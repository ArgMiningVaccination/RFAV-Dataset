HEALTH EFFECTS 2.1 INTRODUCTION The primary purpose of this chapter is to provide pub lic health officials, physicians, toxicologists, and other interested individuals and groups with an ove rall perspective on the toxicology of white phosphorus and white phosphorus smoke. It contains descripti ons and evaluations of toxicological studies and epidemiological investigations and provides conclusions , where possible, on the relevance of toxicity and toxicokinetic data to public health. There are three allotropic forms of elemental phos phorus: white, red, and black phosphorus. At room temperature, pure white phosphorus is a tetrahedral crystal with a molecular formula of P 4. In the pure form, white phosphorus is an ivory-colored, waxy solid. The commercial product is 99.9% pure and may have a slightly yellow color. In the literature, the commercial product is often referred to as yellow phosphorus. In this chapter, the terms white phos phorus and phosphorus are used to refer to P 4, which includes white and yellow phosphorus. White phosphorus is the most active allotropic form and is extremely toxic when inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through burned areas (Eldad and Simon 1991). It is fat soluble, glows in yellow-green light, and ignites spontaneously upon drying and exposure to ai r. Storage of white phosphorus in water prevents it from burning spontaneously (Eldad and Simon 1991). White phosphorus can cause thermal injury and hygroscopic damage by absorbing water from su rrounding tissues. It reacts with oxygen and water to form strong acids (H 3PO 2, H3PO 3) and combines with metals like copper to form dark-colored inactive salts (Eldad and Simon 1991). White phosphorus particles can burn on the surface of the skin or penetrate d eep into the tissues when carried on shrapnel particles. Local destruction of tissues continues as long as white phosphorus is exposed to oxygen. White phosphorus smoke with a garlic odor is characteristic of white phosphorus burns (Eldad and Simon 1991). High mortality rates seen following white phosphorus burns can be due to its absorption from the burned surface, which may result in multi-organ failure (mainly liver and kidneys), hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (ST depression, QT elongation, microvoltage of QRS and bradycardia) (B owen et al. 1971; Eldad and Simon 1991). Copper 8 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS sulphate is a very effective in vitro neutralizer of white phosphorus and has been used to treat white phosphorus burns (Eldad and Simon 1991). However, it is extremely toxic as copper can be absorbed from the burn injury or wound after topical applicati on of copper sulphate to the burnt surface (Bowen et al. 1971; Summerlin et al. 1967). Acute copper intoxica tion jaundice (Summerlin et al. 1967). The hemolytic anemia seen following copper intoxication is a common cause of death. Only tap water irrigations were found to be effective in preventing death after white phosphorus burns (Eldad and Simon 1991). The garlic-like odor is also detected in the vomitus which is phosphorescent and visible when examined in a dark room. If phosphorus is absorbed as the gas phosphine (PH 3), death can occur rapidly due to cardiac collapse (Blanke 1970). In most cases, white phosphorus is ingested accidentally or when trying to commit suicide. Following absorption, white phosphorus stays in the blood for several days and is slowly oxidized to hypophosphoms and phosphorous acids (B lanke 1970). If death occurs within l-3 days, no significant changes are seen. However, in patients who survive for more than a week, the effect of phosphorus damage is evident by the extreme fatty ch anges seen on many organs; alterations in both fat and protein metabolism, a yellowish liver with mark ed fatty degeneration, and severe jaundice are usually present (Blanke 1970). White phosphorus has been used in the manufacture of rat and cockroach poisons, pesticides, matchheads, firecrackers, and ammunitions in the military. Howe ver, other chemicals such as sulfur have replaced phosphorus in matchheads. Phosphorus is also used as a fumigant in the storage of grain in the form of aluminum phosphide pellets. Due to ease of application, pellets of aluminum or magnesium phosphide are commonly used (Garry et al. 1989). Phosphine, a highly toxic gas, is generated from phosphide. The rate of formation of phosphine (permissible exposure limit [PEL], 0.4 mg/m 3) is dependent on the ambient temperature and humidity. In the presence of water (humidity) or acid, the formation of phosphine is greatly enhanced at any given temperature. Phosphine is released rapidly, and it is extremely-fatal to the unprotected worker/person (Garry et al. 1989). An acci dental death of a pregnant woman was related to phosphine exposure from stored grain that had been fumigated with aluminum phosphide (AlP 3) pellets (Garry et al. 1993). Phosphine can also be genera ted when phosphorus is used as a dopant in the microchip processing, where a small amount of phospho rus is added to another substance such as a semiconductor to alter its properties (Garry et al. 1989). 9 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS White phosphorus smoke is gene rated by burning white phosphorus. The U.S. Army uses white phosphorus smoke as a smoke/obscurant for training and testing activities. The smoke generated from burning white phosphorus consists primarily of oxidation and hydrolysis phosphorus pentoxide phosphorus the air reacts with these phosphorus oxides to produce a dynamic mixture of polyphosphoric acids that eventually transform into orthophosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid, and or thophosphorus acid. Wind-tunnel tests in which white phosphorus was burned and oxygen was non-limiting produced an average aerosol mass concentration between 2,500 and 3,000 mg/m3, with the major components being polyphosphates, phosphine, and elemental phosphorus (Van Voris et al. 1987). It s hould be stressed that while residual-coated white phosphorus is very biologically toxic, there are so mewhat stable combustion intermediates (linear and cyclic polyphosphates) that can be persistent under low oxygen conditions and may be toxic to biological organisms. A glossary and list of acronyms, abbreviations, and symbols can be found at the end of this profile. 2.2 DISCUSSION OF HEALTH EFFECTS BY ROUTE OF EXPOSURE To help public health professiona ls and others address the needs of persons living or working near hazardous waste sites, the information in this section is organized first by route of exposure - inhalation, oral, and dermal; and then by health effect - d eath, systemic, immunological, neurological, reproductive, developmental, genotoxic, and carcinogenic effects. Th ese data are discussed in terms of three exposure periods - acute (14 days or less), intermediate (15-364 days), and chronic (365 days or more). Levels of significant exposure for each route and dura tion are presented in tables and illustrated in figures. The points in the figures showing no-observed-adver se-effect levels (NOAELs) or lowest-observedadverse\u00ad effect levels (LOAELs) reflect the actual doses (l evels of exposure) used in the studies. LOAELs have been classified into \"less serious\" or \"serious\" effects. \"Serious\" effects are those that evoke failure in a biological system and can lead to morbidity or mortality (e.g., acute respiratory distress or death). \"Less serious\" effects are those that are not expected to cause significant dysfunction or death, or those whose significance to the organism is not entirely clear. ATSDR acknowledges that a considerable amount of judgment may be required in establishing whether an end point should be classified as a NOAEL, \"less serious\" LOAEL, or \"serious\" LOAEL, a nd that in some cases, there will be insufficient data to decide whether the effect is indicative of significant dysfunction. However, the Agency has WHITE PHOSPHORUS 1 0 2. HEALTH EFFECTS established guidelines and policies that are used to cl assify these end points. ATSDR believes that there is sufficient merit in this approach to warrant an attempt at distinguishing between \"less serious\" and \"serious\" effects. The distinction between \"less serious\" effects and \"serious\" effects is considered to be important because it helps the users of the profiles to identify levels of exposure at which major health effects start to appear. LOAELs or NOAELs should al so help in determining whether or not the effects vary with dose and/or duration, and place into pe rspective the possible significance of these effects to human health. The significance of the exposure levels shown in th e Levels of Significant Exposure (LSE) tables and figures may differ depending on the user's perspective. Public health officials and others concerned with appropriate actions to take at hazardous waste sites may want information on levels of exposure associated with more subtle effects in humans or animals or exposure levels below wh ich no adverse effects have been observed. Estimates of levels posing minimal ri sk to humans (Minimal Risk Levels or MRLs) may be of interest to health professionals and citizens alike. Estimates of exposure levels posing minimal risk to humans (Minimal Risk Levels or MRLs) have been made for white phosphorus. An MRL is defined as an estimate of daily human exposure to a substance that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of adverse effects (noncarcinogenic) over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs are de rived when reliable and sufficient data exist to identify the target organ(s) of effect or the most sensitive health e ffect(s) for a specific duration within a given route of exposure. MRLs are based on noncancerous health eff ects only and do not consider carcinogenic effects. MRLs can be derived for acute, in termediate, and chronic duration exposures for inhalation and oral routes. Appropriate methodology does not exis t to develop MRLs for dermal exposure. Although methods have been establis hed to derive these levels (Bar nes and Dourson 1988; EPA 1990), uncertainties are associated with these techniqu es. Furthermore, ATSDR acknowledges additional uncertainties inherent in the application of the procedures to derive less than lifetime MRLs. As an example, acute inhalation MRLs may not be protective for health effects that are delayed in development or are acquired following repeated acute insults, such as hypersensitivity reactions, asthma, or chronic bronchitis. As these kinds of health effects data become available and methods to assess levels of significant human exposure improve, these MRLs will be revised. 11 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS A User's Guide has been provided at the end of this profile (see Appendix A). This guide should aid in the interpretation of the tables and figures for Leve ls of Significant Exposure and the MRLs. 2.2.1 Inhalation Exposure White Phosphorus. Studies of human exposure to white phosphorus are limited to those examining occupational exposure to white phosphorus for intermediate or chronic durations. Most of the information on the effects of occupational exposure of humans to white phosphorus was from case reports, rather than epidemiology studies. Phosphorus oxidizes rapidly wh en exposed to air, and fumes/vapors in phosphorus factories probably contained phosphorus, phosph oric phosphorus oxide (Heimann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Ward 1928). Exposure levels fo r white phosphorus and phosphorus compounds were not reported in the occupational studies. However, workers at phosphorus plants were probably also exposed to white phosphorus by the dermal and oral routes. One study was located regarding toxicity in anim als after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus (Ruzuddinov and Rys-Uly 1986). Rats were exposed for an intermediate duration to the atmosphere in a phosphorus plant, reported to cont ain white phosphorus and its inor ganic compounds, and changes in the oral mucosa were examined. However, exposure levels for white phosphorus and phosphorus compounds were not reported in the study. White Phosphorus Smoke. Several studies have examined the t oxicity of white phosphorus smoke in humans and animals (White and Armstrong et al. 1935; Brown et al. 1980, 1981; Starke et al. 1982; Walker et al. 1947). The Walker et al. (1947) study is a report of the health effects observed in workers exposed to white phosphorus smoke during a fact ory fire. The other studies involve experimental exposures. In these studies, the smoke was generate d by burning either the felt that contained white phosphorus or white phosphorus alone. White phosphorus-felt (WP/F) smoke was generated by forcing military-grade white phosphor us under pressure into thick pieces of wool felt. This material was then cut into cubes of specific weights. A cube of the wh ite phosphorus felt on an aluminum-foil pan was placed on an unlit electric hot plate within a chamber. The hot plate was a fast-heating unit capable of reaching temperatures in excess of 700\u00b0F (Brown et al. 1980) . The smoke was pumped into the exposure chamber or the white phosphorus/felt was burned in the exposure chamber. In some experiments, the subjects were placed in the exposure chamber prior to burning the white phosphorus, and in other experiments the test atmosphere was generated prior to placing the subjects in the exposure chamber. In some of these studies, 12 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS subjects were not removed until the smoke had dissi pated. Thus, the subjects had the potential to be exposed to a wide range of concentrations of white phosphorus smoke. The temperature in the exposure chambers was higher than room temperature. Anot her limitation of these inhalation studies is the reporting of air concentrations. Typically air samples we re collected on filters, diluted with distilled water, and boiled to convert the phosphorus acids to orthophosphoric acids. The acid content was then determined by titration, and the normality of th e acid was then converted to orthophosphoric acid or phosphorus pentoxide equivalents (Brown et al. 1980). In the Brown et al. (1980, 1981) and Starke et al. (1982) studies, the air concentrations of white phosphorus smoke were expressed in terms of orthophosphoric acid equivalents. In reviewing the methods used to estimate the concentration of or thophosphoric acid, ATSDR detected a calculation mistake. According to the authors' equation for dete rmining the orthophosphoric acid concentration of the sample, the molecular weight was divided by 3 milliequi valents. At pH 9.6, the molecular weight should be divided by 2 milliequivalents. A correction was ma de to exposure levels for the three studies. White and Armstrong (1935) reported the white phosphorus smoke concentration in terms of phosphorus pentoxide equivalents. In Section 2.2, the air concentrations for the White and Armstrong (1935) studies are also expressed in terms of orthophosphoric acid equivalents. Differences in the exposure protocol between the studies conducted by Brown et al. (198 0, 198l), Starke et al. (1982), and White and Armstrong (1935) make it difficult to make comparisons across studies. In White and Armstrong (1935), the continuous-flow method was used, allowing the d esired concentrations to be set up and maintained under conditions which avoided exposure of the experime ntal animals to either excessive temperature rise, oxygen deprivation, or other vitiation of the atmospheres breathed. Exposure duration was for 1 hour. In Brown et al. (1980,1981), exposure times and concen tration levels varied. Exposure durations ranged from 5-90 minutes to 13 weeks, and target con centrations varied (200,500, or 1,000 mg/m 3). In Starke et al. (1982), rats were exposed to white phosphorus sm oke or control air 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 10 consecutive weeks at concentrations of 0,500, and 1,000 mg/m3. 2.2.1.1 Death White Phosphorus. Two white phosphorus-related deaths were re ported in a study of workers from three plants involved in the production of fireworks (Ward 1928). Both workers were females exposed to white phosphorus during the molding and wrapping of a paste containing 44% phosphorus. This step in the production of fireworks involved continuous inhala tion exposure to airborne white phosphorus, dermal 13 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS exposure to the paste, and likely ingestion of ai rborne white phosphorus an d white phosphorus passed from hand to mouth. Apparently, the phosphorus fumes/vapors contained white phosphorus and other phosphorus compounds, including phosphoric oxide a nd phosphorus oxide. However, exposure levels were not reported. Both women de veloped phossy jaw, a degenerative condition affecting the soft tissue, bones, and teeth of the oral cavity, after chronic exposure to the atmosphere at the factory. The cause of death in both cases was listed as septicemia, with absc ess of a tooth and necrosis of the jaw listed as contributory causes. Thus, death in both cases resulted from infections, probably secondary to the degenerative effects of white phosphorus on the oral cavity (Ward 1928). It is likely that the development of phossy jaw resulted from the local action of wh ite phosphorus on the oral cavity (as discussed in Section 2.2.2.2). It is not known whether white phosphorus inhaled and absorbed into the systemic circulation contributed to the developm ent of phossy jaw in these two workers. No studies were located regarding death in animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. White Phosphorus Smoke. No deaths were observed in humans exposed to concentrations as high as 592 mg phosphorus pent oxide equivalents/m3 (817 mg orthophosphoric acid phosphorus pentoxide/m3 (709 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) for 15 minutes (White and Armstrong 1935). Rats, mice, guinea pigs, and goats have died following acute-dur ation exposures to white phosphorus smoke (Brown et al. 1980; White and Armstrong 19 35). Following a single or multiple 5-60-minute exposures, the lowest lethal concentrations identified in the species examined were 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for pregnant rats (Brown et al. 1981; Starke et al. 1982), 1,794 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for nonpregnant rats (Brown et al. 1980), 310 mg phosphorus pentoxide equivalents/m3 (428 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) for mice (White and Armstrong 1935), 264 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for guinea pigs (Brown et al. 1980), and 6,230 mg phosphorus pentoxide equivalents/m3 (8,5 99 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) for goats (White and Armstrong 1935). For most studies, the cause of death was not determined. In mice, exposure to white phosphorus smoke resulted in death within a fe w minutes after removal from low concentrations of the smoke (White and Armstrong 1935). The increased mortality may have been the result of the severe respiratory tract damage that was observed, most likely due to cerebral asphyxiation (the nares of the animals were plugged with a heavy mucous discharge). Respiration was obstructed through irritation and swelling of the mucous membranes lining the very small and constricted upper respiratory passages 14 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS (White and Armstrong 1935). This rapid death from acu te exposure to the smoke was not observed in rats or goats because of their larger upper respiratory tracts. However, much higher smoke concentrations were necessary to produce asphyxial death in rats. In goats, with even larger respiratory tracts, relatively enormous concentrations were required to cause as phyxial symptoms. As in the mice, the same white mucous secretion was seen around their noses and mouths (White and Armstrong 1935). Increased mortality was also observed in rats expo sed to 1,742 mg orthophos phoric acid equivalents/m3 of white phosphorus smoke 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 6-13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981) or 9-10 weeks (Brown et al. 1981; Starke et al. 1982). As with the deaths occurring after acute exposure, the most severe lesions were observed in the respiratory tract. Lesions were most extensive and severe in the larynx and trachea. They consisted mainly of the thickening of the lamina propria (the connective tissue of the mucous membrane) and submucosa by collagen, endothelial cell proliferation, and macrophage infiltration. Occasionally, inflammatory cells were seen in the epithelium (Brown et al. 1981). No chronic duration studies were located. The LD 50 values from each reliable study in each species a nd duration category are recorded in Table 2-1 and plotted in Figure 2-l. 2.2.1.2 Systemic Effects White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding gastrointestinal, dermal, or ocular effects in humans or animals after inhalati on exposure to white phosphorus. White Phosphorus Smoke. Systemic effects of white phosphorus smoke in humans and animals after inhalation exposure are discussed below. The highest NOAEL value and all reliable LOAEL values for systemic effects in each species and duration category ar e recorded in Table 2- 1 and plotted in Figure 2-1. No studies were located regarding musculoskeletal or other systemic effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. 23 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Respiratory Effects White Phosphorus. In a study of 71 humans occupationally exposed to fumes/vapors and paste containing white phosphorus for intermediate or ch ronic duration, an irritating cough was reported as occurring in a large proportion of the employees (Ward 1928); no further information regarding respiratory effects was reported. Details of this stud y are provided in Section 2.2.2.2; exposure levels of white phosphorus and other compounds were not reported. No studies were located regarding respiratory eff ects in animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. White Phosphorus Smoke. In two acute-duration exposure studies, r espiratory effects have been reported by men inhaling white phosphorus smoke for 2-15 minutes (White and Armstrong 1935). At the lowest concentration tested (187 mg phos phorus pentoxide equivalents/m3 [258 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3] for 5 minutes), throat irritation during talk ing was reported. At higher concentrations 514 mg phosphorus pentoxi de equivalents/m3 [709 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 ]for 15 minutes), coughing and nose irritation were reported (White and Armstrong 1935). Coughing, hoarseness, and erythema and edema of the larynx a nd vocal cords were reported in women exposed to an unspecified amount of white phosphorus smoke for 15-20 minutes during a factory fire (Walker et al. 1947). No longer-term human exposure studies were located. In animals, the respiratory tract is one of the primar y targets of white phosphorus smoke toxicity. Slight to intense congestion, edema, and hemorrhages were observe d in the lungs of rats, mice, and goats (Brown et al. 1980; White and Armstrong 1935). Exposure to 3,027 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 90 minutes resulted in respiratory tract lesions in rats (Brown et al. 1980). \"Unmistakable signs of irritation\" were observed in mice, rats, and goats exposed for 1 hour to 110,380, or 540 mg phosphorus pentoxide equivalents/m3 (152,524, or 754 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3), respectively (White and Armstrong 1935). Lung lesions were observed in all of the animals that died early and were necropsied (White and Armstrong 1935). No respirat ory tract effects were observed in guinea pigs exposed to concentrations of white phosphor us smoke as high as 984 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 30 minutes (Brown et al. 1980). However, only one animal was examined at this exposure level, and it was examined 2 weeks after exposure. Exposure to wh ite phosphorus smoke for 24 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 6 or 13 weeks at a concentration of 884 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week resulted in slight laryngitis and tracheitis in rats (Brown et al. 1981). Exposure to a higher concentration (1,742 mg orthop hosphoric acid equivalents/m3) resulted and tracheitis, and minimal-to- severe interstitial pneumonia (Brown et al. 1981). Cardiovascular Effects White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding cardiovascu lar effects in humans after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. In rats exposed for an intermediate duration to an unknown concentration of airborne white phosphorus from the furnace room of a phosphorus factory, an increase in permeability of capillary walls, lesions in the walls of blood vessels, and evidence of impaired microcirculation were observed in the mouth (Ruzuddinov and Rys-Uly 1986). Severe damage to th e oral mucosa was also observed in these animals. No information regarding effects on the heart was located in the animal studies. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding car diovascular effects in humans after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. No gross or histological alterations were observed in the hearts of rats exposed to white phosphorus smoke at concentrations as high as 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m 3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). Gastrointestinal Effects White Phosphonrs Smoke. No studies were located regarding gastro intestinal effects in humans after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. Exposure of rats to concentrations of white phos phorus smoke as high as 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks did not result in gross or histological alterations in the gastrointestinal tract (Brown et al. 1981). 25 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Hematological Effects White Phosphorus. Anemia (marked decrease in red blood cells or hemoglobin) and leukopenia (very low levels of white blood cells or leukocytes) were observed in workers chronically exposed to airborne white phosphorus (Ward 1928). Because the workers handled white phosphorus contaminated rags, it is possible that exposure occurred via oral and dermal routes also. No information on exposure levels was provided. In another occupational exposure study, no alterations in hemoglobin or total or differential leukocyte levels were observed (Hughes et al. 1962). No studies were located regarding hematological e ffects in animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding hematological effects in humans after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. Two weeks after exposure termination, no significant changes in erythrocyte, hematocrit, hemoglobin, or total and differential leukocyte leve ls were observed in rats exposed to 3,027 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m 3 for 90 minutes or guinea pigs exposed to 984 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 10 minutes (Brown et al. 1980). No changes in erythroc yte, hematocrit, hemoglobin, or leukocyte (total or differential) levels were observe d in rats exposed to 1,742 mg or thophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 of white phosphorus smoke for 15 minutes/day, 5 days/weeks, for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). Musculoskeletal Effects White Phosphorus. Phossy jaw is a degenerative condition aff ecting the entire oral cavity including soft tissue, teeth, and bones (Heimann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Ward 1928). This condition generally occurs following long term exposure to airborne white phos phorus. The effects of phossy jaw can be extreme, involving severe necrosis of soft tissue, teeth, and bones in the oral cavity. Massive life-threatening infections often occur during the development of phossy jaw. With one exception (Jakhi et al. 1983) (see Section 2.2.2.2), all reported cases of phossy jaw have resulted from occupational exposure to white phosphorus fumes/vapors and/or dust. Because white phosphorus oxidizes rapidly, phosphorus fumes/vapors may contain phosphoric oxide orus oxide, addition to phosphorus (Heimann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Ward 1928). 26 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS In a study of workers exposed to white phosphorus for intermediate durations in three fireworks plants, 2 of 44 workers developed definite cases of pho ssy jaw (Ward 1928). These cases, described as slight necrosis of the lower jaw, took up to 2 years for recovery. In the same study, 13 of 27 workers exposed to white phosphorus for chronic durations developed necr osis of the upper and/or lower jaw, ranging from slight to severe; 2 of the 13 workers developing phossy jaw died from complications related to the necrosis. This study and several case reports discuss the progression of symptoms during the development of phossy jaw (Heimann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Kennon and Hallam 1944). It is likely that the development of necrosis of the jaw in workers e xposed to airborne white phosphorus resulted from the local action of phosphorus on the oral cavity. This in formation is discussed in detail in Section 2.2.2.2. There is evidence that occupational exposure to white phosphorus affects bones other than those in the jaw; this implies a systemic effect for inhale d white phosphorus. Two middle-aged men occupationally exposed to white phosphorus for 20-30 years had a history of breaking their femurs in accidents not normally expected to result in breakage of bones (Dearden 1899). One man had broken the right and left femurs on two separate occasions by \"tripping over a board,\" while the other broke the right femur by \"stumbling down a single step,\" and the left femur in \"just as simple a manner.\" Examination of bone from the fingertip of one of the two workers indicated an increased \"relative proportion of phosphoric acid to lime\" compared to healthy bone by nearly 1%. Thus, occupational exposure to white phosphorus may change the composition of bone tissue, decreasing th e bones ability to resist fracture; however, the information reported in this study is insufficien t to definitively attribute the observed effects to occupational exposure to white phosphorus. No studies were located regarding musculoskeletal effects in animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. Hepatic Effects White Phosphorus. Information on hepatotoxicity after exposure to airborne white phosphorus is limited to an occupational exposure study. No alterations in liver function tests were observed in workers chronically exposed to an unreported amount of airborne white phosphorus (Hughes et al. 1962). No studies were located regarding hepatic effects in animals after inhalation expos ure to white phosphorus. 27 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding hepatic effects in humans after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. Slight cloudy swelling was observed in the livers of rats exposed for 1 hour to 2 1,170 mg phosphorus pentoxide equivalents/m3 ( 1,615 1935) or 3,027 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 90 minutes (Brown et al. 1980), mice exposed to 470 mg phosphorus pent oxide equivalents/m3 (649 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) for 1 hour (White and Armstrong 1935), and goats exposed for 1 hour to 7,320 mg phosphorus pentoxide equivalents/m3) (10,104 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) (White and Armstrong 1935). In the White and Armstrong (1935) studies, only animals dy ing early were necropsied. Consequently, results were only reported for some of the animals. No hepa tic effects were observed in guinea pigs exposed to 984 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 10 minutes; only one guinea pig exposed at this concentration was examined 2 weeks after e xposure (Brown et al. 1980). A NOAEL of 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 has been identified for hepatic effects in rats exposed for 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks to white phosphorus smoke. At this concentration, no alterations in the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or gross or histological lesions were observed (Brown et al. 1981). Renal Effects White Phosphorus. In an epidemiology study, 48 apparently healthy men working in a phosphorus plant between 1 and 17 years had average creatinine levels in urine (141 mg/L) essentially identical to those of 28 workers (controls) not exposed to white phosphorus (Hughes et al. 1962). However, the groups were apparently not well matched with respect to age and race (details not reported), as only 28 men (controls) volunteered to allow the blood to be drawn (Hughes et al. 1962). No studies were located regarding renal effects in an imals after inhalation expos ure to white phosphorus. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding renal effects in humans after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. In rats, mice, and goats exposed to white phos phorus smoke for 1 hour, s light cloudy swelling was observed in the kidneys at 1,170,470, and 7,320 mg phosphor us pentoxide equivalents/m 3, 1,615, 649, or 10,104 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) (White and Armstrong 1935). In the White and Armstrong (1935) study, a white, mucous secretion was seen around the noses and mouths of animals that died early. Upon necropsy, conges tion, hemorrhage, edema, and pneumonia were the principal lesions seen in the lungs, which are all ev idence of respiratory obstruction (White and Armstrong 1935). No renal lesions were observe d in rats exposed to 3,027 mg or thophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 90 minutes or guinea pigs exposed to 984 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 10 minutes (Brown et al. 1980). In the Brown et al. (1980) stud y, a small number of animals were examined 2 weeks after exposure termination. Exposure to concentrati ons of white phosphorus smoke as high as 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks did not result in significant changes in levels of serum urea nitrogen, crea tinine, or uric acid or in alterations in the gross or histological examination of the kidneys (Brown et al. 1981). Dermal Effects White Phosphoncs Smoke. No studies were located regarding dermal effects in humans after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. No alterations were observed in the skin of rats e xposed to concentrations of white phosphorus smoke as high as 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). Ocular Effects White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding ocular effects in humans after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. No alterations were observed in the eyes of rats e xposed to concentrations of white phosphorus smoke as high as 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). 29 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Other Systemic Effects White Phosphorus. Decreased serum glucose levels were re ported for some workers occupationally exposed to white phosphorus for a chronic duration (Ward 1928). Details of this study are provided in Section 2.2.2.2. Rats received intermittent exposure to the atmosphe re in the furnace room of a phosphorus factory for l-4 months (Ruzuddinov and Rys-Uly 1986). Histolog y of rats killed monthly revealed progressive morphological degeneration of the tongue and oral muco sa of the cheek, gum, and hard palate. It is likely that the effects of white phosphorus in the oral cavit y are local rather than systemic resulting from direct contact of white phosphorus-containing atmosphere with tissues in the mouth. For this reason this study is also discussed in Section 2.2.2.2. 2.2.1.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects White Phosphorus. Limited information on the immunotoxicity of inhaled white phosphorus was located. As discussed in Section 2.2.1.2, decreased leukocyt e levels were observed in workers exposed to an unknown concentration of white phos phorus via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes (Ward 1928). It is not known if the decrease in leukocyte levels w ould result in impaired immune function. No studies were located regarding immunological or ly mphoreticular effects in animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding immunological or lymphoreticular effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. 2.2.1.4 Neurological Effects. White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding neurological effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding neurological effects in humans after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. 30 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS No histological alterations were observed in the brains of rats exposed to concentrations of white phosphorus smoke as high as 1,742 mg or thophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). This NOAEL fo r neurological effects in rats exposed for an intermediate duration is recorded in Table 2- 1 and plotted in Figure 2-l. 2.2.1.5 Reproductive Effects White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding reproductive effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding reproductive effects in humans after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. No effects on pregnancy rate or number of pups born alive were observed following the mating of male rats exposed to 1,742 mg ort hophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 of white phosphorus smoke 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 10 weeks with fema le rats exposed for 3 weeks (similar exposure protocol) (Brown et al. 1981; Starke et al. 1982) or the mating of male rats exposed to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks to unexposed female rats (Brown et al. 1981; Starke et al. 1982). No exposure -related lesions were seen in the testis, epididymis, ovary, and uterus of rats exposed to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). These LOAEL values from each reliable study for reproduc tive effects in rats in each duration category are recorded in Table 2-l and plotted in Figure 2-l. 2.2.1.6 Developmental Effects White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding developmental effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding developmental effects in humans after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. 31 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Increases in the incidence of right or reversed ductus arteriosus (9/18 or 50%) and ectopic testicles (3/18 or 33%) were observed in the offspring of unexposed male rats and female rats exposed to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3, 15 minutes/day on gestational days 6-15. Statistical analysis of these data was not presented. No other developmental e ffects were observed in this study (Brown et al. 1981; Starke et al. 1982). In another study conduc ted by these authors, no significant increases in the incidence of malformations or anomalies were obser ved in the offspring of rats exposed to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3, 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week during the 3-week premating period, mating period, and gestation period. Thus, the author s did not consider these effects to be significant. However continued exposure of the pups a nd dams to white phosphorus smoke (1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) during the 3-week lactation period resulted in decreased pup growth, pup survival, and pup viability. The authors suggested that the decreased pup growth and survival may have been due to the dams not allowing the pups to nurse, not enough milk being produced, pups not nursing due to respiratory tract irritation, or a dir ect compound-related effect on the pups (Brown et al. 1981; Starke et al. 1982). These NOAEL and LOAEL values from each reliable study for developmental effects in rats are recorded in Table 2-l and plotted in Figure 2-l. 2.2.1.7 Genotoxic Effects White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding genot oxic effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding genotoxic effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. Genotoxicity studies are discussed in Section 2.5. 32 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.2.1.8 Cancer White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding cancer in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. White Phosphonts Smoke. No studies were located regarding cancer in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. 2.2.2 Oral Exposure Studies reporting acute oral exposure of humans to white phosphorus were limited to case reports of intentional or accidental ingestion of match heads, rat poison, cockroach poison, firecrackers, or from military operations. Manufacturers of white phosphorus-containing rat poi son have claimed that the only active ingredient in the rat poison was white phos phorus (Peacock 1993). It is likely that white phosphorus was the agent producing toxicity followi ng ingestion of cockroach poison, match heads, and fireworks, although the presence of other toxic com pounds cannot be ruled out. Many of the case reports involving acute oral exposure of humans to white phosphorus did not report intake levels. High doses of white phosphorus nearly always induced vomiting, expe lling much of the ingested white phosphorus from the body. In addition, gastric lavage to remove white phosphorus from the stomach was performed on many poisoned patients. Thus, doses could not be estim ated for end points other than vomiting for all but one of the case reports for humans receiving acute oral exposure to white phosphorus. Several studies reporting intermediate oral exposure of children to white phosphorus were located. In most cases the white phosphorus was administered as a treatment for rickets, but in some cases white phosphorus was administered to healthy children to prevent the development of rickets. In studies reporting the effects of white phosphorus on bones in children, the doses of white phosphorus.. administered (0.026-0.158 mg/kg/day) were several orders of magnitude lower than those reported following intentional or accident al white phosphorus poisoning. Humans exposed to white phosphorus in the workplace probably ingested some airborne white phosphorus. One retrospective study indicated that oral exposure to white phosphorus passed from hand 33 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS to mouth was likely, because the workers constantly handled a paste containing 4-6% white phosphorus, and washroom facilities at the plants were inadequate. No studies were located regarding health effects in human or animals after oral exposure to white phosphorus smoke. 2.2.2.1 Death Numerous case reports of death following acute or al exposure of humans to white phosphorus were located (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950,196l; Dwyer Winek et al. 1973). In one case report, circumstances following ingestion of white phosphorus allowed for estimation of dose (Hann and Veale 1910). A woman consumed 3.9 g of rat poison containing 4% white phosphorus, but did not vomit until the second day after the poisoning, and the vomitus at that time was clear. Thus, little or none of the white phosphorus ingested was lo st due to vomiting. The estimated single dose was 2 mg/kg/day. Four days after ingesting the rat poison, the woman died. The cause of death was not reported, but autopsy revealed fatty degeneration and cell transformation in the liver (Hann and Veale 1910). In case reports of 56 individuals inte ntionally ingesting large quantities of white phosphor us (0.19-6.3 g) in rat poison, 48.2% of the individuals died, with a 90% death rate in patients ingesting 1.57 g of phosphorus (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950). Because white phosphorus at these oral exposure levels induced rapid vomiting, the doses for these case reports could not be estimated. In patients that died, symptoms prior to death included irreversible vascular collapse; cyanosis, ashen skin color, and deep pallor secondary to vascular collapse); coma; abnormal elect rocardiogram readings; evidence of extreme liver and kidney damage, and hypoglycemia (possible seconda ry to liver damage); and delirium, psychosis, and hallucinations (possibly secondary to brain damage). The cause of death was not reported for each patient, but appeared in most cases to be related to irreve rsible failure of the liver, kidney, brain, and/or cardiovascular system (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950). In other case reports, autopsy of patients dying from white phosphorus poisoning nearly always revealed severe damage to one or more of those four systems 34 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1961; Dwyer and 1951; Wertham 1932). In some cases, pulmonary edema and/or congestion were observed at autopsy (Rao and Brown 1974; Wechsler and Wechsler 1951). In studies reporting the specific cause of death, death was attributed to cardiopulmonary arrest (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950; Rao and Brown 197 4; Simon and Pickering 1976; Winek et al. 1973), peripheral vascular collapse (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950,1961), liver failure (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1961; McCarron et al. 1981), hypoglycemia (Diaz-Rivera al. 1961), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage and hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia (Winek et al. 1973). No deaths were reported in children treated with 0.0264.158 mg/kg/day white phosphorus for as much as 26 months (Compere 1930a; Phemister 1918). An infant became seriously ill with 0.083 mg/kg/day white phosphorus (timed-weighted av erage dose for 6 months), but recovered entirely following discontinuation of the dose (Sontag 1938). Humans occupationally exposed to phosphorus probably ingested some airborne white phosphorus. In a study of 71 humans occupationally exposed to fum es/vapors and paste containing white phosphorus, oral exposure to phosphorus passed from hand to mouth was likely, because the workers constantly handled a paste containing 4-6% white phosphor us, and washroom facilities at the plants were inadequate (Ward 1928). White phosphorus-related deaths occurred in 0 of 44 and 2 of 27 of the workers exposed for intermediate and chronic durations, respectively. In the two cases of death, the workers died from complications related to phossy jaw, a degenerative c ondition affecting the soft tissue, bones, and teeth of the oral cavity. In this condition, the toxic effects of white phosphorus probably result from the local irritant action of white phosphorus on tissues in the mouth. Thus, white phosphorus paste passed from hand to mouth and the local action of airborne white phosphorus on the oral cavity may have contributed to the development of phossy jaw, and subsequent death, of these two workers. It is not known whether white phosphorus ingested and absorbed into the systemic circulation contributed to the development of phossy jaw in the two workers that died (War d 1928). Details of this study are provided in Section 2.2.2.2. A mortality rate of 30% was observed in Wistar ra ts treated by gavage w ith 6 mg/kg white phosphorus (Torrielli et al. 1974). The oral LD 50 value for Charles-River rats was 3.03 mg/kg for females and 3.76 mg/kg for males (Lee et al. 1975). A mortality rate of 20-35 % was observed in mice treated by gavage with 5-6 mg/kg (Hurwitz 1972). LD 50 values of 4.82 mg/kg and 4.85 mg/kg were reported for 35 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS female and male mice, respectively (Lee et al. 1975) . In two separate one-generation reproduction studies in rats (IRDC 1985; Bio/dynamics 1991), 30-47% and 53%, respectively, of treated by gavage with 0.075 mg/kg/day for 145-204 days (intermediate duration) died (or were killed due to morbidity) in late gestation or during parturition; da ms exposed to 0.015 mg/kg/day for similar durations did not have an increased mortality rate (IRDC 1985). Compound-related deat hs were not observed in male rats exposed to 0.075 mg/kg/day for similar durations (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985). Mortality was observed in 9 of 21 dogs treated once by gavage with an unknown quantity of white phosphorus from firecrackers (Dwyer and Helwig 1925). A cat died 2 hours after ingesting an unknown amount of white phosphorus (Frye and Cucuel 1969). The LD 50 values and doses associated with death in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-2 and plotted in Figure 2-2. 2.2.2.2 Systemic Effects Systemic effects of white phosphorus in humans and animals after oral exposure are discussed below. The highest NOAEL value and all reliable LOAEL values fro m each reliable study for systemic effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-2 and plotted in Figure 2-2. No studies were located regarding ocular effects in humans or animals after oral exposure to white phosphorus. Respiratory Effects. Studies on respiratory effects following acute oral exposure of humans to white phosphorus were limited to case reports of intentional or accidental consumption of materials containing white phosphorus. Although intake of phosphorus w as often reported, dose could be estimated for only one study (Hann and Veale 1910), because vomiting and/ or gastric lavage nearly always occurred soon after poisoning, expelling much of the ingested phosphorus from the body. Tachypnea (increased respiratory rate; 48 breaths/minute) was observed in a woman consuming rat poison containing 4% white phosphorus (Hann and Veale 1910); the woman apparently did not vomit until the second day, and the vomitus was clear. The estimated dose was 2 mg/kg. Four days after ingesting the rat 50 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS poison, the woman died, apparently from liver failure . Autopsy showed that the pleural cavity was filled with a dark fluid, but no histological abnormalitie s were observed in the lungs (Hann and Veale 1910). In the following studies, no doses could be estimated for respiratory effects because of vomiting and/or gastric lavage. In a case report involving ingestion of rat poison containing white phosphorus, the patient arrived at a hospital in a coma and displayed Ch eyne-Stokes respirations respirations increas ed to an extreme degree, and the patient died. Autopsy revealed pulmonary congestion and edema throughout the stroma. Increased respiratory rate (56 breaths/minute) and rales also were observed in an infant ingesting rat poison containing white phosphorus (Rao and Brown 1974). The child died, and autopsy revealed evidence of pulmonary edema. Rales were observed in a child ingesting a fatal dose of white phosphorus in fireworks; autopsy indicated that the lungs were normal except for some fibrous adhesions (Dwyer and Helwig 1925). Hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia was observed following autopsy of a man ingesting a fatal dose of rat poison containing white phosphorus (Winek et al. 1973). Aut opsy of a child who died following ingestion of a firecracker revealed fatty deposition in parenchyma, bronchial epithelium, and tracheal epithelium and cartilage (Humphreys and Halpert 1931). Death from cardiopulmonary failure was reported for a 63-year-old woman (Winek et al. 1973), a 2-year-old boy (Simon and Pickering 1976), and a 3-year-old girl (Simon and Pickering 1976) following ingestion of wh ite phosphorus in rat poison; a respiratory rate of 44 breaths/minute was initially observed in the girl (Simon and Pickering 1976). Increased respiratory rate was observed prior to death in two case reports invol ving ingestion of rat poison (Talley et al. 1972; Winek et al. 1973). Shallow respirations and cyanosis were observed prior to death in an adult female following ingestion of rat/roach poison containing wh ite phosphorus (Rubitsky and Myerson 1949). Rales were observed 1 day after intentional ingestion of rat poison by a 30-year-old man; 2 days later the patient went into shock but survived the poisoning and eventually recovered (Pietras et al. 1968). No treatment-related respiratory effects were repor ted in children treated with white phosphorus for intermediate durations. No treatment-related microscopic cha nges were observed in the lungs of rats exposed to 0.2 mg/kg/day white phosphorus in the diet for a chronic duration (Fleming et al. 1942) or 0.075 mg/kg/day phosphorus by gavage for an intermediate duration (LRDC 1985) . Heavy breathing and apnea were reported following ingestion of a fatal quantity of white phosphorus by a cat (Frye and Cucuell969). Necropsy revealed hyperemia, hemorrhage and edema in the lungs. 51 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Cardiovascular Effects. Alterations in electrocardiograms, such as altered or inverted T waves and changes in the QRS complex, and other cardiac cha nges, such as tachycardia, arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, and decreased ventricular contractility, ha ve been observed in individuals accidentally or intentionally ingesting a single dose of white phosph orus (Dathe and Brown 1974; Simon and Pickering 1976; Talley et al. 1972). Damage to the myocardium was verified by a number of cases in which histological examination of the heart was performed. Prominent cross stria tions in the myocardium (Dwyer and Helwig 1925), fatty al. 1961; and 1931; Wertham of and Wechsler 1951), markedly dilated cardiac chamber (Rao and Brown 1974), and interstitial edema of the myocardium and vacuolation of cells (T alley et al. 1972) have been observed. Because of vomiting and gastric la vage, doses cannot be calculated from the human studies. No cardiac effects were reported in longer term human studies. In addition to the effects on the heart, a number of vascular effects have been observed in humans acutely exposed to white phosphorus. A markedly decreased or undetectable blood pressure (Caley and 1951), vascular collapse (Diaz-Rivera et al. undetectable decreased pulse (Dwyer and Helwig 1925; Rubitsky and Myerson 1949), and Hann Veale 1910; McCarron et al. 1981; Wechsler and Wechsler 1951) have been observed. In addition, individuals have died following cardiopulmonary arrest (Simon and Pickering 1976; Winek et al. 1973), which may be due to effects on the heart or vascular system. A dose of 2 mg/kg/day for vascular effects was identified from the Hann and Veale (1910) report of a woman ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus. Dose leve ls cannot be estimated for the other case reports. Hemorrhaging in internal organs, as well as the app earance of petechial hemorrhages on the skin, have been reported in a number of acute human exposur e cases (Hann and Veale 1910; Humphreys and Halpert 1931; Winek et al. 1973). It is not known whether these effects are due to impairment of the integrity of the blood vessels or due to damage of the affected organ (e.g., liver, stomach) itself. In rats administered 0.075 mg/kg/day white phosphor us for an intermediate duration, no histological alterations were observed in the heart (Bio/d ynamics 1991; IRDC 1985). In rats exposed for an intermediate duration to an unknown concentration of airborne wh ite phosphorus from the furnace room 52 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS of a phosphorus factory, an increase in permeability of capillary walls, lesions in the walls of blood vessels and evidence of impaired microcirculation were observed in the mouth (Ruzuddinov and Rys-Uly 1986). These effects probably resulted from the local ac tion of white phosphorus on the oral cavity. Gastrointestinal Effects. Most of the human case reports listed vomiting as an early effect following ingestion of a single high dose of white phosphorus (Caley and Kellock Wechsler 1951; Winek et al. 1973). The doses that induced vomiting ranged from 2 to 23 mg/kg (Caley and Kellock al. 1948; Rubitsky and Myerson 1949). Vomiting generally started within hours after ingesting the white phosphorus, and sometimes continued for many days. Other gastrointestinal effects included abdominal cramps or pain (often severe) (Dwyer and Helwig 1925; Ehrentheil1957; Fletcher al. 1981; Newburger et al. 1948; Pietras et al. 1968), vomiting blood and/or pieces of the gastric mucosa (Dathe and Nathan 1946; Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950; Rubitsky and Myerson 1949), necrosis and erosion of mucosa esophagus, stomach, duodenum, Wertham 1932, Winek et al. 1973). These effects, with the exception of necrosis, were probably due to the irritating effects of white phosphorus on the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. Vomitus often contained white phosphorus, indicating that vomiting generally occurred before all white phosphorus and/or its oxidation products had been absorbed. No gastrointestinal effects were reported in ch ildren receiving treatment with 0.026-0.158 mg/kg/day white phosphorus much as 26 months (Phemister 1918; Compere 1930a). An infant became seriously with 0.083 mg/kg/day white phosphorus (6-month time-weighted average dose), but recovered entirely following discontinua tion of the treatment (Sontag 1938). No vomiting or diarrhea was observed during the treatment period. Gastrointestinal effects were not reported in studi es examining longer term occupational exposure to white phosphorus (Heimann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Kennon and Hallam 1944; Ward 1928). 53 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Erosion and hemorrhages in tissue in the esophagus a nd stomach were observed following ingestion of a fatal unknown quantity of white phos phorus by a cat (Frye and Cucuel 1969). Vomiting was observed in 6 of 21 dogs treated by gavage with an unknown quantity of white phosphorus from firecrackers (Dwyer and Helwig 1925). No gross or microscopic alterations were observed in the gastrointestinal tract of rats treated by gavage with 0.075 mg/kg/day for 204 days (IRDC 1985). Hematological Effects. Hematological effects have been reported in a number of case histories of individuals accidentally or intentio nally ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus contained in rat (and cockroach) poisons or fireworks. Because most of the individuals vomited or received gastric lavage shortly after ingestion, the amount of white phosphor us available for absorption is not known. Increases in erythrocyte levels (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950) and hemoglobin levels (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950; McIntosh 1927); decreases in erythrocyte levels (Dwyer and He lwig 1925) and hemoglobin and/or hematocrit levels (Simon and Pickering 1973); and anemia (Caley and Ke llock 1955) have been observed in some of these individuals. A number of individuals had no change in erythrocyte parameters (Ehrentheil 1957; Fletcher and Galambos 1963; Newburger et al. 1948; Simon and Pickering 1976). The decreases in erythrocyte parameters may be a reflection of the hemorrhages obser ved in specific tissues (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, liver, skin) (Dathe and Nathan 1946; Hann Wechsler 1951; Winek et al. 1973). In addition to these changes in erythrocyte parameters, changes in total or differential leukocyte levels were reported in a number of individuals acutely exposed to white phosphorus. Decreases in total leukocyte levels (Diaz- Rivera et al. 1948; Pietras et al. 1968) and decreases or increases in the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukoc ytes (neutrophils) 1981; Pietras et al. 1968). No changes in leukocyte parameters were observed in a number of individuals (Fletcher and Galambos 1963; Newburger et al. 1948; Simon and Pickering 1976). Abnormally low protbrombin times or levels (hypo-prot hrombinemia) and a moderate decrease in platelets were observed in a number of individuals ingesti ng single doses of 1963; McCarron et 1981). Most of the patients developed hypoprothrombinemia within 4-8 days (McCarron et al. 1981). This is probably secondary to the liver damage rather than a direct effect on platelets. No changes in hematological parameters were observed in a child i ngesting phosphorized cod liver oil (0.083 mg/kg/day phosphorus) for 184 days (Sontag 1938). Anemia and leukopenia were observed in individuals occupationally exposed to white phosphorus chronically (Ward 1928). It is likely that workers were exposed by the inhalation, oral, and dermal routes. 54 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Because there is very little consiste ncy regarding the length of time th at elapsed between ingestion and measurement of hematological parameters and the doses cannot be calculated, it is difficult to compare the results of different studies. There is insufficient in formation to determine whether white phosphorus has a direct effect on erythrocytes and/or leukocytes. Th e effects observed may be secondary effects. The decrease in erythrocyte, hemoglobin, hematocrit a nd leukocyte levels may be secondary to hemorrhaging or hematoemesis (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950; Rubits ky and Myerson 1949) and the increase in erythrocytes and hemoglobin may be a compensatory mechanism due to tissue anoxia. However, since red blood cell synthesis takes 3-5 days, the observed effects may be direct if they are occurring within l-2 days. A slight decrease in hemoglobin levels and increase in eosinophil levels were observed in a 30-year-old man who performed magic shows that involved placing white phosphorus pellets in the mucobuccal folds of his mouth for 15 years. He had no other personal ha bits that might adversely affect his health except for occasional bidi smoking for about 8 years (Jakhi et al. 1983). Information on hematological effects in animals is lim ited to one study in which a marked increase in total leukocyte levels and the percentage of monocytes were observed in a guinea pig acutely exposed to 0.9-2.4 mg/kg/day of white phosphorus in a complex dosing regimen (Lawrence and Huffman 1929). The study authors did not specify at which doses the effects occurred. Musculoskeletal Effects. Following ingestion of a fatal dose of rat poison containing white phosphorus by a woman, autopsy revealed fatty infiltration of essentially all tissues, including the musculature (Wertham 1932). Similar effects were reported following the death of a male child who accidentally ingested a firecracker containing white phosphorus; autopsy revealed fatty deposition in many tissues, included the diaphragmic muscle (Humphreys and Halpert 1931). Humans occupationally exposed to white phosphorus probably ingested some airborne white phosphorus. In a study of 71 humans occupationally exposed to white phosphorus, oral exposure to white phosphorus via hand-to-mouth activity was likely because the workers constantly handled a paste containing 4-6% white phosphorus and washr oom facilities were inadequate (Ward 1928). In workers exposed to white phosphorus for intermediate durations, 2 of 44 developed phossy jaw, described as slight necrosis in the lower jaw. In workers exposed to white phosphor us for chronic durations, 12 of 27 developed phossy jaw, with necrosis ranging from slight to severe; 2 of the 12 workers developing phossy jaw died from complications related to the necrosis. The progression of the disease was similar in the cases described, 55 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS usually beginning with the extraction of one or more teeth, poor healing of the socket, followed by necrosis of tissue in the jaw with severe pain and in fection. Treatment consisted of repeated removal of destroyed bone tissue and teeth, draining of ab scesses, and reconstructive surgery. In severe cases, extensive removal of necrotic bone tissue led to pe rmanent disfigurement. However, exposure levels of white phosphorus were not reported (Ward 1928). Case reports of development of phossy jaw following intermediate or chronic occupational exposure to unreported levels of white phosphorus and phosphorus compounds describe a similar progression of symptoms, with similar results; even in cases of early diagnosis and prompt, intensive treatment of phossy jaw, recovery often took several years (Heimann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Kennon and Hallam 1944). It is likely that the effect of white phosphorus in the oral cavity is local, resulting from contact of \"inhaled\" white phosphorus particles with tissue in the mouth. White phosphorus may affect the oral mucosa. Dull, red spots in the oral mucosa, an early sign of phossy jaw, have been reported to precede its development in occupationally exposed workers (Kennon and Hallam 1944). The oral mucosa of workers exposed to white phosphorus has been described as having a du ll, red, unhealthy appearance (Hughes et al. 1962). Exposed bones may be especially susceptible to the i rritating affects of white phosphorus. It is not known whether white phosphorus ingested and absorbed into the systemic circulation contributed to the development of phossy jaw. Not all workers exposed to white phosphorus for longe r-term durations developed phossy jaw. In a study of 71 workers exposed to airborne white phosphorus for intermediate or chronic durations, 4.5% and 44%, respectively, developed phossy jaw (Ward 1928). Forty-eight male workers with exposure to white phosphorus ranging from 1 to 17 years were found to be normal and healthy with regards to many parameters, including serum levels of calcium a nd phosphorus, and bone density; none of the men developed phossy jaw (Hughes et al. 1962). Tooth loss often precedes and accompanies the progression of development of phossy jaw (Heimann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Kennon and Hallam 1944; Ward 1928). Tooth loss during the later stages of phossy jaw clearly results from destruction of the-bone structure supporting the teeth (Heimann 1946; Kennon and Hallam 1944; Legge 1920; Ward 1928). It is not known if tooth loss prior to diagnosis of phossy jaw or early in the development of the condition is related to the white phosphorus exposure. Poor dental hygiene alone can result in tooth loss, and in several case reports some of the workers were described as having poor dental hygiene (Kennon and Hallam 1944). Tooth loss followed by poor healing of the socket often precedes development of the necrosis (Heimann 1946; Hugh es et al. 1962; Kennon and Hallam 1944; Ward 1928), 56 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS suggesting that poor dental hygiene and exposure to white phosphorus may both be contributing factors to the development of phossy jaw. In a case report, five men developed \"precursor signs\" (delayed healing of extracted tooth sites and residual sepsis) of phossy jaw developed following tooth extraction and occupational exposure to white phosphorus (Hughes et al. 1962). However, the condition did not develop into \"classical\" phossy jaw. A man was repeatedly exposed to white phosphorus pellets, placed in the right mucobuccal cavity for magic shows, for 15 years (Jakhi et al. 1983). After 14.5 years of this type of exposure to white phosphorus, right maxillary molars became loose, and were subsequently lost. This was followed by a lack of healing and development of fistulae in the sockets of the right maxillary molars. White phosphorus necrosis of the jaw devel oped, with massive necrosis of the maxilla and floor of the antrum on the right side of the mouth; perforations were pr esent through which the maxillary sinus and nasal cavity were visible. No effects were observed on the left side of the maxilla or on the mandible. Radiographs revealed no evidence of pathology in the chest a nd long bones. The damage to the jaw was probably caused by direct local contact of phosphorus with the soft tissue and bone in the oral cavity. No microscopic or histological abnormalities were observed in the bone of rats treated by gavage with 0.075 mg/kg/day for 204 days (IRDC 1985). Rats e xposed for a chronic duration to 0.2 mg/kg/day white phosphorus in the diet had epiphyseal line thickeni ng and greater extension of trabeculae into the diaphysis of unspecified bones, compared to a control group (Fleming et al. 1942). This study is limited by the failure to specify incidences of effects at interval during dosing and by the failure to state the dosing duration explicitly. Bone effects were observed in children (Com pere 1930a; Phemister 1918; Sontag 1938) and Adams and Sarnat 1940; Whalen et al. 1973) following acute and intermediate oral exposure to white phosphorus. Because white phosphor us-related effects were observed in growing bones, these effects were considered developmental effects, and are discussed in. Section 2.2.2.6. Hepatic Effects. Hepatic effects have been observed in most individuals accidentally or intentionally ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus. These effects include jaundice (Caley et Fletcher and Galambos 1963; Humphreys WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS and Halpert 1931; Rao and Brown 1974; Simon and Pickering al. 1981; Pietras et al. 1968), impaired liver function test results (Fletcher a nd Galambos 1963; Newburger et al. 1948; Pietras et al. 1968; Rubitsky and Myers on 1949), and increases in AST, ALT, and/or lactate dehydrogenase (Ehrentheil 1981; Pietras et al. 1968). In addition to these effects, autopsies or liver biopsies ha ve revealed a number of histological alterations in these individuals. Necrosis (Fletc her and Galambos 1963; Rao and Br and Halpert 1931; Wertham 1932) have been observed in the liver. In addition to these e ffects, altered prothrombin time or level has been observed in a number of individuals ingesting a si ngle dose of McCarron et al. 1981). Prothrombin and other plasma proteins that are re quired for the efficient progression and regulation of blood coagulation are primarily synthesized in the liv er. A deficiency of these proteins is often observed in individuals with severe liver disease. A prolongation of prothrombin time is in part due to this impaired synthesis. Liver function tests were normal in workers chronically exposed to unreported levels of airborne phosphorus (Hughes et al. 1962). Similar hepatic alterations have been observed in animals acutely exposed to white phosphorus. Increases in AST and ALT levels (Paradisi et al. 1984), impaired liver function tests (Ghoshal et al. 1969; Hurwitz 1972; Sigal et al. 1954) increased liver weight (Ghoshal et al. 1969; Seakins and Robinson 1964), increased hepatic Paradisi et al. 1984; Seakins and Robinson 1964), decreased protein synthesis (Barker et al. 1963; Seakins and Robinson 1964), disaggregation of polyribosomes (Pani et al. 1972), fa tty degeneration (Ghoshal et al. 1969) and necrosis (Ghoshal et al. 1969) have been observed. No NOAEL values for hepatic effects following acute animal exposure were identified. In rats, the LOAEL value for liver effects was 6 mg/kg (Barker et al. 1963); in mice it was 5 mgkglday (Hurwitz 1972); and in dogs it was 0.2 mg/kg/day (Sigal et al. 1954). The liver effects occurred shortly after dosing; 3 hours after dos ing, a significant decrease in protein synthesis was observed in the liver (Barker et al. 1963), minimal he patocytic fatty changes were observed after 4 hours (Ghoshal et al. 1969), and severe hepatocytic fatty changes were observed after 12 hours (Ghoshal et al. 1969). 58 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The following hepatic effects have been observed in animals orally exposed for an intermediate duration: fatty infiltration in guinea pigs exposed to 0.75 mg/kg/day (Ashbum et al. 1948), presence of eosinophilic granules at 0.25 mg/kg/day and cirrhosis at 0.66 mg/kg/day in rabbits and guinea pigs (Mallory 1933), and fibrosis and cirrhosis in pigs exposed to 0.6 mg/kg for 5 days/week (Peterson et al. 1991). In the Peterson et al. (1991) study, no liver effects were observed af ter 4 weeks of exposure; after 8 weeks, there were early signs of fibrosis, and after 12 weeks, extens ive fibrosis was observed. Exposure to 0.075 mg/kg/day for an intermediate duration resulted in slight-to- moderate liver necrosis in dying pregnant rats (Bio/dynamics 1991), but no hepatic effects in the surviving pregnant rats or in male rats (Bio/dynamics 1991). In another reproduction study, liver effects were not observed in dying pregnant rats exposed to 0.075 mg/kg/day (IRDC 1985). Both studies used sim ilar exposure protocols and similar vehicles; the difference in the occurrence of liver damage between the studies cannot be explained. Renal Effects. Evidence of severe renal effects have been observed in a number of individuals intentionally or accidentally ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus contained in rat (or roach) poison or fireworks. Proteinuria (Matsumoto et al. 1972; Pietras et al. al. (Dathe and Nathan 1946; McCarron et al. 1981; Rao and Brown 1974), increased blood levels of urea and/or nitr ogen (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950, 1974; 1949), creatinine levels (Dathe and Nath an 1946; McCarron et al. 1981) have been observed in these individuals. Renal insufficiency may be due to a direct toxic effect of phosphorus on the kidneys or to acute renal tubular necrosis from fluid loss a nd shock. Patients in shock may have a peculiar pallor and cyanosis. These probably reflect extensive cellula r damage with poor perfusion of the capillary beds, and are a prognostic sign of serious health effects (Melamon et al. 1981). Several case reports have reported no alterations in kidney function (Ehrenthe il 1957; Fletcher and Galambos 1963; Greenberger et al. 1964; Simon and Pickering 1976). Histological alte rations have also been observed in a number of humans ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus. Fatty changes in the tubules and loop intratubular capillaries (Wechsler and Wechsler 1951) have been observed. Because most individuals vomited shortly after ingesting the white phosphorus or were lavaged, accurate doses cannot be calculated except for one study (Harm and Veale 1910). Histological alterations in the kidney were observed in an 59 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS individual ingesting 2 mg/kg/day, but the lesion was not described. Creatinine levels were similar among unexposed workers and workers exposed to white phosphorus for chronic durations (Hughes et al. 1962). In animals, fatty infiltration in the nephron and subcapsular hemorrhages were observed in dogs acutely exposed to an unspecified amount of white phosphorus (Dwyer and Helwig 1925). No renal effects were observed in rats exposed to 0.075 mg/kg/day for an intermediate duration (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985). No chronic exposure animal studies ex amining renal effects were located. Dermal Effects. Transient toxic dermatitis (described as a scalartiniform rash) developed 9 days after a man ingested a near-fatal dose of rat poison (Dathe a nd Nathan 1946). Edema of eyelids was reported in a 13-month-old child after ingestion of a fatal dose of white phosphorus (Rao and Brown 1974). Subcutaneous hemorrhages were visible in the left foot in a woman after consumption of 3.9 g of rat poison containing 4% phos phorus (Hann and Veale 1910). The woman died 4 days after the initial poisoning. At this time, an enormous subcutaneous hemorrhage was visible below the waist line. In this case report, the woman apparently did not expel (via vom iting) any of the ingested dose. Thus, it is likely that the ingested dose (2 mg/kg) was representative of the effective dose. Scattered blue-green petechiae were observed on the abdomen of a male child follo wing accidental ingestion of a fatal dose of white phosphorus mixed with other ingredients from a firecracker (Humphreys and Halpert 1931). The dose level in this study could not be determined; the firecracker was a red composition of phosphorus mixed with other ingredients and was thought to cont ain about 10% phosphorus (Humphreys and Halpert 1931). No studies were located regarding dermal effects in animals after oral exposure to white phosphorus. Other Systemic Effects. A number of other systemic effects have been observed in humans ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus. The effects that are observed most consistently are hypoglycemia (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950; McCarron et al. 1981; McIntosh 1927; Wechsler and Wechsler 1951), an increase in body temperature (mild pyrexia or feve r) (Dathe and Nathan 1946; McIntosh 1927), and a decrease in plasma calcium, potassium, and/or sodium levels (Caley and Kellock 1955; McCarron et al. 1981; Rao and Brown 1974). It is unclear whether the fever seen is a symptom of phosphorus poisoning or a result of the treatment involved. In addition to these effects, metabolic acidosis (Rao and Brown 1974), hypothermia (Simon and Pickeri ng 1976), damage to the spleen (Greenberger et al. 1964), ascites 60 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS (Fletcher and Galambos 1963), fatty infiltration of the pancreas (H umphreys and Halpert 193 l), and necrosis of the adrenal medulla and cortex (Wechsler and Wechsler 1951) have In a child ingesting 0.083 mg/kg/day white phosphorus for an intermediate duration, decreased appetite, impaired body weight gain, and poor turgor (fullness or tension produced by the fluid content of blood vessels, capillaries, and cells) were observed (Sontag 1938). Serum glucose levels were decreased in workers occupationally exposed to white phosphorus for a ch ronic duration. It is likely that the workers were exposed by the inhalation, oral, and dermal routes (Ward 1928). In dogs acutely exposed to an unspecified amount of white phosphorus, hypoglycemia was observed (Williamson and Mann 1923). Rats recei ved intermittent exposure to the atmosphere in the furnace room of a phosphorus factory for 14 months (Ruzuddinov and Rys-Uly 1986). Histology of rats killed monthly revealed progressive morphological degenerati on of the tongue and oral mucosa of the cheek, gum, and hard palate. Epithelium and connective tissue from different parts of the oral cavity responded similarly to the treatment. Changes in the epithelial layer, observed after only 1 month of exposure, included increases in keratinization and numbers of cell layers, resulting in thickening and hyperkeratosis in the epithelium of the mucosa. Over time, the th ickening and hyperkeratosis in the epithelium increased and histological changes were observed in the sube pithelial connective tissue base. Eventually, the oral cavity contained areas of thickening of the mucosa fro m hyperkeratosis and increased epithelial cell layers interspersed with areas of decreased thickness of the epithelial layer due to atrophy, dystrophy, and cellular necrosis. At this time, adverse changes in the subepithelial connective tissue were considered pronounced. These effects occurred in most of the animals exposed to the atmosphere. It is likely that the observed effects of phosphorus on the oral cavity were local rather than systemic, resulting from direct contact of white phosphorus with tissues in the mouth. The study presented essentially no quantitative data, and the types and exposure levels of chemicals in the atmosphere (thought to contain elementary phosphorus and its inorganic compounds) were not reported (R uzuddinov and Rys-Uly 1986). 2.2.2.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects. There is limited information on the immunotoxici ty of white phosphorus; however, there is some information that suggests that the immune system ma y be a target. Thymic hemorrhages were observed in two young children accidentally ingesting white phosphorus-containing fireworks (Dwyer and Helwig 1925; Humphreys one of these ch ildren, hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue in the intestinal wall and abdominal lymph nodes and hyperplastic lymphoid corpuscles in the spleen were 61 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS observed (Humphreys and Halpert 193 1). Decreases in leukocyte levels were reported in a number of case reports involving acute ingestion of rat poison or fi reworks containing white phosphorus (Diaz-Rivera al. 1948; Pietras et al. 1968). A decrease (Pietras et al. 1968) or an increase in the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) (McCarron et al. 1981) were also observed in individuals ingesting white phosphorus. Because the individuals vomited shortly after ingesting the white phosphorus and/or received gastric lavage, doses could not be estimated. In workers exposed to an unknown level of white phosphorus via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes, a decrease in leukocyte levels was observed (Ward 1928). No studies were located regarding immunological or lym phoreticular effects in animals after oral exposure to white phosphorus. 2.2.2.4 Neurological Effects A number of case reports of individuals accidentally or intentionally ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus have reported ne urological effects. Nonspecific neurological effects including lethargy (Dathe and Nathan 1946; Fletcher and Galambos 1949; 1981), and hypoactivity (Humphreys and Halpert 1931) have been observed. Other symptoms of neurotoxicity that have been observed include coma or semi-coma (Caley toxic delirium and 1950), hemiplegia (Humphreys and Halpert 1931; Mc Carron et al. 1981), reflexes (Wechsler and Wechsler 1951), hyperesthesia (Humphreys and Halpert 1931), coarse fasciculations (Caley and Kellock 1955), unresponsiveness to painful stim uli (Simon and Pickering 1976), and marked asterixis (flapping tremor) (Greenberger et al. 1964). In addition to these overt signs of neurotoxicity, histological damage in the brain was observed in four individuals ingesting a si ngle dose of white phosphorus. Based on this limited information, the types of cellular dama ge can be grouped into four categories: (1) cellular changes resulting from ischemic damage found in the Pu rkinje cells and cerebral cortical cells of the second and third layer of the cortex (Wertham 1932); (2) direct white phosphorus-induced cellular damage to the dentate nucleus and inferior olives (Wertham 1932); (3) fatty infiltration in the ganglion 62 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS cells of the cortex, neuroglial cells, Golgi cells of the cerebellum, and the cells in the pia-arachnoid space (Humphreys and Halpert 1931; Wertham 1932); and (4) cerebral edema (Rao and Brown 1974). It is not known if the cerebral edema observed in this one indi vidual was secondary to the other types of damage. A child treated with 0.083 mg/kg/day white phosphorus for an intermediate duration became lethargic 3 months after beginning treatment and remain ed lethargic until treatment was discontinued 70 days later. Following cessation of treatment, the ch ild recovered very rapidly (Sontag 1938). Overt signs of neurotoxicity were observed in a cat ingesting a single lethal dose (Fry and Cucuel 1969) and in pregnant rats exposed to a lethal dose (0.075 mg/kg/day) of white phosphorus for an intermediate duration (effects only observed during late gesta tion of parturition) (Bio/dynamics 1991). Tonoclonic convulsions, increased salivation and weakness were observed in the cat (Frye and Cucuel1969), and tremors were observed in pregnant rats (Bio/dynamics 1991). In another developmental toxicity study (IRDC 1985), no signs of neurotoxicit y were observed in pregnant rats. All LOAEL values from each reliable study for neurolog ical effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-2 and plotted in Figur e 2-2. Because vomiting occurred or the individuals received gastric lavage shortly after ingestion, reliable dose estimations could only be made for one individual acutely exposed to 2 mg/kg/da y white phosphorus (Hann and Veale 1910). 2.2.2.5 Reproductive Effects Extensive uterine hemorrhaging was observed in a 2-month pregnant woman following the intentional ingestion of 2 mg/kg white phosphorus in rat poiso n (Hann and Veale 1910). Autopsy results showed that the uterus was enlarged containing a hemorrhagic mole, which was consistent with a 2-month pregnancy. No effects on reproductive performance or histological alterations in the ovaries, uterus, testis, or epididymis were observed in rats administered 0. 075 mg/kg/day or less in a one-generation reproduction study (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985). The highest NOAEL value and all LOAEL values from ea ch reliable study for effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-2 and plotted in Figure 2-2. 63 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.2.2.6 Developmental Effects A healthy infant was administered phosphorized cod liver oil (reported to contain 1.1 mg \"pure\" phosphorus per fluid ounce) from ages l-7 months (Sontag 1938). The phosphorized cod liver oil was apparently administered for the prevention of rick ets. The time-weighted average dose for the 6-month exposure was 0.083 mg/kg/day. During the first 3 mont hs of treatment, the child appeared clinically normal and grew at a normal rate. From the ages of 4 to 6 months, the child became clinically ill, gained essentially no weight, and the rate of growth in height decreased from 0.1 to 0.04 cm/day. Following replacement of the treatment with normal, nonphosphori zed cod liver oil, the child appeared to recover quickly, and began to grow at a normal rate. Radi ograms taken at 6 months of age showed bands of increased density at the end of all the long bones with increased thickness and density also observed in the zones of calcification. Radiograms taken between 9 months and 5 years of age showed bands of increased density in the diaphyses of the long bones, and in the pelvic, metacarpal, and metatarsal bones. This study describes formation of \"phosphorus\" bands of increased density in the ends of long bones and possible decreased growth in a child exposed to 0.083 mg/kg/day phosphorus for 6 months (Sontag 1938). It should be noted that radiologic densities are common at the growing points of long bones in children. However, lead poisoning, administration of nickel, certain chronic diseases like anemia, and hypervitaminosis D may also produce bands in the ends of bones, but these are much thicker and heavier (Sontag 1938). A child with Perthes' disease was administered 0.056 mgkg/day of phosphor us for two periods of intermediate duration, separated by a period with no exposure (Phemister 1918). \"Phosphorus\" bands of increased density developed in the ends in the tibia, fibula, and femur during the two exposure periods, without any improvement in the child's condition. A male child with dyschondroplasia was administered 0.026 and 0.046 mg/kg/day white phosphorus for 3 and 8 months, respectively. \"Phosphorus\" bands of increased density developed in the tibia, fibula, an d femur. The density and thickness of the bands were greater at the high-dose level and longer-treatment pe riod. A male and 0.059 mg/kg/day phosphorus for 26,3, and 18 months, respectively, separated by a period of time with no white phos phorus exposure. Treatment with white phosphorus produced marked changes, including bands of in creased density at the ends of bones and increased transverse diameters of the shafts of bones in the legs and arms (Phemister 1918). Four children with moderate to severe cases of rickets were treated ora lly with 0.110-0.158 mg/kg/day white phosphorus for 64 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS durations ranging from 64 to 149 days (Compere 1930a ). \"Phosphorus\" bands of increased thickness and density were observed in the long bon es of 1 of 2 of the children examined. An arachitic child was treated with 0.119 mg/kg/day white phosphorus for 82 days (Compere 1930b). Following treatment, the child had a \"heavy phosphorus line\" and increased density of cortices. Treatment with white phosphorus did not generally improve the condition of the bones in children with rickets. Because these children were sickly, the relevance of the observed effects to potential effects of white phosphorus in normal, healthy children could not be ascertained. Young, growing rabbits exposed to 0.3 mg/kg/day wh ite phosphorus given as a pill for an acute duration had transverse bands of increased density in metaphyseal regions of the tibia and fibula, compared to a control group (Adams 1938a). However, the percentage of calcium and phosphorus, and the calcium/phosphorus ratio in the metaphyseal and cortical regions of the right tibia was similar between treated and control animals. Young, growing rabbits exposed to 0.3 mg/kg/day white phosphorus given as a pill for an intermediate duration had average gr owth of the tibia of 0.27 mm/day, compared to 0.36 mm/day in the control group; however, no statistical analysis of the results was reported (Adams and Samat 1940). One rabbit had histological abnormalities in the tibia including decreased size of epiphyseal cartilage plate, as well as increased density in the me taphyseal zone with trabeculae that were greater in number and extended further into the diaphysis to a greater extent, compared to a control rabbit. The trabeculae were associated with a greater amount of calcified cartilage matrix. These effects probably resulted from a decrease in the normal rate of bone resorption during bone growth, resulting in decreased rate of growth of the tibia. Weanling rats exposed to 1.25 mg/kg/day white phosphorus in the feed for an intermediate duration had widening of the metaphyseal trabeculae, broadened metaphysis, and a slightly convex lateral contour of the proximal tibia, comp ared to a control group (Whalen et al. 1973). Osteocytes were small and elongated comp ared to those in the control group, and osteocytic osteolysis and chondrolysis were decreased or missing. In the treated rats, metaphyseal trabeculae extended deeper into the diaphysis than in the controls. These effects pr obably resulted from decreased bone resorption during bone growth, resulting in widening trabeculae and a denser metaphysis. Very similar results were observed in studies on growing rats (Adams and Sa rnat 1940) and rabbits, but not in an adult rabbit (Adams 1938b). In rats, the doses varied from 0.002% to 0.05% yellow phosphor us (Adams and Sarnat 1940) and in rabbits, from 0.6 to 6 mg (Adams 1938b; Adams and Samat 1940). 65 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS A decrease in the number of viable pups and an in crease in the number of stillborn pups was observed in the F 1a and F 1b offspring of rats exposed to 0.075 mg/kg/day; however, the incidence was not significantly (p<0.05) different from controls (IRDC 1985). These effects were not seen in a similarly designed reproduction study in which rats were administer ed 0.075 mg/kg/day (Bio/dynamics 1991). Neither of these studies found any significant differences in th e occurrence of malformations or anomalies. These NOAEL and LOAEL values from each reliable study for developmental effects in rats are recorded in Table 2-2 and plotted in Figure 2-2. 2.2.2.7 Genotoxic Effects No studies were located regarding genotoxic effects in humans or animals after oral exposure to white phosphorus. Genotoxicity studies are discussed in Section 2.5. 2.2.2.8 Cancer No studies were located regarding cancer in human s or after oral exposure to white phosphorus. In the only chronic duration oral study in animals, no treatment-related histopathological lesions were observed in the lungs or other organs ( not otherwise specified) in rats given 1.6 mg/kg/day white phosphorus in the diet for up to 479 days (Fleming et al. 1942). Only six rats per dose group were used. 2.2.3 Dermal Exposure (Nonburn) Studies regarding dermal (nonburn) exposure of humans to white phosphorus were limited tojhose involving occupational exposure. In one study, the work ers' hands were regularly in contact with paste containing phosphorus (Ward 1928). The extent of de rmal exposure in the other occupational studies was not clear, although it is likely there was dermal expos ure to airborne particles (Heimann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Kennon and Hallam 1944). 66 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS One study was located regarding health effects in animals after dermal exposure to white phosphorus; the study tested dermal and ocular irritation of white phosphorus in rabbits (Lee et al. 1975). No studies were located regarding health effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to white phosphorus smoke. 2.2.3.1 Death Dermal exposure to white phosphorus most likel y occurred in humans occupationally exposed to fumes/vapors and paste containing white phosphorus. Th e workers constantly handled a paste containing 4-6% white phosphorus. The workers were most lik ely exposed by the inhalation, oral, and dermal routes. White phosphorus-related deaths occurred in 0 of 44 and 2 of 27 of the workers exposed for intermediate or chronic durations, respectively (Ward 1928). No studies were located regarding death in animals after derma.l exposure to white phosphorus. 2.2.3.2 Systemic Effects No studies were located regarding respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, or renal effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to white phosphorus. The highest NOAEL value and all reliable LOAEL values for systemic effects in each spec ies and duration are recorded in Table 2-3. Hematological Effects. Anemia and a decrease in leukocytes were observed in workers occupationally exposed to white phosphorus (Ward 1928). Because the workers handled rags coated with white phosphorus, the workers were exposed by inhalation, oral, and dermal routes. No studies were located regarding hematological e ffects in animals after dermal exposure to white phosphorus. Musculoskeletal Effects. Phossy jaw, described as slight-to-severe necrosis of the jaw, was observed in workers exposed to white phosphorus via the inhalation, oral, and dermal routes for intermediate and chronic durations. The workers constantly handled a paste containing 4-6% white phosphorus (Ward 1928). For more information on this effect, see Section 2.2.2.2. 70 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS No studies were located regarding musculoskeletal effects in animal s after dermal exposure to white phosphorus. Dermal Effects. No studies were located regarding dermal effects in humans after dermal exposure to white phosphorus. No signs of skin irritation were observed in rabbits af ter a 0.1% solution of white phosphorus in peanut oil was applied to the shaven intact skin (Lee et al. 1975). White phosphorus is highly reactive and is likely to be an irritant. It is possible that the peanut oil vehicle was protective against these potential effects. Ocular Effects. No studies were located regarding ocular effects in humans after dermal exposure to white phosphorus. No signs of eye irritation was observed in rabbits af ter a 0.1% solution of white phosphorus in peanut oil was applied to the eyes (Lee et al. 1975). White phos phorus is highly reactive and is likely to be an irritant. It is possible that the peanut oil ve hicle was protective against this potential effect. Other Systemic Effects. Decreased serum glucose levels were observed in workers occupationally exposed to white phosphorus (Ward 1928). In addition to inhalation and oral exposure, the workers' hands were regularly in contact with paste containing white phosphorus. No studies were located regarding other systemic effects in animals after dermal exposure to white phosphorus. 2.2.3.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects As discussed in Section 2.2.3.2, in workers expo sed to an unknown level of phosphorus via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes, a decrease in leukocyte levels was observed (Ward 1928). No other effects suggestive of immunotoxicity were observed in humans. No studies were located regarding immunological and lymphoreticular effects in animals after dermal exposure to white phosphorus. 71 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS No studies were located regarding the following health effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure (nonburn) to white phosphorus: 2.2.3.4 Neurological Effects Effects 2.2.3.6 Developmental Effects 2.2.3.7 Genotoxic Effects Genotoxicity studies are discussed in Section 2.5. 2.2.3.8 Cancer No studies were located regarding cancer in hum ans or animals after dermal exposure to white phosphorus. 2.2.4 Dermal Exposure (Burn) No studies were located regarding health effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure (burn) to white phosphorus smoke. 2.2.4.1 Death A high rate of mortality (12 of 27) in humans occu rred following accidental explosions from ignited white phosphorus in munitions factories (Walker et al. 1947) . The workers that died had third-degree burns over 35-90% of their body surface. Those surviving had burns over 19% of the body surface. These burn cases followed a course that was \"indistinguishable\" from that of nonphosphorus related third-degree burns. Thus, death apparently resulted from the burns alone, with no contributing factor from white phosphorus. In animal studies using experimental white phosphorus burns, there is evidence that white phosphorus or phosphorus compounds remaining in the burn site may contribute to the increased mortality. New Zealand White rabbits received white phosphorus burns or branding burns (control group) over l0-20% of 72 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS the body surface (Bowen et al. 1971). The mortality rate was 65-85% in rabbits burned with white phosphorus, compared to 0% in the control group. Most deaths occurred within the first 18-24 hours. Clinical signs prior to death included a genera lized depression and twitching. Results from serum chemistry and EKG tests prior to death indicated th at white phosphorus burns may produce a decrease in the calcium/phosphorus ratio, with potentially lethal effects on heart function. Animals that died had decreased serum calcium (80% of those that died ) and increased serum phosphorus (100% of those that died). Rabbits that died generally had major shif ts in EKG readings, while survivors had minor EKG changes. Three other studies used rats as models of acute dermal burn. Doses of 29 mg/kg/day (Ben-Hur et al. 1972), 100 mg/kg/day (Ben-Hur and Appelbaum 1973), and 182 mg/kg/day (Eldad and Simon 1991) resulted in 5 of 10 (50%), 4 of 8 (50%), and 16 of 16 (100%) deaths, respectively, in the groups that were burned with white phosphorus. Although each of the studies using rats had a control group, none of the studies reported incidences of mortality in the control group. Changes in clinical serum and urinary parameters, as well as microscopic examination of tissues, generally indicated severe liver and kidney damage. Acute renal and/or hepatic failure was the probable cause of death. Severe hepatic, renal, a nd capillary damage was also indicated by light and phase-contrast microscope (Ben-Hur et al. 1972; Ben Hur and Appelbaum 1973). 2.2.4.2 Systemic Effects No studies were located regarding respiratory, gastro intestinal, or musculoskeletal effects in humans or animals after dermal (burn) exposure to white phosphorus. The highest NOAEL value and all reliable LOAEL values for systemic effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 2-3. Cardiovascular Effects. Transient electrocardiogram alterations, indicative of myocardial-ischemia, were observed in an individual burned by an unkn own amount of white phosphorus (Summerlin et al. 1967). The electrocardiogram returned to normal 5 days after being burned. In rabbits burned by an unknown amount of white phosphorus, electrocardiogram alterations (prolongation of QT interval, ST segment depression, T-wave changes, bradycardia, and low voltage QRS 73 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS complex) indicative of myocardial damage were observed; however, no histological alterations were observed in the heart (Bowen et al. 1971). Hematological Effects. Anemia, hemolysis, and leukocytosis have been observed in individuals burned by an unspecified amount of white phosphorus (Summerlin et al. 1967; Walker et al. 1947). Because copper sulfate is often used to treat white phosphorus burns, it is difficult to determine whether the anemia and hemolysis were due to copper or white phosphorus poisoning. Copper can be absorbed from the burn injury or wound after topical appli cation of copper sulfate to white phosphorus burn surfaces (Bowen et al. 1971; Summerlin et al. 1967). Acute copper intoxication is characterized by hemolytic anemia with intravascular hemolysis (Summerlin et al. 1967) No studies were located regarding hematological effect s in animals after dermal (burn) exposure to white phosphorus. Hepatic Effects. Jaundice, hepatomegaly, and increased serum bilirubin levels have been observed in humans with white phosphorus-induced burns (Song et al. 1985; Summerlin et al. 1967; Walker et al. 1947). In rats burned once with 29 or 100 mg/kg/day wh ite phosphorus, an increase in ALT levels, necrosis, ballooning degeneration of he patocytes, and microthrombi in the portal veins have been observed (Ben- Hur and Appelbaum 1973; Ben-Hur et al. 1972). In rabbits burned by white phosphorus (dose not reported), semm calcium and phosphorus levels were normal, and no morphological damage was observed (Bowen et al. 1971). No longer-term human and anim al studies examining hepatic effects were found. Renal Effects. Evidence of renal damage was observed in individuals burned once with white phosphorus. Increased blood urea nitrogen (Summerlin et al. 1967), increased urinary levels of protein and urea nitrogen (Walker et al. 1947), and signs of acute renal failure (Song et al. 1985) have been observed. No longer term human studies were identif ied. Some of the blood/serum chemical changes are also found in thermal burn patients and cannot necessar ily be ascribed to white phosphorus toxicity. However, controlled animal studies (discussed below) ha ve shown similar effects that have been attributed to white phosphorus. 74 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The severe histological alterations that have been observed in animals acutely burned with 29-200 mg/kg/day white phosphorus, s upport the effects observed in humans. Necrosis and vascular degeneration of the proximal tubule and ischemic ch anges in the glomerulus of rats were observed (Applebaum et al. 1975; Ben-Hur and Applebaum 1973; Ben-Hur et al. 1972). In addition to these histological alterations, increased blood urea nitroge n levels, excessive diuresis, oliguria, decreased creatinine clearance, and renal failure have b een observed (Ben-Hur et al. 1972). No histological alterations were observed in the kidneys of rabb its burned once with an unreported amount of white phosphorus (Bowen 1971). No longer-term derrn al (burn) animal studies were located. Dermal Effects. Dermal effects have resulted from white phosphorus-induced burns during pesticide manufacture and from incendiary munitions explosions (Konjoyan 1983; Song et al. 1985; Summerlin et al. 1967; Walker et al. 1947). Many white phosphorus-induced burns are second and third degree. Burn damage to the skin tissue is believed to result not only from heat but also from the corrosive action of phosphoric acid and the hygroscopic (moisture-absorb ing) properties of phosphorus pentoxide, which is generated by the oxidation of white phosphorus (Ben-Hur and Appelbaum 1973). Severe white phosphorus burns also tend to heal more slowly than other types of third-degree thermal burns. Rat models of acute dermal burn exposure revealed necrosis of the skin at exposure levels of 29 mg/kg/day (Ben-Hur et al. 1972) and 100 mg/ kg/day (Ben-Hur and Applebaum 1973), and delayed wound healing at 100 mg/kg/day. Ocular Effects. Ocular effects have resulted from white phosphorus-induced burns during pesticide manufacture and from incendiary munitions explosions (Konjoyan 1983; Song et al. 1985; Summerlin et al. 1967; Walker et al. 1947). Many white phosphorus-induced burns are second and third degree. Burn damage to the skin tissue is believed to result not only from heat, but also the corrosive action of phosphoric acid and the hygroscopic (moisture-absorb ing) properties of phosphorus pentoxide which is generated by oxidation of white phosphorus (Ben-Hur and Appelbaum 1973). Also, severe white phosphorus burns tend to heal more slowly th an other types of third-degree thermal burns. Transient local necrosis and congestion were repor ted after smoking particles of white phosphorus were discovered in the tarsal and bul bar conjunctival sacs of a dermal burn patient (Scherling and Blondis 1945). The conjunctival effects were comp letely absent by 4 days post-exposure. 75 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS No studies were located regarding ocular effects in animals after dermal (burn) exposure to white phosphorus. Other Systemic Effects. No studies were located regarding other systemic effects in humans after dermal (burn) exposure to white phosphorus. In rabbits burned once with an unknown amount of white phosphorus, serum hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia were observed (Bowen et al. 1971). No longer term dermal (burn) exposure studies were located. 2.2.4.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects Leukocytosis was observed in individuals burned by an unspecified amount of white phosphorus (Walker et al. 1947). No studies were located regarding immunological or lym phoreticular effects in animals after dermal (burn) exposure to white phosphorus. 2.2.4.4 Neurological Effects An individual lapsed into a deep coma a number of hours after being burned by white phosphorus (Walker et al. 1947). Depression, poor responsiveness to stimuli, shivering, twitching, and anorexia were observed in rabbits burned by white phosphorus ( no dose reported) (Bowen et al. 1971). No studies were located regarding the following health effects in human or animals after dermal (burn) exposure to white phosphorus: 2.2.4.5 Reproductive Effects 2.2.4.6 Developmental Effects 2.2.4.7 Genotoxic Effects Genotoxicity studies are discussed in Section 2.5. 76 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.2.4.8 Cancer No studies were located regarding cancer in humans or animals after dermal (burn) exposure to white phosphorus. 2.3 TOXICOKINETICS The toxicokinetics of white phosphor us are poorly understood. There are several reasons for this. First, both organic and inorganic molecules containing phosphor us perform a vastly intricate web of functions in the animal body. Organic phosphorus is metabolica lly important for energy storage and transfer in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine, for information transfer and ultimately protein synthesis in nucleotides and nucleic acids, and for carbohydrate metabolism in hexose- and triosephosphates (Latner 1975). Phospholipids have an important structural role, forming integral parts of cell and organelle membranes, including the matrix th at properly orients mitochondrial oxidative enzymes (Dryer 1970). Inorganic phosphorus occurs as phosphate in the blood's buffering system, in interstitial fluid, and in intracellular fluid where it is the ma jor anionic constituent (Guyton 1976). Second, a method for quantifying white phosphorus per se in body tissu es has not been developed. Therefore, quantitative assessments of white phosphorus absorption, distri bution, metabolism, and excretion are necessarily measurements of possible white phosphorus metabolites and not of white phosphorus itself. Even the qualitative detection of white phosphorus in bodily fluids and tissues is equivocal. The one published method for detecting the presence of white phosphorus in tissue gives unequivocal negative results but can give false positives with unreported frequency (Bla nke 1970). Also, phosphorescence observed in tissues of white phosphorus-exposed animals may or may no t be indicative of the presence of white phosphorus as such. The fate of white phosphorus following exposure by any route is an open question. White phosphorus is an inorganic chemical that is poorly soluble in water, soluble in nonpolar organic solvents such as benzene, soluble in more polar organic solvents such as CS 2 (Cotton and Wilkinson 1966), and is lipid-soluble. White phosphorus is the most reactive allo tropic form of elemental phosphorus, oxidizing spontaneously in the air at room temperature, and hydrating under certain conditions (Cotton and Wilkinson 1966). Although it has not been demonstrat ed, it is probable that, since white phosphorus is highly reactive in the presence of oxygen, it is rapi dly converted to its oxi dation products prior to 77 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS absorption into the body. Inorganic conversion (e.g., to phosphates, phosphorus peroxide, and orthophosphates) may occur as white phosphorus sits on th e skin exposed to the air, travels through the air to the moist surfaces of the lungs and mouth, or moves through the highly acidic and then basic environments of the mammalian gut. However, absorp tion of some white phosphorus by oral, inhalation, and dermal routes is likely since it is lipid-soluble. If white phosphorus as such is absorbed, then the inorganic reactions may occur in vivo in the blood, interstitial fluid, an d intracellular fluid, although this has not been demonstrated. Further, there are no studies either definitively supporting or refuting the possibility that white phosphorus is broken down enzymatically. The formation of white phosphorus metabolites is probably limited by the inorganic, aqueous dissociation of white phosphorus. Following the dissociation of white phosphorus (either prior to absorption or in the body fluids), the individual phosphorus atoms are pr obably incorporated first into phosphates and then into a variety of biochemicals as secondary metabolit es. The fate of the phosphorus would then follow that of all common phosphorus-containing molecules in the body. At least 96% of excreted phosphorus (both urine and feces) is excreted as inorganic phos phate, and the and phospholipids) (Latner 1975). The of white phosphorus smoke are likewise unknown. White phosphorus smoke is primarily oxides and acids of phosphorus, with some residual unburnt white phosphorus (refer to Chapter 3 for a detailed description of the composition of white phosphorus smoke). The fates of airborne white phosphorus, and the phosphorus oxides and phos phorus-containing acids originating from the combustion of white phosphorus, are largely unknown. 2.3.1 Absorption 2.3.1.l Inhalation Exposure White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding absorpti on in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. Human serum concentrations of phosphate (relevance to absorption of white phosphorus is unknown) following inhalation exposure are discussed in Section 2.3.3 (Metabolism). White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding abso rption in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. White phosphorus smoke probably contains some 78 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS residual unburnt white phosphorus (see Chapter 3 for composition information). Human serum concentrations of phosphate (relevance to absorp tion of white phosphorus smoke is unknown) following occupational inhalation exposure to white phosphorus are discussed in Section 2.3.3 (Metabolism). Health effects observed after inhalation of white phosphorus smoke are most likely portal of entry effects, and, therefore, do not indicate that absorption of white phosphorus occurred. However, the oxides and acids of white phosphorus that occur in the smoke are probably absorbed to an unknown degree. 2.3.1.2 Oral Exposure White Phosphorus. No studies were located that quantify absorption of white phosphorus in humans following oral exposure to white phosphorus. Qualitative evidence of oral absorption in humans abounds in case reports of intentionally and accidentally ing ested white phosphorus from rat poison or fireworks. Systemic signs of toxicity following such ingestion ra nge from simple gastrointestinal upset to liver failure to death within hours of ingestion (see Section 2.2 fo r further details). These reports suggest that either white phosphorus, or one of its inorga nic breakdown products, is absorbed. Orthophosphate is a stable end-product of the inorgani c oxidation or hydrolysis of white phosphorus (see Section 2.3.3 [Metabolism]), and is possibly produced in the gut to some degree prior to absorption. During normal digestion, phosphate is released from phosphate-containing biochemicals in food and actively absorbed in the upper small intestine, and somewhat less in the more basic environment of the lower small intestine (Latner 1975). Phosphate absorptio n is significantly higher in acid pH environments than in alkaline environments (Tietz 1970). Huma n and animal data on ser um levels of phosphate (technically, one of two ionic forms of orthophosphate [H 3PO 4]) are included for completeness in Section 2.3.3 (Metabolism). Intestinal absorption of phosphate normally fluctuates widely. It is decreased by high intake of calcium, magnesium, or iron, which form insoluble phosphates in the gut, by unusually high intestinal alkalinity, and by low vitamin D intake (Latner 1975). Thus, the relevance of serum phosphate levels as they relate to abso rption of white phosphorus is not known. Renwick (1989) notes species differences in gastric pH, ranging from 1.9 in rabbits to between 3.8 and 5.0 in rats. Such differences in gut environments ma y affect species differences in absorption rate of white phosphorus or its inorganic breakdo wn products, although quantitative comparisons between species were not located. 79 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Absorption of 32P-labeled white phosphorus or one of its br eakdown products is very rapid following oral administration to animals. Came ron and Patrick (1966) observed 32P systemically in female rats, female rabbits, and male mice for 48 hours following a single oral dose by gavage of 32P-labeled white phosphorus. Absorption of 32P was high in the liver, renal cortex, bowel mucosa, epidermis, hair follicles, pancreas, and adrenal cortex, and was low in the brain, striped muscle, myometrium, fat, and bone. In a later study, Ghoshal et al. (1971) demonstrated that phosphorus was rapidly absorbed in male rats following a single oral gavage of 32P-labeled white phosphorus mixe d with a \"toxic dose\" of unlabeled white phosphorus. By 15 minutes post-dosing, radioactivity was detected in the blood and liver (<5% of administered 32P). At 2-3 hours, the percentage of total dose in the liver reached its maximum of 65-70%. At that time, the percentages of administered 32P recovered from blood (12%), kidney (4%), spleen (0.4%), pancreas (0.4%), and brain (0.39%) were significantly lower than for the liver (p<0.001; n=4 for each). The fraction of the administered dose accounted for in these tissues at 2-3 hours post-dosing was 82-87%. Finally, Lee et al. (1975) gavaged rats once with 10% of the oral LD 50 of 32P-labeled white 50 in 50; females = 3.03 mg/kg) and found that total 32P absorbed reached a maximum of 60-65% of the administered radioactivity at =24 hours post-dosing. White Phosphoncs Smoke. No studies were located regarding absorption in humans or animals after oral exposure to white phosphorus smoke or white phosphorus smoke condensates. 2.3.1.3 Dermal Exposure White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding absorption in humans or animals after dermal (no burn) exposure to white phosphorus. No studies were located that qua ntify absorption in humans or animals following exposure to white phosphorus by dermal burning. Qualitative evidence of absorption in humans and animals in the form of systemic effects suggests absorption of white phos phorus or one of its combustion products following dermal white phosphorus burns (see Section 2.2). Human and animal serum concentrations of phosphate following dermal white phosphorus burns are discussed in Section 2.3.3 (Metabolism), although their 80 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS White Phosphorus Smoke . No studies were located regarding ab sorption in humans or animals after dermal exposure to white phosphorus sm oke or white phosphorus smoke condensates. 2.3.2 Distribution Naturally occurring phosphorus is widely distributed in the healthy human body. Approximately 80% of phosphorus in the human body is bound with calcium in the bones and teeth. Pyrophosphates and polyphosphates are associated with bone formation by maintaining the mineral phase of bone, hydroxyapatite (3Ca 3(PO 4)2Ca(OH) 2), in supersaturated solution in the extracellular fluid (Latner 1975). Phosphorus-containing organic compounds in the blood and muscle such as proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates constitute another 10% of body phosphorus. Nearly all organic forms of phosphorus in blood, such as 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, adenosine triphosphate, and fructose 1,6-diphosphate, occur in erythrocytes (Henry 1967). The remaining 10% has an extensive distribution in the fluids of the body (Harper 1969). Serum inorganic phosphates are present at levels of 3.0-4.5 mg/l00 mL (Harper 1969) as H 2PO 4-1 (80%) and as HPO 4-2 (20%) of 7.4 (Tietz 1970). Walser and Mudge (1960) report that 7% of plasma phosphate is in direct association with calcium. Transient hypo- or hyperphosphatemia frequently occurs in the healthy human body following meals. Plasma inorganic phosphate increases following ingestion of calcium and decreases during periods of increased carbohydrate metabolism (Latner 1975). Vitamin D can increase phosphate absorption in the gut; during vitamin D deficiency, plasma phosphate falls (Lat ner 1975). In ill individua ls, hypophosphatemia is caused by vomiting and severe diarrhea, and is associated with various liver diseases (Latner 1975). 2.3.2.1 Inhalation Exposure White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding distribu tion in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. Human serum concentrations of phosphate (relevance to distribution is unknown) following inhalation exposure are discussed in Section 2.3.3 (Metabolism). White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding distribution in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. White phosphorus smoke probably contains some residual unburnt white phosphorus (see Chapter 3 for composition information). Human serum concentrations of phosphate (releva nce to distribution of white phosphorus, oxides of phosphorus, or acids of phosphorus is unknown) foll owing occupational inhalation expos ure to white phosphorus smoke are 81 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS discussed in Section 2.3.3 (Metabolism). Health eff ects observed in humans and animals after inhalation of white phosphorus smoke (see Section 2.2) are most likely portal of entry effects, and, therefore, do not indicate that absorption and subsequent distribution of white phosphorus occurred. However, a percentage of the oxides and acids of white phosphorus that occu r in the smoke is probably absorbed and distributed systemically. 2.3.2.2 Oral Exposure White Phosphorus. No studies were located that quantify distribution in humans following oral exposure to white phosphorus, but several studies have examined the distribution of 32P in animals following oral administration white phosphorus. Human and animal serum concentrations of phosphate (relevance to distribution is unknown) following oral exposur e are discussed in Section 2.3.3 (Metabolism). An acute exposure study by Cameron and Patrick (1966) showed qualitatively and quantitatively that the 48 hour distribution of 32P after oral administration of 32P-labeled white phosphorus was similar in rats, rabbits, and mice. Using qualitative au toradiography results, they assigned the liver, renal cortex, bowel mucosa, epidermis, hair follicles, pancreas, and ad renal cortex to the high uptake category. The ovary, renal medulla, spleen, endometrium, myocardium, thymus, lung, and adrenal medulla were assigned to the medium uptake category following autoradiography. Striated muscle, brain, myometrium, fat, and bone were each assigned to the low uptake category on th e basis of autoradiography. Autoradiography showed that in both the kidney and adrenal gland, the cortex was more heavily labeled than the medulla, and that the centrilobular region of the liver showed greater uptake of 32P than other areas of the liver. Cameron and Patrick (1966) generally confirmed their own autoradi ography results quantitatively. At 48- hours post-dosing, data showed the same distribution of radioactivity for both perfused and unperfused tissue samples. A comparison of radioactivity c oncentration between blood and other tissues was not possible, since the units of radioactivity concentra tion in the blood were unclear. Among the tissues other than blood, the bowel had the highest level of radio activity, followed in generally decreasing order by the liver, kidney, spleen, lung, heart, muscle, pancreas, adrenal, brain, thymus, thyroid, testes, ovary, uterus, fat, bone, aorta, trachea, and pituitary. In a later acute exposure study, Goshal et al. (197 1) examined both gross distribution and subcellular hepatic distribution of 32P at 2-3 hours post-dosing. At 2-3 hours, the percentage of total dose in the liver 82 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS reached its maximum of 65-70%. At that time, the percentages of administered 32P recovered from blood (12%), kidney (4%), spleen (0.4%), pancreas (0.4%), and brain (0.39%) were significantly lower than for the liver (p<.001; n=4 for each). A substantial amount ( 40%) of the administered 32P remained in the liver for several hours. The subcellular distribution of 32P within the liver at 2 hours post-dosing was 54%, 18%, 16%, and 10% of total liver radioactivity in th e supematant, microsomal, nuclear, and mitochondrial fractions, respectively. Each of these subcellular fracti ons was treated in turn with 10% trichloracetic acid (TCA) to precipitate essentially all macromolecul es in the fraction, leaving only the water-soluble components in solution. The radioactivity of TCA-pr ecipitable material in the supematant, microsomal, nuclear, and mitochondrial fractions w as approximately 1.7%, 5.1% (significantly higher than in the other fractions; p<0.0l), 1.2%, and 0.3% of total hepatic radioactivity, respectively. Most of the radioactivity of the liver was recovered from the phosphate fraction after TCA treatment. Although the radioactivity recovered from total hepatic lipids increased up to 2-3 hours post-dosing, total hepatic lipids represented a maximum of only 1.4-3% of the administered dose of 32P. Lipids were also extracted from the microsomal fraction of the liver homogenate at the 4- and 10-hour sacrifices (n=4 for each). Total radioactivity of hepatic microsomal lipid significantly increased (p<0.025; n=4) between 4 and 10 hours post-dosing, whether expressed as percent of total liver activity (increased from about 2.7% to 4.1%) or as a percent of total 32P administered (increased from about 1.1% to 1.9%) Following a single oral administration of 32P-labeled white phosphorus (dose not specified) to female rats, Lee et al. (1975) found that administered 32P was distributed unevenly among sampled tissues, and the distribution among tissues changed with the timing of sacr ifice after dosing. The liver consistently had the highest total 32P as a percent of the administered dose, with 16.1%, 16.9%, and 6.3% at 4 hours, 1 day, and 5 days post-dosing. The percent of the administered 32P recovered from whole blood, liver, and lungs decreased as the time between dosing and sacrifice increased. The percent of the administered 32P recovered from skeletal muscle increased sli ghtly with time after dosing. Administered 32P recovered from kidneys, spleen, and brain tissue remained relativel y constant from 4 hours to 5 days post-dosing. The tissue/plasma radioactivity radio (radioactivity in 1 g wet tissue per radioactivity in 1 mL plasma) increased in all tissues examined (liver, kidney, spleen , brain, lung, skeletal muscle, and bone) during the period 4 hours to 5 days post-dosing. Relative 32P concentration in the liver was far higher than in any other tissue from 4 hours to 5 days post-dosing, an d increased from 18.7 to 103.2 times the concurrent plasma 32P concentration. The greatest increase in relative 32P concentration during that period was seen in bone, from under twice to over 65 times the concurrent plasma concentration. Total radioactivity at 83 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 24 hours after a single oral dose was 19.3, 5.4,4.8, 2.9, 2.4, 2.2, 0.68, and 0.25 dpm(x10-5)/g in liver, kidney, bone, blood, spleen, lungs, skeletal muscle, and brain, respectively. In another acute exposure study, Lee et al. (1975) re ported that the distribution of radioactivity in these tissues was similar whether rats received a single dose or five daily doses. They measured total radioactivity at 24 hours after the last of five dail y doses to be 79.4,39.3,36.8,28.4,22.2, 17.7,5.9, and 2.6 dpm(xl0-5)/g in liver, kidney, bone, blood, lungs, spleen, skeletal muscle, and brain, respectively. Although the highest absolute level of radioactivity w as in the liver, the increase in radioactivity 24 hours after the last of the five daily doses compared to a single dose, was 10.5, 10.2,9.8, 8.7, 7.7,7.4,7.2, and 4.1 times the single-dose level in the brain, lungs, blood, skeletal muscle, bone, spleen, kidney, and liver, respectively. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding distribution in humans or animals after oral exposure to white phosphorus smoke or smoke condensates. 2.3.2.3 Dermal Exposure White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding distributio n in humans or animals after dermal (no burn) exposure to white phosphorus. No studies were located that quantify distributi on in humans or animals following exposure to white phosphorus by dermal burning. Human and animal se rum concentrations of phosphate following dermal white phosphorus burns are discussed in Section 2.3. 3 (Metabolism). Their relevance to white phosphorus distribution is unknown. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding distri bution in humans or animals after dermal exposure to white phosphor us smoke or smoke condensates. 2.3.2.4 Other Routes of Exposure White Phosphorus. Whitely et al. (1953) compared phosphorus (allotropic form not specified) uptake in viva by rabbit skin between areas of actively growing hair and areas where hair is not growing. Accumulation of 32P was measured in the skin only . Rabbits were administered 75 \u00b5Ci of 32P/kg body weight in 84 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS phosphate-buffered saline by intrave nous injection. Accumulation of 32P in the skin following intravenous injection was more rapid in areas with actively growing hair than in areas where hair was not growing, and the ratio of radioactivity between those areas increas ed with time after exposure, up to 72 hours post- dosing. The ratio of total radioactivity betw een the growing and quiescent areas as estimated by autoradiography was approximately 1.6 at 5 minutes (three rabbits), 2.4 at 1 hour (nine rabbits, 2.7 at 24 hours (four rabbits), and 3.4 at 72 hours (number of rabbits not reported). A similar pattern over time between the zones of hair growth was also observe d in the total radioactivity as calculated from liquid scintillation counter data. The ratio of total radioactivity between the grow ing and quiescent areas as estimated by scintillation counting (or electron flux calculated in part from counts per minute) was approximately 1.8 at 5 minutes, 2.3 at 1 hour, and 2.9 at 24 hours. In a more detailed examination of 32P distribution in rabbit skin, Whitely et al. (1953) examined the \"phosphate fractions\" of the skin following intravenous injection. The mean tissue concentration of total phosphate in nucleic acid is significantly greater in th e growing zone than in the quiescent zone (p<0.01), both in terms of weight (0.46 and 0.27 mg phosphate/g skin wet weight, respectively) and area (0.07 and 0.02 mg phosphate/cm3 skin, respectively). The mean tissue con centration of total acid-soluble phosphate was significantly greater in the growing zone than in the quiescent zone (p<0.0 l), only when expressed in terms of the area of skin exam ined (0.07 and 0.04 mg phosphate/cm3 skin, respectively). The difference between the growing and quiescent zones in terms of mean specific activity of total phosphate (counts per minute/mg phosphate; this appears to be a relative index of the fraction of total phosphate that is radiolabeled) grew over time in the nucleic acid fraction and decreased in the acid-soluble fraction. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding distribution in humans or animals after other routes of exposure to white p hosphorus smoke or smoke condensates. 2.3.3 Metabolism Studies that specifically address the metabolism of white phosphorus are very limited. Nothing is known about the enzymatic catalysis of white phosphorus. The inorganic chemistry of white phosphorus has been fully described, but its relevance in vivo has not been specifically addressed. White phosphorus is the most reactive allotropic fo rm of elemental phosphorus, combusting (oxidizing) spontaneously in the presence of oxygen to form P 4O10 and P 4O6 (Figure 2-3), which in turn are easily 85 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS hydrated to form oxo acids of phosphorus (Cotton and Wilkinson 1966). Orthophosphate (H 3PO 4) is the most prevalent oxo acid of phosphorus found in the blood (Guyton 1976). In turn, orthophosphate occurs in human serum in its monobasic (HPO 4-2) and dibasic (H 2PO 4) forms in a ratio of about 4: 1 (Tietz 1970). Blanke (1970) claims that phosphorus is slowly oxidized in the blood to hypophosphorous and phosphorous acids (hypophosphite and phosphite, respec tively), but does not cite a source, and does not address the problem of special thermal or pH c onditions. Hypophosphorous a nd phosphorous acids in turn may ultimately be oxidized (heat requirement not specified) to orthophosphate in the presence of water (Cotton and Wilkinson 1966). A variety of ot her higher oxo acids of phosphorus exist, such as pyrophosphates and polyphosphates (which are involved in bone formation) (Latner 1975), cyclic phosphates, and cyclic polyphosphates (Cotton and Wilkinson 1966). It is conceivable that any combination of these may be formed either prior to absorption, or in the blood as minor reaction products in the formation of orthophosphate from white phosphorus , although there is no solid evidence that these co-products are formed. White phosphorus also may be hydrolyzed in an al kaline aqueous environment with the addition of heat (see Figure 2-3) to give a mixture of hypophosph ite and phosphite, with hydrogen and phosphine, respectively, as co-products (Cotton and Wilkinson 1966). Hudson (1965) repor ts similar reactions, but does not mention that added heat is required, implying instead that a highly alkaline environment may drive the reaction. The jejunum of the mammalian gut may provide an appropriate environment for either of these reactions. Although the reactions forming these lower 0x0 acids of phosphorus seem unlikely to occur in human serum due to the extreme thermal or pH requirements, it is possible that enzymatic catalysis may occur. Indeed, there is some circ umstantial evidence suggesting that these reactions do occur in human blood. Phosphine is a co-product of the formation of phosphite (HP0 3-2) by alkaline hydrolysis of white phosphorus (Hudson 1965) and is a highly toxic gas. Phosphine can cause cardiac collapse (Blanke 1970), and severe cardiac problems have been observe d in several cases involving human ingestion of white phosphorus (see Section 2.2). It is also genot oxic in humans (Garry et al. 1989). An accidental death of a pregnant woman was related to phosphine exposure from stored grain which had been fumigated with aluminum phosphide (AIP 3) pellets (Garry et al. 1993). 87 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS In in vitro studies, phosphine decreased red blood cell or plasm a cholinesterase activity, and similar effects were seen in vivo in workers using phosphine fumigant (Potte r et al. 1993). Phosphine also reacted in vitro with intact red blood cells to form dense a ggregates of denatured hemoglobin known as \"Heinz bodies\" (Potter et al. 1991). No studies were located regarding metabolism in human s or animals after inhalation, dermal, or other routes of exposure to white phosphorus smoke or smoke condensates. White phosphorus smoke and condensates of the smoke probably contain some residual unburnt white phosphorus (see Chapter 3 for composition information). For further discussion of wh ite phosphorus metabolism, see Sections 2.3.3.1, 2.3.3.2, and 2.3.3.3 below. 2.3.3.1 Inhalation Exposure No studies were located that specifically address white phosphorus metabolism in humans or animals after inhalation exposure. However, since orthophosphate is a stable end-product of the inorganic oxidation and hydrolysis of white phosphorus, it is appropr iate to examine data on serum phosphate levels in humans and animals (these data are discussed further in Section 2.2). An epidemiology study (Hughes et al. 1962) co mpared the mean serum phosphate level of five occupationally-exposed phosphorus plant workers with the mean serum phosphate level of five healthy control men not exposed to phosphorus. The exposur e duration ranged from 1 to 17 years in the exposed group. Although the route of exposure was not reported, it is assumed to be inhalation of airborne phosphorus. It is likely that oral exposure (ingestion of airborne phosphorus) also occurred. The serum phosphorus levels of phosphorus plan t workers and controls were reported to be 2.85 and 2.9 mg/l00mL, respectively. Both values are below the normal range for adult humans of 3.0-4.5 mg/l00 mL (Harper 1969). There was no statistical difference between the wo rkers' and controls' serum phosphate levels (test and p value not reported). The serum phosphate level of a worker with phossy jaw was within the normal range of values for an adult human (Hughes et al. 1962). Excretion of phospha te via urinary and fecal routes was reported qualitatively to be approximately normal. The daily output of phosphorus in the feces was about l/4 to l/3 of the total output in both urine and feces. 88 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.3.3.2 Oral Exposure No studies were located that specifically addr ess white phosphorus metabolism in humans after oral exposure. However, since orthophosphate is a st able end-product of the inorganic oxidation and hydrolysis of white phosphorus, it is appropriate to examine data on serum phosphate levels in humans following oral ingestion of white phosphorus (these da ta are discussed further in Section 2.2). Although orthophosphate is the stable end-product, linear and cyclic phosphorus compounds do exist that are stable for relatively long periods, and these may be metabo lic blockers especially where phosphorus metabolism is on-going. Generally, there were no obvious patterns in human ser um phosphate level with respect to oral dose or time of measurement after ingestion. Many case reports of adults who intenti onally ingested rat poison containing white phosphorus are discussed in Section 2.2. Over 25 of these cases reported serum phosphate levels ranging from 1.2 to 8.6 mg/l00 mL 3 hours to 36 days after exposure. Twelve cases reported sufficient data to calculate oral doses, which ranged between 7.1 and 22.9 mg/kg/day. The normal serum concentrations of phosphate in adult humans are reported to range from 3.0 to 4.5 mg/l00 mL (Harper 1969). However, the doses in these adult suicide cases are confounded by the fact that virtually all the persons either vomited or were lavaged fairly soon after dos ing. At least 10 additional case reports involve children who accidentally ingested single unspecified doses of white phosphorus, or were administered phosphorus (between 0.095 and 0.212 mg/kg/day) (allotropic form not explicitly medicinally rickets for an intermediate dura tion. Serum phosphate leve ls following ingestion in children were similar to normal se rum phosphate levels in children [4.0-7.0 mg/l00 mL (Harper 1969)]. Limited quantitative and qualitative evidence of the metabolic fate of white phosphorus after acute oral exposure was located. In an acute oral study in rats with 32P-labeled white phosphorus, Lee et al. (1975) determined that urinary and fecal elimination rout es respectively accounted for 17.1% and 2%, 34.5% and 16.6%, and 46.7% and 33.0% of the administered dose at 4 hours, 1 day, and 5 days post-dosing, respectively. White phosphorus is insoluble in wate r, and about 96% of the phosphorus bound in urine is inorganic phosphate (Latner 1975). Based on this, it is reasonable to conclude that 20% of the administered white phosphorus is excreted as phosphate in urine within 4 hours post-dosing, showing that in viva metabolism of white phosphorus is extremely rapid. 89 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Lee et al. (1975) also qualitatively studied urinary metabolites of 32P-labeled white phosphorus in rats. They used thin-layer chromatography (TLC) at 4 and 24 hours after a single oral dose to show that radioactive urinary metabolites consisted of two classes of compounds. One of the compounds corresponded to inorganic phosphate, the other co mpound was less polar and suggested an organic phosphate, although the composition of this class of metabolites was not determined. TLC analysis of liver extract also showed two classes of compounds with similar properties. Since phosphate is a metabolite of the breakdow n of white phosphorus and since phosphate is incorporated into a variety of organic molecules, these biomolecules may be considered molecular successors (or secondary metabolites of white phosphorus ) and may provide information regarding the fate of white phosphorus after absorption. Ghoshal et al. (1 971) studied the effect of acute oral administration of white phosphorus in male Wistar rats on he patic microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase activity. The activity was reported as milligram inorganic phosphat e split from glucose-6-phosphate in 20 minutes per equivalent gram of microsomes. Glucose-6- phosphatase activity was and 39% (p<0.01%; n=6) over control values at 12 and 24 hours post-dosing, respectively. Activity was not significantly different from controls at 4 hours post-dosing (p value not reported; n=6). 2.3.3.3 Dermal Exposure No studies were located regarding metabolism in hum ans or animals after dermal (no burn) exposure to white phosphorus. No studies were located that specifically address white phosphorus metabolism in humans or animals following dermal white phosphorus burns. However, orthophosphate is a stable end-product of the oxidation and hydrolysis of white phosphorus. Thus, it is appropriat e to examine data on serum phosphate and urinary phosphate in humans and animals following dermal white phosphorus burns (these data are discussed further in Section 2.2). Serum phosphate was reported in three human cases of dermal white phosphorus bu rn following explosion of incendiary munitions. Serum phosphate ranged between 1.34 and 8.7 mg/l00 mL. The normal range of adult human semm phosphate is 3.0-4.5 mg/l00 mL (Harper 1969). No patterns with respect to burn intensity or time after exposure were evident. 90 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Urinary phosphate was measured in eight human cases of dermal white phosphorus burn following explosion of incendiary munitions. It was not possible to estimate doses. The rate of urinary phosphate excretion varied widely, ranging between 0.08 and 5.83 g/day. The normal adult human output of inorganic phosphate in urine is 0.34-1.0 g/day (Henry 1967). In five of these cases, levels were measured daily for up to 27 of the first 30 days post-exposure . Overall, the rate of urinary excretion of phosphate was not related to the percent of the area of body burne d, the percent of the body with third-degree burns, the survival of the patients, or the time after exposure. In a series of controlled studies using rats (Appl ebaum et al. 1975; Ben-Hur and Applebaum 1973; Ben- et al. 1972) significant increases (p<0.01) in 72-hour serum phosphate ranging from 100% to 120% over controls were observed. Anesthetized animals we re burned in inguinal inci sions after application of 26-200 mg/kg white phosphorus. Anesthetized rabbits were burned on intact skin with 5,700 mg/kg white phosphorus (Bowen et al. 1971). Those that died after white phosphorus burns showed significant (p<0.001) increases in serum phosphate levels over pre-burn levels. The pr e-burn levels ranged between 4.5 and 5.5 mg/l00 mL, and postexposure levels measured at 12 hours to 3 days range d between 6.5 and 10.5 mg/l00 mL. Phosphate levels in phosphorus-burned animals that su rvived remained normal throughout the study. 2.3.4 Excretion 2.3.4.1 Inhalation Exposure White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding excre tion in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. Human urinary excretion of phosphate (relevance to absorption of white phosphorus is unknown) following inhalation exposure is discussed in Section 2.3.3 (Metabolism). White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding excretion in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke. 91 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.3.4.2 Oral Exposure White Phosphorus. No studies were located that specifically address white phosphorus excretion in humans after oral exposure However, two animal studies (Cameron and Patrick 1966; Lee et al. 1975) indicate rapid urinary and fecal excretion of white phosphorus, metabolites, or unabsorbed inorganic breakdown products. Lee et al. (1975) measured urinary and fecal elimination of 32P in rats after oral administration of labeled white phosphorus. The total radioactivity excreted in urine and feces was assessed in three different groups of rats sacrificed at 4 hours or 1 or 5 days after dosing. Total excretion of 32P was far higher via the urinary route by 4 hours post-dosing. Excretion of 32P via the fecal route increased rapidly between 4 hours and 5 days post-dosing. By 5 days post-dos ing, combined urinary and fecal excretion accounted for 80% of the administered dose of 32P. Cameron and Patrick (1966), showed that radioactivity in the urine of rabbits at 48 hours post-dosing was five times the level observed in the blood, while radi oactivity in the feces of rabbits, rats, and mice was higher than the tissue concentration in the bowel by a factor of = 13. 2.3.4.3 Dermal Exposure White Phosphoras. No studies were located regarding excretion in humans or animals after derrnal (no burn) exposure to white phosphorus. No studies were located regarding excretion in animals after derrnal burn exposure to white phosphorus. Human urinary excretion of phosphate (relevance to absorption is unknown) following dermal burn exposure is discussed in Section 2.3.3 (Metabolism). White Phosphorza Smoke. No studies were located regarding excretion in humans or animals after dermal exposure to white phosphor us smoke or smoke condensates. 92 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 2.4 MECHANISMS OF ACTION No quantitative information on absorption, distributio n, metabolism, and excretion of white phosphorus following inhalation, oral, dermal, and dermal burn exposure was located. Studies in which 32P-labeled white phosphorus was orally administered to animals demonstrated that the label was widely distributed throughout the body, with some of the highest concentrations in the liver, kidney, blood, spleen, and brain (Cameron and Patrick 1966; Lee et al. 1975). Liver damage in animals exposed to white phosphor us progresses rapidly. Four hours after receiving a single oral dose of white phosphorus, minimal fatty changes in hepatocytes were observed; by 12 hours fatty changes were extensive (Ghoshal et al. 1969) . Exposure to white phosphorus has been shown to damage the rough endoplasmic reticulum and cause a disaggregation of polyrib osomes (Ganote and Otis 1969; Pam et al. 1972). This damage results in impairme nt of protein synthesis, in particular, a decrease in the synthesis of the apolipoprotein portion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are required for the transport of triglycerides. A significant decrease in protein synth esis has been detected as early as 3 hours after oral exposure (Barker et al. 1963). The sm ooth endoplasmic reticulum is also involved in the formation of the VLDLs, and damage to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum also impairs the formation of VLDLs. The net result of these ultrastructural chang es is an accumulation of triglycerides in the liver (Ghoshal et al. 1969). This results in steatosis and fi brosis, which is one of the mechanisms involved in the hepatotoxicity of white phosphorus. The mech anism behind the damage to the endoplasmic reticulum is not known; also, it is not known whether white p hosphorus itself or a metabolite of white phosphorus is the damaging agent. In addition to these damages, white phosphorus or a metabolite causes damage to the mitochondria and nuclei in the livers of animals ora lly exposed to white phosphorus (Ghoshal et al. 1969). The damage to the mitochondria may impair the cell's ability to produce ATP, thus resulting in necrosis of the cell. Fatty infiltration and/or cellular damage has also b een observed in the kidney, brain, and hear& It is possible that white phosphorus (or a metabolite) also im pairs the ability of cells in these organs to produce ATP. The mitochondrial damage may also inhibit fatt y acid oxidation (also contributing to the decreased availability of ATP) which could result in an accumulation of fat in the organs. Normal growth of long bones involves bone depo sition and bone resorpti on. Bone deposition during growth, also known as endochondral ossification, in volves the formation of osseous tissue (bony tissue) 93 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS with cartilage. In long bones, endochondral ossifi cation is seen at the epiphyseal cartilage plate by formation of bone trabeculae on a frame work of unr esorbed cartilage, by the action of osteoblasts. The trabeculae extend out from the epiphy sis towards the diaphysis or shaf t of the bone. The trabeculae and cartilage make up an intercellular calcified cartila ge framework. The area of the bone containing this framework is the metaphysis or metaphyseal zone. Normal bone growth involves the resorption of intercellular calcified cartilage matrix, which is left when the cartilage cells are released and disappear on the diaphyseal side of the epiphyseal cartilage plate. Normally a large percentage of this matrix is reabsorbed, leaving only a few spicules on which bo ne is deposited. The process of tubulation (or formation of the tube in a growing bone) is dependent on the peripheral and central resorption of metaphyseal bone and cartilage. Additio nal new bone is deposited only in the portion designed to become the cortex of the shaft (Guyton 1981). The effects of orally administered phosphorus on gr owth of the long bones has been well documented in the animal literature, and to a lesser extent in hum ans. Phosphorus apparently decreases the absorption of intercellular calcified cartilage matrix by osteoclasts, in the metaphyseal region of growing bones. Administration of phosphorus to growing animals or children produces \"phosphorus bands\" of increased bone density and thickness that are visible grossl y or from radiograms are observed in the metaphyseal region of growing bones, and represent areas of decreased absorption of the calcified cartilage matrix. Histological examination of \"phos phorus bands\" in young, growing rabbits revealed decreased size of epiphyseal cartilage plate, as well as increased density in the metaphyseal zone, with trabeculae that were greater in number and extended further into the diaphysis, compared to a control rabbit (Adams and Sat-t-tat 1940). The trabeculae were associated with a greater amount of calcified cartilage matrix. Growing rats exposed to phosphorus had widening of the metaphyseal trabeculae, broadened metaphysis, and a slightly convex lateral contour of the proximal tibia, compared to a control group (Whalen et al. 1973). Osteocytes were small and elongated compared to those in the contro l group, and osteocytic osteolysis and chondrolysis were decreased or missing. Metaphyseal trabeculae extended deeper into the diaphysis than seen in controls. These effects probably resulted from decrea sed bone resorption during bone growth, resulting in widening trabeculae and a denser metaphysis. B ecause normal growth of the bone depends on the resorption of the calcified cartilage matrix, phosphorus decreases the rate of growth of long bones (Adams 94 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 1938a, 1938b; Adams and Samat 1940). These \"phosphorus bands\" were not observed in an adult rabbit or at repaired fracture sites in long bone (Adams 1938b). The mechanism of action of white phosphorus on the oral cavity has been determined primarily from human occupational studies. The condition progresses slowly and has only been observed in workers exposed for intermediate or chronic durations (H einmann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Kennon and Hallam 1944). It is likely that the effect of phosphorus in the oral cavity is local, resulting from contact of \"inhaled\" phosphorus particles with tissue in the m outh. Rats exposed to the atmosphere in a phosphorus factory displayed progressive histopathological de generation of the oral mucosa, reported as pronounced after only 4 months of exposure (Ruzuddinov and Ry s-Uly 1986). The oral mucosa of occupationally exposed workers has been describ ed as having a dull, red, unhealthy appearance (Hughes et al. 1962; Kennon and Hallam 1944). These effects on the oral mucosa may result from the general irritant effects of white phosphorus. The conditio n usually begins with the extraction of one or more teeth, poor healing of the socket, followed by necrosis of tissue in th e jaw with severe pain and infection (Heinmann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Kennon and Hallam 1944). Tooth loss is thought to contribute to the condition, by exposing the bone in the socket to the irritant effect s of white phosphorus. It is not known whether tooth loss (possibly related to poor dental hygiene) precedes the condition, or whether the tooth loss is the result of white phosphorus exposure. It is also not known whether phosphorus ingested and absorbed into the systemic circulation contributed to the development of this condition known as phossy jaw. Evidence exists that long bones of occupationally exposed wo rkers fracture more easily under stress, suggesting a systemic effect of white phosphorus on bones. 2.5 RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Phosphorus is found in every cell of the body, but mo st of it (about 80% of the total) is combined with calcium as Ca 3(PO 4)2 in the bones and teeth (Harper 1969; Ti etz 1970). Phosphorus is present in cells mainly as organic phosphate, with a small amount in serum as inorganic phosphate (Tietz 1970). Phosphorus is involved in the intermediary me tabolism of carbohydrates (Tietz 1970). About 10% is found in combination with proteins, phospholipids, and carbohydrates and in other compounds in the blood and muscle (Harper 1969). The remaining phosphor us is widely distributed in various chemical compounds such as nucleic acids, nucleotides, a nd adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (Tietz 1970). 95 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The metabolism of phosphorus (P) is la rgely related to that of calcium (Ca). The Ca:P ratio in the diet affects the absorption and excretion of these el ements (Harper 1969). Any increase in serum phosphorus results in a decrease of serum calcium by mechan isms which are still unknown. For example, increased serum phosphorus levels and decreased serum calcium levels are seen in uremia (renal retention of phosphorus), hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia (decreased serum calcium and hyperphosphatemia (increased serum phosphorus levels), and the reve rse is seen in hypercalcemia (increased serum calcium levels) and hyperparathyroidism. Hypophos phatemia (low serum phosphorus levels) is seen in ricketts (vitamin D deficiency) (Harper 1969; Tietz 1970). The recommended ratio of phosphorus to calcium is 1:1, except in infants it is 2:1. For older infants, the recommended intake of phosphorus is increased to 80% of the calcium requirement, so that the ratio is similar to cow's milk (Harper 1969). Both phosphorus and calcium are distributed similarly in foods, hence a sufficient intake of calcium ensures a sufficient intake of phosphorus. The exception is cows' milk, which contains more phosphorus than calcium (Harper 1969). The adult daily requirement for phosphorus is about 700 mg. A ba lanced diet provides sufficient amounts of phosphorus because it is commonly found in foods (phosphoproteins and phosphol ipids, inorganic phosphate), especially milk and milk products, wheat, meats and fish (Latner 1975) . In the body, normal serum (inorganic) phosphorus are 4-7 mg/l00 mL in children and 34.5 mg/l00 mL in adults and the elderly. In body fluids and tissues, normal serum phosphorus levels found are 40, 170-250, 360, and 22,600 mg/l00 mL in blood, muscle, nerve, and both bones and teeth, respectively (Harper 1969; Tietz 1970). White Phosphorus. White phosphorus does not naturally occur in the environment. It has been manufactured in the past for use in such products as matches, fireworks, pest poisons, and incendiary munitions. It is primarily in the manufacture a nd use of these products where human exposure has occurred. White phosphorus is also commonly called yellow phosphorus. Chemically, white phosphorus is an allotropic form of elemental phosphorus containing four phosphorus atoms. It is a solid at room temperature and may be stored as a solid in water without breaking down or significantly dissolving, yet it is soluble in oils and lipids. It is unstable in air, either volatilizing or spontaneously cornbusting at room temperature. Oxidized inorganic forms of phosphorus include phosphorus pentoxide, which is a known hygroscopic compound. The oxidized forms of phosphorus are also reactive, forming various higher oxo acids in th e presence of water, and various lower oxo acids in an alkaline aqueous environment with the addition of heat. 96 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Biologically, white phosphorus is highly lipid-soluble indicating that it is probably absorbed easily via all routes of exposure, although this has not yet been demonstrated. Most of the absorbed white phosphorus is then probably quickly broken down by some of the inorganic reactions described above. White phosphorus is highly toxic. Pe ople have attempted suicide by ingesting matches, fireworks, roach poison, or rat poison containing white phosphorus. Unless emergenc y poison treatments are applied within 2-3 hours, death is likely. Animal data are c onsistent with human data after acute oral exposure. Further, a life-threatening condition called phossy jaw has been described following intermediate or chronic occupational exposure to white phosphorus. Systemic effects following oral ingestion in humans a nd animals usually begin with severe gastrointestinal distress within several hours, probably due to extreme irritation of the gastrointestinal lining. This may be followed during the next 3 weeks by life-threatening organ impairments that are manifested by severe cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematological, and ne urological effects. Respiratory, dermal, ocular, reproductive, and immunological effects have genera lly not been severe after acute oral exposure. Histological changes in the mucous membranes of the mouth and susceptibility to death among pregnant females during birth are also possible following longer term exposure. Similar systemic effects have been observed fo llowing dermal white phosphorus-induced burns. This route of exposure also inflicts 2nd and 3rd degree burns that may be slow to heal. White Phosphorus Smoke. There is limited information on the to xicity of white phosphorus smoke. Based on this information, the respiratory tract a ppears to be the most sensitive target. Because white phosphorus smoke contains a number of phosphorus compounds and a small amount of white phosphorus, the toxicity of white phosphorus smoke cannot be extrapolated from human and animal studies involving exposure to white phosphorus. Minimal Risk Levels for White Phosphorus Inhalation MRLs No MRLs have been derived for inhalation exposure to white phosphor us because none of the inhalation studies reported exposure levels. 97 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Oral MRLs An MRL of 2x10-4 mg/kg/day has been derived for intermediate-duration oral exposure to white phosphorus based on a NOAEL of 0.015 mg/kg/day (IRDC 1985). 0.075 mg/kg/day (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985). At this dose level, there were significant increases in mortality during late pregnancy and parturition (Bio/dynamic 1991; 1991). The study also identified a NOAEL of 0.075 mg/kg/day for systemic, developmental, and reproductive effects, and the Bio/dynamics (1991) study identified a NOAEL of 0.075 mg/kg/day for developmental and re productive effects. At first examination, it appeared that no intermediate oral MRL could be derived because the lowest dose indicated in Table 2-2 was 0.075 mg/kg/day, which was associated with increased mortality in pregnant rats in two reproductive studies one by Bio/dynamics (1991) and one by IRDC (1985). However, in the IRDC (1985) study, 0.075 mg/kg/day was a NOAEL for systemic end points (Table 2-2); therefore, the lower doses in the study did not appear in the LSE table. Further examination of the study revealed no effects in rats at lower doses of 0.005 and 0.015 mg/kg/da y. Therefore, the 0.015\u00ad mg/kg/day dose, which was not associated with in creased mortality and produced no other effects, was the NOAEL for the intermediate database. In the Bio/dynamics (1991) study, only the 0.075\u00ad mg/kg/day dose was used, which in addition to increased mortality, was associated with hepatic toxicity (Table 2-2). Therefore, the critical end poi nt is hepatic. It should be noted that the MRL was actually based on a NOAEL of 0.015 mg/kg/day since 0.075 mg/kg/day was associated with effects the Biojdynamics (1991) stud y. The resultant intermediate MRL would be 2x10 -4 mg/kg/day. It was noted that the EPA derived an RfD from the same NOAEL of 0.015 mgikg/day in the same study. The lowest LOAEL value (0.083 mg/kg/day) in healthy humans ingesting white phosphorus for an intermediate duration was identified in the Sont ag (1938) study. Lower LOAEL values have been identified in children with rickets (Phemist er 1918). Because these children had a pre-existing condition, these data were not considered reliable. Other systemic effects and neurological effects were observed at this dose. This study was not selected as the basis of an intermediate-duration oral 98 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS MRL because it is a case report of a single child and no assessment of hepatic or renal toxicity (liver and kidneys are two primary targets of white phosphorus toxicity) was made. No acute oral MRL could be derived for exposure to white phosphorus. A number of case reports of individuals accidentally or inten tionally ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus identified LOAEL values for gastrointestinal effects. No NOAEL valu es were identified in the human studies. The lowest LOAEL value for systemic and reproductive effects identified in humans was 2 mg/kg/day (Harm and Veale 1910); however, this is a lethal dose. The lowest LOAEL values in animals were 0.2 mg/kg/day for impaired liver function in dogs (Sigal et al. 1954) and 0.3 mg/kg/day for developmental effects in rabbits (Adams 1938a); both studies reported data for a sma ll number of animals. No acute oral MRL could be derived because serious effects (impaired liver functi on) occurred in dogs at 0.2 mg/kg/day, the lowest dose in the acute oral database. No chronic-duration MRL for oral exposure to wh ite phosphorus could be derived. Information on exposure levels was not reported in the human chronic-duration studies. A LOAEL value of 0.2 mg/kg/day was identified in a chronic dog study for skeletal effects (Fleming et al. 1942). However, this study was not selected as the basis for a chronic-duration oral MRL because the study authors did not specify which organs were examined, and thus it is not known whether the liver and kidneys (two primary targets of white phosphorus toxicity) were examined. In addition, this LOAEL value is higher than the intermediate LOAEL value for increased mortality in pregnant dams (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985). Minimal Risk Levels fo r White Phosphorus Smoke Inhalation MRLs An MRL of 0.02 mg/m3 has been derived for acute-duration inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke from a minimal LOAEL of 187 mg/m3 for 5 minutes for throat irritation in humans (White and Armstrong 1935). Although a 5m inute exposure duration is usually too brief to consider for MRLs and expanding over a 24-hour period would result in an exposure level of 0.6 mg/m3, further experiments indicated exposure for longer durations would result in more severe effects. In the field, white phosphor us smoke was generated at 0.1 mg/m3 to protect soldiers from detection. In addition, the OSHA PEL is 0.1 mg/m3. Therefore, expanding the 5minute duration over 24 hours is reasonable. 99 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The acute toxicity of airborne white phosphorus smoke has been studied in humans and a number of animal species. The human exposure studies assessed respiratory toxicity only (Walker et al. 1947; White and Armstrong 1935). The animal exposure studi es were primarily lethality studies (Brown et al. 1980; White and Armstrong 1935). In the Brown et al. (1980) study, rats and guinea pigs were killed 2 weeks after the single exposure, and a sm all number of animals were examined. The White and Armstrong (1935) study examined a limited numbe r of end points in rats, mice, and goats which died during or after exposure. The human and animal studies suggest that the respiratory tract is the most sensitive end point of toxicity; however, b ecause of study limitations, other sensitive end points cannot be eliminated. No intermediate-duration inhalati on MRL was derived. Only one intermediate-duration inhalation study was identified. In this study, rats were exposed to several concentrations of white phosphorus smoke for 15 minutes/day (Brown et al. 1981). The study suggests that the respiratory tract is the most sensitive end point of toxicity. No chronic-duration inhalation exposure studies were located; therefore, an MRL for chronic-duration exposure to white phosphorus smoke could not be derived. Death White Phosphorus. White phosphorus is highly toxic via the oral route. Many case reports of deaths resulting from intentional or accidental ingestion of white phosphorus in rat and cockroach poison and firecrackers were located (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950, 1961; Dwyer and Pickering 1976; 1932; Winek et al. 1973). The classical progression of symptoms from fatal oral white phosphorus poisoning in humans involves three stages (McCarron et al. 1981). Symptoms in the first stage include vomiting (with vomitus sometimes containing blood a nd/or pieces of the gastric mucosa) and extreme abdominal cramps and pain. These symptoms probably result from the extreme irritant effects of white phosphorus on the gastrointestinal lining. In the second stage the patient improves symptomatically and appears to be recovering. The thir d stage usually consists of a rapid decline in condition, with death resulting from failure of one or more orga n systems, usually the liver, kidney, and cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Autopsy often reveals massi ve damage to one or more of these organ systems 100 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1961; Dwyer Wechsler 1951; Wertham 1932). Not all cases of fatal white phosphorus poisoning follow the cl assic scenario. Death from cardiac arrest may occur rapidly (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1961). Because vomiting often expels much of the ingested dose, the effective dose usually cannot be estimated. In one case report, a woman ingested a fatal dose of white phosphorus, but did not expel the ingested dose before dying (Hann and Veale 1910). In this case the ingested dose (2 mg/kg/day) probably approximates the effective dose producing death. This study identifies a LOAEL of 2 mg/kg/day for a single oral dose of white phosphorus in humans. No deaths occurred in children receiving daily doses of 0.158 mg/kg/day for intermediate dur ations (Compere 1930a; Phemister 1918; Sontag 1938). No studies were located regarding death in humans after chronic oral exposure to white phosphorus. Longer term occupational exposure to white phosphorus can result in a condition (phossy jaw) that is potentially life-threatening. Two white phosphorus-related deaths were reported in a study of 71 workers from three plants involved in the production of fi reworks (Ward 1928). Both workers developed phossy jaw, a degenerative condition affecting the soft tissue, bones, and teeth of the oral cavity, after chronic exposure to the atmosphere at the factory. It is likely that white phosphorus-related necrosis results from a direct local effect following contact of phosphorus with tissues in the oral cavity. The cause of death in both cases was listed as septicemia, with abscess of a t ooth and necrosis of the jaw listed as contributory causes. Thus, death in both cases resulted from infecti ons, probably secondary to the degenerative effects of white phosphorus on the oral cavity (Ward 1928). Animal data support the acute oral toxicity of white phosphorus. Mortality rates of 20% were reported for rats (Lee et al. 1975; Torrielli et al. 1974) an d mice (Hurwitz 1972) exposed to single gavage doses ranging from 3 to 6 mg/kg phosphorus, compared to the LOAEL of 2 mg/kg identified in the case report of a woman intentionally ingesting rat poison (Ha nn and Veale 1910). In two one-generation reproduction studies in rats, 30-47% (IRDC 1985) and 53% (Bio/dynamics 1991) of the pregnant females treated by gavage with 0.075 mg/kg/day for an intermediate duration (145-204 days) died (or were killed due to morbidity) in late gestation or parturition. Dams expo sed to 0.015 mg/kg/day for similar durations did not have an increased mortality rate (IRDC 1985). Compound -related deaths were not observed in male rats exposed to 0.075 mg/kg/day for similar durations (IRDC 1985; Bio/dynamics 1991). The high mortality rates in pregnant rats may indicate a parturition-related sensitivity to the toxic effects of white phosphorus. Upon histopathological evaluation of selected tissues (heart, liver, kidneys, uterus, ovaries, and 101 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS testes/epididymides), the only finding considered treatment related was an increased incidence of centrilobular liver necrosis in 8/30 treated females (Bio/dynamics 1991). No studies were located regarding death in animals after inhalation or dermal (nonburn) exposure to white phosphorus. Information that was located regarding the contribu tion of white phosphorus to death after acute white phosphorus-induced burns suggests a possible differe nce between humans and animal models. A high rate of mortality (l2/27) in humans occurred following acci dental explosions from ignited white phosphorus in munitions factories (Walker et al. 1947). The workers that died had third-degree burns over 35-90% of their body surface. Those surviving had burns over 19% of the body surface. The authors noted that these burn cases followed a course that was \"indistinguishable\" from that of nonphosphorus related third- degree burns. The contribution of white phosphor us to the increased mortality is not known. In animal studies using experimental white phos phorus burns, there is evidence that phosphorus compounds remaining in the burn site may contribute to the increased mortality. Experimental burns with white phosphorus have resulted in abnormal EKGs in rabbits (Bowen et al. 1971) and extensive renal and hepatic damages in rats (Ben-Hur et al. 1972; Ben-Hur and Appelbaum 1973). Increased mortality in these studies was attributed to the systemic effect s of white phosphorus or phosphorus compounds, rather than to the toxicity of the burn. White phosphorus is probably absorbed to a much greater degree from severe burns than from normal dermal exposure. White Phosphorus Smoke. No deaths were reported in human s inhaling white phosphorus smoke at concentrations as high as 592 mg phosphorus pentoxide equivalents/m3 (817 mg orthophosphoric pentoxide equivalents/m3 (709 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) for 15 minutes (White and Armstrong 1935). In animals exposed to white phosphorus smoke, deaths have been observed following acute- a nd intermediate-duration inhalation exposure or acute oral exposure. The lowest lethal concentrations identified in animals exposed once to white phosphorus smoke are 1,943 mg orthophos phoric acid equivalents/m3 for rats (Brown et al. 1980), 310 mg phosphorus pentoxide equivalents/m3 (428 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) for mice (White and Armstrong 1935), 677 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for guinea pigs (Brown et al. 1980), and 6,230 mg phosphorus pentoxide equivalents/m3 (8,599 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) for goats (White and Armstrong 1935). Similar lethal concentrations (1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) were 102 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS observed in rats exposed to white phosphorus smoke 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 6-13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981; Starke et al. 1982). For the most part, the cause of death was not determined. An exception is the mouse acute exposure study. A thic k mucous discharge was observed in the nares of dying mice. This discharge plugged the nares, and the mice died of asphyxiation (White and Armstrong 1935). For the other species tested, the most prominent nonlethal effect was moderate-to-severe respiratory tract irritation. It is possible that the respiratory tract damage was severe enough to be life- threatening. Based on this information on deaths in animals, it is likely that exposure to high concentrations of white phosphorus smoke would be fatal to humans. Systemic Effects Respiratory Effects White Phosphorus. In a study of 71 humans occupationally exposed to fumes/vapors and paste containing white phosphorus for intermediate or chronic durations, an irritating cough was reported as occurring in a large proportion of the employees (Ward 1928). No quantitative information was provided. No information on respiratory effects was reporte d in other occupational exposure studies (Heinmann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Kennon and Hallam 1944). White phosphorus has an irritating effect on other soft tissues, including the oral mucosa and gastroint estinal tract. Thus, inhalation of white phosphorus might be expected to produce irritation in the tissue of the lungs. No studies were located regarding respiratory eff ects in animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. Various changes in respiration were reported in hum ans following intentional or accidental ingestion of life-threatening doses of white phosphorus. During the initial stage following oral white phosphorus poisoning, the patient is usually anxious and in a great deal of pain. Increases are observed in many vital signs, including respiratory rate (Hann and Veale 1910; Rao and Brown 1974; Simon and Pickering et al. 1972; Winek et al. 1973). Rales have been reported in several cases of serious white phosphorus poisoning (Dwyer and Helwig and Wechsler 1951). If the condition worsens, the patient often becomes comatose and may display decreased, 103 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS shallow respirations (Rubitsky and Myerson 1949) or Cheyne-Stokes respiration (Wechsler and 195 1). Autopsy has revealed pulmonary damage incl uding a small amount of dark fluid in the pleural cavity (Hann and Veale 1910), pulmonary congestion and 1951), hemorrhagic and tracheal ep ithelium and cartilage (Humphreys and Halpert 1931). Death from cardiopulmonary failure was reported followi ng ingestion of white phosphorus in rat poison (Simmon and Pickering 1976; Winek et al. 1973); however, the pulmonary effect was probably secondary to cardiovascular failure. Death due to acute oral wh ite phosphorus poisoning is generally attributed to organ systems other than the respiratory tract (Diaz- Rivera et al. 1961; Dwyer and No treatment-related microscopic cha nges were observed in the lungs of rats exposed to 0.2 mg/kg/day white phosphorus in the diet for a chronic duration (Fleming et al. 1942) or 0.075 mg/kg/day white phosphorus by gavage for an intermediate duration (IRDC 1985). Heavy breathing and apnea were reported following ingestion of a fatal quantity of white phosphorus by a cat (Frye and Cucuell969). Necropsy revealed hyperemia, hemorrhage, and edema in the lungs. No studies were located regarding respiratory e ffects following dermal exposure, both for burn and nonburn. White Phosphorus Smoke. Respiratory tract irritation has been observed in humans exposed to white phosphorus smoke for 2-15 minutes. Throat irritati on during talking, coughing, nose irritation, and erythema and edema of the larynx and vocal cords have been reported (Walker et al. 1947; White and Armstrong 1935). Respiratory tract irritation has been observed at concentrations of 187 mg phosphorus pentoxide equivalents/m 3 (258 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) for 5 minutes or longer (White and Armstrong 1935). Damage to the respiratory tract has also been observed in animals exposed to white phosphorus smoke for acute and in termediate durations. Slight-to- intense congestion, edema, and hemorrhages were observed in the lungs of rats, mice, and goats dying during or following a l-hour exposure to concentrations of 1,350,470, a acid equivalents/m3) (White and Armstrong 104 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 1935) and rats exposed to 3,027 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 90 minutes (Brown et al. 1980). Exposure to 1,742 mg or thophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks resulted in minimal-to-sev ere interstitial pneumonia in rats (Brown et al. 1981). In addition to these effects in the lungs, slight tracheitis and lar yngitis has been observed in rats exposed to 884 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 6-13 weeks. The severity of these effects on the trachea and larynx increased at hi gher concentrations (Brown et al. 1981). Dermal studies examining the respiratory tract were not located. Because the respiratory tract effects observed following inhalation exposure to white phosphorus smoke are probably the result of direct contact with the respiratory tissue, it is not likely that similar respiratory tract effects would be observed following dermal exposure. Cardiovascular Effects White Phosphorus. Effects on the myocardium have been observed in humans exposed to a single oral dose of white phosphorus, humans exposed to mo lten phosphorus, and rabbits burned by phosphorus. Alterations in electrocardiogram readings, tachycardia, arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, and decreased ventricular contractility have been observed in human s orally exposed to white phosphorus or burned by phosphorus (Dathe and et al. 1948; Pietras et al. 1968; Rao and Brown Pickering 1976; Summerlin et al. 1967; Talley et al. 1972) and rabbits burned by white phosphorus (Bowen et al. 1971). These alterations may be due to a direct effect on the heart as evidenced by the fatty infiltration, necrosis, cross st riations, and interstitial edema that have been observed in the hearts of affected individuals (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1961; Dwyer and W echsler Wertham 1932) or may be secondary to peripheral vascular collapse that can cause a decrea se in the coronary blood flow resulting in severe myocardial ischemia. Longer-term human studies did not examine cardiac end points. No evidence of myocardial damage were observed in rats orally exposed to relatively low concentrations of white phosphorus (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985). Effects on the vascular system have also been observed in humans and animals. One of the more prominent effects following acute human exposure to wh ite phosphorus is shock, manifested by a marked decrease in blood pressure, vascular co llapse, marked decrease in pulse, cyanotic nail beds, cold clammy skin, and cardiopulmonary arrest (Caley and Kellock 1955; Dathe and Nathan 1946; Diaz-Rivera 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 1950,196l; Dwyer and Helwig 1925; Wechsler 1951; Winek et al. 1973). The mechanism involved in the development of shock in these individuals is not known. Hemorrhaging in internal organs as well as the appearance of petechia l hemorrhages on the skin have been reported in a number of acute human exposure cases (Harm and Veal e 1910; Humphreys and Halpert 1931; Winek et al. 1973). In addition, an increase in permeability of capillary walls and lesions in the walls of blood vessels have been observed in the mouth of rats exposed for an intermediate duration to an unknown concentration of airborne phosphor us (Ruzuddinov and Rys-Uly 1986), and proliferation of the tunica intima and occlusion of the blood vessel lumen were observed in the cortical blood vessels of rabbits receiving intravenous injections of 15 mg/kg/day of white phosphorus for an intermediate duration (Ferraro et al. 1938). White Phosphorus Smoke. There is limited information on the pote ntial of white phosphorus smoke to induce cardiovascular effects in humans. No hu man exposure studies examining the cardiovascular system were located. No gross or histological altera tions were observed in the hearts of rats exposed to white phosphorus smoke at concentrations as high as 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). No dermal exposure studies examining the cardiovascular system were located. Gastrointestinal Effects White Phosphorus. No information on the gastrointestinal effects in humans or animals following inhalation, dermal, or dermal burn exposure is available. In humans acutely ingesting poisons containing white phosphorus, the most prominent gastrointes tinal effect was Wechsler 1951; Winek et al. 1973). Reported doses that induced vomiting ranged fro m 2 to 23 mg/kg/day. The vomiting usually started shortly after ingesting the white phosphorus and persisted for several days. Abdominal pain or cramps often accompanied the vomiting. The effects on th e gastrointestinal tract were probably due to the irritating effects of white phosphorus. This is suppor ted by the necrosis and erosion of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and jejunum (Wechsler and Wechsl er 1951) and the gastrointestinal hemorrhage WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 1932; Winek 1973) that have been observed in humans. Gastroin testinal effects have not been observed in children ingesting white phosphorus for an intermediate duration (Compere 1930a; Phemister 1918; Sontag 1938). Similar gastrointestinal effects have been observe d in animals ingesting white phosphorus. Vomiting was observed in dogs ingesting an unreported amount of white phosphorus (Dwyer and Helwig 1925) and erosion of the esophagus and stomach was observed in a cat ingesting a single dose (amount not reported) of phosphorus (Fry and Cucuel 1969). No gross or mi croscopic alterations were observed in rats exposed to a relatively low dose (0.075 mg/kg/day) of white phosphorus for an intermediate duration (IRDC 1985). White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding gast rointestinal effects in humans after exposure to white phosphorus smoke. No gross or hi stological evidence of gastrointestinal tract damage was observed in rats exposed to 1,7 42 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). No dermal exposure studies examining gastrointestinal effects were located. Hematological Effects White Phosphorus. Hematological effects have been observed in a number of individuals accidentally or intentionally ingesting white phosphorus containing poisons or fireworks. The effects on erythrocytes appear to be inconsistent. Increases and decrease s in erythrocyte levels, increases and decreases in hemoglobin levels, and anemia have been observed (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950; 1955; Simon and Pickering 1976). The changes in erythrocyte parameters may be a reflection of the hemorrhages ob served in a number of individuals (Datbe and Nathan 1946; Hann Wechsler 1951; Winek et al. 1973) or a compensatory mechanism because of tissu e anoxia. Anemia has also been observed in individuals occupationally exposed to airborne white phosphorus via inhalation, ingestion, an-d dermal contact (Ward 1928). Increases or decreases in the leve ls or percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) have been observed in individuals acutely exposed ingested white phosphorus (Diaz-Rivera al. 1948; Pietras et al. 1968). No hematological effects were observed in a number of individuals acutely exposed to phosphorus (Fletcher and Galambos 1963; Simon and Pickering 1976) or in a child exposed for an intermediate duration (Sontag 1938). 107 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Anemia, hemolysis, and leukocytosis have been observed in individuals burned by white phosphorus (Summerlin et al. 1967; Walker et al. 1947). Because copper sulfate is often used to treat white phosphorus burns, it is difficult to determine whethe r the anemia and hemolysis were due to copper or white phosphorus poisoning. A small number of the available animal studies have measured hematological effects. An increase in total leukocyte and monocyte levels were observed in guinea pigs acutely exposed to ingested white phosphorus (Lawrence and Huffman 1929) An increase in the levels of monocytes was also observed in guinea pigs receiving white phosphorus via subcutane ous injection for an acute duration (Lawrence and Huffman 1929). Hemosiderosis has b een observed in the spleens of rats subcutaneously exposed to 1.2 mg/kg/day for an acute duration, exposed to 0.8 mg/kg/day for an intermediate duration, and 0.05 mg/kg/day for a chronic duration (Fleming et al. 1942). White Phosphorus Smoke. Hematological end points were not examined in the three human exposure studies that were located (Walker et al. 1947; White and Armstrong 1935). No significant changes in erythrocyte, hematocrit, hemoglobin, or total and differential leukocyte levels were observed in rats exposed to 3,027 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m 3 for 90 minutes (Brown et al. 1980), guinea pigs exposed to 984 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 10 minutes (Brown et al. 1980), or rats exposed to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 of white phosphorus smoke for 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). No dermal exposure studies examining hematological effects were located. This information is not ade quate for determining the potential of white phosphorus smoke to induce hematological effects in humans. Musculoskeletal Effects White Phosphorus. White phosphorus produces two entirely di fferent effects on bone, depending on the type of exposure. Longer-term occupational exposure to airborne phosphorus can produce a degenerative condition (phossy jaw) affecting the entire oral cavity including soft tissue, teeth, and bones (Heimann 1946; Hughes et al. 1962; Ward 1928). The effects of phossy jaw can be extreme, involving severe necrosis of soft tissue, teeth, and bones in the oral cavity. Massive life-threatening infections often occur during the development of phossy jaw. The progressi on of the disease was similar in the cases described, usually beginning with the extraction of one or more teeth, poor healing of the socket, followed by necrosis of tissue in the jaw with severe pain and in fection. Treatment consisted of repeated removal of 108 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS destroyed bone tissue and teeth, draining of ab scesses, and reconstructive surgery. In severe cases, extensive removal of necrotic bone tissue led to permanent disfigurement. It is likely that the effect of white phosphorus in the oral cavity is local, resulting from contact of inhaled wh ite phosphorus particles with tissue in the mouth. Workers in phosphorus factories have oral mucosa described as having a dull, red, unhealthy appearance (Hughes et al. 1962). Placement of a white phosphorus pellet in the right mucobuccal cavity of a man employed as a magician, eventually (after 14 years) resulted in massive necrosis of the maxilla and floor of the antrum on th e right side of the mouth; perforations were present through which the maxillary sinus and nasal cavity were visible. No effects were observed on the left side of the maxilla or on the mandible. Radiographs revealed no evidence of pathology in the chest and long bones. The damage to the jaw was highly localized affecting only the side the mouth exposed to the pellet. Exposed bones, such as sockets following toot h extraction, may be especially susceptible to the irritating affects of white phosphorus. Thus, poor dental hygiene might be a contributing factor to the development of phossy jaw. It is not known whether white phosphorus ingested and absorbed into the systemic circulation contributed to the development of phossy jaw. There is evidence that occupational exposure to white phosphorus weakens the long bon es in the body, as indicated by fractures following minimal stress (Dearden 1899). Ingested white phosphorus does not affect the or al cavity. However, bone effects were observed in children (Compere 1930a; Phemister 1918; Sont ag 1938) 1938b; Adams and Surnat 1940; Whalen et al. 1973) follow ing acute- and intermediate -duration oral exposure to phosphorus. Because white phosphorus-re lated effects were observed in growing bones, these effects were considered developmental in nature a nd are described under Developmental Effects in Section 2.2.2.4. No studies were located regarding musculoskeletal effects in animals after inhalation exposure to white phosphorus. Chronic oral exposure to 0.2 mg/kg/day white phosphorus in the diet resulted in epiphyseal line thickening and greater extension of trabeculae into the diaphysi s of unspecified bones, compared to a control group (Fleming et al. 1942). This study is limited by the failu re to specify incidences of effects at intervals during dosing and by the failure to state the dosing duration explicitly. Thus, it is not known if these bone effects occurred in young or adult rats. 109 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding musculoskeletal effects in humans and animals after inhalation or dermal exposure to white phosphorus smoke. Hepatic Effects White Phosphorus. One of the primary targets of white phosphorus is the liver. Hepatotoxicity has been observed in humans orally exposed to white phosphorus and burned by white phosphorus and in animals exposed orally and parenterally and burned by wh ite phosphorus. No information on hepatotoxicity in animals following exposure to airborne white phosphorus was located. The following indicators of hepatic damage have been noted in humans acu tely exposed to white of bilirubin, impa ired liver function tests, and increases in AST and ALT (Caley and Kellock 1955; Diaz-Rivera Pickering 1976; Wechsler and Wechsler 1951). Autopsies or liver biopsies were performed in a number of these individuals, and marked liver dama ge was observed. Necrosis, fibrosis, hemorrhages and fatty infiltration were observed Fletcher and Wechsler 1951). Similar hepatic effects were observe d in humans burned by white phosphorus (Song et al. 1985; Summerlin et al. 1967; Walker et al. 1947). No alterations in liver function tests were observed in workers chronically exposed to an unreported am ount of airborne white phosphorus (Hughes et al. 1962). Although there is extensive information on the hepatotoxicity of white phosphorus in humans ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus, there is very limited information on dose-effect relationships. Most of the individuals vomited or received gastric lavage shortly after ingesting the white phosphorus; thus, reliable doses could not be calculated. No dose in formation is available for the inhalation, dermal, or dermal burn routes. Similar hepatic effects have been observed in animal s orally exposed for acute and intermediate durations (Ashburn et al. 1948; Ghoshal et al. 1969; ; Mallory 1933; Pani et al. 1972; Paradisi et al. al. 1991; Seakins and Robinson 1964; Sigal et al. 1954) and dermally burned with white phosphorus once (Ben-Hur et al. 1972; Ben-Hur and Appelbaum 1973). The lowest LOAEL value for hepatic effects identified in animals orally exposed to white phosphorus is 0.2 mg/kg/day (Sigal et al. 1954) for acute duration and 0.25 mg/kg/day (Mallory 1933) for intermediate duration. No NOAEL value 110 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS for acute oral exposure was identified. As discussed in Section 2.2.2.2, conflicting results in the Bio/dynamics (1991) and IRDC (1985) studies preclude identifying the 0.075 mg/kg/day dose as a NOAEL or LOAEL value. The lowest LOAEL value for dermal burn exposure is 29 mg/kg/day. No NOAEL values for dermal burn exposure were identified. Animal data provide information on the progression of the hepatic effects. Four hours after dosing, minimal hepatocytic fatty changes were observed; by 12 hours extensive hepatocytic fatty changes were observed (Ghoshal et al. 1969). The severity of the liver effects was duration related, with early signs of fibrosis being detected after 8 weeks of exposure and extensive fibrosis after 12 weeks (Peterson et al. 1991). The steatosis (fatty infiltration) observed in the livers of humans and animals is likely to be the result of impaired protein synthesis of the liver. One of the earliest signs of liver toxicity is a decrease in protein synthesis (Barker et al. 1963); the impaired prot ein synthesis is probably due to the damage to the rough endoplasmic reticulum and disaggregation of polyribosomes (Garro te and Otis 1969; Pani et al. 1972). The decrease in synthesis of apolipoproteins results in a decrease in the transport of triglycerides out of the liver. Twelve hours after ingestion of a single dose of white phosphorus, significant increases in liver triglyceride and decreases in plasma triglycerid e levels were observed (Ghoshal et al. 1969). The damage observed in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (site for conjugation of different components of lipoproteins) (Ganote and Otis 1969; Ghoshal et al. 1969) may also play a role in the decreased ability to remove triglycerides from the liver. Other damage in the liver (e.g., fibrosis) may be due to the ultrastructural changes that are observed in the mitochondr ia (focal matrical rarefaction, loss of cristae, and rupture of peripheral membranes) (Ghoshal et al. 1969). White Phosphorus Smoke. There is limited information on hepato toxicity following exposure to white phosphorus smoke. No human exposure studies examining hepatic end points were identified. In animals, cloudy swelling of the liver was observed following 60-90-minute exposures to 1,170 mg phosphorus pentoxide equivalents/m 3 (1,615 orthophosphoric Armstrong 1935) or 3,027 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 in rats (Brown et al. 1980), 470 mg phosphorus pentoxide equivalents/m3 (649 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) in mice (White and Armstrong 1935), and 7,320 mg phosphorus pent oxide equivalents/m3 (10,104 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) in goats (White and Armstrong 1935). Hepatic effects were not observed in rats exposed to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 6 or 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). No studies examining hepatic end points followi ng dermal exposure were located. 111 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Renal Effects White Phosphorus. No changes in urinary creatinine levels we re observed in workers exposed to an unspecified amount of airborne white phosphorus (H ughes et al. 1962). Evidence of severe renal effects have been observed in humans orally exposed to white phosphorus and burned by white phosphorus. In animals, renal effects have been observed following oral and dermal burn exposure. There is no information on the potential of white phosphorus to induce renal effects in humans dermally exposed to white phosphorus or animals exposed by inhalation and dermal routes. The presence of protein, albumin, and acetone in the urine and increases in blood levels of urea nitrogen, nonprotein nitrogen, and creatinine have been observed in individuals acutely ingesting rat (or roach) poisons or fireworks containing white phosphorus (Dathe and Nathan 1946; Diaz-Rivera Brown 1974; Rubitsky and Myerson 1949). These clinical symptoms suggest a severe decrease in rena l function. In addition to these indicators of renal function, histological damage consisting of fatty changes in the tubules and loop of Henle and engorged glomeruli and intratubular capillaries have been obser ved in humans acutely exposed to white phosphorus (Dwyer 1951; Wertham 1932). Several case reports have reported no alterations in kidney function (Ehrentheil 1957; Fletcher and Galambos 1963; Greenberger et al. 1964; Simon and Pi ckering 1976). Histological alterations have also been observed in a number of humans ingesting singl e dose of white phosphorus. Fatty changes tubules, loop sler and Wechsler 195 1) have been observed. Indicators of impaired renal function (increased blood urea nitrogen, and increased urinary protein and urea nitrogen) have also been observed in humans acutely burned by white phosphorus (Song et al. 1985; Summerlin et al. 1967; Walker et al. 1947). No longer-term human oral or dermal burn studies examining renal effects were located. Histological alterations in the kidneys have been ob served in animals acutely ingesting white phosphorus and burned by white phosphorus. Fatt y infiltration in the nephron and subcapsular hemorrhages were observed in dogs orally exposed to an unspecified amount of white phosphorus (Dwyer and Helwig 1925). Necrosis and vascular degeneration of the proximal tubule and ischemic changes in the glomerulus were observed in animals burned once with 29-200 mg/kg/day white phosphorus (Appelbaum et al. 1975; Ben\u00ad 112 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Hur and Appelbaum 1973; Ben-Hur et al. 1972). Evid ence of impaired renal function (increased blood urea nitrogen levels, excessive diuresis, oliguria, decr eased creatinine clearance) ha ve also been observed in animals burned with white phosphorus (Ben-Hur et al. 1972). No renal effects were observed in rats exposed to 0.075 mg/kg/day for an intermediate duration (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985). No chronic oral exposure studies or intermediate and chroni c dermal burn exposure studies examining the renal system were located. The mechanism of action of white phosphorus on the kidney is not known. Changes in the integrity of blood vessels have been observed in humans and an imals exposed to phosphorus (see Cardiovascular discussion). It is possible that changes in the glom emlar capillaries allow protein from the blood to enter the glomemlar filtrate. The mechanism behind the necrosis in the proximal tubules is not known. These data suggest that the kidneys are one of the primary targets of white phosphorus toxicity. It is likely that white phosphorus, which is absorbed through th e lungs and skin, would also affect the kidneys The severe histological alterations that have been observed in animals acutely burned with 29-200 mg/kg/day white phosphorus, support the effect s observed in humans. No histological alterations were observed in the kidneys of rabbits burned once with an unre ported amount of white phosphorus (Bowen et al. 1971). No longer-term derm al burn animal studies were located. White Phosphorus Smoke. Renal effects were not examined in the three acute-duration white phosphorus smoke inhalation human studies (Walker et al. 1947; White and Armstrong 1935). Slight cloudy swelling in the kidneys was observed in rats, mice, and goats exposed to white phosphorus smoke for 1 hour at concentrations of 1,170,470, and 7,32 0 mg phosphorus 10,104 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3) (White and Armstrong 1935). No renal lesions were observed in rats exposed to 3,027 mg orthophosphoric acid/m3 for 90 minutes (Brown et al. 1980), or rats exposed to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 6 or 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). Because of differences in the exposure protocols, comparisons between the White and Armstrong (1935) study and the Brown et al . (1980, 1981) studies cannot be made. No dermal exposure studies examining renal effects were located. 113 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Dermal Effects White Phosphorus. There is limited information on the dermal toxicity of white phosphorus. Dermal effects were not reported in humans or animals fo llowing inhalation exposure. Very few human studies reported dermal effects following acute ingestion of white phosphorus. Toxic dermatitis (Dathe and Nathan 1946) and subcutaneous hemorrhages (Hann and Veale 1910; Humphreys and Halpert 1931) have been reported. It is not known if the dermatitis is related to phosphorus exposure, or due to a pre-existing condition. The subcutaneous hemorrhages are consistent with other studies which found hemorrhages in the liver, brain, and kidneys. No evidence of skin irritation was observed in animals exposed to white phosphorus in peanut oil placed on the skin (Lee et al. 1975). The peanut oil vehicle may have been protective against the potential irritating effects of white phosphorus. Following dermal burn exposure to white phosphorus, damage to the skin has been reported in humans and animals (Konjoyan 1983; Song et al. 1985; Summerlin et al. 1967; Walker et al. 1947). Many white phosphorus-induced burns are second and Third degree. Burn damage to the skin tissue is believed to result not only from heat but also from the corrosive action of phosphoric acid and the hygroscopic (moisture-absorbing) properties of phosphorus pe which is generated by oxidation of white phosphorus (Ben-Hur and Appelbaum 1973). Also, severe white phosphorus burns tend to heal more slowly than other types of third-degree burns. Rat models of acute dermal burn exposure revealed necr osis of the skin at 29 mg/kg/day (Ben-Hur et al. 1972) and 100 mg/kg/day (Ben-Hur and Appelbaum 1973), and delayed wound healing at 100 mg/kg/day. White Phosphorus Smoke. There is limited information on the pote ntial of white phosphorus smoke to induce dermal effects. No human exposure studies examining dermal end points were located. In rats, no histological damage in the skin was observed follo wing inhalation exposure to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). Ocular Effects White Phosphorus. There is limited information on the ocular toxicity of white phosphorus. Ocular effects were not reported in humans or animals fo llowing inhalation exposure. Very few human studies reported ocular effects following acute ingestion of white phosphorus. Edema of the eyelids (Rao and 114 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Brown 1974) has been reported. It is not known if th e edema is related to phosphorus exposure, or due to a pre-existing condition. No evidence of eye irritation was observed in animals exposed to white phosphorus in peanut oil placed on the eye (Lee et al. 1975). The peanut oil vehicle may have been protective against the potential irritating effects of white phosphorus. Transient local necrosis and congestion were repor ted after smoking particles of white phosphorus were discovered in the tarsal and bul bar conjunctival sacs of a dermal burn patient (Scherling and Blondis 1945). The conjunctival effects were comp letely absent by 4 days post-exposure. No studies were located regarding ocul ar effects after dermal burn exposure. White Phosphorus Smoke. There is limited information on the pote ntial of white phosphorus smoke to induce ocular effects in humans. No human exposure studies examining ocular end points were located. In rats, no histological damage in the eye was ob served following exposure to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). Other Systemic Effects. White Phosphorus. A number of other systemic effects have been observed in humans and animals exposed to white phosphorus. Hypoglycemia was observed in humans ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus (Diaz-Rivera et al. McCarron et al. 1981; McIntosh Wechsler and Wechsler 1951) and in dogs acutely inges ting an unspecified amount of wh ite phosphorus (Williamson and Mann 1923). The hypoglycemia is probably the result of a decr ease in the ability for the liver to regulate and/or synthesize glucose. A decrease in plasma electrolyte levels (calcium, potassium and/or sodium) has been observed in humans acutely ingesting white phosphorus (Caley ingesting approximately 0.1 mg/g/d ay white phosphorus for an intermediate duration (Compere 1930a), and in rabbits burned once with white phosphorus (Bowen et al. 1971). No reliable dose information was available from acute duration st udies. The alteration in electrolyte levels may be secondary to the vomiting and diarrhea observed followi ng ingestion of white phosphorus. The metabolic acidosis that was observed in an individual ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus (Rao and Brown 1974) and the decrease in pH observed in a child consuming approximately 0.1 mg/kg/day white 115 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS phosphorus for an intermediate duration (Compere 1930a) may be related to an alteration in electrolyte levels. Other systemic effects have been observed in a sma ll number of individuals intentionally or accidentally ingesting white phosphorus containing poison or firework. Some of these effects, such as fatty infiltration of the pancreas (Humphreys and Halpert 1931), splenomegaly (Greenberger et al. 1964), and necrosis of the adrenal medulla and cortex (Wechsler and Wechsler 1951), are consistent with effects that have been widely reported in other tissues. Other effects such as ascites (Fletcher and Galambos 1963), hyperthermia (Dathe and Nathan 1946; McIntosh 1927; McIntosh 1927), and hypothermia (Simon and Pickering 1976), may be the result of a pre-existing condition. No re liable dose information is available from these studies. The decreased appetite, impaired weight gain, a nd poor turgor observed in a child who ingested 0.08 mg/kg/day white phosphorus for an intermediate duration (Sontag 1938) may have been caused by damage to the gastrointestinal tract. Degeneration of the tongue and oral mucosa of th e cheek, gum, and hard palate was observed in rats exposed to the atmosphere in a furnace room or a phosphorus factory for an intermediate duration. These effects were most likely the result of a direct contact of white phosphorus with tissues of the mouth an&or indirect contact through particles deposited on the fu r which are then ingested by preening (Ruzuddinov and Rys-Uly 1986). No other systemic effects were reported for humans exposed via inhalation or dermal (nonburn) exposure, humans burned with white phosphorus, or animals dermally (nonburn) exposed. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding other systemic effects in humans and animals after inhalation or dermal exposure to white phosphorus smoke. Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects White Phosphorus. Information available on the immunotoxi city of white phosphorus is limited. Hemorrhages in the thymus of two young (Dwyer and 1925; Humphreys and Halpert 193l), lymph nodes, and splenic lymphoid corpuscles in a young child (Humphreys and Halpert 1931), decreases in neutrophil levels (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950; 116 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Fletcher and Galambos McCarron et al. 1981; Newburger et al. 1948; Pietras et al. 1968), and a decrease (Pietras et al. 1968) or an increase (McCarr on et al. 1981) in the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) were observed in individua ls ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus. Because the individuals vomited shortly after ing esting the white phosphorus and/or received gastric lavage, doses could not be estimated. A decrease in neutrophil levels was also observed in workers exposed to an unknown level of white phosphorus vi a inhalation, oral, and dermal routes (Ward 1928) and in individuals burned by white phosphorus (Walker et al. 1947). The alterations suggest that the immune system may be a target of toxicity. No info rmation on immunotoxicity in animals was located. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding immunological or lymphoreticular effects in humans and animals after inhalation or dermal exposure to white phosphorus smoke. Neurological Effects White Phosphorus. Signs of neurotoxicity have been observed in a number of individuals ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus. These signs include lethargy, sleepiness, i rritability, restlessness, hypoactivity, coma, toxic delirium yperesthesia, coarse muscle fasciculations, marked asterixis, al. 1972; Wechsler and Wechsler 1951). Coma was also reported in an individual burned by white phosphorus (Walker et al. 1947). Similar signs of ne urotoxicity have been observed in animals receiving oral, dermal burn, or parenteral exposure of white phosphorus (Bio/dynamics et al. 1938; Frye and Cucuel 1969). Histological damage in the brain has also been observed in humans acutely ingesting white phosphorus (Humphreys and Halpert 1931; Rao and Brown 1974; Wertham 1932) and in rabbits receiving intravenous injections of phosphorus far an intermediate duration (Ferraro et al. 1938). Liver damage was observed in most of the human a nd animals exhibiting signs of neurotoxicity. In a compilation of case reports of individuals intentio nally ingesting single doses of white phosphorus, neurotoxicity was frequently observed in individuals exhibiting signs of liver toxicity (McCarron et al. 1981). Some of the neurological effects observed may have been secondary to the liver damage. 117 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Disturbances in consciousness (ranging from confusi on to stupor to deep coma) and fluctuating neurological signs such as rigidity, hyperreflexia, ast erixis, and, rarely, seizures have been observed in individuals with hepatic failure. Histologic alterations observed in these individuals with hepatic failure include hyperplasia of astrocytes (pri ncipally in the cortex), cerebral edema, and band-like cerebral cortical necrosis. Many of these histological alterations were observed in the limited number of white phosphorus poisoned individuals in which histopathological examin ation of the brain was performed (Rao and Brown 1974; Wertham 1932). However, not all of the histological alterations in the brain appeared to be secondary to liver damage. Fatty deposition (an effect observed in a number of tissues) has been observed in humans (Humphreys and Halpert 1931; Wertham 1932) but not in animals (Fer raro et al. 1938) exposed to white phosphorus. Alterations secondary to ischemic damage were observed in an indi vidual ingesting white phosphorus (Wertham 1932). Proliferation of the tunica intim a of small cortical blood vessels that occasionally resulted in occlusion of the vessel was observed (Ferraro et al. 1938). The hemiplegia observed in two individuals may have been the result of occlusion of cortical blood vessels (Humphreys and Halpert 1931; McCarron et al. 1981). Damage to microglial cells (hypertrophy and effects associated with acute swelling) (Ferraro et al. 1938) and da mage to cells of the inferior olives (observed in humans and animals) (Ferraro et al. 1938; Wertham 1932) may be a direct effect of white phosphorus. White Phosphorus Smoke. There is limited information on the neurotoxicity of white phosphorus smoke. No human exposure studies were located. No lesions were observed in the brains of rats exposed to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m 3 of white phosphorus smoke 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). No other studies examining neurological end points were observed. Reproductive Effects White Phosphorus. There is limited information on the re productive effects of white phosphorus in humans. Uterine hemorrhaging was reported in a 2-m onth pregnant woman who intentionally ingested a lethal dose (2 mg/kg) of phosphorus (Harm and Veale 1910). In male and female rats orally exposed to white phosphorus, no effects on reproductive performance were observed at relatively low doses (0.075 mg/kg/day) (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985). In addition, no histological alterations were observed in reproductive organs of male rats recei ving subcutaneous injections of 3.2 mg/kg/day for l-l1 days (Fleming et al. 1942), subcutaneous injecti ons of 0.8 mg/kg/day for 140 days (Fleming et al. 118 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 1942), or subcutaneous injections of 0.4 mg/kg/da y for 340-610 days (Fleming et al. 1942). Male and female rats orally exposed to 0.075 mg/kg/day for 145 or 204 days (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985) and male guinea pigs receiving 0.4 mg/kg/day via subcutaneous injections for 720 days (Fleming et al. 1942) likewise showed no effects in reproductive organs. Increased mortality was observed during late gestation and parturition in rats receiving wh ite phosphorus for an intermediate duration. These effects were discussed previously in Section 2.5 under \"Death. \" No dermal exposure studies examining reproductive toxicity were located. The studies that examined reproductive performance used relatively low doses; it is not known if exposure to higher doses would result in reproductive toxicity. Thus, the potential of white phosphorus to cause reproductive effects in humans cannot be determined. White Phosphorus Smoke. Reproductive end points were not examined in the available human exposure studies (Walker et al. 1947; White and Armstrong 1935). No histological damage was observed in reproductive tissues of male and female rats exposed to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m 3 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981). In addition, no effects on reproductive performance were observed in male or female ra ts exposed to 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 15 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 3-13 weeks (Brown et al. 1981; Starke et al. 1982). Dermal exposure studies examining repr oductive end points were not located. Developmental Effects White Phosphorus. Oral white phosphorus administered to two healthy children for intermediate durations for the prevention of rickets resulted in a decreased growth rate in one child (Sontag 1938) and the development of transverse bands of increased density at the ends of the long bones. Increased thickness and density were observed in the zones of calcification in both children (Compere 1930a; Sontag 1938). Following cessation of treatment, the growth rate returned to normal; however, the \"phosphorus\" bands were still visible 4.5 years later (Sontag 1938). Young, growing rabbits and rats exposed orally to phosphorus for acute or intermediate durations developed similar transverse bands of increased density in metaphyseal regions of the long bones, compared to a control group (Adams 1938a, 1938b; Adams and Sarnat 1940; Whalen et al. 1973). In addition, some animals had a decreased rate of growth of the long bones (Adams and Samat 1940). Normal growth of long bones requires bone depositi on and bone resorption. White phosphorus apparently decreases the absorption of intercellu lar calcified cartilage matrix by osteoclasts, in the metaphyseal region 119 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS of growing bones. The process of tubulation (or formul ation of the tube in a growing bone) is dependent on the peripheral and central resorption of metaphyseal bone and cartilage. During white phosphorus administration, areas of increased density are formed and bone growth is inhibited. Information on the developmental toxicity of white phosphorus, other than effects on growing bones, is limited to two oral exposure studies (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985), which administered a relatively low dose of white phosphorus. A nonsignificant (p>0. 05) decrease in the incidence of viable pups and increase in the incidence of stillbirths was observed in the offspring of rats exposed to 0.075 mg/kg/day. These effects were not observed in a similarly designed study in which rats were exposed to 0.075 mg/kg/day (Bio/dynamics 1991). Anomalies or malformations were not observed in either of these studies. Because these studies used relatively low doses, their usefulness in predicting whether exposure to white phosphorus would result in developmental toxicity is limited. White Phosphorus Smoke. No data on developmental effects in humans exposed to white phosphorus smoke were located. No developmental e ffects were observed in rats exposed in utero to concentrations of white phosphorus smoke as high as 1,742 mg orthophosphoric acid equivalents/m3 for 15 minutes/day (Brown et al. 1981; Starke et al. 1982). However, exposure of the dams and pups to white phosphorus smoke in utero and during lactation resulted in an 8% decrease in pup body weight, a 68% decrease in pup survival, and a 35% decrease in viab ility (Brown et al. 1981; Starke et al. 1982). These results may be due to interference with the pups suck ling, decreased milk production, decreased suckling due to respiratory tract irritation in the pups, or another compound-rela ted effect. No dermal exposure developmental studies were located. Genotoxic Effects White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding in vivo genotoxic effects in humans or animals after inhalation, oral, dermal ( nonburn), and dermal (burn) exposure. Genotoxicity of a saturated solution of white phosphorus in water was evaluated in vitro in a standard Ames assay both with and without microsomal activation (Ellis et al. 1978). The tests used Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA1535, not genotoxic in these test systems. 120 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies were located regarding in vivo or in vitro genotoxic effects in humans or animals after inha lation and dermal exposure. Cancer White Phosphorus. No information on carcinogenicity of white phosphorus in humans has been located. Data in animals are very limited. In a chronic oral exposure study in rats, carcinogenic effects were not reported (Fleming et al. 1942). However, this stud y provides limited information on which tissues were examined. White Phosphorus Smoke. No human or animal exposure studies examining cancer following inhalation or dermal exposure to white phosphorus smoke were located. 2.6 BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE AND EFFECT Biomarkers are broadly defined as indicators signaling ev ents in biologic systems or samples. They have been classified as markers of exposure, markers of effect, and markers of susceptibility (NAS/NRC 1989). Due to a nascent understanding of the use and interpretation of biomarkers, implementation of biomarkers as tools of exposure in the general population is ve ry limited. A biomarker of exposure is a xenobiotic substance or its metabolite(s), or the product of an interaction between a xenobiotic agent and some target molecule(s) or cell(s) that is measured within a compartment of an organism (NAS/NRC 1989). The preferred biomarkers of exposure are generally the substance itself or substance-specific metabolites in readily obtainable body fluid(s) or excreta. However, several factors can confound the use and interpretation of biomarkers of e xposure. The body burden of a substance may be the result of exposures from more than one source. The substance being measured may be a metabolite of another xenobiotic substance (e.g., high urinary levels of phenol can result from exposure to several different aromatic compounds). Depending on the properties of the substance (e.g., biologic half-life) and environmental conditions (e.g., duration and route of exposure), the s ubstance and all of its metabolites may have left the body by the time samples can be taken. It may be difficult to identify individuals exposed to hazardous substances that are commonly found in body tissues and fluids (e.g., essential mineral nutrients such as copper, zinc, and selenium). Biomarkers of exposure to white phosphorus are discussed in Section 2.6.1. 121 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Biomarkers of effect are defined as any measurable biochemical, physiologic, or other alteration within an organism that, depending on magnitude, can be recognized as an established or potential health impairment or disease (NAS/NRC 1989). This definiti on encompasses biochemical or cellular signals of tissue dysfunction (e.g., increased liver enzyme activity or pathologic changes in female genital epithelial cells), as well as physiologic signs of dysfunctio n such as increased blood pressure or decreased lung capacity. Note that these markers are not often substan ce specific. They also may not be directly adverse, but can indicate potential health impairment (e.g., DNA adducts). Biomarkers of effects caused by white phosphorus are discussed in Section 2.6.2. A biomarker of susceptibility is an indicator of an inherent or acquired limitation of an organism's ability to respond to the challenge of exposure to a specific xe nobiotic substance. It can be an intrinsic genetic or other characteristic or a preexisting disease that results in an increase in absorb ed dose, a decrease in the biologically effective dose, or a target tissue res ponse. If biomarkers of susceptibility exist, they are discussed in Section 2.8, \"Populatio ns That Are Unusually Susceptible.\" 2.6.1 Biomarkers Used to Identify or Quantify Exposure to White Phosphorus White Phosphorus. White phosphorus affects nearly every organ system to some degree, depending on the duration and route of exposure (see Section 2.2). Most of these effects appear to be shared effects and may not be useful individually as characteristic indicators of white phosphorus exposure. However, established clinical diagnostic principles as well as the weight of evidence from this report (see Section 2.2) suggest that a sequence of effects following exposure and a few individual clinical signs or effects may be useful biomarkers of exposure. Data were sufficient to suggest biomarkers indicative of acute oral, acute dermal, and chronic occupational ex posures (see Section 2.2 for further details). Data were not sufficient for other routes of exposure. There are no known quantitative biomarkers unique to acute oral white phosphorus poisoningin an individual. Unfortunately, the metabolism of white phosphorus is not well understood (refer to Section 2.3 for details of metabolism). Studies that identify metabolites of white phosphorus were not located. It seems, however, that most metabolites of white phosphorus are probabl y inorganic or organic molecules that are commonly found in body tissues and fluids. Two obvious potential biomarkers of exposure are serum and urine phosphate levels, which are parameters that are included in some routine clinical test series. The normal range for human serum phosphate is 3.0-45 mg/l00 mL (Harper 1969), 122 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS and the normal range for the rate of human urinary phosphate excretion is 0.34-1.0 g/day (Henry 1967). However, the weight of evidence upon examination of pertinent data (see Sections 2.2 and 2.3) indicates that these parameters are probably not good biomarkers of exposure. Both of them commonly have a high degree of variability within individuals. Also, both th e mean and the range of an individuals values vary within a population of individuals. Thus, serum a nd urine phosphate are contraindicated as biomarkers of exposure. An odor of garlic in th e inhaled breath of an individual, po ssibly accompanied by a pale bluegreen phosphorescence in the vomitus or the feces, and smoke coming out of the mouth and feces are indicative of acute oral white phosphorus poisoni ng. White phosphorus itself volatilizes and produces the metallic odor of garlic, while the phosphorescence is thought to be evolved during the oxidation of white phosphorus to phosphorus pe ntoxide (Rabinowitch 1943). White Phosphorus Smoke . The lack of information on the metabolism and mechanism of action of white phosphorus smoke and the limited information on the toxicity of white phosphorus smoke precludes identifying biomarkers of exposure. 2.6.2 Biomarkers Used to Characteri ze Effects Caused by White Phosphorus White Phosphorus. The primary sites of white phosphorus toxicity are the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, cardiovascular system, and bone. The bone effects are only observed following longer-term exposure to white phosphorus, whereas hepatic, renal and cardiovascular effects are observed shortly after exposure to white phosphorus. Following exposure to white phosphorus, a dense phosphorus line can be identified on the bones. The appearance of this phos phorus line may be unique to phosphorus; however, it may only occur in growing bones. The most extens ive information on the effects of white phosphorus is from the acute human oral exposure database, prim arily case reports of individuals intentionally or accidentally consuming poisons or fireworks contai ning phosphorus. The biomarkers of liver effects include jaundice, impaired bromsulfophthalein (BSP) (liver function test) results, increased levels of bilirubin, and increased in AST and ALT levels. Incr eases in blood levels of urea nitrogen and nonprotein nitrogen, proteinuria, albuminuria, and oliguria are so me of the biomarkers of kidney damage that have been observed in humans. Indicators of cardiovascu lar effects include a marked decrease in (or undetectable) blood pressure and/or pulse and hemorrhag ing. Shortly after ingesting white phosphorus, most individuals vomit, and often blood is present in the vomitus. Although these biomarkers are not specific for phosphorus exposure, a combination of vo miting, altered serum chemistry values, suggestive of liver and kidney damage, and symptoms of shock may be useful in identifying phosphorus exposure. 123 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Quantitative biomarkers of acute oral exposure that are shared with a variety of other toxic compounds are numerous (see Section 2.2 for more details). Clinical pathologic findings include hypoglycemia, decreased total leukocytes, increased serum bilirubin, altered prothrombin time, increased AST and ALT, impaired liver function, increased lactate dehydrogen ase, decreased serum triglyceride levels, proteinuria, albuminuria, oliguria, increased blood urea and/or nitrogen, and increased blood creatinine levels. A postmortem quantitative biomarker is increased tota l hepatic lipids and hepatic triglyceride levels. Clinical signs of oral toxicity may be the most reliable set of biomarkers of acute oral exposure to white phosphorus. After acute oral exposure to white phosphorus, a typical set of clinical signs ensue (these are discussed in more detail in Section 2.2). Severe g astrointestinal distress follows within several hours, sometimes with gastrointestinal swelling. Usually , it involves persistent and/or violent vomiting, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea. Following these ty pical initial signs of acute oral exposure to white phosphorus, a number of nonspecific signs may appear within 12 hours of ingestion. These range from no further effects to severe hepatomegaly, jaundice, decreased urine volume, increased respiratory rate, vascular collapse or cardiac arrest, lethargy or sleepiness, transient hemiplegia, shock, coma, and/or death, among others (see Section 2.2 for more detail). Qualitative biomarkers of acute oral exposure that ar e shared with other toxic compounds include a variety of electrocardiogram alterations. Postmortem biomar kers include fatty hepatic degeneration, pulmonary internal he morrhaging, widespread intracellular fatty deposits, various myocardial damage, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, and increased liver weight (see Section 2.2 for more detail). Quantitative biomarkers of dermal burn exposure are generally similar to those seen after acute oral exposure (see Section 2.2 for details). Qualitative biom arkers are also generally similar, but differ on a few relatively obvious points. In white phosphorus burn exposures , gastrointestinal upset is less common and generally less severe, and phosphorescent particles are frequently visible in the area of a white phosphorus burn rather than in vomitus and/or feces. Also if white phosphorus is still present in the burn wound following cleansing procedures, white phosphor us - induced burns may re-ignite spontaneously There are no known quantitative in-life or postmortem biomarkers that are unique to chronic (primarily inhalation, but also oral and dermal) exposure to white phosphorus. There are also no postmortem quantitative biomarkers of chronic exposure. In-life quantitative biomarkers that are shared with other 124 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS toxic compounds include anemia, decreased total le ukocytes, and hypoglycemia (see Section 2.2 for details). Qualitative in-life biomarkers that are characteristic of chronic exposure to white phosphorus include progressive destruction of the jaw bones (phossy jaw), brittleness of long bones, and poor healing of oral cavity lesions including tooth sockets after tooth extr action (see Section 2.2 for details). In-life biomarkers that are probably shared with other toxic compounds include increased permeability of capillary walls and impaired microcirculation. Postmortem qualitative biomarkers include hyperkeratosis of the epithelium of the oral mucosa and lesions of the capillary walls (see S ection 2.2 for details). Hyperkeratosis is a microscopic morphological finding that can be seen in biopsy material from a living patient or from an autopsy and is seen in association with phosphorus intoxication. White Phosphorus Smoke. Based on the limited information on the toxicity of airborne white phosphorus, the respiratory tract appears to be the prim ary site of toxicity. However, similar respiratory tract effects have been observed following exposure to other airborne irritants. Additional information regarding biomarkers for effects can be found in OTA (1990) and CDC/ATSDR (1990). A more detailed discussion of the health effects caused by white phosphorus and white phosphorus smoke can be found in Section 2.2 of Chapter 2. 2.7 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER SUBSTANCES White Phosphorus. Information that was located on interactiv e effects of white phosphorus with other compounds focuses on absorption and hepatotoxicity. Gastrointestinal absorption of white phosphorus may be enhanced by interaction with a liquid vehicle. This is suggested by an increase in mortality rate afte r ingestion of rat poison, roach poison, or fireworks in a study of 51 suicide cases (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950). A possible mechanism is the facilitation of the passage of the white phosphorus to the duodenum, wh ere more rapid absorption may occur when the medium of ingestion is itself digested and absorbed. However, the interpretation of the effect of a liquid medium on phosphorus absorption is confounded by the timing of lavage, timing of post-ingestion vomiting, and perhaps interactions between components of the poisons. 125 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS In contrast, gastrointestinal absorption was impeded by an interaction with physiologically inert liquid petrolatum (a cathartic) orally administered to dogs (Atkinson 1921). Adverse systemic effects were completely prevented or delayed. Apparently white phosphorus preferentially dissolves in liquid petrolatum, which is itself not digested, and th erefore passes through the gastrointestinal tract. The interactive effects of copper sulfate associated w ith dermal absorption are equivocal. Information was located suggesting antagonistic effects of copper sulfate solutions in water, glycerol, and oil with respect to phosphorus absorption and 1% lauryl sulfate) applied to white phosphorus burns also appeared to demonstrate an antagonistic interaction in one study by preventing white phosphorus-induced death in rats (Ben-Hur and Appelbaum 1973). However, the same emulsion solution had no beneficial effect in a later repeat of the experiment (Eldad and Simon 1991). The mechanism by which copper sulfate theoretically impedes dermal absorption of phosphorus following white phosphorus burn is the fo rmation of a copper-phosphorus complex (Cu 3P2) that will not be absorbed, is unstable and may decompose to ioni c copper and phosphate when in contact with oxygen in the air (Sontag et al. 1985). A safer and potentially more reliable antagonist to white phosphorus dermal absorption is a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO 3). The mechanism is not known with certainty (Song et al. 1985) but is hypothesized to be formation of Ag 3P, the toxic properties of which are not reported. Increases in hepatic triglycerides after white phosphorus tr eatment were apparently potentiated in male rats by pretreatment with intraperitoneal injection of phenobarbital (Jacqueson et al. 1979). The effect was not observed in females. White phosphorus and phenobarbita l individually induced statistically significant increases in hepatic triglycerides. The potentiation ma y occur by phenobarbital increasing the hydroxylation of testosterone, a steroid hormone, or it could also be due to proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A different steroid, 19-nortestosterone phenylpropionate (NTPP), was shown to be moderately antagonistic to increases in white phosphorus -induced hepatic triglyceride levels (Jacqueson et al. 1978). NTPP did not change the mortality rate or the incidence of other systemic effects after white phosphorus treatment (Jacqueson et al. 1978). Phenobarbitone is not only a potentiator of white phos phorus-induced fatty liver, but is also antagonist of white phosphorus-induced mortality. Pretr eatment with phenobarbitone prevented death in 126 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS phosphorus-treated male rats, while white phosphorus alone caused 40% mortality in males (Jacqueson et al. 1979). The mechanism for this is unclear. Glutathione (GSH) and propyl gallate (PG) are an tioxidants and free radical scavengers. Pretreatment with each of these chemicals was antagonistic to white phosphorus-induced increases in hepatic triglycerides and increases in hepatic polyribosome disaggregation (Pani et al. 1972). The intraperitoneal pre-treatment with glutathione or propyl gallate was maintenance of hepatic protein synthesis in spite of white phosphorus treatment. The interaction of phetharbital and white phosphorus is also antagonistic with respect to liver function. Four daily treatments of mice with phetharbital following a single administration of white phosphorus facilitated the return of BSP retenti on to control levels (Hurwitz 1972). Three studies examined the mediating effect of phe nobarbital on white phosphorus-induced liver function impairment. Pre-treatment with four or five intrap eritoneal injections of phenobarbital showed no effect on white phosphorus-induced triglyceride accumulation at 12 hours after white phosphorus administration (Pani et al. 1972), but had an antagonistic effect on white phosphorus-induced increases in BSP retention at 24 hours after treatment with white phosphor us (Hurwitz 1972). The antagonistic effect of phenobarbital pre-treatment on white phosphorus-induced BSP retention disappeared by 48 hours after white phosphorus administration. Another study conducted by Hurwitz (1972) showed the antagonistic effect of 4 daily intraperitoneal post-treat ments with phenobarbital on white phosphorus-induced mortality. White Phosphorus Smoke. No information on the interactive effects of white phosphorus smoke and other compounds was located. 2.8 POPULATIONS THAT ARE UNUSUALLY SUSCEPTIBLE A susceptible population will exhibit a different or enha nced response to white phosphorus than will most persons exposed to the same level of white phosphorus in the environment. Reasons include genetic make-up, developmental stage, age, health and nutritional status (including dietary habits that may increase susceptibility, such as inconsistent diets or nutritional deficiencies), and substance exposure history (including smoking). These parameters may r esult in decreased function of the detoxification and 127 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS excretory processes (mainly hepatic, renal, and respir atory) or the pre-existing compromised function of target organs (including effects or clearance ra tes and any resulting end-product metabolites). For these reasons we expect the elderly with declining orga n function and the youngest of the population with immature and developing organs will generally be more vulnerable to toxic substances than healthy adults. Populations who are at greater risk due to their unusually high exposure are discussed in Section 5.6, \"Populations With Potentially High Exposure.\" White Phosphorus. Studies have shown that pregnant rats are more susceptible than nonpregnant female and male rats to the lethal effect s of white phosphorus during late gesta tion or parturition. It is not known if pregnant women would also represent an unusua lly susceptible population. Human exposure to white phosphorus has shown that the liver, kidney, and cardi ovascular systems are some of the primary targets of toxicity. Individuals with pre-existing liver, kidney, heart, or circulatory disorders may be unusually susceptible to white phosphorus toxicity. White Phosphorus Smoke. There is no information on populations that would be usually susceptible to the toxicity of white phosphorus smoke. Based on human and animal inhalation studies, it is possible that individuals with pre-existing respiratory problems may be more sensitive. 2.9 METHODS FOR REDUCING TOXIC EFFECTS This section describes clinical practice and research concerning methods for reducing toxic effects of exposure to white phosphorus. However, because some of the treatments discussed may be experimental and unproven, this section should not be used as a gui de for treatment of exposures to white phosphorus. When specific exposures have occurred, poison cont rol centers and medical toxicologists should be consulted for medical advice. 2.9.1 Reducing Peak Absorption Following Exposure White Phosphorus. The first 2 hours following oral ingestion of white phosphorus containing compounds appear to be critical. Mortality rates increase rapidly if gastric lavage is not administered within 2-3 hours after ingestion (Diaz-Riviera et al. 1950). Although emesis has occasionally been contraindicated because white phosphorus may be co rrosive to the esophagus and mouth, a study of 51 cases of white phosphorus ingestion indicates that vomiting within 1 hour appears to substantially 128 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS increase the probability of survival, and an 80% mort ality rate was indicated among individuals who did not vomit at all (Diaz-Rivera et al. 1950). Supporting animal data show that white phosphorus in mineral oil is absorbed in male rats within 15 minutes of ingestion, and within 2-3 hours 82-87% of the administered dose had reached internal or gans and fluids (Ghoshal et al. 1971). Various lavage solutions have been suggested, includi ng mineral oil, saline, and dilute copper sulfate solution. Dilute copper sulfate has been suggested for its emetic properties, as well as for its ability to form an apparently inert complex with phosphorus that reduces white phosphorus absorption (Eldad and Simon 1991; Summerlin et al. 1967). It has been suggested that dermal absorption may be impeded with dilute aqueous copper sulfate solutions by temporarily inactivating white phosphorus until the copper-phosphorus complexes can be removed by washing with forceps (Rabinowitch 1943; Goldblatt and Oakeshott 1943; Jelenko 1974). However, mitigation with copper sulfate solution has since been contraindicated because of its own toxicity as a potent hemolytic agent (Eldad and Simon 1991). Ind eed, even the effectiveness of 3% copper sulfate emulsions to interfere with dermal absorption is in qu estion, since contradictory results have been reported (Ben-Hur and Appelbaum 1973; Eldad and Simon 1991) . Indeed, water was the only flushing treatment that was effective in preventing death in one of the studies (Eldad and Simon 1991). A solution of copper sulfate in oil or glycerol is suggested to deac tivate liquid paraffin or benzene-rubber solutions of phosphorus, after successful trials with animals (Goldblatt and Oakeshott 1943). The oil solution reportedly also effectively deactivates solid phosphor us and phosphorus dissolved in carbon sulfide or benzene. The toxicity of the oil solution of copper sulfate itself was not reported. Silver nitrate was suggested as an alternative to copper sulfate, and was successfully applied in 13 cases of white phosphorus burns during 1978-1985 (Song et al. 1985). It is suggested that oils and greases be exclude d from white phosphorus burn areas, since they may dissolve the white phosphorus and assist its penetra tion into the wound (Rabin owitch 1943). An apparent exception to this is suggested in studies in animal s subjected to white phosphorus burns and treated with oil-phosphorus solution. The oil-phosphorus solution was very effective in inactivating white phosphorus (Goldblatt and Oakeshott 1943; Ra binowitch limite d white phosphorus burn, flushes with aqueous solutions of dilute copper sulfate or sodium bicarbonate are suggested (Rabinowitch 1943). Covering the affected area with liquid petrolatum has also been suggested (Jelenko 1974). Surgical 129 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS removal of phosphorus particles with forceps concurrent with the flushes is suggested, since they may reignite once the burn area dries (Rabinowitch 1943). Common treatments for eye exposure to white phosphorus fumes/vapors include holocaine and epinephrine ointments, a solution, a nd a solution with epinephrine alone. All of these have been suggested as successful therapeutic agents following exposure of the eye, but their effect on absorption through the eye area is unknown (Scherling and Blondis 1945). White Phosphorus Smoke. There is no information on methods for reducing peak absorption following exposure to white phosphorus smoke. 2.9.2 Reducing Body Burden White Phosphorus. The retention of white phosphorus followi ng absorption is poorly understood. Most of the phosphorus is probably quickly converted to orthophosphate, which in turn is rapidly eliminated from the body in urine (see Section 2.3). Supporting anim al data show that up to 17% of administered radiolabeled phosphorus was eliminated in the urine of rats 4 hours after oral administration (Lee et al. 1975). By 5 days post-dosing in the same study, 79% of administered radiolabeled phosphorus was excreted in the urine and feces, combined. The fate of the remaini ng phosphorus is unknown. Some evidence suggests that white phosphorus or its metabolites are present in the human body after 5 days. A latent period of 4 days to 3 weeks follo wing initial gastrointestinal distress, and preceding severe systemic effects and/or death, has been well described. It is not known whether the relapse is due to retention of active phosphorus or one of its metabolites rather than to delayed effects from an organ impairment that occurred dur ing the initial intoxication. No studies on body burden reduction methods were located. The state of definitive knowledge of white phosphorus metabolism is too limited to permit ex tensive speculation on methods for reducing body burden. However, it is possible that increasing selec tive excretion of phosphate may increase the rate of inorganic conversion of white p hosphorus to phosphate (this conve rsion is described in detail in Section 2.3). Since phosphate is a naturally occurring component of the blood's buffering system, this would effectively deactivate the phosphorus. No me thods for selectively increasing phosphate excretion were located. 130 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS White Phosphorus Smoke. There is no information on methods to reduce the body burden of toxic components of white phosphorus smoke. 2.9.3 Interfering with the Mechanism of Action for Toxic Effects White Phosphorus. One manifestation of liver damage follo wing ingestion of white phosphorus is an increase in sulfobromophthalein (BSP) retention, indicating impairment of biliary excretion. Both phetharbital and phenobarbital seem to mitigate the white phosphorus-induced increase in BSP retention. Four daily intraperitoneal treatments of mice with e ither phetharbital or phenobarbital following a single administration of white phosphorus fac ilitated the return of BSP retention to control levels at 5 days after white phosphorus ingestion (Hurwitz 1972). Howe ver, the usefulness of these two compounds as mitigating factors may be very limited, since white phosphorus-induced body weight changes and mortality rate were not affected. The primary mechanisms of action in the liver are an impairment of protein synthesis (particularly a decrease in apolipoprotein), resulting in an accumulation of triglycerides, which eventually leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis, and mitochondrial damage, which results in diminished ATP levels, and cell necrosis. Similar mechanisms of action probably occu r in the kidney, heart, and brain. A compound that would interfere with the white ph osphorus-induced ultrastructural damage would mitigate these effects; no compound has been identified that would in terfere with this mechanism of action. White Phosphorus Smoke. There is no information on methods for interfering with the mechanism of action for white phosphorus smoke-induced toxic effects. 2.10 ADEQUACY OF THE DATABASE Section 104(I)(5) of CERCLA, as amended, directs the Administrator of ATSDR (in consultation with the Administrator of EPA and agencies and programs of the Public Health Service) to assess whether adequate information on the health effects of white phosphorus and white phosphorus smoke are available. Where adequate information is not availa ble, ATSDR, in conjunction with the National Toxicology Program (NTP), is required to assure the initiation of a program of research designed to determine the health effects (and techniques for developing methods to determine such health effects) of white phosphorus. 131 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS The following categories of possible data needs have been identified by a joint team of scientists from ATSDR, NTP, and EPA. They are defined as substan ce-specific informational needs that if met would reduce the uncertainties of human health assessment. This definition should not be interpreted to mean that all data needs discussed in this section must be filled. In the future, the identified data needs will be evaluated and prioritized, and a substance-specific research agenda will be proposed. 2.10.1 Existing Information on Hea lth Effects of White Phosphorus The existing data on health effects of inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure of humans and animals to white phosphorus are summarized in Figures 2-4 and 2-5. The purpose of this figure is to illustrate the existing information concerning the health effects of white phosphorus. Each dot in the figure indicates that one or more studies provide information associated with that particular effect. The dot does not necessarily imply anything about the quality of the study or studies, nor should missing information in this figure be interpreted as a \"data need.\" A data need , as defined in ATSDR's Decision Guide for Identifying Substance-Specific Data Needs Related to Toxico logical Profiles (ATSDR 1989), is substance-specific information necessary to conduct comprehensive pub lic health assessments. Generally, ATSDR defines a data gap more broadly as any substance-specific information missing from the scientific literature. Most of the information on the toxicity of white phosphorus in humans comes from case reports of individuals who intentionally or accidentally ingest ed a single dose of phosphorus that was a component of poison or fireworks. These case reports provide information on acute systemic effects, possible immunological effects, neurological effects, reproductive effects, and death in humans. In addition to these case reports of single exposures, there are several case reports of children ingesting white phosphorus for an intermediate duration; these studies provide information on intermediate systemic effects and developmental effects. Information on chronic oral and dermal exposure in humans is limited to occupational exposure studies in which workers were e xposed to white phosphorus via inhalation, oral, or dermal routes. Some limited information on chronic systemic effects is available from these studies. There is limited information on the toxicity of inha led white phosphorus in hum ans. Several occupational exposure studies are available; however, only a limite d number of parameters were assessed in these studies. Some information on health effects in hum ans following dermal burn exposure is available. As with the occupational exposure studies identified fo r inhalation, oral, and dermal (nonburn), these studies examined a limited number of systemic parameters. 134 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Information on the toxicity of inhaled white phosphorus in animals is limited to a study that examined some parameters of systemic toxicity following intermediate-duration exposure. Information on death, acute, intermediate, and chronic systemic effects, neurological effects, reproductive effects, and developmental effects has been located. Studies on animals dermally (nonburn) exposed to white phosphorus are limited to an acute exposure study which monitored for dermal and ocular effects. Several dermal burn studies were identified which provided da ta on death and a limited number of acute systemic effects. Neurological effects were also obser ved in an acute animal dermal burn study. White Phosphorus Smoke. There is a limited amount of available information on human toxicity of white phosphorus smoke. These acute-duration human expos ure studies monitored for systemic effects following inhalation exposure. Death, systemic effect s, and developmental effects have been observed in animals exposed to airborne white phosphorus smoke for acute and intermedia te durations. Reproductive and neurological end points have also been monitored following intermediate-duration inhalation exposure. No dermal exposure studies were located. 2.10.2 Identification of Data Needs Acute-Duration Exposure White Phosphorus. No acute-duration inhalation exposure data in humans and animals were located; thus, an acute-duration inhalation MRL cannot be derived. There is extensive information on the acute-duration effects of white phosphorus following oral exposure in humans (Caley and Kellock al. al. et al. Pickering 1976; Wechsler and Wechsler 1951). The primary targets of toxicity are liver, kidneys, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal system. Acute-duration oral exposure data in animals support the identification of these target organs. An acute-duration oral MRL cannot be derived because most individuals vomit shortly after ingestion of white phosphorus; thus, the dose cannot be calculated. Animal studies cannot be used as the basis of the MRL because the studies that identified the lowest LOAEL values reported data for only a small number of animals (Adams 1938a; Sigal et al. 1954). Only one acute-duration dermal (nonburn) study was located (Lee et al. 1975); this animal study only tested for dermal and ocular effects and did not use multiple 135 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS doses. Several human acute-duration dermal burn e xposure studies reported effects Summerlin et al. 1967; Walker et al. 1947). Based on these human studies and animal studies (Appelbaum et al. 1975; Ben-Hur and Appelbaum 1973; Ben-Hur et al. 1972; Bowen et al. 1971), the primary targets following dermal burn exposure to white phosphorus appear to be the skin, liver, and kidneys. Additional studies involving acute exposure to white phosphorus would be helpful to identify the target organs following inhalation and dermal (nonbur n) exposure and dose-response relationships for all routes of exposure. There are populations surrounding hazardous waste sites that might be exposed to white phosphorus for brief periods; children living near phosphorus-c ontaining hazardous waste sites may be exposed to white phosphorus by dirt ingestion and/or skin contact while playing at unrestricted dumpsites. Therefore, this information is important. White Phosphorus Smoke. In humans and animals exposed to airborne white phosphorus smoke for acute durations, the respiratory tract appears to be th e most sensitive end point (Brown et al. 1980; Walker et al. 1947; White and Armstrong 1935). An acute inhalation MRL of 0.02 mg/m3 was derived based on throat irritation in humans (White and Armstrong 193 5). Other effects observed in animals include death and hepatic and renal effects (Brown et al. 1980; White and Armstrong 1935). These studies have several limitations; a limited number of end points were examined in the White and Armstrong (1935) study, and animals were held for 2 weeks following exposure termination in the Bowen et al. (1980) study. In addition, these studies expressed air concentrations in terms of orthophosphoric acid or phosphorus pentoxide equivalent concentrations making it di fficult to assess the health risk to humans following exposure to white phosphorus smoke. Acute-durati on inhalation exposure studies examining a number of end points would be useful in assessing human health risk. No acute-duration dermal exposure studies were located. Dermal exposure studies examining a numbe r of end points would be useful in determining the targets of white phosphorus smoke toxicity. Intermediate-Duration Exposure White Phosphorus. Several human intermediate- duration inhalation studies were identified (Hughes et al. 1962; Legge 1920; Ward 1928). Phossy jaw was observed in these workers. Only one animal inhalation study was identified (Ruzuddinov and Rys-Uly 1 986). Because these studies only examined a limited number of end points (primarily focused on occurrence of phossy jaw), they cannot be used to determine the targets of toxicity. Several intermediate dura tion studies in which children were administered white 136 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS phosphorus reported abnormalities in the bone (Compere 1930a; Phemister 1918; Sontag 1938). In addition, a study in which workers were exposed to ai rborne white phosphorus (w ith some oral and dermal exposure) reported phossy jaw (War d 1928). Several intermediate-durati on animal studies were identified (Adams and Sarnat Sollmann 1925; Whalen et al. 1973). Based on the human and animal studies, the primary targets of intermediate-duration e xposure to white phosphorus appear to be the bone and liver. Most of the animal studies did not examine the renal system; however, based on acute data, it is likely that this is also a target of toxicity following intermediate-dur ation exposure. An intermediate-duration oral MRL of 2x10 -4 mg/kg/day was derived based on a NOAEL of 0.0 15 mg/kg/day which increased mortality or other effects in pregnant rats (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985). As discussed above, in the workers examined by Ward (1928) (exposed via inhalation, oral, and dermal routes), phossy jaw was observed. No intermediate-duration dermal animal studies were id entified. The targets of toxicity following dermal exposure cannot be identified because of the limited number of end points examined in the Ward (1928) study. No intermediate-duration dermal burn studi es were identified. Inhalation, oral, and dermal (nonburn and burn) exposure studies would be usef ul to determine the primary targets of white phosphorus toxicity and dose-res ponse relationships. There are populations surrounding hazardous waste sites that might be exposed to white phosphorus for similar durations. White Phosphorus Smoke. No human intermediate-duration inhalation exposure studies were located. In rats exposed to white phosphorus smoke for 6-13 w eeks, death and respiratory effects were observed (Brown et al. 1981). The very short daily exposure duration (15 minutes/day) precludes using these animal exposure studies as the basis of an intermedia te-duration inhalation MRL. It is not known if a longer daily exposure to white phosphorus smoke woul d be more toxic; interm ediate-duration exposure studies examining this effect would be useful. No human or animal inte rmediate-duration dermal exposure studies were located. Dermal exposure st udies examining a number of end points would be useful in determining targets of white phosphorus smoke toxicity. Chronic-Duration Exposure and Cancer White Phosphorus. There is limited information on the chr onic toxicity of white phosphorus. Increased mortality (Ward 1928), phossy jaw (Hughes 1944; Legge cough (Ward 1928), and a lterations in hematologi cal parameters (Ward 1928) have been observed in workers chronically exposed to airborne white phosphorus. Frequently these 137 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS workers were exposed by oral and dermal routes as well as the inhalation route. No chronic-duration animal inhalation studies were located. The chronic-dur ation inhalation exposure data suggest that the musculoskeletal system is one of the primary ta rgets of phosphorus; however, because these studies only examined a limited number of end points, other possi ble targets of toxicity cannot be excluded. The occupational exposure studies (Heimann 1946; Hugh es et al. 1962; Kennon and Hallam Legge 1920; Ward exposure thus, a chronic-duration inhalation MRL cannot be derived. Phossy jaw and altered hematological parame ters were observed in an individual orally exposed to white phosphorus (Jakhi et al. 1983). In the Ward (1928) study, workers were also exposed orally; the results of this study are presented above. One chronic- duration animal study was identified. In this study, musculoskeletal effects were observed (Fleming et al. 1942). Bone changes consisting of thickening of the epiphyseal line and extension of tr abeculae into the shaft were noted in all the animals, but not in the controls (Fleming et al. 1942). The skeletal system a ppears to be a target of white phosphorus toxicity. Other potential targets of toxicity (i.e., liver and kidney) cannot be identified because the Jakhi et al. (1983) and Ward (1928) human studies examined a limited number of end points, and it is unclear which tissues were examined in the Fleming et al. (1942) study. Because targets of toxicity have not been fully identified, a chronic-duration oral MRL could not be derived. Information on chronic-duration toxicity of white phosphorus following dermal (nonburn) exposure to white phosphorus is limited to the occupational exposure studies discussed above for inhalation. No ch ronic-duration nonburn dermal animal studies were identified. No chronic-duration dermal burn human or animal studies were located. Studies designed to identify potential targets of chroni c white phosphorus toxicity coul d be useful because water and soil sources near hazardous waste sites can be contaminated with white phosphorus. No information on the carcinogenic potential of wh ite phosphorus was located. Studies designed to assess carcinogenicity in animals after inhalation, oral, and dermal (nonburn and burn) exposure would be useful. White Phosphorus Smoke. No chronic-duration inhalation or dermal exposure studies for humans and animals were located. The availabl e intermediate-duration inhalation exposure study (Brown-et al. 1981) did not examine carcinogenic end points. Chronic- duration inhalation and dermal exposure studies that examine a number of end points as well as carcinogenicity would be useful in determining the targets of white phosphorus smoke toxicity as well as its carcinogenic potential. 138 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Genotoxicity White Phosphorus. No studies were located regarding in vivo genotoxic effects in humans or animals after inhalation, oral, or dermal (nonbur n and burn) exposure. In a standard in vitro Ames assay, white phosphorus was not genotoxic. Studies testing the in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity of white phosphorus would be useful. White Phosphorus Smoke . No information is available on the genotoxicity of white phosphorus smoke. Studies that examined the in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity of white phos phorus smoke would be useful. Reproductive Toxicity White Phosphorus. There is limited information on the repr oductive toxicity of white phosphorus. Uterine hemorrhaging and spontaneous abortion were observed in a woman ingesting a lethal dose of phosphorus (Hann and Veale 1910). Inte rmediate-duration oral exposure studies in rats have shown no effect on reproductive performance or histological damage to reproductive organs following exposure to relatively low doses (Bio/dynamics 1991; IRDC 1985). Acute, intermediate, and chronic duration parenteral studies have shown no histological altera tions in the testes (Fleming et al. 1942). Additional studies could help determine the potential of white phosphorus to induce reproductive effects at higher doses. Inhalation and dermal studies would provide in formation on reproductive toxicity by these routes. White Phosphorus Smoke . No reproductive performance effects or histological lesions on reproductive tissues were observed in male and female rats e xposed to white phosphorus smoke for intermediate durations (Brown et al. 1981). A limitation of this study is that the rats were exposed for a very short daily duration (15 minutes/day). Studies that involved l onger daily inhalation expos ures or dermal exposures would be useful to determine the potential for reproductive toxicity in humans exposed to white phosphorus smoke. Developmental Toxicity White Phosphorus. No information on developmental toxicity in humans was located. In two onegeneration reproduction studies, the incidence of developmen tal effects in rats orally exposed to white phosphorus was not significantly different from the incidence in vehicle-only controls (Bio/dynamics 139 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS 1991; IRDC 1985). These studies administered relativel y low doses of white phosphorus, and additional oral studies utilizing higher exposure levels could he lp determine the potential developmental toxicity of white phosphorus. Inhalation and dermal studies would provide information on developmental toxicity by these routes. White Phosphorus Smoke. Decreased body weight and survival we re observed in pups exposed to white phosphorus smoke in utero and during the lactation period (Brown et al. 1981; Starke et al. 1982). The authors suggested that these effects on the pups may be the result of impaired suckling. A study that tested this hypothesis would be useful in determining the potential of white phosphorus smoke to induce developmental effects. No dermal developmental t oxicity studies were located; studies examining this route would be useful in assessing human health risk. lmmunotoxicity White Phosphorus. Information on the immunotoxicity of white phosphorus is limited to case reports involving decreases in total leukocyte levels or changes in differential leukocyte counts following ingestion of a single dose of white phosphorus (Di az-Rivera et al. Newburger et al. 1948; Pietras et al. 1968), changes in total leukocyte levels in workers exposed to white phosphor us (inhalation, oral, and dermal exposures) for chronic duration (Ward 1928), hemorrhages in the thymus in children ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus (Dwyer and Helwig 1925; Humphreys and Halpert 1931), hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue and lymph nodes in a child ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus (Humphreys and Halpert 193 l), hyperplasia of splenic lymphoid corpuscles in a child ingesting a single dose of white phosphorus (Humphreys and Halpert 193 l), and leukocytosis in individuals burned by white phosphorus (Walker et al. 1947). No information on immunotoxicity in animal s was located. The human data suggest that the immune system is a target of white phosphorus toxic ity; however, no information on the potential of white phosphorus to impair immune functi on is available. Animal studies assessing the results of a battery of immune function tests could be useful in determ ining the immunotoxic potential of white phosphorus. Information on different routes of exposure could be useful in assessing if effects are route specific. White Phosphorus Smoke. No studies examining immunotoxicity following inhalation or dermal exposure to white phosphorus smoke were located. Animal studies assessing the results of a battery of 140 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS immune function tests would be useful in dete rmining the immunotoxic potential of white phosphorus smoke following inhalati on or dermal exposure. Neurotoxicity White Phosphorus. There is extensive information on overt ne urotoxicity in humans acutely ingesting white et al. 1972; Wechsler and Wechsler 1951) and several autopsy reports on histological damage in the brain (Humphreys and Halpert 193 1; Rao and Brown 1974; Wertham 1932). Neurotoxicity has also been observed in animals exposed to white phosphorus for acute or intermedia te duration (Bio/dynamics 1991; Ferraro et al. 1938; Frye and Cucuel 1969). The study conducted by Ferraro et al. (1938) demonstrated that the severity of the neurological damage was dose related. It is not known if the sever ity of the effects would also be duration-related; a study that examined this relation could be useful. In addition, no information on neurotoxicity following inhalation or dermal exposure in humans or animal s was located. Inhalation and dermal studies would be useful in determining whether the effects are route-specific. White Phosphorus Smoke. Information on the neurotoxicity of white phosphorus smoke is limited to an intermediate-duration study that examined the brain for histological lesions (Brown et al. 1981). Inhalation and dermal exposure studies examining a battery of neurological end points (including neurobehavioral effects) would be useful in assessing the neurotoxic potential of white phosphorus smoke. Epidemiological and Human Dosimetry Studies White Phosphorus. There are a great number of acute-duration human oral (Caley and, Kellock al. al. et al. and Pickering 1976; Wechsler Wechsler 1951) and several occupational exposure studies al. 1962; Kennon and HaIlam 1944; Legge 1920; Ward 1928). Because most individuals vomited shortly after ingesti on of white phosphorus, 141 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS the amount of white phosphorus available for absorption is not known. In the occupational exposure studies, the concentration of airborne white phosphorus was not reported. White phosphorus is still used in the munitions industry and further studies of these workers may yield more useful information on doseresponse relationships and provide qua ntifiable data that could be used to monitor individuals living near hazardous waste sites. White Phosphorus Smoke. There is limited information on the human toxicity of white phosphorus smoke. Respiratory effects have been observed fo llowing acute-duration exposure to white phosphorus smoke (Walker et al. 1947; White and Armstrong 1935). Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect White Phosphorus Exposure. The major data insufficiency with respect to bi omarkers is the lack of quantitative factors that can be measured either in-life or postmortem, a nd that are uniquely indicative of white phosphorus poisoning. This deficiency is related to the lack of definitive information regarding white phosphorus toxicokinetics. Because little is known about the fate of white phosphorus in the body, there are no substance-quantity or substance-presence tests that ar e currently available that indicate white phosphorus intoxication. Effect. There are a number of biomarkers of exposure for white phosphorus. Most of these biomarkers are not unique for white phosphorus; however, the combination of biomarkers of effect for several targets may be specific for white phosphorus. Studies that identified unique biomarkers for exposure and effect would be useful. White Phosphorus Smoke Exposure. No biomarkers of exposure were identified for white phosphorus smoke. In addition, no information on the metabolism of white phosphorus smoke were located. Studies designed to assess the metabolism of white phosphorus smoke would be useful in identifying biomarkers of exposure. Biomarkers of exposure are useful in facilitating future medical surveillance that can lead to early detection and possible treatment. 142 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Effect. There is limited available information on biomarkers of effect for white phosphorus smoke. Studies that assessed a number of sensitive biomarkers of respiratory irritation would be useful for the early detection of white phosphorus smoke-induced respiratory tract effects. Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion White Phosphorus. The pharmacokinetics database is inade quate. No quantitative information was located regarding absorption, distribution, metabolis m, or excretion following inhalation, dermal, and dermal burn exposure to white phos phorus. Definitive quantitative data on metabolic pathways following oral exposure to white phosphorus also are lacking. Da ta that were located on absorption, distribution, and excretion following oral exposure were helpful. They provided some time-related data, but provided no information regarding comparisons between various dose levels. White Phosphorus Smoke . No information on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of white phosphorus smoke were located. Toxicokinetic studies would be useful in assessing the risk to human health following exposure to white phosphorus smoke. Comparative Toxicokinetics White Phosphorus. No studies were located that provided info rmation regarding target organs following inhalation and dermal (no burn) exposure to white phosphorus. Similarities in organ-specific systemic effects between humans and animals indicate that the same organs are targeted following oral and dermal burn exposure to white phosphorus. No toxicokinetic studies have been performed on humans. Thus, the appropriateness of animals as models of white phosphorus toxicokinetics in humans is unknown. A similar tissue distribution of orally administered radiolabeled white phosphorus was observed in rats, rabbits, and mice. It seems reasonable to expect that tissue distribution in humans would be similar. No other multiple species studies were located. White Phosphorus Smoke. Based on the limited available informati on on the toxicity of airborne white phosphorus smoke, it appears that humans and animal s have similar targets of concern. Toxicokinetic studies in a variety of animal species would be useful in determining which animal species is an appropriate model for human toxi city to white phosphorus smoke. 143 WHITE PHOSPHORUS 2. HEALTH EFFECTS Methods for Reducing Toxic Effects White Phosphorus. There is limited information on the mech anisms of absorption of white phosphorus for any of the routes of exposure. Information on reducing peak absorption following acute oral exposure (Diaz-Rivera 1950), after white 91), and after acute eye exposure (Scherling and Blondis 1945) is available. No information on reducing absorption following inhalation exposure was located. No studies were located regarding methods for reduci ng body burden or methods for interfering with the mechanism of action for toxic effects. Also, no defi nitive studies were located regarding the metabolic fate of white phosphorus after absorption. Therefore, studies elucidating metabolic pathways would be helpful as baseline data for developi ng methods for reducing body burden. White Phosphorus Smoke. There are limited data for assessing methods for reducing the toxic effects of white phosphorus smoke. Studies that examine absorption would be useful in assessing methods for preventing absorption of white phosphorus smoke. St udies examining the distribution and metabolism of the white phosphorus smoke would be useful for determining methods for reducing the body burden of toxic compounds following exposure to white phos phorus smoke. Studies designed to establish methods for the mitigation of the respiratory tract effects observed in humans and animals exposed to airborne white phosphorus smoke would be useful in treati ng individuals exposed to white phosphorus smoke. 2.10.3 On-going Studies White Phosphorus. No on-going research studies pertaining to white phosphorus were located. White Phosphorus Smoke. No on-going research studies pertaini ng to white phosphorus smoke were located. "}
