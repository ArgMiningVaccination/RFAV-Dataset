Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular disease (CVD), Chronic Respiratory Diseases and Common Mental Disorders are major causes of disability and premature mortality. They entail not only adverse health but economic and developmental consequences. The rising burden of NCDs has generated an overall concern globally to formulate and implement effective strategies for their prevention and control. In India, a national programme on cancer control was already ongoing for more than three decades. It was decided to integrate this programme with the NCD control programme and the National Programme for prevention and control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseas es and Stroke (NPCDCS) was launched in October 2010. The objectives of this programme include preventing and controlling NCDs through behaviour and life -style changes; providing early diagnosis and management of common NCDs; building capacity at various le vels of health care; training human resources adequately and establishing palliative and rehabilitative care. The NPCDCS revised guidelines (2013 -2017) seek to create adequate community resources for effective prevention, detection, referral and treatment through convergence/linkage with the ongoing interventions of the National Health Mission (NHM) including programmes such as the National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP), National Mental Health Programme (NMHP), National Programme for Health Care of the E lderly (NPHCE) for NCDs, programmes that deal with communicable diseases like TB, as well as programmes like the RCH/Adolescent/School Health etc. Towards this objective, it becomes important to train the health workforce in understanding the risk factors for NCDs in general and the preventable risk factors in particular. This will enable health personnel in the promotion of healthy lifestyles, reduction of risk factors, early identification and intervention, as well as encouraging treatment compliance and follow -up. As reducing many of the risk factors involves behavioural change, health personnel need to be trained to acquire the knowledge and skills to engage clinical and community populations, motivate them to change, initiate and maintain healthy behav iours that will ensure optimal health of the people. 4 A series of training manuals has thus been developed for different categories of health providers, including medical officers, counsellors and community health workers. Various experts have been involved in the development of these manuals. The National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore, was given the primary responsibility for developing the manualised training programmes. An expert group meeting held in Bangalore on 6 and 7 Februa ry 2014 provided the headstart for the manual development with suggestions on the content, format and delivery of the training. The draft manuals were developed by the NIMHANS team and revised based on the reviews of external experts. These manuals were th en field tested and further revised. A second meeting of experts held at New Delhi on August 13, 2014 reviewed the final drafts and provided further suggestions on refinement as well as rolling out. Optimal behaviour change occurs when persons have the knowledge of risks associated with a particular behaviour , the benefits of changing, the way in which change is possible and supported for such change. The medical officer needs an understanding of effective and brief c ounselling strategies that can be used in the busy clinical setting. The medical officer has a responsibility both for early diagnosis and intervention for NCDs as well as for the prevention of NCDs. Effective counselling can help to motivate persons to ch ange, improve treatment adherence and help them to maintain such changes. We hope medical officers will use these training session s effectively and be agents of change in a community. What they do will have a major impact on reducing the burden from non -communicable diseases in India. 5 LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AIIMS - All India Institute of Medical Sciences ANM - Auxiliary Nurse Midwife AUDIT - Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test BMI - Body Mass Index CD - Communicable Diseases CHW - Community Health Worker CO - Carbon Monoxide COPD - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COTPA - Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act DALY - Disability Adjusted Life Years DASH - Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension DM - Diabetes Mellitus FIT- Frequency Intensity and Timing of exercise GOI - Government of India ICMR - Indian Council of Medical Research MO - Medical Officer NCD - Non Communicable Disease NFHS - National Family Health Survey NHM - National Health Mission NIMHANS - National Instit ute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences NIN - National Institute of Nutrition NPCDCS - National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke NRT - Nicotine Replacement Therapy PHC - Primary Health Care QPE - Quality Physical Education SHG - Self help groups SHS - Second hand smoke TCC - Tobacco Cessation Clinic WHO - World Health Organization 6 CONTENTS PAGE Introduction to the Training Manual Notes to the F acilitator Training Schedule 7 8 13 Session s: 1.

An ideal facilitator for this manualised training would be a professional with a background in health, preferably public or mental health or humanities with a good knowledge of health a nd health behaviour change. The facilitator would need to have a good understanding of non -communicable diseases and their management, as well as risk factors that mediate these disorders. The facilitator would need to have knowledge of the NCD burden in I ndia. In addition, she/he should be an effective facilitator with good communication and motivating skills. A working knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of the medical officers as well as other staff of the PHC would help the facilitator to train the medical officer in two important ways. The first is to both to provide intervention to patients that aim to address reduction of risks to NCDs. The second is to co - manage such risk reduction by interacting with and guiding the NCD counsellors and commu nity health workers and ensuring that the patient's attempts to reduce risk are reinforced by the other health care providers. The facilitator must e mphasiz e on the multidisciplinary team approach as the best approach to NCD risk reduction. Most importantly, the facilitator should be passionate about improving the health and well -being of our communities and convey to the participant medical officers that behaviour change is possible and can significantly reduce risk for many of the non - comm unicable disorders. It would be desirable to have a co -facilitator who could conduct some of the sessions, answer questions, involve silent participants, distribute the handouts and make the sessions more lively and interactive. 8 Notes to the F acilitator The training manual is planned for 3 days and will cover the following areas: 1. Introduction to risk factors and NCDs 2. Tobacco use 3. Alcohol use 4. Unhealthy diet 5. Physical inactivity 6. Teamwork and developing an integrated approach Each of the 5 risk factors is dealt separately. The training of the medical officers can either be conducted as a continuous 3 day programme or as standalone sessions for each risk factor. Teamwork and developing an integrated approach is the last session describing how the medical officer will work along with other health care providers as a multidisciplinary team in primary care. - A timetable with specific contents and approximate time allocated for each risk factor is given. The facilitator is free to decide how to use this time to plan each session. Format of the training: - 1. Registration and Pre -training assessment. The participants should be advised to register themselves at least half an hour prior to starting the training programme on Day 1. The Pre - training assessment can be handed to each participant soon after they register and the filled forms collected prior to Session 1. Further de tails are provided under the section on pre and post-training assessment. 2. Introduction on Day 1 : The facilitator will open the session on Day I using an ice breaker. The participants will pair off and get to know each other (discuss about what one likes to eat, favourite movies, songs and so on).The aim is to gather information about the person and introduce him/ her to the group. This activity will take about 30 minutes. 3. Opening and Closing session : Each day will open with a 15 minute session on wh at was discussed and learnt the previous day. The closing session at the end of the day is to summarize what was discussed. The opening and closing session as an exercise is to link different risk factors and NCDs together as a whole. 9 Duration: 15 minutes INSTRUCTION Open the day by inviting participants to share what they learnt from the previous day's programme. It is worth taking some time over the opening session as the aim is to link one risk factor to another and so on. A sample question is provided below. Prompt question: Could some of you share about what you learnt and understood from the previous day's sessions? For instance, what was the risk factor (s) that was discussed and what action will the medical officer tak e? CLOSING SESSION (at the end of each day) INSTRUCTION Close the day by inviting participants to share what they learnt from the day's sessions. It is worth taking some time over the closing session and give time to participants to share how they will transfer what they have learnt back to the field. Remember to link one risk factor to another and so on. A sample question is provided below. Prompt question: Could some of you share about what you take back from today's sessions? For instance, what was the risk factor (s) that was discussed and what action will the medical officer take? 4. Content of each session (covering risk factors): - Presentation of information: The facilitator's style is interactive and generates discussion throughout with the purpose of linking the contents to how the medical officer will actually use it in the clinic . The slides used in the power point presentation have been linked with the training manual to make it easy for the facilitator. - Format: Each risk factor begins with an introduction, broad aim and specific objectives. 10 - INSTRUCTION given at the beginning of each objective gives the facilitator instructio ns about the session. - Notes to the facilitator give instructions about how an activity is to be conducted. It gives simple steps for the facilitator to follow. - Duration: Approximate time for the entire presentation of each risk factor (e.g. diet, tobacc o etc) and for each activity is given. The facilitator can use this time frame to plan sessions. - Activities : Activities during each training session may be : Brainstorming or whole group interaction , indicated by the letter ' B' and the symbol Group activity or discussion in small groups, indicated by the letter GA and the symbol Individual Activity , indicated by letter IA the symbol Role Play is indicated by the letter RP and symbol - Facilitator's reading material: The facilitator should read the material before the session. Sources for specific information are quoted and included as references in the footnotes. - Handouts: Copies of handouts will be made before the session and distributed either before or after the session. List of handouts are included at the end of each session. - Power point presentation: A DVD containing the power point presentations accompanies the training manual. The slides for each session are reproduced in the manual to aid the facilitators. - Annexure s are at the end of the manual. - Materials for the training need to be arranged in advance and they are as follows: LCD projector, writing board and markers or chalk, chart papers and felt pens, drawing pins to display charts, paper and pens for individual work, tables (for group work) and chairs. - Before beginning the introduction session, the facilitator can invite questions regarding the training content. Instruct participants about: - Various administrative arrangements for the training (stay, food, travel etc) - Go over the training schedule 11 - Distribute files and writing material - Introduce the facilitators and co -coordinators for the workshop - Tell the trainees about arrangements for drin king water, location of restrooms and answer questions regarding any other arrangements. 12 PRE/ POST TRAINING EVALUATION AND FEEDBACK Instructions to the Facilitator : - The facilitator will make two sets of the evaluation questionnaire, one for the pre -training evaluation and one for post -training evaluation. - Pre - training questionnaire will be distributed soon after registration before the session begins (Day1). The facilitator will instruct the participants to tick the appropriate answer to each question. The facilitator/co -facilitator should collect all the response sheets and keep them carefully, as it is necessary to compare this with the post -training evaluation - On the last day of training, a similar set is distributed (post - training). Pa rticipants are asked to fill out the questionnaire which is then collected prior to the valedictory - An assessment of the change in the responses will be useful for the facilitator to gauge how much the participants learnt from the training. - In addition to the post -training evaluation, a feedback about the training will also be useful to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the programme and make improvements for further training programmes. - The Response Key is provided separately to help the facilitat or mark the correct responses. Additional information is also provided along with the Response Key as it may help the facilitator discuss and clarify some of the concepts during the training programme. The Pre -training and Post training evaluation questi onnaire, training feedback forms and Response Key are provided as Annexures. 13 Training Schedule TIME DAY 1 DAY 2 DAY 3 9.00-10.30 WELCOME INTRODUCTION TO RISK FACTORS AND NCDs RECAP ALCOHOL USE CONTD PHYSICAL INACTIVITY CONTD. 10.30 -11.00 TEA TEA TEA 11.00 -1.00 TOBACCO USE UNHEALTHY DIET STRESS 1.00-1.45 LUNCH LUNCH LUNCH 1.45-3.30 TOBACCO USE CONTD.

They have a prolonged course and can lead to functional impairment , disability or death . Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and common mental disorders (e.g. depression and anxiety) are common NCDs. Socio -cultural and technological advances, changes in lifestyle and behaviour have all played a r ole in the rise of NCDs. Cardiovascular Diseases In developing nations, altered diets and diminished physical activity are critical factors contributing to the acceleration of CVD epidemics, along with tobacco use1. CVDs are the leading cause of mortality in India. One in every fo urth death is attributable to CVDs. Populations as well as individuals at risk must be protected through initiatives that take into account nutrition -based and other preventive strategies to protect and promote cardiovascular heal th. Diabetes In India, a disturbing trend in recent years is the shift in age of onset of diabetes to a younger age, its increase among the poor , in urban slum dwellers, in the middle class and even in the rural areas. Rapid changes in physical activity an d dietary habits are attributed as causes. Early 1 Reddy, K.S. Cardiovascular diseases in the developing countries: dimensions, determinants, dynamics and directions for public health action. Public Health Nutrition 2002; 5 (1A): 231 -237 17 identification of at -risk individuals and appropriate lifestyle intervention are recommended to prevent or postponing the onset of diabetes2. Cancer Rates of cancer are expected to double by 20303. Where to bacco use in men is concerned, nearly half of all cancers at specific sites are associated with its use (35.6% to 50.0% in the six population based registries). The sites include: mouth (oral cavity), lip and hypopharynx, pharynx, oeso phagus, larynx, lung and urinary bladder. In women, nearly one fifth of cancers occur at these sites, (10.1% to 17.3% in the six Registries), predominantly in oesophagus and oral cavity4. Childhood cancers also appear to be on the rise in India.5 Chronic Respiratory Diseases Chronic respiratory disorders (including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, occupational lung disease and sleep related breathing disorders) are estimated to become the third leading cause of death by 20306. Low- and middl e-income countries already shoulder much of the burden of COPD with almost 90% of COPD deaths taking place in these countries7. Common Mental Disorders Depression is among the top ten causes of disease burden8. Meta -analytic studies (analysis of multiple research studies) have shown that anxiety and depression increase the risk of coronary artery disease in healthy populations by 26% to 81%9,10. The prevalence of major depression is consistently higher for pers ons with physical illnesses than for those without these disorders; e.g. 29% with hypertension, 22% with myocardial infarction, 27% with diabetes, and 33% with cancer11. Many researchers have evaluated the prevalence of 2Mohan VS. Sandeep R, Deepa BS, Varghese C. Epidemiology of type 2 d iabetes: Indian scenario.

Pathways leading to co - morbidity of mental disorders and other NCDs are bi -directional and care for persons with these conditions needs to be addressed under primary care. Slide 2 NEED FOR TRAINING India has adual burden of both communicable & non -communicable diseases (NCDs) NCDs rising as a 'new epidemic' (WHO, 2011) OUT OF EVERY 1000 INDIANS: -159.5 have hypertension -100 have mental health disorders -37 have ischaemic heart disease -62.5 have diabetes About 28 lakh persons have cancer 2IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BURDEN DUE TO NCDs IS RISING: About 80% deaths from NCDs Nearly one in three NCD deaths occur below age of 60 This training is about how behavioural factors such as tobacco and alcohol use, unhealthy diet , physical inactivity and stress are leading causes of such deaths All arepotentially preventable There is a need for training health care providers in developing countries. Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) account for approximately 6 8% of all causes of deaths across the world13. In low and middle income countries (LMIC), the burden due to NCDs is rising rapidly and nearly 80 percent of deaths from NCDs are from LMIC. Further evidence shows that 29 percent of NCD deaths in these countries occur below the age of 60. Among various causes, behavioural factors such as tobacco use, alcohol use, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity are leading causes of such deaths which are potentially preventable. In India, we presently have a dual burden of both communicable and non -communicable diseases (NCDs). The prevalence of NCDs is, however, increasing and NCDs will become the 'new epidemic'. 12 Shankar B.R, Saravanan B, Jacob K.S (2006).

In 2003, approximately 30 million suffered from coronary heart disease14. Out of every 1000 Indians: 159 hav e hypertension (about 300/100 in urban areas) 37 have ischaemic heart disease (about 100/1000 in urban areas) 62.5 have diabetes (about 100/1000 in urban areas)15 There are an estimated 28 lakh persons with cancer. The number of persons with hypertension is likely to nearly double by 202516. In 2000, India had the highest number of diabetics in the world, followed by China and the United States.17 While the global prevalence of diabetes is likely to double by 2030, the maximum increase is likely to be seen in India. More than 10 lakh (1 million) new cancers are diagnosed each year in India, leading to 6 -7 lakh deaths from cancer each year (figure for 2012)18 Slide 3 AIM OF TRAINING The Medical Officer will be able to identify risk factors leading to NCDs in patients coming to the Health Centre, offer intervention, as well as involve others in the primary care team 3 14 Ministry of Health, Government of India.

INSTRUCTION Discuss the risk factors and NCDs and how they are interrelated. Generate discussion among participants to give examples from their fie ld settings. Total duration: 1 hour approximately Slide 4 WHAT IS A RISK FACTOR? 4Any attribute, characteristic, or exposure in an individual, increasing the likelihood of developing A non communicable disease It influences risk throughout the life course For example, a positive family history of heart disease or diabetes is a risk factor which increases the risk for the disease in the individual. Overweight and obesity are risk factors for many diseases. Use of tobacco and alcohol are risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing an NCD. Risk factors change throughout a person's life span and exposure to risk factors in child hood can have serious effects later in life. 21 Slide 5 RISK FACTORS AND NCDs BIOLOGICAL FACTORS Family History Age GenderPHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS Being overweight, obesity Raised blood pressure Raised blood glucose Raised total cholesterol 5BEHAVIOURAL FACTORS Stress Tobacco Alcohol Unhealthy diet Physical inactivityENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS Air pollution Food preservatives, adulterants, artificial colours Indoor smoke (from fuels)NON -MODIFIABLE MODIFIABLE NON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES Risk factors for NCDs can be classified as physiological, behavioural and environmental; or as non-modifiable and modifiable. There are also biological risk factors where there can be family history of illnesses, age and gender that contribute to disease. Physiological risk factors are being overweight, obesity, raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose and raised total cholesterol. Behavioural risk factors are stress, use of tobacco, alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical activity that can be modified. Other factors that add to risk include environmental factors such as air pollution, food preservatives, adulterants, artificial colour and indoor smoke from fuels. Behavioural risk factors: According to the World Health Organization19 risk factors that are behavioural or physiological and hence modifiable are tobacco and harmful alcohol use, unhealthy diet (low fruit and vegetable intake), physical inactivity and stress. Alcohol consumption especially binge drinking leads to hypertension, stroke and in som e atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy. To address these risk factors, primary prevention and health promotion is part of management. Social factors like poverty, living conditions and cultural practices can influence risk for NCDs. Risk factors can also be thought of as proximal or recent (e.g. recent lifestyle) or distal or a long time in the past (e.g. childhood undernutrition or obesity). 19World Health Organization. Non communicable diseases fact sheet. January 2015. http:// who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs355/en/ 22 Slide 6 RISK FACTORS ARE WORTH TREATING 6II Rise of NCDs and high costs of treatment Lack of awareness about risk factors Unhealthy lifestyles Need for simple prevention at early stages and health education NEED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE BURDEN OF COSTS Risk factors are worth treating: Lack of awareness of risk factors, poor technical competence at different health interventions and high costs of treatment play a role in the rise of NCDs. For instance, the reason for developing diabetes and heart attacks at an early age is largely due t o poor consumption of fruits and vegetables, unhealthy diet, increased use of tobacco and alcohol and a sedentary lifestyle. There is a need for simple public health interventions to tackle major NCD risk factors through urgent preventive action at early s tages. Primary prevention through health education and secondary prevention through case management of NCDs and their common risk factors are sustainable and cost effective. Slide 7 DIABETES CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES CANCER COMMON MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS STRESS ALCOHOL TOBACCOPHYSICAL INACTIVITYUNHEALTHY DIET IMPACT OF RISK FACTORS ON NCDs 7 CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISORDERS Age Poverty Gender Illiteracy Occupation Risk factors can occur together Higher the levels, higher the risk 23 Various risk factors can occur together : For instance , one person can have high blood pressure, high blood sugar, obesity as well as dyslipidemia (persons with higher levels have higher risks) and small elevations of risk factors are much more harmful than isolated elevation of single risk factor s). Age, poverty, gender, levels of education and occupation play a role in the development of the NCDs: The Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) -NCD risk factors survey (2007 -2008)20, Phase -I was carried out in seven states of household coverage was 4905. Some of the findings were as follows: Tobacco and alcohol use : In India, one in three adults used tobacco in any form . This includes nearly one in two males and one in five females who use tobacco.21. A similar pattern of increasing prevalence with age and decreasing with level of education was also observed with current alcohol drinkers and use of tobacco and alcohol use starte d at a younger age contributing to the high risk of NCD at later ages. Physical inactivity was the leading cause of diabetes, hypertension and coronary heart disease: More female respondents were in the category of low physical activity as compare d with males across all the age groups. Rural population was doing more physical work than urban. High prevalence of excess weight was recorded in all the age groups except the younger age and was prevalent in both sexes, but higher in urban population compare wi th rural. Unhealthy diet was a major risk factor of many NCDs: High proportion of population was taking inadequate amount of fruits and vegetables which increases the risk of NCD. Its distribution across all age groups, education, occupation and residenc e was found very high. Overall, NCD risk factors were prevalent across all socioeconomic and demographic categories of population in phase -I states. RISK FACTORS AND NCDs: Tobacco use is a known or probable cause of many diseases including heart disea se; cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary dise ase and digestive tract disease and also has significant adverse effects on pregnancy. Smokeless tobacco use causes oral cancer of the lip, tongue, mouth, and throat areas and digestive system cancers. Chronic respiratory diseases like asthma 20 National Institute of Medical Statistics, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), 2009,IDSP Non -Communicable Disease Risk Factors Survey, Phase -I States of India, 2007 -08.National Institute of Medical Statistics and Division of Non -Communicable Diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India. 21Global Adult Tobacco Survey India 2009 -2010.

Alcohol use is linked to many diseases and injury conditions including liver cirrhosis, several cancers (liver, laryngeal, esophageal and orpharyngeal cancers), injuries and hemorrhagic strokes. 5.1% of the global burden of disease and injury was attributable to alcohol as meas ured in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) .22 Diet with a low consumption of fruit and vegetables has been identified as a risk factor in the development of a range of chronic diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke and many forms of cancer. Diet rich in salt, sugar, saturated/ transfat s are considered unhealthy. Lack of physical activity leads to obesity, dyslipidemia (lower high -density lipoprotein levels), insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus , as well as high blood pressure. Physical inactivity is a well - established risk factor for coronary hear t disease (CHD) and is associated with about a two -fold increase in risk of CHD. Stress is known to worsen physical conditions and can come in the way of seeking help, treatment adherence and outcome23. Modifiable risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol may be used to cope with stress . Stress can also impact diet and physical activity.

THOSE WITH AN IDENTIFIED NCD Provide awareness about healthy lifestyles Modify risk factors & identify NCDs early Treat NCDs & modify risk factors Modify risk factors In terms of populations to be addressed by the medical officer, the circles indicate 4 groups and their levels of interventions: 1. Those with an identified NCD: This group will benefit from appropriate treatment of the NCD, an assessment of risk factors and guidance to modify the risk factors for better control of the NCD, preventing other NCDs and preventing complication s from the NCD. 2. Those with risk factors and undiagnosed NCD: This group will benefit from early detection and intervention for the NCD and guidance to modify the risk factors. 3. Those with risk factors but no NCD: This group will benefit from guidance to modify the risk factors to lower risk for NCD and early warning signals. 4. Health persons without risk factors: This group will benefit from enc ouragement to lead a healthy lifestyle with awareness on risk factors and ways of avoiding them. The interventions are best carried out by a multi -disciplinary team working both in the community and in the health clinic. 24Frieden TR. A framework for public health action.

Addressing risk factors is a component of the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancers, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS): According to the Operational Guidelines (NPCDCS), services in primary care include health promotion, psycho -social counseling and simple steps to manage the health problem25. Health education includes promoting a healthy diet and physical activity, weight reduction, early diagnosis and screening. These services would become a part of existing primary health care and referrals to district hospitals and above would be needed for more specialized health care for NCDs. The NPCDCS operational guidelines have bee n modified in 201326 (annexure 5) and circulated to all states. 25Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.

Severe cases will be referred to specialists and the District Hospital for further management but can be counselled regarding the importance of reducing risk factors prior to referral and at follow -up. Slide 12 WORKING EFFECTIVELY Listen to the person and recognise distress Understand factors contributing to health conditions Gain patient's trust and confidence to make lifestyle changes Engage patient to understand their health status and their role to improve health Provide support to improve health Promote treatment adherence, arrange referral and follow up 12A physician should be an effective listener -Be objective, non- judgmental -Inform role of Counselor and Community Health Worker 28 As part of general medical practice, physicians come across patients with bodily complaints and excessive health concerns . In such a scenario, Medical Officers may be generally uncomfortable in taking up the role of a counselor and providing a comfortable environment to talk about their 'real - life stresses ( this is often attributed to lack or inadequate training to recognize emotional needs of patients or to lack of time )27. A few minutes of advice from a physician can result in significant behaviour chang e. Developing the ability to lis ten and give complete attention can greatly enhance the trust and confidence between the patient and doctor. This is often important in improving the patient's motivation and efforts to make lifestyle changes . It can help th e patient to recognise how emotional distress can affect health, how he/she can play an important role in improving his/her own health, both by treatment adherence and addressing risk factors. Being objective, non - judgemental and linking the patient to o ther health care providers is part of the process. Slide 13 MEDICAL OFFICERS AS CHAMPIONS FOR NCD CONTROL Lead by setting an example Provide health education Promote healthy lifestyles in schools Workplace interventions for healthy lifestyles Train other health care providers on risk factors for NCDs and promote behavioral change in the communityBeing champions in addressing risk factors Medical Officers can lead by setting an example and become champions in addressing risk factors and NCDs in primary care in the community. They can influence the public and be change -makers in society in a number of ways viz. public talks, communication t hrough audio -visual media, messages on social networks, participation in school and workplace programmes on health and wellness and by being advocates of healthy lifestyle by themselves adopting these practices. 27Murthy S, Isaac MK, Chandrashekar CR, Kishore Kumar KV.

According to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (2010)28, 47% of men and 20% of women use tobacco in either smoking or smokeless forms. Tobacco causes a variety of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease and respiratory diseases. It kills more than AIDS, legal and illegal d rugs, road accidents, murder and suicide put together29. One in ten adult deaths globally are attributed to tobacco use. Of the global deaths due to ischaemic heart disease, 11% are attributed to tobacco use. More than 70% of deaths from lung, trachea and bronchus cancers are attributable to tobacco use30. Poor awareness : Unfortunately, most people are unaware about the dangers of tobacco use and cannot name specific diseases caused by tobacco use other than cancer. People may generally know that tobacco u se is harmful, and view it as a bad habit , but believe they can reduce or stop tobacco use well in time before health problems occur. Dangers about tobacco use have not been adequately explained. Even among those who are aware, most tobacco users will be u nable to quit by themselves and up to half of them will die from tobacco -related illnesses. In India, smokeless tobacco use is widely accepted among both men and women31. 28 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) Fact Sheet India: 2009 -2010. http:// nccd.cdc.gov/gtssdata/Ancillary/DownloadAttachment.aspx?ID=964 29Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Murthy P, Nattala P, WM 290) 33 The Non -Communicable Disease Risk Factors Survey, Phase -I States of India, 2007 -08 in seven states of India studied tobacco as a risk factor found that increasing pattern of prevalence was seen with increasing age of people and a declining pattern of prevalence with increasing level of education. Prevalence of tobacco use among the occupat ion of agriculture and manual worker s was high compared with others. Tobacco use and health problems32: There are many diseases including NCDs associated with tobacco use. Tobacco causes harm independent of other risk factors. Tobacco use is directly related to many NCDs. Tobacco use also occurs with other risk factors such as alcohol, stress (tobacco used to cope), poor diet practices and inadequate physical act ivity. - Heart and circulatory system: hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarction, strokes and peripheral arterial disease. Smokers have a two -to three fold greater risk of suffering sudden cardiac death than non -smokers, the risk i ncreasing with increased exposure to cigarette smoke. - Increased CVDs along with raised body lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), obesity, physical inactivity, poor nutrition and excessive alcohol consumption. Diabetes can also increase the risk of CVDs. - Oro-pharynx/larynx: inflammation, ulcers, pre cancerous conditions and cancers, including cancers of pancreas, kidney, urinary bladder. Active smoking is responsible for a majority of lung cancer -related deaths aged over 35. Smokers are ten times more li kely to die from lung cancer than non -smokers, and heavy smokers are 15 to 25 times more at risk than non-smokers. Duration and intensity of smoking can influence the risk of developing lung cancer and heavy smokers have upto 20 times the risk of developin g laryngeal cancers compared with non -smokers. - Bidi smokers have a two -fold higher risk of developing oral cancer and five times higher risk of developing cancer of the base of the tongue and oropharynx than non -smoker s. - Strokes: Smokers are at two to four times the risk of having a stroke than non -smokers and those with hypertension are at a much higher risk for haemorrhagic stroke. - Respiratory system: cancer, tuberculosis, asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease - Sexual and reproductive system: erectile dy sfunction (men), impaired menstrual cycle, early menopause (women), reduced fertility, cancers - Immune system: reduced immune response, increased infection - Bones: brittle bones, osteoporosis - Skin, eye and ear diseases: psoriasis, cataract, macular degenerat ion, ear infections - Smokers report higher levels of tiredness or fatigue, reduced well -being and satisfaction with life and have increased incidence of psychological symptoms such as depressed mood and anxiety 32 World Hea lth Organization.

Murthy P, Mohan M, (NLM classification: WM 290) 34 - Smokeless tobacco also causes many of the tobacco -related diseases that smoking causes. - In South Asia, 90% of patients with oral cancers are tobacco chewers and the risk is higher among those who use both tobacco and alcohol This session on tobacco use will help the Medical Officers to understa nd the linkages of tobacco to other risk factors and non -communicable diseases. The objectives are to identify tobacco use as a risk factor, intervene to help tobacco users to stop tobacco use and involve of other health care providers in preventing tobacc o use and providing support for cessation. Total duration: 2hours 45 minutes approximately Slide 2 AIM The Medical Officer will be able to identify and intervene to address tobacco use as a risk factor for NCDs in primary care 35 Slide 3 LEARNING OBJECTIVES A.IDENTIFY tobacco use as a risk factor for NCDs (Ask and Assess) B.INTERVENE to provide support for tobacco cessation (Advise and Assist) C.INVOLVE other health care providers in the prevention of tobacco use and support for cessation (Arrange) 3 I's INSTRUCTION Play a small video clip to highlight the harm caused by tobacco.

Diagrams and flowcharts can be used to illustrate the linkages. Slide 5 & 6 WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY TOBACCO USE? TOBACCO USE AND ITS EFFECT ON HEALTH Brain: strokes Bones: brittle bones, osteoporosis Immune system: reduced immune response, increased infection Sexual and reproductive system : erectile dysfunction (men ), impaired menstrual cycle , early menopause (women ), reduced fertility, cancers Heart and circulatory system : hypertension, heart disease , heart attacks, coronary and other artery disease , peripheral vascular disease Oro-pharynx/larynx: inflammation , ulcers, precancerous and cancers Physical appearance: premature ageing, alopecia, tooth decay Skin, eye and ear psoriasis , cataract, macular degeneration , ear system: cancer , tuberculosis, asthma , lung disease Pregnancy and babies: miscarriages, stillbirths , pre -term delivery, low birth weight , sudden infant death syndrome, developmental impairments There are 4000 chemicals in one cigarette and 3000 chemicals in one gutka packet33. The Medical Officer can use this information when giving advice to patients on the harmful use of tobacco on health. Slide 7 BDoes tobacco use only affect the person who uses it? 7 Generate discussion and write the points on the board. 33National Cancer Institute. Second hand smoke: questions and answers 2010, http://cancer.gov/images/Documents/3770da1d - 1c3a -4a1c -905f-944140049158/Fs10_18.pdf CHEMICALS IN TOBACCO AND THEIR ACTION ON HEALTH Nicotine: Its effects are as a powerful addictive drug that causes increase in heart rate and blood pressure. It has adverse effects on cardio vascular health Carbon Monoxide: Acts as an added stress factor to precipitate cardiovascular diseases. It combines with haemoglobin to form carboxyhaemoglobin that reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood Hydrogen cyanide and acrolein : Respiratory irritants that paralyse cillary movement Phenol: It producing chemical Polyaromatic hydrocarbons carcinogens Tobacco -specific nitrosamines (TSNAs): It is a carcinogen 3000 chemicals in one gutka packet. 4000 chemicals in one cigarette 37 Slide 8 SECONDHAND SMOKERS When someone is present with an active smoker in a room, the breathable air is contaminated by the smoke. People around are also being exposed to the same toxic gases as the person Second Hand Smoke When someone is present with an active smoker in a room, the breathable air is contaminated by the smoke. That means people around are also being exposed to the same toxic gases as the person. A 'passive smoker ' is therefore at risk to develop cancers, hea rt and lung diseases as the active smokers. Second hand smoke is a complex mix of thousands of chemicals. At least 50 substances in second hand smoke have been shown to cause cancer that can enter the body through the lungs before being absorbed into the b lood stream. Slide 9 Indoor air pollution Common household pollutants can cause allergies, acute poisoning, developmental problems among children and NCDs Tobacco smokeSolid fuelsFungus growing on damp surfaces Dust miteMosquito coils 38 Other environmental pollutants In additional to tobacco smoke, persons living in the household may be exposed to multiple other environmental pollutants that have serious health consequences. One major source of indoor air pollution in India is smoke from the use of solid fuels (wood, coal, charcoal, dung, crop wastes). Women and young children are often the first victims of indoor smoke -related acute and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses . Other consequences that have been described are peri - natal adverse outcomes like still -birth and low birth weight34, cancers of the nasopharynx, larynx, lung and leukaemias35. According to WHO estimates, in 2012, 4.3 million people die prematurely each year across the world due to household air pollution36. The incompletely burned combustion products of biomass fuels include suspended particulate matter, carbon monoxide, polyar omatic hydrocarbons, polyorganic matter, formaldehyde, etc., which have adverse effects on health. The combustion of coal results in production of oxides of sulfur, arsenic, and fluorine. Pollutants such as aldehydes, volatile, and semivolatile organic compounds are produced from resins, waxes, polishing materials, cosmetics, and binders. Biological pollutants like dust mites, mo ulds, pollen, and infectious agents produced in stagnant water, mattresses, carpets, and humidifiers also pollute indoor air .37 Indoor air pollution may also have an impact on outcome of tuberculosis, cataract, asthma, cardiovascular health, and cancers.

NICOTINE IN TOBACCO MAKES THE PERSON ADDICTIVE 11THINK OF QUITTING BUT UNABLE TO QUIT OCCASIONAL USE CONTINUED USE THE CHEMICAL NICOTINE EXCITES THE PLEASURE PATHWAY IN THE BRAIN BECOMES A HABIT (HOLDING/LIGHTING A BIDI) How does tobacco cause addiction? Once inside the brain, nicotine, like most addictive drugs, triggers the release of chemicals associated with euphoria and pleasure. Like other substances finally there is release of dopami ne at the pleasure centre and continued use causes dependence . In addition to chemical effects, experience of holding and lighting a cigarette or b idi, associating a smoke with coffee, alcohol or food, can maintain the habit. According to Global Adult Tob acco Survey, about 46% of current smokers and 45% of users of smokeless tobacco planned to quit or thought about quitting. Less than half (46% ) of smokers and just about one -quarter (27%) of users of smokeless tobacco were advised to quit by a health care provider.38 Very few smokeless tobacco users quit by themselves. Only 1% of daily smokeless tobacco users have quit on their own, making the qui t ratio 5%, even lower than the 2% spontaneous quit rates among smokers (quit ratio 13%). 38 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), India Fact sheet (2009 -2010) http:// mohfw.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892 s/1455618937GATS%20India.pdf 40 Slide 1 2 LAWS ON TOBACCO CONTROL: COTPA 2003 PUBLIC PLACESBELOW AGE OF EIGHTEEN YEARSNEAR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS MANDATORY DEPICTION WARNING SINGS 12 COTPA The law in our country bans smoking in public places. In order to protect the public from the adverse and harmful ef fects of tobacco use and second hand smoke (SHS) and to discourage the consumption of tobacco, the Government of India enacted the Tobacco Control law titled \"Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and C ommerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, (COTPA) 2003\".39 According to COTPA: No one is allowed to smoke in public places Tobacco products should not be advertised Tobacco products should not be sold near educational institutions Tobacco packets should carry warnings about the risks of using tobacco 39 State Anti Tobacco Cell, Karnataka. COTPA 2003. http:// satckarnataka.in/cotpa.html 41 Slide 1 3 BHow can we identify tobacco use in primary care? 13 Generate discussion and write them on the board. Slide 1 4 IDENTIFYING TOBACCO USE AMONG PATIENTS ASK & ASSESS ASK & ASSESS 42 Slide 1 5 and 1 6 HOW CAN WE IDENTIFY TOBACCO USE? ASK all patients who report with health problems. As tobacco use is common, ask every patient about smoking and smokeless forms of tobacco (this includes men and women). Tobacco use may be hidden and patients rarely spontaneously report use . Therefore, the Medical Officer should ask about tobacco use to all patients who report with health problems. As tobacco use is common, ask every patient about smoking and smokeless forms of tobacco as well as exposure to tobacco smoke (this includes men , women and children for exposure to environmental smoke ). WHAT TO ASK? Ask about tobacco use, present and past Asking about past quit attempts is helpful in knowing what helps the patient quit and what does not Asking about a family history is often helpful to make the patient understand that he or she may have a biological predisposition to addiction and also explain how tobacco addiction is a disease that can run in families much like other NCDs. Asking about second hand smoking is useful to understand whether the person is exposed to tobacco smoke at home or at work. It is well known that tobacco users may also use alcohol as well as other drugs. Each of these are risk factors for both communicable and non -communicable diseases. When they occur together, they can worsen and complicate many diseases. ASK -Tobacco use this includes both past and present: For example: \"Do you smoke or use chewing tobacco?\" OR \"Have you used tobacco before?\" -Genetic risk For Example: \"Does your father/mother use tobacco in any form?\" -Second hand smoking For Example: \" Does anyone (friends or family) smoke? \" -Other substances (Cannabis, Opioids , Alcohol, Benzodiazepine, Amphetamine, Cocaine and Inhalants) and past or present use. 43 Slide 1 7 LOOK FOR SIGNS OF USE -Stained gums, teeth, fingers -Odour WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS (COMBINATION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS): Irritability Fatigue Insomnia Cough Nasal Drip Dizziness Lack of Concentration Constipation Headaches Hunger Craving for tobacco Slide 1 8 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AND INVESTIGATIONS Urinary and Salivary cotinine can be useful in monitoring recent use Respiratory examination (*CO estimation and Pulmonary Function Tests can be useful)Oral examination Cardiac examination *CO estimation test is used to test the level of Carbon monoxide in the body Interpretation: 0-6 ppm = Normal 7 to 10 ppm = Risky 10 and more ppm = Danger Carbon monoxide in the breath can help to provide feedback to the patient on the risks from smoking and also monitor a reduction in smoking at follow -up. This can be done through a ca rbon monoxide measuring instrument which is not very expensive and can be used in primary care. Investigations like pulmonary function tests may be available only in specialized centres. 44 Slide 1 9 SUMMARY POINTS Tobacco use affects health. Chemicals in tobacco lead to health consequences. Smoking can also harm others (Second -hand smoking) Tobacco use leads to dependence It is essential to ask every patient about tobacco use and related problems Slide 20 LEARNING OBJECTIVE B. INTERVENE to provide support for tobacco cessation (Advise and Assist) INSTRUCTION Discuss using brainstorming, steps to manage tobacco use as a risk factor seen in patients at the Health Centre. There will be patients who are non -users, past users and those who are presently using tobacco. Flow charts have been used to illustrate the steps for care. 45 ACTIVITY (GROUP WORK) Duration: 30 minutes Divide participants into small groups. The groups will discuss how we intervene for tobacco use in primary care. Provide chart paper and pens to make presentations (15 minutes). Each group can nominate a representative to make the presentation. Generate discussion during the presentation. Slide 21 A How do we intervene for tobacco use in primary care? 21 There is evidence about how patients take notice of the Medical Officer's advi ce about tobacco and other drugs including alcohol and its impact on health. Smoking related counselling intervention provided by physicians is well received by patients and associated with higher 6 month cessation rates .40 Experience from India has shown that counselling improves cessation rates in clinical and community settings 41,42. 40 Ockene JK, Kristeller J, Goldberg R.

Slide 2 3 WHAT ARE THE COMMON PROBLEMS DURING ABSTINENCE AND HOW TO INTERVENE? Lack of support for cessation Give follow up dates , keep telephonic contact and identify support (family, friends) Negative mood or depression Involve counselor, prescribe medication and refer to specialist Prolonged withdrawal symptoms Use an approved pharmacotherapy or adding/ combining counseling and medication to reduce strong withdrawals Weight gain Suggest physical activity and exercise, healthy diet, and say that weight gain is normal and to watch it. Feels deprived/ drop in motivation Reassure the user that such feelings are common. Praise and encourage patient's efforts to quit. 47 Slide 2 4 PHARMACOTHERAPY There are many pharmacological agents which support process of quitting and act on the brain to reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms Medication can be of 2 kinds: 1.Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) , Nortryptiline Medication is useful for those tobacco users who have tried to quit unsuccessfully on their own in the past. Some people are also unable to tolerate withdrawal symptoms and request additional help from medication. Pharmacological approaches are mainly of t wo kinds: nicotine replacement therapy and non - nicotine replacement therapy. When using nicotine replacement, the patient is advised to substitute the tobacco with NRT straightaway. For non -NRT treatment, the patient is advised to set a quit date 7 -10 days after starting the medication. Regular follow -up to maintain the motivation and provide support is extremely important to aid the cessation attempt. For more information on pharmacotherapy refer to the table below. NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (NRT) Dosage and duration Side effects Contraindications/ Precautions Nicotine gum For 1 -24 cigarettes/b idis - gum 24 cigarettes/bidis 4mg gum (upto 24 pieces/day) for 12 weeks Chewers need about half or a quarter of the dose as prescribed for smokers.

Slide 2 5 and 26 Slide 2 7 SUMMARY POINTS The M edical Officer can provide brief and effective intervention for tobacco cessation Counseling is an effective intervention for tobacco cessation Pharmacotherapy is available and must be recommended for tobacco dependence when patient is unable to quit with self -effort 50 Slide 2 8 LEARNING OBJECTIVE C. Involve other health care providers to offer help (Arrange) INSTRUCTION Discuss using brainstorming the steps taken by the Medical Officer to refer the patient to other health care providers at the health centre. Before referring the patient to the Counselor, discuss how the Counselor will help the patient to address current tobacco use and help to make lifestyle changes. The flow chart illustrates how the physician can l ink the patient to the Counselor for behavio ural change and the Community Health Worker for home visits and follow -up. Slide 2 9 LINKAGES TO OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS INVOLVE OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MEDICAL OFFICER/NURSE Refer back to MEDICAL OFFICER for medical assistance (if necessary)Involve Counselor for further help Refer to Lab for investigations COUNSELOR MEDICAL OFFICER Involve Community Health Worker for follow up Refer to Specialist (TCC clinic) / District Hospital for specialist care COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER ARRANGE 51 The Medical Officer will link the patient having problems due to tobacco use to the other health care providers at the Health Centre. The patient will be referred to the Counselor who will screen for nicotine dependence (using Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependenc e Questionnaire) and motivate patient for lifestyle and behavioural change. Referral will be done to a specialist in the District Hospital when physical and mental health problems are serious e.g. patient has cancer or stroke. Patients will be given follo w - up dates by the Counselor/ and or Medical Officer. When the patient is irregular for follow - up, the Community Health Worker wil l be asked to make home visits. Slide 30 SUMMARY POINTS Involve other health providers like Counselor, Nurse, Community Health Worker, LAB and District Hospital. Slide 3 1 INVOLVE THE FAMILY Educate the family member on tobacco ask a risk factor, the nature of addiction and the importance of family support Involve the Counselor in counseling the patient and family regarding tobacco cessation After the clinical consultation Involve the Community Health Worker in follow -up support for cessation 52 Family members often accompany the patient to the clinic and the Medical Officer can briefly talk to the family either during or after the consultation. Family members share many of the beliefs and misconceptions about tobacco use, including that it is not really harmful. Others who are aware of the harm are often critical of the tobacco user. One common reaction is, \"I have told him so often to stop. He simply does not listen. He does it to annoy me'. Explaining about addiction and how to support the perso n in their quit attempt is useful. The counselor can be very helpful in resolving family stress, which may be contributing to the person's use of tobacco. In the absence of a counselor, the nurse may take up the responsibility of educating and involving the family. Slide 3 2 GET INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY Medical officer as a change agent in the communityPublic talks on tobacco related harm and addressing misconceptions Participation in tobacco awareness and prevention programmes in schools Participation in workplace programmes on health and safety focusing on tobacco preventionDe- Normalising tobacco use in the community We know that tobacco is not only a health problem, it is also a social and economic problem. Tobacco use has become 'normalised' in many societies. As a doctor, getting involved in providing awareness in the community on the harm from using tobacco, particularly among youth , can arrest or at least postpon e their tobacco use. Doctors can also emphasize the importance of quitting and inform tobacco users where such help is available. Participating in debates and discussions, being informed of governmental laws and policies and influencing them and making hea lth a social agenda are also important actions beyond the clinic. 53 Slide 3 3 SUMMARY FLOW CHART Slide 3 4 WRAP UP B What do you take back at the end of the session? 54 WRAP UP the session by getting participants to share about the challenges in the field and facilitate disc ussion on how can be overcome.

According to the Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health44 (2014), alcohol consumption is related to more than 200 types of diseases. This includes many non - communicable diseases (NCDs) like cancers, liver disease, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cirrhosis of the liver. Alcohol consumption has also been associated with infectious diseases like tuberculosis. There is a close association between alcohol use and mental health problems. In India, alcohol and tobacco use is associated with higher mortality among men45 and alcohol related problems accounts for over every fifth of hospital admissions. Although alcohol use is a serious problem in India, most people do not receive any treatment for alcohol use disorders.46Alcohol u se is relatively high in north -eastern and southern states of India and Goa as compared to other parts of country47,48. Easy availability of alcohol through increasing number of sales outlets in both urban and rural areas, earlier age of first drink and grea ter extent of women drinking are recent trends have contributed to an increase in harmful effects of alcohol and habitual users. Methanol commonly found in adulterated drinks is a major cause for mass tragedies in India. Among the 43 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Regional Office for SE Asia.

Project Report 2011 -2012. 59 poor communities, alcohol use has led to increasing resources spent for drinking and for managing alcohol related problems49. Alcohol not only causes problems for the individual, but also results in a variety of harm for the households50. Alcohol use in urban and rural areas : Residi ng in villages and brewing alcohol is significantly linked to alcohol use51. In a rural sample of Vellore, one third used alcohol during the previous year, one fifth drank regularly and one sixth were hazardous alcohol users52. NFHS -3 revealed that for eithe r sex, proportions consuming alcohol were greater amongst those from rural than urban areas. Among females the ratio between urban to rural was 1:5 (0.6%: 3.0%)53. Similarly, high rates of alcohol use have been observed in urban slums of India in several st udies. Risk factors and alcohol use : According to NIAAA54, high consumption of alcohol leads to inappropriate food intake and low physical activity and many alcohol users use tobacco, aggravating harm from combined use. N utrition related disorders at both ends of the spectrum (both under nutrition and obesity) are also common with alcohol consumption. Poor mental health conditions and stress increases the chance of harmful use of alcohol and can come in the way of seeking help. NCDs and other health condit ions and alcohol us e: - Significantly higher proportion of alcohol users (32.5% of the 3,258 alcohol users) reported health problem compared to non -users (14.5% of the 3,745)55. - The major disease and injury conditions related to alcohol use are cancers of th e mouth, oropharynx, oesaphageal and liver cancer; neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, depression, alcohol dependence and harmful use, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, haemorrhagic stroke, and cirrhosis of the liver. Injury conditions in clude motor vehicle accidents, drowning, falls, poisonings, self - inflicted injuries, homicide56. - Alcohol use is linked to specific types of cancer in the Indian region, particularly when it is combined with various forms of tobacco consumption. These are the commonest risk factors for non -communicable diseases, according to studies carried out in Haryana57. - Studies conducted on stroke in India have established long -term alcohol use in 25% of cases among hospitalized stroke subjects. 49Bonu et al ibid 50Murthy P et al.

Health care providers should pay attention to alcohol use as a risk factor contributing to NCDs. With the growing problem of pharmaceutical drug abuse, health providers also nee d to provide proper instructions regarding the abuse and dependence potential of pharmaceutical drugs if used inappropriately59. This session on alcohol use will help the Medical Officers understand the harm from alcohol as well as linkages of alcohol as a risk factor to other risk factors. The link with non -communicable diseases is highlighted. The first objective is to improve identification of alcohol use as a risk factor among persons seeking help at the Health Centre, provide feedback regarding alcohol use and harm, intervene to manage problems related to alcohol use and involve other health care providers to work effectively as a team to address risk factors for NCDs. Persons may present in primary care with a diagnosed NCD complicated by alcohol use. They may be at risk for NCD because of alcohol use. They may have harmful or dependent use of alcohol which that has already caused problems or has the potential to cause problems. They may also present with intoxication, withdrawal or delirium. The Medica l Officer should be in a position to recognize these different scenarios of presentation and offer intervention.

At the same time, poverty and distress are also common factors associated with the increased use of alcohol. Slide 10 INSTRUCTION Play a short video on alcohol awareness and have a bri ef discussion on what the community needs to know about alcohol as a risk factor for NCDs. WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY ALCOHOL USE? Alcohol use is a risk factor for communicable diseases like tuberculosis, HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Alcohol use creates problems in family life, work and social life Play video clipNo alcohol ad campaign.mp4 (Right click and open hyperlink) 66 Slide 11 ALCOHOL USE AND ITS EFFECT ON NCDs Cardiovascular Diseases: Cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, hypertension, heart alcoholic hepatitis, and Gastrointestinal system: Pellagra, Gastritis, ulcers, bleeding & Cancer Changes in mood, Anxiety, Depression & other psychotic problemsBrain & Nervous system: Dependence, peripheral neuropathy , memory disturbances, fits, stroke and mental illnesses. Reproductive System: Reduce fertility, Impaired sexual performance & impotence Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. Unlike other foods, alcohol does not require digestion. When a person drinks, alcohol is absorbed directly into the blood stream through the walls of the stomach and the intestine. Once alcohol enters the bloodstream it circulates throughout the body. Alcohol is metabolized in the liver and i s changed to carbon dioxide, water and a few calories of energy. As there are no nutrients, these are called 'empty calories'. Alcohol can have immediate as well as long term effects. Research has found a strong link between alcohol use , death as well as disability from non -communicable diseases, and these findings support the World Health Organization's call to implement evidence -based strategies to reduce harm from alcohol. Alcohol is also a risk factor for communicable diseases like tuberculosis, HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Besides health related issues, the impact of alcohol use often creates problems in family life, work and social life62. 62Nattala P, Murthy P, Nagarajaiah.

Examples of harm to others includes injury to others, either intentional or unintentional (tr affic accident, workplace accident, injury to partner or child), neglect of family responsibilities, loss of property through damage, pawning etc and endangerment of colleagues at the workplace. Studies from India have demonstrated the effects of alcohol a t the workplace in terms of increase in accidents (inside and outside the workplace), absenteeism and productivity63,64. 63Murthy P (Ed)Community based drug rehabilitation and workplace prevention.

The risky patterns of drinking65 are elaborated below: 1. HARMFUL USE refers to the health damage that is physical or mental due to drinking. It is defined as a pattern of alcohol use that is causing health damage, either physical (e.g. liver damage) or mental (e.g. depression) 2. HAZARDOUS USE is a risky pattern of drinking that includes physical, mental and social consequences to the drinker or others (e.g. drinking and driving or fights with neighbours) . Hazardous consumption includes binge drinking (drinking four or more drinks in one sitting or on one occasio n) and pathological drinking (inability to stop drinking once started). 3. DEPENDENCE refers to the cluster of behavio ural, cognitive and physiological phenomena that develops after repeated drinking. The characteristics of dependence are mentioned later. 65The ICD -10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders.

CRAVING: a strong desire or sense of compulsion to take the substance. It can be triggered by situations or objects associated with drinking: Example: \"I have tried to stop so many times but every time I meet my drinking friends I have the urge to drink and start drinking again\" LOSS OF CONTROL: difficulties in substance -taking behaviour in terms of its onset, termination or levels of use: Exam ple: \"Every time I start drinking, I plan to stop with a quarter, but I end up drinking 2 - 3 quarters...\" WITHDRAWAL STATE: When substance use has ceased or quantity has reduced, the user has negative experiences: Example: \"When I stop drinking, I don't get sleep and my head aches. My hands start shaking in the morning.....\" TOLERANCE: Increased doses of psychoactive substances are required in order to achieve effects originally produced by lower doses: Example: \"I started with 1 glass of beer but now it do es not give me a kick. Now, I need to drink more than 3 glasses to get a kick.....\" SALIENCE: Progressive neglect of alternative pleasures/ interests because of the substance despite clear evidence of harmful consequences: 71 Example: A person not regular at work (absenteeism), not attending social gatherings and avoiding family responsibilities. Knowing that alcohol use will harm the body through excessive drinking and cause other psycho social complications but still not able to stop drinking: Example: li ver impairment impaired, cognitive functioning. As per the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD 10) a person fulfilling 3 or more of the above dependence criteria is diagnosed as having alcohol dependence Slide 1 6 A Discuss methods of assessment and intervention for alcohol use disorders in primary care 16 ACTIVITY (GROUP WORK) Duration: 30 minutes Divide participants into small groups. The groups will discuss methods of assessment and intervention for alcohol use disorders in primary care. Give chart paper and pens to make presentations (15 minutes). Each group can nominate a representative to make the presentation. Generate discussion during the presentation. 72 Slide 1 7 IDENTIFYING ALCOHOL USE AMONG PATIENTS ASK & ASSESS ASK & ASSESS Slide 1 8 HOW DO WE IDENTIFY ALCOHOL USE? Ask ALL patients (including men & women) reporting with health problems Alcohol use may be hidden Ask as part of a routine clinical history 73 Alcohol use may not be a presenting problem and may be hidden. Therefore, it is essential to ask about alcohol use to ALL patients (including men , women and adolescents ) who report with health problems. At the same time, it would be useful to ask regarding the use of other mind -altering substances ( cannabis , opioids, inhalants, sedatives, stimulants etc) Slide 1 9 USE AUDIT -C TO ASK Did you use alcohol (past and present)? 'Do you drink?' OR 'Have you used alcohol before?' If yes: 1. How often do you have a drink containing alcohol? 2. How many standard drinks containing alcohol do you have on a typical day when drinking? 3. How often do you have six or more drinks on one occasion? If yesto the above questions, ask further. Contd. Slide 20 WHAT TO ASK? Effects on family, work and social life Reasons for use and maintenance Tolerance, craving and withdrawal symptoms Use of other substances (Tobacco, Cannabis, Opioids , Benzodiazepines and other sedatives, Inhalants, Amphetamine, Cocaine etc) Check for physical and mental health problems Check for last use If NCD is present or patient is at a risk for NCD, assess understanding of link between alcohol, other risk factors and NCD 74 Taking alcohol use history70 When asking about alcohol consumption: Ask questions without indicating a preferred answer, and try not to display surprise at any responses given. Ask about the level and pattern of consumption of alcohol, as well as any behaviours associated with alcohol use that may risk the person's health and the health of others (i.e., where, when and with whom alcohol consumption typically occurs, what triggers alcohol cons umption, activities when intoxicated, financial implications, capacity to care for children, and violence towards others). Ask about harms from alcohol, including: accidents, driving while intoxicated relationship problems medical problems such as liver disease / stomach ulcers legal / financial problems sex while intoxicated and that is later regretted or risky alcohol -related violence including domestic violence Ask about commencement and development of alcohol use in relation to other life events, for example, by taking a chronological history. If there is evidence of hazardous or harmful alcohol use, establish dependence by asking about the development of tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, use in greater amounts or over a greater length of time than was intended, continued alcohol use the problems related to it, difficulty in stopping or cutting down alcohol use, and craving for alcohol use. Ask about social networks and the person's alcohol and other drug consumption patterns. Ask for other risk factors that occur along with alcohol use (use of tobacco, presence of stress, unhealthy dietary practices, lack of ex ercise). 70World Health Organization. Alcohol use disorders.

Slide 2 2 IDENTIFYING ACUTE INTOXICATION & SIMPLE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS OF ACUTE INTOXICATION Smell of alcohol on the breath Slurred speech Disinhibited behaviour Use breathalyzer if available WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS Tremor in hands Sweating Vomiting Increased pulse & blood pressure Agitation Anxiety Insomnia 76 When examining the person, look for: 1. Presence of intoxication 2. Presence of withdrawal; 3. Evidence of long -term heavy alcohol consumption, such as liver disease (enlarged liver, peripheral signs of liver injury), cerebellar or peripheral nerve damage. 4. Presence of acute confusion or clo uding of consciousness with recent history of heavy alcohol consumption Slide 2 3 SYMPTOMS OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME Symptoms Time of appearance after cessation of alcohol use Minor withdrawal symptoms: insomnia, tremulousness, mild anxiety, gastrointestinal upset, headache, diaphoresis, palpitations and anorexia 6 to 12 hours Alcoholic hallucinations: visual, auditory or tactile hallucinations12to 24 hours * Withdrawal seizures: generalized tonic -clonic seizures24 to 48 hours ** Alcohol withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens): hallucinations (predominately visual), disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, low -grade fever, agitation and diaphoresis 48 to 72 hours *** *Symptoms generally resolve within 48 hours. **Symptoms reported as early as two hours after cessation. ***Symptoms peak at five days. 77 Slide 2 4 ASSESS FOR ACUTE CONFUSION OR CLOUDING OF CONSCIOUSNESS Wernicke's Encephalopathy -Nystagmus , ataxia, ophtalmoplegia Head injury -Evidence of lacerations, bleeding around head, ears Alcohol withdrawal delirium Exclude other common causes for confusion, such as infections, hypoxia, hypoglycaemia , hepatic encephalopathy and cerebrovascular accidentDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS If the person presents with acute confusion with recent heavy consumption of alcohol, a differential diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcohol withdrawal delirium, or head injury may be considered. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by confusion, ataxia and ophthalmoplegia Alcohol withdrawal delirium is characterized by confusion, disorientation, autonomic hyperarousal (sweating, tachycardia), tremulousness, and hallucinations may be present. Seizures may also precede the delirium). Head injury must be ruled out in a patient presenting with alcohol consumption and confusion. It is important to look for signs of head injury such as lacerations, bleeding around the head or ears. Other common causes of confusion, such as infections, hypoxia, hypoglycaemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and cerebrovascular accidents need to be considered. If any of these are suspected, and needs further investigations for appropriate management, referral t o a specialized centre may be considered. 78 Slide 2 5 SUMMARY Alcohol use and non -communicable diseases are closely linked. Ask about alcohol use and identify patterns of hazardous/harmful and dependent use Assess for intoxication, withdrawal and complications Physical examination and investigations are essential for complete assessment. Slide 2 6 LEARNING OBJECTIVE B. INTERVENE to manage problems related to alcohol use 79 INSTRUCTION Discuss using brainstorming, steps to manage alcohol use as a risk factor seen in patient at the Health Centre. There will be patients who are non -users, harmful/hazardous users and those having dependence. Flow charts have been used to illustrate the steps for care. Slide 26 Activity (Role play) Total duration: 30 minutes Sit in pairs and face each other. Nominate one person as the MO and the other as the patient. Use the case given to continue the activity . Before role play, give 5 minutes for reading and clarifying the case study. Ask participants what they learnt from the activity and summarize.

Steer the discussion towards a balanced evaluation of the positive and negative effects (pros and cons) of alcohol. Question the perceived benefits and bring up some of the negative aspects which may not have been mentioned by the person. Personalise the risk of continued pattern of drinking on the person's health, either in terms of the NCD if it has already been diagnosed, or in terms of the risk for future development of NCDs Avoid arguing with the person Encourage the person to decide f or themselves if they want to change their pattern of alcohol use, particularly after there has been a balanced discussion of the pros and cons of the current pattern of use Advise complete stopping If the person expresses a readiness to quit alcohol, discuss examples of ways that the harmful or hazardous use of alcohol can be reduced not having alcohol at home not going to pubs or other locations where people use alcohol asking support from family or friends asking the person to come back with family o r friends and to discuss a way forward together at the health centre Assess for medical and psychiatric co -morbidity. Monitor and treat if symptoms persistent, or are distressing. Refer to the counsellor to support in following manner Self-help group: Consider advising people with alcohol dependence to join a self -help group, e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous. Consider facilitating initial contact, for example by making the appointment and accompanying the person to the first session. Address housing and emplo yment needs : Where available, work with local agencies and community resources to provide supported employment for those who need support to return to work or find a job and to enable access to local employment (or educational) opportunities, based on the person's needs and skill level. In a study by the International Labour Organization in India , supported employment for 71 World Health Organization. mhGAP Intervention Guide for mental, neurological and substance u se disorders in non -specialized health settings, 2010. http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241548069_eng.pdf 82 persons with alcohol dependence and proper follow -up showed a significant improvement in all spheres of life.72 Where available, work with local agencies and community resources to find supported housing or assisted living facilities, as well as independent living facilities, if these are needed. Carefully consider the capacity of the person and the availability of alcohol or other subst ances in advising and facilitating optimal housing arrangements. Supporting families and carers: Discuss with families and carers the impact of alcohol use and dependence on themselves and other family members, including children. Based on feedback from f amilies: Offer an assessment of their personal, social and mental health needs. Provide information and education about alcohol use and dependence. Help to identify sources of stress related to alcohol use; explore methods of coping and promote effective c oping behaviours. Inform them about and help them access support groups (e.g. self -help groups for families and carers) and other social resources. In a recent ICMR study73, providing interventions of women partners of men with alcohol dependence showed sig nificantly greater improvements in their psychological well -being. Alcohol and other Substance use in Adolescence Clarify the confidential nature of the health care discussion, including in what circumstances parents or other adults will be given information. Identify the most important underlying issues for the adolescent, keeping in mind that adolescents are often not able to articulate their problems well. This might mean asking open ended questions covering the areas covered by the HEAD S? acron ym (Home, Education / Employment / Eating, Activities, Drugs and alcohol, Sexuality / Safety / Suicide) and allowing sufficient time for the discussion. Although they usually present with less severe substance abuse problems, young people can present with severe dependence. It is just as important to screen adolescents for alcohol and alcohol problems as adults. Provide parents and the adolescent with information on the effects of alcohol and other substances on individual health and social functioning. Encourage a change in the adolescent's environment rather than focusing directly on the adolescent as being the problem, such as by encouraging participation in school or work and activities after school / work that occupy the adolescent's time, and encourage participation in group activities which facilitate the adolescent's skill acquisition and contribution to their communities. It is important that adolescents are involved in activities which interest them. 72 UNODC. Community Based Drug Rehabilitation and Workplace Prevention.

Indian Council for Medical Research, 2014. 83 Encourage parents and / or responsible adults to know where the adolescent is, who they are with, what they are doing, when they will be home, and to expect the adolescent to be accountable for their activities. Encourage parents to set clear expectations (at the same time being prepared to negotiate the se expectations with the adolescent), and to discuss with adolescents the consequences of the adolescent's behaviours and non conformity with expectations. Advise parents to limit their own behaviours which may be contributing to their children's substance use, including the purchasing or providing of alcohol or the provision of funds which are being spent on substance use, keeping in mind the potential influence of their own alcohol and alcg use on their children. Women - Pregnancy and breastfeeding Advis e women who are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant to avoid alcohol completely. Advise women that consuming even small amounts of alcohol early in pregnancy can harm the developing foetus, and that larger amounts of alcohol can result in a syndrome of severe developmental problems called Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). Advise women who are breastfeeding to avoid alcohol completely. Advise and support breastfeeding mothers not to use any psychoactive substances. Given the benefits of exclusive breastfe eding (particularly in the first 6 months), if mothers continue to drink alcohol they should be advised to limit their alcohol consumption, and to minimise the alcohol content of the breast milk, such as by breastfeeding before drinking alcohol and not aga in until after blood levels fall to zero (allowing approximately 2 hours for each drink consumed, i.e. 4 hours if TWO drinks are consumed), or using expressed breast milk. Mothers with harmful substance use and young children should be offered what social support services are available, including additional post natal visits, parenting training, and child care during medical visits. Encourage the person to meet the Counsellor for a more detailed discussion on understanding the relationship between alcohol u se and NCD's and help to quit. If the person is still not ready to stop or reduce alcohol use, then ask the person to come back to discuss further with yourself (Medical Officer) or Counsellor. 84 Slide 30 INTERVENE FOR INTOXICATION AND WITHDRAWAL INTOXICATION Assess airway and breathing. \u00bb Put the person on their side to prevent aspiration in case they vomit. \u00bb Refer to hospital if necessary or observe until effects of alcohol have worn off. \u00bb If methanol poisoning is suspected, refer to hospital for emergency management.WITHDRAWAL Look for: \u00bb Past episodes of severe alcohol withdrawal including delirium and seizures \u00bb Other medical or psychiatric problems or benzodiazepine dependence \u00bb Severe withdrawal symptoms already present only a few hours after stopping drinking Slide 3 1 B What are the medicines for detoxification, severe withdrawals and for relapse prevention? 31 Generate discussion and write them on the board. 85 Slide 3 2 PHARMACOTHERAPY: DETOXIFICATION Diazepam for withdrawal -10 mg qidor 20 mg qidfor 3 -7 days. In patients with hepatic dysfunction, 5 -10 mg qid with careful monitoring When liver function cannot be assessed, lorazepam may be considered (1mg lorazepam =5 mg diazepam) Thiamine 100 mg/day orally for 5 days or longer Other vitamin supplements as indicated Patients should be cautioned about self -medicating beyond the prescribed period because of risk of developing dependence . PHARMACOTHERAPY74,75 For the patient is motivated to stop drinki ng and when the withdrawal symptoms are not very severe, detoxification can begin on an outpatient basis. Withdrawal symptoms occur when the person stops heavy drinking typically between 6 hours to 8 hours after the last drink. Look for tremors in hands, sweating, vomiting, increased pulse and blood pressure and agitation. ASK about headache, nausea and anxiety. Note that seizures, delirium and confusion can occur in severe cases. Reassure the patient about how detoxification is a simple method. TABLE 1.The list of drugs prescribed for detoxification is given below: 74 Murthy P& Nikketha S. Psychosocial interventions for persons with sub stance abuse: Theory and practice.

The dose and duration of diazepam should be determined individually according to the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and other medical conditions. In the hospital se tting, diazepam can be given more frequently (hourly) and higher daily doses (up to 120 mg daily can be given for the first 3 days based on frequent assessments) Drowsiness, fatigue and in coordination (most common) Safe Chlordiazepoxide 50-120 mg & gradu ally over 7-10 days Drowsiness, tiredness, Swelling, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, constipation and irregular menstrual periods Safe Lorazepam 4-12 mg & gradually over 7 - 10 days Dizzy, drowsy and cause blurred vision Safe even in liver diseases Please Note: Roughly for one unit of alcohol (30 ml spirit), 1mg of diazepam or 5 mg of chlordiazepoxide is needed. - Supplement with vitamins. - Mh Gap recommendations for alcohol dependence: Oral thiamine 100 mg/day for 5 days or longer. Other vitamins as necessary. For delirium, thiamine 100 mg IV or IM three times daily for 5 days or longer - Treat patient for other physical problems like dehydratio n and gastritis is important. Look for co - morbid conditions like depression and anxiety and medicate. 87 Slide 3 3 MANAGING SEVERE WITHDRAWAL If withdrawal is complicated by delirium: -Treat withdrawal with diazepam -Manage in a safe environment -Keep well hydrated -Avoid restraining -If delirium or hallucinations persist despite treatment of other withdrawal symptoms, then consider using antipsychotics such as haloperidol 2.5 -5 mg orally up to 3 times daily. Thiamine 100 mg IV or IM three times daily for 5 days If withdrawal is complicated by seizures, treat with diazepam; do not use anti convulsants to prevent further seizures Management of alcohol withdrawal Be alert for the person at risk of a withdrawal syndrome, for example, the person with undiagnosed alcohol dependence in the district hospital. When there is evidence of a withdrawal syndrome developing (or before withdrawal symptoms develop in the case of planned withdrawal), administer diazepam at an initial dose of up to 40 mg daily (i.e., 10 mg four times daily or 20 mg twice daily) for 3 - 7 days. In people with impaired hepatic metabolism (e.g. liver failure, elderly) use a single low dose initially (5 - 10 mg) and determine the duration of action of this dose before prescribing further doses. Administer thiamine100 mg / day orally for 5 days (or longer if required) to prevent the development of thiamine -deficiency syndromes such as Wernicke's encephalopathy. Consider other vitamin supplementation when indicated . Ensure adequate fluid intake and electrolyte requirements are met. Correct potassium and magnesium levels that are typically low. Ensure carer support. Provide as quiet and non -stimulating an environment as possible, which is well lit in the day time and lit enough at night to prevent falls if the person gets up in the night. When the person has severe alcohol dependence (previous history of severe alcohol withdrawal, seizures or delirium) or concurrent serious medical or psychiatric disorders or is lacki ng adequate support, CONSULT A SPECIALIST , if available. Consider and treat other medical problems (e.g. Wernicke's encephalopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, head injury with or without subdural haematoma). Benzodiazepines should not be used in people with hepatic encephalopathy or respiratory depression. 88 WHERE to withdraw from alcohol? 1. Have there been past episodes of severe withdrawal symptoms, seizures or delirium? 2. Are there other significant medical or psychiatric problems? 3. Do significant withdrawal features develop within 6 hours of the last drink? 4. Has outpatient withdrawal failed? 5. Is the person homeless or without any social support? If YES to any of the above then inpatient withdrawal treatment is preferable. Alcohol -withdrawal delirium Treat the person in a low stimulus and safe environment where they are unlikely to do themselves harm. Treat underlying alcohol withdrawal with diazepam. Administer thiamine 100 mg i.v. or i.m. 3 times daily for 5 days. Use antipsychotic medication, if necessary, for the duration of psychotic symptoms only (e.g. haloperidol 2.5 - 5 mg orally tds). Maintain hydration. Avoid restraining the person. Always consider other causes of delirium and hallucinations (e.g. head inju ry, hypoglycaemia, infection (most commonly pneumonia), hypoxia, hepatic encephalopathy or cerebrovascular accidents). Slide 3 4 RELAPSE PREVENTION Acamprosate : Reduces craving Naltrexone : Reduces craving Disulfiram : Causes an unpleasant reaction if combined with alcohol Usually prescribed for one year and works best when combined with counsellingOther measures to improve outcome -Improving social support -Addressing problems of work -Addressing other social needs -Referral to self -help groups -Proper follow -up -Learning effective ways of managing relapse -Help in emergency situations Relapse -prevention medications after withdrawal from alcohol: Several medications are useful in the treatment of alcohol dependence and increase the likelihood of the person maintaining abstinence from alcohol. The principal medications are acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram. The decision to use of any of these medications should be made taking i nto consideration preferences of the person and an assessment of benefit versus risk (e.g. is there an excessive risk if the medication is administered by non -medically trained health workers or if the person has liver 89 disease or is using other drugs). All three medications should be avoided, if possible, in pregnant women . TABLE 2. DRUGS FOR RELAPSE PREVENTION (mh GAP RECOMMENDATIONS) Acamprosate (333 mg tablets) Suppresses the urge to drink Can be started immediately after withdrawal symptoms subside Dose: 2 tablets thrice daily in persons above 60kgs 2 tablets twice daily in persons below 60 kgs Duration of treatment - one year 20% of patients may experience side effects like diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, pruritis, occasional maculopapu lar rash and rarely bullous skin lesions Relatively safe except in persons with renal insufficiency Naltrexone (50 mg) Suppresses the urge to drink. Can be started after withdrawal symptoms subside Dose: 50 mg/day. Can be maintained at 50 -100 mg/day for one year. 20% of patients may experience side effects like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anxiety, sleep disturbance, headache, reduced energy, joint and muscle pain. Patient must be warned not to use any opioid drugs while on naltrexone. With higher doses, liver function tests recommended as liver toxicity can occur Disulfiram (250 mg) Causes an unpleasant and potentially dangerous reaction if combined with alcohol. The patient must be advised of the mechanism of action and that one in 15,000 patients can have a fatal reaction (much rarer than alcohol related complications) Dose: 250 mg/day for one year Adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, fatigue, decreased libido, rarely psychotic reaction, allergic dermatitis, peripheral neurit is or hepatic cell damage. Contraindicated in persons with coronary heart disease, cardiac failure, history of cerebrovascular accident, severe hypertension, psychosis, severe personality disorder or suicidal risk Should be offered to motivated patients an d where the drug can be monitored by a family member or a treatment professional. There is evidence about how patients take notice of the Medical Officer's advice about alcohol and other drugs including tobacco and its impact on health. 90 Accurate, well -timed information helps people to think about their use and just giving advice could be enough to get them to make lifestyle changes. Physical examination, feedback, reassurance and psycho education to patient and family should be conducted for all patients. Before referral discuss the importance of meeting the Counselor to address current issues. The Medical Officer should educate the patient (in brief) about the ill effects of alcohol use and its effects on health and treat the present me dical condition. Slide 3 5 SUMMARY Interventions are different for three different groups. Pharmacotherapy is useful for detoxification and relapse prevention Combination of counseling and pharmacotherapy works better than either alone for alcohol dependence Slide 3 6 LEARNING OBJECTIVE C. Involve other health care providers to offer help 91 INSTRUCTION Discuss using brainstorming the steps taken by the Medical Officer to refer the patient to other health care providers at the health cent re. Before referring the patient to the Counselor , discuss how the Counselor will help the patient to address current alcohol use and help to make lifestyle changes. The steps of l inking the patient to the Counselor for behavioural change and the Community Health Worker for home visits is illustrated in the flow chart. Slide 3 7 INVOLVE OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MEDICAL OFFICER/NURSE Refer back to MEDICAL OFFICER for medical assistance (if necessary)Involve Counselor for further help Refer to Lab for investigations COUNSELOR MEDICAL OFFICER Involve Community Health Worker for follow up Refer to Specialist (De -addiction Centre)/ District Hospital for specialist care COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER ARRANGE The Medical Officer will link the patient having problems due to alcohol use to other health care providers at the Health Centre. The patient can be referred to the Counselor who will screen for levels of alcohol related problems (using AUDIT C) and motiva te the patient for lifestyle and behavioural change. Referral would be done to a specialist in the District Hospital when physical and mental health problems are serious e.g. when patient requires in - patient detoxification or when there is relapse durin g detoxification or when patient is not willing for out - patient detoxification. Patients should be given follow - up dates by the Counselor/ and or Medical Officer. When the patient is irregular for follow - up, the Community Health Worker would make h ome visits. 92 Slide 3 8 SUMMARY Involve other health care providers like Counselors, Community Health Workers and specialists and District Hospital Slide 3 9 FAMILYEducate about the harm from alcohol Encourage the family to support the person to quit, rather than criticizeExplore alcohol use in other family members and how that can influence the index persons' decision to quit If there is significant stress contributing to alcohol use, involve the counselor in working with the familyINVOLVE THE FAMILY Family members are often critical of a person's drinking and this often worsens, rather than improves the drinking. It is more useful to understand why a person's drinks and find other ways of managing this situation. If a person is addicted, family members need to support recovery from such addiction. The Medical Officer's advi ce will help this process. Sometimes, other family members also have a drinking 93 habit, and just advising the index p atient to reduce or stop drinking may not help. Encouraging multiple family members to change their drinking habits comes with significant health benefits and also improves the family well -being. Slide 40 MEDICAL OFFICER Inform the community, particularly the young about alcohol related harm and healthy choices Conduct programmes in schools, workplaces and other settings on alcohol related harm Be aware of policies and programmes to prevent and address alcohol related harm Understand about healthy choices and be a role model GET INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY Getting involved i n the community The Medical Officer can be an important opinion maker in the community. Talking about alcohol related harm in public , writing about it in newspapers and magazines , encouraging people to adopt alcohol free lifestyles and being a role model can also influence community attitudes. The medical officer who uses alcohol must also be personally aware of the harm it can cause, and if he/she develops dependence, get professional help to overcome the problem.

Under nutrition The relationship between under nutrition and health has l ong been known in low and middle income countries. Under nutrition and consumption of low -nutrition foods poses a great problem, particul arly in lower income groups. C hildren exposed to under nutrition in utero or early in life carry greater risks for NCDs as adults (the Barker hypothesis). It is also known that due to the maternal effect of malnutrition, genetic programming during gestation can alter vulnerability to cardiovascular disease and diabetes later in life (epigenetic changes). The World Econom ic Forum now rates NCDs in the top five threats to global economic development worldwide. The extensive medical and socio -economic effects of NCDs are both causes and consequences of poverty. Poverty and poor living conditions restrict healthy lifestyle choices and increase the propensity for risk factor exposure and overall NCD development.76 A growing number of developing countries must shoulder a \"double burden\" of malnutrition: the persistence of under -nutrition, especially among children, along with a rapid rise in overweight, obesity and diet -related chronic disease. In developing countries undergoing rapid economic 76FAO. 2006. http:// ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0442e/a0442e.zip 103 transition, under -nutrition, over -nutrition, infectious and chronic diseases coexist ov er long periods of time.\"77 In a NCD risk factors survey in India78, prevalence of being overweight was higher among females compared with males across all the age groups and was higher in urban compared with rural population. Those with lower levels of educ ation had a lower prevalence of being overweight . Persons whose occupation was agriculture or manual work also had lower prevalence of overweight. Inadequate amount of fruits and vegetables (less than five servings of fruits and vegetables per day) was reported in all the seven states studied . Diet and health conditions including NCDs: The effect of unhealthy diet both on premature death and disease is now recognized as a serious problem in developing countries. According to the WHO79 , dietary factors contribute to about 30% of all cancers in industria lized countries and upto 30% in developing countries. Over - nutrition is becoming a problem especially in urban areas and more women have diabetes or hypertension and obesity compared to men with these conditions. One fourth of the adult population and one fifth of school going children are overweight in India. Unhealthy diet is one of the leading causes of non - communicable diseases such as heart diseases, hypertension, cancer and diabetes. - Obesity associated with heart attack, stroke, diabetes and cancer. - Hypercholesterolemia is linked with atherosclerosis, premature heart disease and diabetes. - Increased salt intake is related to hypertension, cancer, atherosclerosis and diabetes - Inadequate dietary fib re is related to micro -nutrient deficiencies and colon cancer risk Healthy diet reduces the risk of heart diseases, as well as type 2 diabetes80. It is estimated that 30% of disease can be controlled with proper diet. Healthy diet also leads to a better quality of life and health, less psycho social problems and high productivity. This session on diet will help the Medical Officers to understand the linkages of diet as a risk factor to other risk factors and non -communicable diseases. The first objective is about identifying diet as a risk factor. This is followed by interventions to manage problems related to poor diet and involvement of other h ealth care providers through referrals. 77 FAO ibid 78National Institute of Medical Statistics, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) IDSP Non -Communicable Disease Risk Factors Survey, Phase -I States of India, 2007 -08.National Institute of Medical Statistics and Division of Non -Communicable Diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India, 2009. 79National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad.

Identify unhealthy diet as a risk factor for NCDs INSTRUCTION Discuss using brainstorming about the importance of unhealthy diet as a risk for health and the importance of asking patients coming to the health centre. Slide 5 A Why it is important to identify unhealthy diet? 5 106 ACTIVITY (GROUP WORK) Duration: 30 minutes Divide participants into small groups. The groups will discuss why it is important to identify unhealthy diet as a risk factor for NCDs. Give chart paper and pens to make presentations (15 minutes). Each group can nominate a representative to make the pres entation. Generate discussion during the presentation. Slide 6 DOUBLE BURDEN OF DIETARY DISEASES Currently, India is undergoing a rapid socio -economic, demographic, and nutritional health transition. Although India has not yet overcome the problems of poverty, under nutrition and communicable diseases, it is increasingly facing additional challenges related to the affluence that results from industrialization, urbanization and econo mic betterment.81 Over the last five decades, there have been steady but slow reductions in the rates of births, deaths, infant mortality and under -five mortality. India still has high infant, perinatal and neonatal mortality. Nearly one -third of Indian chi ldren have low birth -weight. While under -nutrition is a problem among children from lower socio -economic groups, over -nutrition has been observed among children in upper socio - economic groups. 81 Ramachandran P. The double burden of malnutrition in India. In Assessment of the double burden of malnutrition in six case study countries , 2005. 107 However, over the last three decades, there has been a progres sive decline in under -nutrition and some increase in over nutrition in both urban and rural areas. Over the same period, there has also been a decline in the consumption of pulses, which are a major source of protein in Indian diets. The double burden of malnutrition in India is partly attributable to soaring costs and the inability of poor people to purchase them in adequate quantities, in spite of higher expenditure on pulses. Although India's milk output has increased massively, there has not been any improvement in the per capita consumption of milk. Consumption of vegetables and fruits also continues to be very low. In rural areas, there has not been any significant increase in the per capita consumption of fats and oils and of sugar and jaggery. Howe ver in urban areas - even among slum dwellers - there has been an increase in oil consumption and some increase in sugar consumption82. Slide 7 INDIAN ENIGMA Indian men growing taller three times as fast as Indian women (Deaton 2008)Younger daughters -in-law in rural joint families have lower Body Mass Index and shorter children on average (Coffey, Khera and Spears 2013) Women's Social Status and Nutrition Gender, diet and NCD risk Gender inequality has a bearing on diet throughout the developmental span of an individual. Studies from India have shown how gender discrimination results in greater dietary impoverishment for girls83. At the same time, gender has also been shown to have a relationship with unhealthy dietary habits, lower levels of exercise and greater proneness to obesity and diabetes among women.84 82 Ramachandran P. ibid 83Barooah VK.

Obesity has nearly doubled between 1980 and 2008. Globally, 44% of diabetes, 23% of ischaemic heart disease and 7 -41% of certain cancers are attributable to being overweight and obesity. Once associated with high -income countries, obesity is now also prevalent in low -and middle -income countries Slide 10 DISEASE RISK FROM EXTRA WEIGHT There is a rapid change in traditional diet to energy rich, nutrient poor foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt and NCDs stem from such diets. Nutrition -related practices and conditions that lead to NCDs are increased weight (obesity), increased fat/ cholesterol intake, salt, processed/ preserved/instant foods and inadequate dietary fibre. GROWING PROBLEM OF OBESITY IN INDIA Age and sex adjusted prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors among middle socio -economic status subjects aged 20 -59 years in the present Jaipur Heart Watch (JHW -5) study conducted in years 2009 -10 as compared to previous studies in 2002 -3 (JHW -3) and 2004 -5 (JHW -4) in Jaipur. Persistently high prevalence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors is observed. Significant increase is observed for high cholesterol and high triglycerides (Mantel Haenzel X2 for trend p<0.05) while other trends are insignificant. 109 Slide 11 B Why is obesity growing so rapidly in India? 11 ACTIVITY .

According to NIN, healthy diet is one which provides all the nutrients and non -nutrients (dietary fibre, antioxidants and components produced by plants) in required amounts and proper proportions. Healthy diet can easily be achieved through the blend of the four basic food groups: 1. Energy giving food includes examples such as grains/cereals (rice, wheat, oats and corn), millets (ragi and jower), roots (carrot, potato, ginger and onion), jaggery/honey/sugar and oil/ghee. 2. Body building food includes pulses , soya beans, milk and milk products, meat, fish, eggs and nuts. 3. Protective food includes fruits, vegetables and green leafy vegetables. 4. Fibre food includes fruits & vegetables (especially raw), whole grains and pulses. The choice of what a person eats is based on convenience, habit, trends and income.

Generate discussion and write the points on the board. 114 Slide 20 IDENTIFYING UNHEALTHY DIETARY PRACTICES ASK & ASSESS ASK & ASSESS Slide 21 IDENTIFYING ASK? Unhealthy diet may not be a presenting problem and may not be identified unless asked. Ask about unhealthy diet to those who report health problems. Ask about unhealthy dietary practices -high intake of salt, oily food, low intake of vegetables and fruits and excess intake of fast foods. For example: \"Do you use more salt in food?\" OR \"Do you include vegetables and fruits in your daily meal?\"LOOK FOR Over weight Underweight Obesity 115 Slide 22 24 HOUR DIETARY RECALL A dietary recall is a retrospective method of dietary assessment where an individual is interviewed about their food and beverage consumption during a defined period of time, typically the previous day or the preceding 24 hours.

Toddlers, children & pregnant women need more energy foods Pregnant women, adults and elderly need more fibre foods Children, adolescents, pregnant women, adults and the elderly needs more protective food Adolescents, pregnant women, toddlers (milk) & adults need more body building food Slide 33 DIETARY SALT RESTRICTION WHO: the daily consumption of salt should not exceed 5 grams or one teaspoon. 121 Slide 34 TIPS TO REDUCE SODIUM INTAKE Reduce salt in usual cooking Avoid sprinkling extra salt onto food while eating Reduce salt in dough, chutneys Reduce salt in salads Be aware that many sweet condiments also contain saltAvoid Processed food Restaurant foods with lots of sauce (pizza, pasta, noodles) Papads and pickles Salted nuts Chips, fries, samosas and other fried foods DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC DISEASE CONDITIONS91 There are specific dietary recommendations for people with hypertension, heart diseases, diabetes and other NCDs. The two guidelines below are evidence based and are safe to recommend . DIETARY APPROACHES TO STOP HYPERTENSION (DASH, N IH, 2006) - Low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat - Intake of fruits, vegetables - Fat-free or low -fat milk and milk products - Reduce salt NUTRITIONAL GUIDELINES FOR THE PREVENTION OF HEART DISEASES AND DM (FNRI -DOST). (Developed in response to the growing number of Filipinos with DM and heart diseases) - Eat foods low in fat and cholesterol - Increase intake of fibre rich foods in the dai ly diet - Limit intake of salty foods - Regulate alcohol intake - Use healthy oil such as sunflower or safflower oil for cooking (avoid oils high in trans fats and saturated fats like coconut oil and palm oil) 91 World Health Organization.

Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables 4. Get more active 5. Drink plenty of water 6. Eat high -fibre foods 7. Be aware of the kind of food you are eating (avoiding fatty, salty and sweetened foods) 8. Use a smaller plate 9. Don't keep junk food easily available 10. Avoid alcohol Slide 35 SUMMARY POINT It is essential to follow the steps to help unhealthy dietary practices 123 Slide 36 LEARNING OBJECTIVE C. Involve other health care providers to offer help INSTRUCTION Discuss using brainstorming the steps taken by the Medical Officer to refer the patient to other health care providers at the health cent re. Flow charts have been to illustrate the steps. Slide 37 INVOLVE OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MEDICAL OFFICER/NURSE Refer back to MEDICAL OFFICER for medical assistance (if necessary)Involve Counselor for further help Refer to Lab for investigations COUNSELOR MEDICAL OFFICER Involve Community Health Worker for follow up Refer to Specialist / District Hospital for specialist care COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER ARRANGE The Medical Officer will link the patient by referring him/ her to the Counselor to manage diet as a risk factor. It is important to reiterate the importance of meeting the Counselor in order to make 124 lifestyle changes to address the current health condition. The Medical Officer should routinely advise about dietary changes to different patient groups. Encouraging the patient and family members to create healthy eating practices keeping in mind local cultural practices and affordable food options is necessary. This can be done before or after the patient is referred by the Medical Officer to the Counselor. Inform patients to come on follow - up dates given by the Counselor/ Medical Officer (when the patient is not regular for follow - up the Community Health Wo rker will be asked to make home visits). Slide 38 SUMMARY It is essential to involve other health care providers. Slide 39 INVOLVE THE FAMILY FamilyImportant to involve the meal planner Important to involve the finance controller Important to advise keeping in mind the family background and eating practicesOther family members may also need counseling to reduce their risk factors 125 Among people who live at home with their family members, while giving advice regarding dietary changes, it may be useful to involve t he family member who is the main person cooking for the household (often a spouse) so that appropriate action is taken to follow the dietary advice. Family members often need to be provided information on unhealthy and healthy food and how to follow a balanced diet. The nurse or counselor can provide such information. The Community Health Worker who visits families would be in a good position to advise them on how to cook hygienically, preserve nutrient content while cooking, reduce oil during cooking etc. Brief advi ce on diet from the Medical Officer is taken seriously by family members. Slide 40 INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY Medical OfficerImprove public awareness regarding proper diet Address different groups with differing dietary needs Be aware of policies and programmes related to food and dietParticipate in community initiatives for healthy eating It is important that the Medical Officer steps out of the clinic and takes health related issues to the community. Health care providers need to improve community awareness on issues related to healthy and unhealthy diets, particularly from the point of NCD prevention. Since dietary needs change across the developmental continuum (infants to elderly), the advice for healthy diets differs for different populations. It is useful for people to k now about how to choose foods which are quality tested/labeled, to ensure that street food is hygienically prepared and served and to be aware of healthy cooking and safe preservation of food. It is useful for the Medical Officer to be aware of the social and cultural influences that may influence diet habits as well as the country's policies and programmes that support healthy diets. 126 Slide 41 SUMMARY FLOW CHART Slide 4 2 WRAP UP B What do you take back at the end of the session?

The WHO92estimates that 31% of individuals over the age of 15 years are physically inactive globally.93 It is estimated that if p hysical inactivity was reduced by 10%, 1.3 million lives could be saved each year94, independent of the increased risk from being overweight, having raised blood glucose and raised blood pressure. Physical inactivity is considered the fourth leading risk fa ctor for global mortality. In developing countries, there is a shift from agriculture to urban and industrial sectors. There is an increase in physical strain and work pressure contributing to fatigue and tiredness. Lack of facilities for recreation and ex ercise contributes to the problem. Lack of physical activity is identified as a major modifiable risk factor for non -communicable chronic diseases (NCDs). It is a contributing factor for lower back and neck pain, obesity, coronary heart disease, stroke, ca ncer, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. This session on physical activity will help the Medical Officers to understand the linkages of physical activity as a risk factor to other risk factors and to non -communicabl e diseases. The first objective is to identify physical activity as a risk factor, followed by interventions to manage problems related to poor physical activity and involvement of other health care providers in addressing risk factors.

Diagrams and flowchart illustrate the linkages to th e health care providers. Slide 5 B How is physical activity different from exercise? 5 Generate discussion and write them on the board. 135 Slide 6 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE - ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCES WHO defines physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure -including activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out household chores, travelling and engaging in recreational pursuits Exercise is a sub -category of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive and aims to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness Physical activity and Exercise - Essential differences95 WHO defines physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure - including activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out household chores, travelling, and engaging in recreational pursuits. The term \"physical activity\" should not be confused with \"exercise\", which is a subcategory of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and aims to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness. Both moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity brings health benefits. Regular and adequate physical activity : Improves muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness Improves bone and functional health Reduces the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, breast and colon cancer and depression Reduces the risk of falls as well as hip or vertebral fractures; and Is fundamental to energy balance and weight control. 95 World Health Organization.

PHYSICAL INACTIVITY IN INDIAPREVALENCE (%) AGE GROUPS Both Males Females Age Group WHO Global InfoBase (2003) PHYSICAL INACTIVITY IN INDIA 54.4% were physically inactive Females were significantly more inactive than males Urban subjects were more inactive than rural subjects (65% vs50%) Fewer than 10% engaged in recreational physical activityA recent study in India (2014) among 14, 227 adults showed that: Anjana et al 2014 138 A review on diet and physical activity for prevention of NCDs in low and middle income countries suggests that policy makers urgently need to develop a comprehensive policy to incorporate dietary quality and physical activity98. There is a large gap in knowledge where physical activity is concerned in the Indian context99. In an Indian study100 on NCDs, high prevalence of excessive weight was seen in all the age groups except among the young and was prevalent in both sexes. It was higher in the urban population compared with rural. Low prevalence of being overweight was recorded among illiterate s as well as those working in agriculture or as manual workers. More female respondents were in the category of low physical activity compared to males across all the age groups. Rural population was doing more physical work than urban. In an ICMR -India st udy carried out in four regions of India101, physical activity was assessed in 14,227 individuals over the age of 20 years. In this population, 54% were inactive. Inactivity was higher among urban compared to rural populations (65% versus 50%). No recreation al activity was reported by 88.4 to 93.1% of the respondents. The study concludes that less than 10% of Indian adults are engaged in recreational physical activity and that urgent steps need to be initiated to promote physical activity to stem the twin epi demics of diabetes and obesity in India. Slide 13 and 14 STRESS ALCOHOLTOBACCO UNHEALTHY DIET PHYSICAL INACTIVITY CANCER CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES STROKE DIABETESRisk of coronary heart diseases is 30 to 50% higher in people who do not involve in moderate level physical activity. Physical activity reduces blood pressure & improves good cholesterol. A single session of physical activity deceases blood pressure level for up to about 20 hours. Moderate amount of activity decrease risk of stroke. Vigorous physical activity reduces risk of breast cancer by approximately 20 to 40 % Risk of type 2 diabetes can be reduced by 60% through physical activity. Physical activity improves control of blood glucose. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY & NCDs 13 98Lachat, C, Candeias, Kolsteren, P.

Slide 16 A What are the causes for the ' global pandemic ' of physical inactivity and what are the barriers for physical activity? 16 Slide 17 FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY Individual Regional/National policy Environment Interpersonal Global Factors that influence physical activity Low or decreasing physical activity levels often correspond with a high or rising gross national product. The drop in physical activity is partly due to inaction during leisure time and sedentary behaviour on the job and at home. Likewise, an increase in the use of \"passive\" modes of transportation (which does not involve any energy expenditure for the traveler) also contributes to physical inactivity. 141 Need for national policies on physical activity As early as in the 1950's, a study104 showed that men engage d in active physical work (conductors and post men) were less likely to suffer from coronary heart disease compared to men with sedentary occupations (bus drivers or clerical workers). More than six decades later, it has become very evident that physical e xercise has an important preventive role for a variety of NCDs. Many countries have now evolved policies and guidelines for physical activity. Recommendations for physical activity According to the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non -Communicable Diseases 2013 -2020, WHO member states have agreed to reduce physical inactivity by 10%. Policies to increase physical activity include the following: Walking, cycling and other forms of active transportation which are accessible and safe for all. Labour and workplace policies that encourage physical activity . Schools to have safe spaces and facilities for students to spend their free time actively. Students must have protected physical training time. Quality Physical Education (QPE) that supports children to develop behaviour patterns that will keep them physically active throughout their lives and Sports and recreation facilities that provide opportunities for everyone to do sports. 104Paffenbarger RS Jr, Blair SN, Lee IM.

Globally, around 31% of adults aged 15 and over were not active enough in 2008 (men 28% and women 34%). In high-income countries, 41% of men and 48% of women were insufficiently physically active, as compared to 18% of men and 21% of women in low-income countries. Slide 19 B How do we identify physical inactivity or inadequate physical activity ? 19 Generate discussion and write the points on the board. 143 Slide 20 ` HOW TO IDENTIFY Slide 21 IDENTIFY ASK Physical inactivity and lack of physical activity may not be a presenting problem. Therefore, it is essential to ask about physical activity among ALL those who report with health problems. WHAT TO ASK? Ask about: Physical activity For example: \"What kind of work do you do?\" OR \"Do you include in any kind of physical activity on a daily basis?\"Look out for the patient who is: Over weight Underweight Obese Ask about physical activity to all those who report health problems at the PHC. 144 Assessing physical activity Patient's physical activity and sedentary activity are not routinely asked about during a clinical assessment. Asking about physical activity has now been recommended as the 5th vital sign105, along with Pulse and BP. Slide 22 CAPTURE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AS A VITAL SIGN The EVS: \"2 questions, 1 minute\" 1) \"On average, how many days per week do you engage in moderate or greater physical activity?\" 2) \"On those days, how many minutes do you engage in activity at this level?\" Recommend Exercise on Prescription Slide 23 CHECK BMI BMI= weight (kilogram) \u00f7height Developing healthcare systems to support exercise: exercise as the fifth vital sign. Br J Sports Med. 2011;45:473 -74 145 Slide 24 SUMMARY POINTS Physical inactivity leads to NCDs. ASK every one about physical activity. Slide 25 LEARNING OBJECTIVE B. INTERVENE to manage problems related to physical inactivity (Advise and Assist) INSTRUCTION Discuss using brainstorming the steps to address physical inactivity as a risk factor when patients come to the Health Centre. Flow charts have been to illustrate the steps to offer care. Activity (Role play) Total duration: 30 minutes Sit in pairs and face each other. Nominate one person as the MO and the other as the patient. Use the case given to continue the activity . Before role play, give 5 minutes for reading and clarifying the case study. Ask participants what they learnt from the activity and summarize. 146 Slide 26 A ROLE PLAY A 38 year old male patient who is obese (BMI 32) comes to you with symptoms of breathlessness. His cardiac and respiratory evaluation is normal. He has a family history of heart disease. How would you intervene regarding physical exercise? 26 Slide 27 INTERVENE Patient physically active: Encourage the present status & treat the present medical condition 147 Slide 28 INTERVENE: PRESCRIPTION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND AVOIDANCE OF SEDENTARY ACTIVITY Brief Advice consists of a short (3 minute), structured conversation with the patient aimed at raising awareness of the benefits of physical activity, exploring barriers and identifying some solutions. Slide 29 BRIEF INTERVENTION (3 -20 MINUTES) MOTIVATING BEHAVIOUR CHANGE FOR PHYSICAL INACTIVITY To what extent does the person consider his/her level of physical inactivity as unhealthy? Does the person believe that physical activity will improve his/her health status? Achieve this by: Discussing the risks of continuing physical inactivity Discussing the benefits of physical activity Focusing on the patient's needs Addressing barriers Be aware of the preferences Support the behaviour change in a non -judgmental and positive manner Encourage self -efficacy Slide 30 STEPS TO ADDRESS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND OFFER HELP: FIT Frequency of Exercise: The number of occurrences of a particular physical activity during the day OR the number of days dedicated to a particular physical activity programme . Intensity of Exercise: How 'vigorous' a physical activity is . Timing of Exercise: The measure in minutes or hours expended for a particular physical activity programme 148 STEPS TO ADDRESS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND OFFER HELP 1. Frequency: The Frequency refers to the number of occurrences of a particular physical activity during the day OR the number of days dedicated to a particular physical activity programme. Simple interventions, such as encouraging individuals to stand and/or walk when television adv erts are in progress or, if working behind a computer, to take regular 15 minute breaks every hour to stretch ones legs and walk, may aid in reducing sedentary behaviour. It is a matter of strategising and prioritising what is feasible and to what the pati ent is ready to commit. 2. Intensity: The Intensity refers to how 'vigorous' a physical activity is. A positive dose response exists of derived health benefits from increasing physical activity intensity. Knowledge of the applicability of the 'progressive ove rload' principle with regards to intensity levels may be of use. Much like training a particular muscle, physical activity levels below certain minimum intensities is unlikely to elicit any beneficial physiological changes. However, it is important to note that minimum intensity varies from individual to individual. 3. Time: The Time refers to the measure in minutes or hours expended for a particular physical activity programme. Interestingly time is also the most commonly reported barrier among those not mee ting the recommended national guidelines. In patients with health conditions, different health conditions and their risks must be taken into consideration while recommending physical activity. Following the brief intervention, if the person requires more intensive counseling for behavioural change, the Medical Officer should refer to the counselor. 149 Slide 31 Exercise Children 5 -17 yrs At least 60 minutes daily of moderate to vigorous physical activityAdults 65 yrs and above At least 150 minutes of moderate - intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous -intensity physical activity in a week Adults 18 -64 yrs At least 150 minutes of moderate - intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous -intensity physical activity in a week Muscle strengthening exercises 2 or more days per week More exercise, additional health benefitsWHO 2011 The WHO guidelines recommend 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week for adults (30 minutes per day most days of the week) and for children and adolescents, 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day.106 However, the recommendations do not address the risks of sedentary behaviour . Slide 3 2 SUMMARY POINTS Prescribe physical activity as specific intervention to reduce risk for NCDs Motivate the person to engage in physical activity by understanding the risks of physical inactivity and sedentary life style and benefits of physical activity Discuss the optimal physical activity by using FIT approach 106 World Health Organization 2014, opcit 150 Slide 3 3 LEARNING OBJECTIVE C.

It is important to reiterate importance of meeting the Counselor in order to make lifestyle changes to address current health condition. 151 Inform patients to come on follow - up dates given by the Counselor/ Medical Officer (when the patient is not regular for follow - up the Community Health Worker will be asked to make home visits). Slide 3 5 SUMMARY POINTS Involvement of other health care providers like Counselor , Nurse, Community health worker, LAB, and District Hospital. Slide 3 6 INVOLVE THE FAMILY FAMILYEducate family members about the risks of physical inactivity To clarify fears and encourage physical activity Identify barriers for physical activityEncourage family rituals that promote physical activity The family needs to be educated about the risks of physical inactivity. Some families discourage physical activity in a person with a health problem, particularly a heart condition. Families need to be educated about the preventive role of physical activity for NCDs. Many families have rituals like television watching which does no t provide any physical activity. A suggestion from the medical officer on the importance of physical activity can be a good impetus for the family members. Further information about physical activity can be provided by the counsellor or nurse. 152 Slide 3 7 INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY Medical OfficerPromote community awareness on the risks of physical inactivity Health awareness in schools and workplaces on the importance of physical activity Lobby for better facilities in the community for physical activityBe a role model by being physically active In the community, the Medical Officer can serve as an agent of change by providing information about the risks of physical inactivity and the advantages of being physically active, through talks, discussions, articles in news papers, interviews and so on. Talking about the need for 'healthy' spaces for physical activity so that town planners and municipality bodies start to think about preserving and creating such spaces, lobbying for open areas for children, youth and adults c an have long -term benefits for future generations.

It can come in the way of help seeking, treatment adherence and outcome. Sources of stress in patients coming to the Health Centre may be within the family, or ge nerated from work conditions. Individual vulnerability and coping styles can influence stress perception and presentation . Non-communicable chronic diseases, stress and common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety often occur together107. The odds of non - compliance with medical treatment regimens are three times greater for depressed patients compared with non -depressed patients108. Treatment provided in primary care settings to address risk factors including mental health care are effective for pati ents, strengthen health care service systems, and reduce costs and can be provided by physicians, nurses and lay health workers. Stress, other risk factors and its impact on health : Stress can contribute to anxiety, depression, hypertension, heart diseas es and cerebrovascular disease, peptic ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease and alter immune functions leading to the development of cancer. To cope with stress, persons may use tobacco and alcohol; develop unhealthy diet practices and become physical inactive. 107 Ngo VK, Rubenstein, A, Ganju V, Kannellis P, N, Rabadan -Dieh C and Daar AS.

The first objective is about identifying stress as a risk factor followed by the inter vention to manage problems related to stress and involvement of other health care providers through referrals. Total duration: 2 hours 45 minutes approximately Slide 2 AIM The Medical Officer will be able to identify and intervene to address -stress as a risk factor and -provide advice on mental health promotion 2 Slide 3 LEARNING OBJECTIVES A.IDENTIFY stress as a risk factor for NCDs B.INTERVENE to manage problems related to stress and provide brief advice on mental health promotion C.INVOLVE other health care providers to offer help 3 I's 3 The 3 I's is an easy way to remember the MOs approach to address stress. 160 Slide 4 LEARNING OBJECTIVES A. 1. IDENTIFY stress as a risk factor 4 INSTRUCTION Facilitate a discussion about how stress can be identified in primary care. Discuss different aspects of stress among participants with examples from their field settings and use case studies. Slide 5 CAUSES OF STRESSDeath of a loved one Chronic Illness Financial problems (debts)Workplace stressTaking care of aged parents/ children CAUSES OF STRESS WHAT A PATIENT HAVING HYPERTENSION WHEN ASKED ABOUT STRESS MAY SAY: ' I have been having money problems in the last one year as my crop has failed. My father is very old and I have to bear his medical expenses. I have to send my child to school this year and pay fees.' 5161 Stress in a person can occur due to various causes i.e. work related, home related (like taking care of children, aged parents, loss of a loved one), having a chronic illness, being in debt and so on. Thus, stress can occur from various areas of our lives , life health, occupation, social, financial, etc. Slide 6 EFFECTS OF STRESS ON HEALTH STRESS CAN AFFECT MANY HEALTH CONDITIONSMULTIORGAN: Diabetes, Ageing, Chronic FatigueBLOOD VESSELS: Atherosclerosis, endothelial inflammations, immune disorders, lupus, IBD, MS, Cancer EYES : Macular Degeneration, retinal degeneration, Cataracts CHD : Cardiac fibrosis, hypertension, Ischemia, Myocardial InfarctionSKIN : Skin aging, sunburn, psoriasis, kidney disease, renal graft, arthritis, psoriasisLUNG : Parkinson's Disease, OCD, ADHD, Autism, Migraine, Stroke, Trauma, Cancer 6 Stress can affect health in many ways. Unchecked and unhealthy levels of stress can lead to lead to many health problems such us hypertension, heart disease, digestive problems, disturbed sleep, musculoskeletal disorders depression and anxiety and so on. The immune system can get impaired and make a person vulnerable to infection including cancer. GROUP ACTIVITY (Case studies) IDENT IFYING STRESS Total duration: 30 minutes Divide the participants into groups and distribute the three case studies. The cases are about individuals facing stress . Since there is an overlap between symptoms of stress and common mental disorders like anxiety and depression , these case studies focus on the need to evaluate for common mental disorders in people who have stress . The participants will read the case studies and discuss the questions and share what they understand as the problem and what steps they would take to help the patient as part of intervention (15 minutes). Each group will present (with the help of a spokesperson) their understanding and steps they will take to help the patient (10 minutes). Handouts will be distributed after group presenta tions. 162 HANDOUTS: 6.1. Checklist for identifying stress 6.2. Checklist for identifying anxiety 6.3. Checklist for identifying depression 6.4.

CASE STUDY 7 Raja is 40 years old and has a teashop near the railway station. He has a busy day and he runs his shop alone. He starts the day early in the morning and finishes late at night and has little sleep. He takes breaks to smoke bidis saying that it reduces tension. Due to lack of time he has quick meals at the local hotel. Last week, he was found to have high BP during a medical camp. He says he gets irritable at work and gets into fights with his customer and at home he gets angry easily and shouts at his wife and children for no reason. He comes to the Health Centre with his wife . After screening he meets the Medical Officer with his recent reports. What is your understanding about Raja's problems? As a Medical Officer what steps would you take to help him?A 163 Slide 8 2. CASE STUDY Rani is 32 years old and has been married for the past 7 years and has four daughters. Recently, she experiences difficulty in breathing and burning sensation in her stomach. She finds it hard to rest and finds it difficult to sleep as she says she worries about her future. She feels fearful when she visits her in-laws who ask her about having a male child. She comes to the Health Centre and her medical tests are normal. The Medical Officer finds out from Rani that her husband is talking about his second marriage to try for a male child. What is your understanding about Rani's problems? As a Medical Officer what steps would you take to help her ? 8 Slide 9 3. CASE STUDY Chotu is 35 years old and is a bus driver doing long overnight routes. When he meets the Community Health Worker he complains that his body has become weak and that there is pain in his legs. His wife adds that Chotu prefers to stay at home and avoids family functions. She says that he has been taking tonics and injections given by different doctors over the past few months but it has not helped him. He is worried that he will become weaker and lose his job. He comes to the Health Center for help and after screening his medical tests reveal that he has diabetes. He meets the Medical Officer. What is your understanding about Chotu's problems? As a Medical Officer what steps would you take to help him? 9 164 Slide 10 DEBRIEFING (3 CASES) Case 1: This case illustrates the impact of stress on Raju. Cause of stress is work -related and the consequences are poor sleep, feeling tense, unhealthy diet, use of tobacco, quarrels at home and high blood pressure. The Medical Officer will have to monitor and manage Raju's BP and address stress. Case 2: There is the presence of stress. Rani's stress is related to family problems. Rani will need help for dealing with stress. A discussion on how to differentiate between stress and an anxiety disorder (a common mental disorder) can be made here. Case 3: Chotu has developed multiple somatic complaints, poor sleep and appetite and worries. His work and family life are affected and he has been diagnosed as being diabetic. The Medical Officer will need to address and manage diabetes, and stress that can aggravate diabetes. The medical officer will also have to rule out a depressive disorder (a common mental disorder) 10 The Medical Officer will identify stress, and evaluate for anxiety and depression presented in the 3 cases and offer specific help to address them. Slide 11 IDENTIFY STRESS 11Evaluate for Stress ASK AND ASSESSRule out Anxiety Disorder and Depression The flowchart describes the patient coming to the Health Centre. The Medical Officer will ask and assess in order to identify symptoms related to stress . 165 Slide 12 IDENTIFY ASK Ask ALL those who have a health condition Probe for underlying stress, worries and tensions WHAT TO ASK? Ask about psychological distress Rule out anxiety and depression There are differences between stress & common mental health disorders such as anxiety & depression 12 WHOM TO ASK? Ask ALL who report with health problems and probe for underlying stress, worries and tensions . Evaluate for common mental disorders (anxiety and depression as per checklist given as handouts). WHAT TO ASK? The Medical Officer will probe for stress and evaluate for anxiety and depression using the checklist. Slide 13 EXAMPLE OF ASKING ABOUT STRESS IN A PATIENT 'You have been having health problems like coughing and chest pain since six months and you say that you have taken frequent leave from work due to your poor health condition. You also say that smoking bidis helps you forget tension at work. The Nurse says that your blood sugar and BP are high and that you feel tired and find it difficult to sleep. Can you tell me a little about the work you do and what situations create tension? ...' ASK about stress related symptoms like frequent and unexplained physical symptoms like headache, body ache, tiredness and poor sleep 13 The verbatim illustrates how the Medical Officer can ask for stress related problems. 166 Slide 14 IDENTIFYING STRESS PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS Headache, muscle tension or pain, chest pain, repeated episode of infection , high blood pressure, fatigue, thirst, weight gain or loss of weight, stomach upset, skin disorders, back pain, sleeplessness, loss of interest in sexual activity EMOTIONAL SYMPTOMS Anxiety, restlessness, lack of motivation or focus, irritability or anger, sadness or depression BEHAVIOURAL SYMPTOMS Overeating or under eating, angry outbursts, difficulty to concentrate or memory is impaired, drug or alcohol abuse, tobacco use, social withdrawal, taking medication without prescription or over use (pain killers etc.) 14 SYMPTOMS INDICATING STRESS109 Physical symptoms: Headache, muscle tension or pain, chest pain, repeated episodes of infection, high blood pressure, fatigue, thirst, weight gain or loss of weight, stomach upset, skin disorders, back pain, sleeplessness, loss of interest in sexual activity Emotional symptoms: Anxiety, Restlessness, Lack of motivation or focus, Irritabil ity or anger, Sadness or depression Behavioural symptoms: Overeating or under eating, angry outbursts, difficulty to concentrate or memory is impaired, drug or alcohol abuse, tobacco use, social withdrawal, taking medication without prescription or over use (pain killers etc.) 109International Labour Organization.

These symptoms should usually involve elements of: The ICD -10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders: Clinical description and diagnostic guidelines (2006) WHO(a)Apprehension (worries about future misfortunes, feeling \"on edge\", difficulty in concentrating) (b) Motor tension (restless fidgeting, tension headaches, trembling, inability to relax ) (c) Autonomic over activity (lightheadedness, sweating, tachycardia or tachypnoea , epigastric discomfort, dizziness, dry mouth) 15 The Medical Officer can identify primary symptoms of anxiety using ICD -10110. Slide 16 DIFFERENTIATING STRESS FROM DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION Sadness or low mood Loss of interest Reduced energy and Increased fatiguability Reduced concentration and attention Reduced self -esteem and self -confidence Ideas of guilt and unworthiness Pessimistic views of future Ideas or acts of self -harm or suicide Disturbed sleep and diminished appetite The ICD -10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders: Clinical description and diagnostic guidelines (2006) WHOMost of the symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks 16 The Medical Officer can identify primary symptoms of depression using ICD -10. 110 World Health Organization. ICD -10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders.http://who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf 168 Slide 17 ASSESSMENT FOR STRESS Physical examination Rule out physical illness and treat physical condition. Investigations as appropriate (lab etc.) Mental state examination Rule out common mental disorder like anxiety and depression 17 Slide 18 SUMMARY POINTS IDENTIFY stress as a risk factor for NCDs Look for the presence of a common mental disorder like anxiety or depression 18 169 Slide 19 LEARNING OBJECTIVE B. INTERVENE to manage problems related to stress 19 INSTRUCTION Interventions to manage problems related to stress are discussed. Slide 20 A HELPFUL APPROACH Listening attentively Showing concern Allowing patient to express feelings Keeping confidentiality Offering support Conveying optimism and hope that problems can be overcome 20 The Medical Officer should convey a caring attitude to the patient. Listening and showing concern, allowing the patient talk and express feelings, keeping the information confidential, offering support from the health providers at the Health Centre and conveying hope and optimism a bout making lifestyle changes are helpful approaches. 170 Slide 21 INTERVENE WHEN STRESS IS PRESENT Advise & Assist 21 The flowchart describes the patient having stress related symptoms. The Medical Officer will advise and assist for symptoms related to stress e.g. promoting hea lthy coping, relaxation, lifestyle changes and referral to Counselor for further help including pharmacotherapy for any underlying health condition. The patient must be told prior to referral to the Counselor about the importance of counseling to address c urrent issues. Follow -up dates should ideally be given at the same time by both the Medical Officer and the Counselor. Slide 22 INTERVENE FOR STRESS ACUTE STRESS Suggest simple stress management techniques (refer to Counselor for deep breathing, muscle relaxation) Strengthen healthy coping and social supports Promote positive thinking and time management Promote healthy lifestyle changes (diet, physical activity, avoidance of alcohol, tobacco use, self -medication without prescription) Avoid stimulants like caffeine Look out for suicidal ideasFOR PATIENTS WITH A RECENT SEVERE TRAUMATIC EVENT, REFER TO COUNSELOR DO NOT prescribe benzodiazepines/ antidepressants for acute stress or symptoms of grief REFER TO A SPECIALIST IF: -Grief lasting longer than a couple of months -Severe stress -Requiring psychotherapy -Not responding to current approach mhGap Guidelines on Stress22 The interventions for acute stress and recent severe traumatic stress will vary111. For acute stress, stress management techniques, strengthening healthy coping and social supports (from family and community) and healthy lifestyle changes are advised. Refer to a specialist for further management if the symptoms are severe. 111 World Health Organization.

Self help tips can be advised by the Medical Officer. Slide 24 INTERVENE WHEN ANXIETY / AND OR DEPRESSION IS PRESENT Advise and Assist 24 The flowchart illustrates how the Medical Officer will advise and assist with interventions after identifying anxiety and depression112. 112 World Health Organization. mhGAP Intervention Guide for mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non -specialized health settings, 2010. http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241548069_eng.pdf 172 The Medical Officer will advise simple anxiety management techniques, strengthen coping and social support using local resources, suggest healthy ways of managing stress and promote healthy diet and physical activity. The patient will be cautioned against the use of stimulants, alcohol and tobacco use and non -monitored prescription drugs. Slide 25 PHARMACOTHERAPY FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ANXIETY If anxiety is severe and incapacitating the individual: -use minor tranquillizers like Diazepam 5 -15mg per day or -Alprazolam 0.5-1.5 mg per day in divided doses for not more than 4 to 6 weeks. -Reassurance about current situation and minor tranquilizer will relieve most symptoms of anxiety 25DEPRESSION Use pharmacotherapy if patient has a moderate or severe syndrome of depression Recommended antidepressant medications under WHO mhGAP include SSRIs [Fluoxetine (20 mg) Tricyclic antidepressants [Amitryptiline , Imipramine started at dose and increased to 100 -150 mg/day)]. SSRIs are preferred antidepressant in patients with cardiac problems and elderly. Explain lag in onset of symptoms, potential side-effects and duration of treatment Involve family to monitor in case of suicidal risk Keep in mind drug -drug and drug -disease interactions if person is already on treatment for another medical disorder The use of anxiety reducing drugs like benzodiazepines or antidepressants is not routinely recommended for the treatment of acu te stress or grief. If the anxiety is severe and incapacitating the individual significantly, use minor tranquillizers like diazepam 5 -15mg per day or alpr azolam 0.5 -1.5 mg per day in divided doses for not more than 4 to 6 weeks. Reassurance about the curr ent situation along with a minor tranquilizer will relieve most of the symptoms of anxiety. Use of benzodiazepines can rapidly lead to dependence. Therefore they must be used only in exceptional cases. These drugs must be used cautiously in the elderly (at half the adult dose, short -acting preferred over long -acting) (mhGAP) , avoided in pregnant and breast feeding women and not prescribed in children. Patients needing more intensive interventions may be referred to a specialist. 173 Slide 26 IN CASE OF PATIENT WITH SUICIDAL RISK Assess suicidal risk. If suicidal intent is strong, refer to specialist (It is an emergency) Prescribe required sedation (Diazepam 10 -20 mg per day as an initial measure). Inform family about risk. Educate them about the illness -that patient should not be left alone and that harmful objects should be kept away (poisons, weapons etc.) In patients reporting thoughts of self -harm, the MO, nurse or counselor may advise of ways of managing thoughts of self harm -calming oneself, not being alone, reaching out and getting support Assessing for suicidal risk Psychological distress, agitation, mood changes, anxiety, hopelessnessSignificant sleep disturbances, multiple somatic complaints Social isolation, substance abuseFamily history of mental illness or suicide, past history of attemptsMO must ask for suicidal thoughts 26 When self - harm and suicide are recognized, offer support and involve family members. It is important to involve the Counselor and Community Health Worker for providing support and after - care. Patients with a strong suicidal risk must be managed as in -patient and referred for specialist care. In the case of persistent anxiety and suicidal ideation with depressive symptoms (those in stupor and refuse food) having no improvement in one month of continued treatment refer patie nt to a specialist/ District Hospital. Slide 27 SUMMARY POINTS INTERVENE for stress: advise healthy coping, support systems and simple relaxation techniques Evaluate for anxiety and depression and manage appropriately Assess for any suicidal risk and intervene 27 174 Slide 28 LEARNING OBJECTIVE C. INVOLVE other health care providers to offer help 28 Slide 29 INVOLVE OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS MEDICAL OFFICER/NURSE Refer back to MEDICAL OFFICER for medical assistance (if necessary)Involve Counselor for further help Refer to Lab for investigations COUNSELOR MEDICAL OFFICER Involve Community Health Worker for follow up Refer to Specialist / District Hospital for specialist care COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER ARRANGE 175 Slide 30 SUMMARY It is essential to involve other health care providers. The Medical Officer will link the patient by referring him/ her to the Counselor to manage stress. It is important to reiterate the importance of meeting the Counselor in order to discuss and ventilate and find ways of managing problems and that the Commun ity Health Worker will make home visits and follow up if necessary. Where there is no Counselor, the Nurse can be trained in providing counseling. In many countries, Nurses have been shown to be able to provide effective counseling and improve health outc omes. Slide 31 INVOLVE THE FAMILY Emphasize the importance of preventing stress and treating common mental disorders to the accompanying family member Involve the Counselor in more detailed intervention with the family After the clinical consultation Involve the Community Health Worker in maintaining contact and providing follow -up support to the family Even in a busy practice, it is useful for the Medical Officer to spend some time explaining to the family member on the importance of stress prevention to reduce risk and improve outcome for NCDs. This will he lp to reduce the caregiver's worry about the person's health and better support the person's recovery. Often, stress is related to problems within the family. In such cases, it is useful to involve the counselor in talking to the family members. Families a lso need to understand that common mental disorders are real disorders, and not just because of 'psychological weakness'. Finally, health problems in one family member can cause stress for other family members, and helping them can help the whole family, a nd not just the specific health condition. 176 Slide 32 GET INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY Medical Officer as a change agent in the communityPublic talks on stress and common mental disorders Participation in school programmes on mental health promotion Participation in workplace programmes on health and safetyParticipation in public debates on reducing stress and common mental disorders Health of the community cannot be effectively taken care of by only clinical interventions. We need to take prevention activities into the community. Talking about the prevention and management of stress and common mental disorders in public platforms (lec tures, public discussions, television shows, mobile messages), adopting healthy lifestyles to avoid stress, recognizing symptoms of common mental disorders among ourselves, our co -workers and families and taking corrective action are all activities for bet ter health and well -being of our communities. Slide 33 33Healthy mental activity (thought, perception, emotion, behaviour )Productive daily activities Fulfilling relationshipsAbility to adapt and cope with stressPositive Mental Health Messages from doctors on positive mental health and attitudes at public for a can be an effective technique for mental health promotion. 177 Slide 34 SUMMARY FLOW CHART 34 Slide 35 WRAP UP B What do you take back at the end of the session? 35 Invite the participants to share about what they take back from the session and how they can use the learning at their Health Centre. 178 HANDOUTS : 6.10.

Slide 2 Activity (Group Work) A WORKING AS A TEAM How can we work as a team in primary care? The team: Medical Officer Counselor Community Health Worker Health Centre District Hospital (Duration : 30 minutes) 2 186 TEAMWORK IN ACTION Total duration: 30 minutes Divide participants into groups and give chart papers and pens for the activity. The group will nominate a representative to make the presentation (15 minutes). Ask the group how health care providers work as a team to help the patient from the time he/she enters the Health Centre. Arrows can be used to explain linkages among the team of health care providers in the given diagram (use Slide 3). Also discuss the te am's role in the community. Summarize after group presentations. Slide 3 TEAMWORK IN ACTION (Use arrows) PATIENT COMING TO HEALTH CENTRE COUNSELOR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERMEDICAL OFFICER DISTRICT HOSPITAL HEALTH CENTRE 3 Ask the groups to use arrows to depict linkages. Give 15 minutes for group work and after presentation by each group discuss. 187 Slide 4 TEAMWORK IN ACTION PATIENT COMING TO HEALTH CENTRE COUNSELOR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERMEDICAL OFFICER DISTRICT HOSPITAL HEALTH CENTRE 4 There are many ways of interpreting the patient's journey to seek help. The patient can be referred by the Community Health Worker or come directly to the Health Centre after which he/ she is seen by the Medical Officer ( and/or Nurse). The Medical Officer treats the patient and refers him/ her to the Counselor for further help. The Counselor after seeing the patient can refer the patient back to the Medical Officer for health related issues/ medicatio n and link up to the Community Health Worker for home visits and follow -up. Use of contemporary technology All team members can use contemporary technology to engage and maintain patients in follow -up. SMS messaging, phone calls, quit lines and internet -based communication can increasingly be exploited to improve contact with patients and provide them continued support. Referral When there is a need for specialized care (beyond the capacity of primary care), the patient will be referred to the specialist / District Hospital by the Medical Officer. In the community , summarise the ways in which different health professionals can be involved in health promotion, health education, early detection and addressing risk factors. 188 Slide 5 RISK FACTORS IN NCDs 5Stress Tobacco useHarmful alcohol useUnhealthy DietPhysical Inactivity Cardiovascular Diseases Diabetes Cancer Chronic Respiratory Diseases Common Mental Disorders The more the risk factors, greater are the chances of developing NCDs. Assessment of Risk Factors for NCDs and documentation at the Health Centre Slide 6 6NCD risk factor assessment and record in health care Parameters Details Comments Socio -demographic details Date of visit Age, Gender, Contact Information Consent for follow -up Record risk for NCD Non Modifiable Risk FactorsFamily history of: Cardiovascular disease Hypertension Diabetes Cancer Chronic respiratory disease Mental disorderWhether present or absent Modifiable Risk Factor Tobacco use: Never Past (smoking and/or smokeless) Current (smoking and/or smokeless)Age of initiation, quantity per day,age at quitting Age at initiation, quantity per day and currently, attempts to quit, severity of dependence, last use, desire to quit Documentation of the absence or presence of risk factors for NCDs, of the intervention provided and monitoring whether the patient has been successful in reducing the risk factors with the support of the health providers is very important. In the long run, it will indicate whether reduct ion of risk factors has prevented the developm ent and progression of the NCD. 189 Slide 7 7Parameters Details Comments Modifiable Risk FactorsExposure to tobacco smoke Exposure to other environmental toxinsEnquire about passive or second hand smoking Enquire about exposure at home, workplace etc Modifiable Risk FactorAlcohol Never Past CurrentAge of initiation, frequency and type, age of quitting Age of initiation, frequency and type, frequency of more than 5 drinks/day, dependence, last use, desire to quit Modifiable Risk FactorDiet Frequency of fast/fried food Frequency of added salt intake (sprinkling extra salt, pickled and preserved foods) Servings of fruits Servings of vegetables 24 Hour dietary recallFrequency per week Frequency per dayNCD risk factor assessment and record in health care It is important to record both non -modifiable and modifiable risks and give a feedback regarding these to the patient.

Provide a follow -up date and plan of action For chronic diseases, follow -up and ongoing monitoring and support is important. In a good multi - disciplinary set -up, the care plan and individual health care provider responsib ilities will be comprehensively documented. For eg. While the Medical Officer is responsible for providing treatment advice for the NCD and the Doctor/Nurse giving the patient brief advice on reducing the risk factor (e.g. smoking), the Counselor will provide counselling on how to deal with withdrawal and prevent relapse; the Community Health Worker will remind the patient on the follow -up date and provide support in between follow -ups. 190 Slide 9 9NCD risk factor assessment and record in health care -Summary Record Risk factor absentPositive feedback and encourage healthy lifestyle Re-emphasize healthy diet, physical exercise, avoidance of tobacco and alcohol, positive mental health and coping with stress Risk factor presentList risk factors and educate about lifestyle modification Screen for NCDs including diagnostic tests Monitor risk factors at follow -up and provide feedback and support NCD presentManagement plan for NCD List risk factors and educate about lifestyle modification Screen for other NCDs including diagnostic tests Monitor NCD and risk factors at follow -up and provide feedback and support The patient's record should contain a summary of the risk factors and the interve ntion provided. While this is a summary of the details that need to be recorded for NCD risk reduction, this record may be maintained separately (for e.g. in an NCD clinic) or be integrated with the general case record in the primary health care centre. Counselors and community health care workers may add supplementary information on the frequency with which they have seen the patient, the nature of intervention (e.g. counselling session or home visit) and dates for follow -up. 191 Slide 10 SIMPLIFY AND AMPLIFY RISK REDUCTION AS A TEAM COUNSELORCOMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERMEDICAL OFFICER RISK FACTORS INTEGRATING DIFFERENT ROLES TO HELP THE PATIENT AT THE HEALTH CENTRE10 Working together as a team is more efficient and is grea tly beneficial for the patient in order to reduce risk factors for NCDs.

In some countries like Australia113, it is estimated that more than 90% of people have at least one risk factor for NCDs. While it is acknowledged that there are non -modifiable risk factors fo r NCDs, the fact that most risk factors can be controlled, and that reducing the number of risk factors can reduce risk for disease must be recognized.

Nearly 80% of deaths in these countries occur below the age of 69 and in India the prevalence of NCDs is incre asing and predicted to become the 'new epidemic' 2 a There are few non -modifiable risk factors for NCDs. According to the WHO, there are many modifiable risk factors including behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, low fruit and vegetable intake (unhealthy diet), poor physical activity and stress. 3 b Tobacco use may not be a presenting problem and may be hidden. The Medical Officer should ask all patients who report with health problems about tobacco u se including obse rving signs. 4 c NRT supports the process of quitting and act on the brain to reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms. There is also non - NRT medication in such as Bupropion, Varenicline and Nortryptiline 5 d Binge drinking refers to drinking 5 or more drinks on one drinking occasion and is associated with serious health risks. Dependence refers to a harmful pattern of consumption with tolerance, withdrawal and salience. Drinking in pregnancy can have adverse effects on pregnancy outcome and produce foetal alcohol spectrum disorders 6 b The BMI is calculated as follows: Weight in Kgs/ Height in M2. The range for normal BMI among Indians is 18.5 -22.9. 7 d Physical activity is not contraindicated with just a diagnosis of NCD. In fact, physical activity is important in the control of NCDs, but some modification may be required in patients with certain NCDs . 8 c Stress can present in numerous ways. Stress is an important modifiable risk factor for NCD. Preventing and learning to cope 202 with stress is an important approach to reduce risk for NCD and improve outcomes. 9 c The first step in the management of a patient expressing suicidal ideas is an assessment of suicidal risk. A patient with a serious suicidal risk needs to be referred for inpatient treatment. Providing support, ensuring a safe environment, involving a multi-disciplinary team for psychological support and follow -up are important steps in managing suicidal risk. 10 b The MO will IDENTIFY, INTERVENE and INVOLVE the multi disciplinary team of health professionals in prevention and care to address risk factors for NCDs. The Counselor will ASK, ASSIST and ARRANGE The Community Health Worker will use the TALK approach -TELL what NCDs and risk factors are; ADVISE on how to reduce risk factors and adopt healthy lifestyles; LEAD collective community action ; KNOW more about NCDs, risk factors, self -help approaches and networks for treatment and support. 11 False COTPA refers to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act. It was enacted in 2003 to protect the public from adverse and harmful effects of second hand smoking. 12 True According to the WHO report Alcohol and Health 2004, alcohol is responsible for 200 disease conditions and even moderate consumption is not free of health risk. 13 False 40% of Indian families consume 10 g of salt daily (NIN, 2010) 14 False Physical activity is any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure (e.g. playing, house work, travelling). Exercise is a sub category of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive and aims to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness. 15 False Dietary recommendations vary across the developmental continuum. Young children need food rich in energy and good for body building. Elderly people need food rich in fibre and low in fat. 203 16 False Deficiency of dietary fibre is specially associated with a risk to colonic cancer. 17 True Foods high in sodium content also include processed cheese, pickles, foods with preservatives and instant noodles 18 True Other forms of aerobic exercise include running, brisk walking, swimming. 19 False Nicotine is the primary addictive substance in tobacco. Nicotine is said to be many times more addictive than illicit drugs. Tar and nearly 4000 other chemicals are present in tobacco, including many carcinogens. 20 False Community interventions play an important role in NCD risk reduction. Such interventions encompass not just health awareness, but access to healthy foods, proper environments for physical exercise and recreation, policies on tobacco and alcohol and a netwo rks of services in the community for treatment and support 204 Annexure 5 NATIONAL MEETING OF EXPERTS FOR DEVELOPING TRAINING MANUALS TO ADDRESS PSYCHOLOGICAL/BEHAVIOURAL RISK FACTORS FOR NCDs (NIMHANS, BANGALORE - 6th & 7th Feb 2014) Ms. Aruna ASHA worker, Kolar Dr. Vivek Benegal Professor & Head, Centre for Addiction Medicine, NIMHANS , Bangalore Dr P Satish Chandra Director/Vice , Goa Dr George A.
