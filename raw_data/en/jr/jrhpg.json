He is now 3.5. Do any of you have any thoughts (positive/negative)? They claim to have recovered 100 kids so far. That looks very tempting. Please share your thoughts/research. [Original poster's comments (1)](/post/a48044545/homeopathy_-houston_homeopathy?commentBy=rZF95cprnzoxV8HO) comments (22) I'll be blunt. I think true homeopathy is quackery, plain and simple. Homeopathic remedies are prepared in such a way that if they worked (beyond placebo effect), we would have to scrap our entire understanding of chemistry and physics. So basically... they don't work. That said, I think a lot of homeopaths don't practice traditional homeopathy so much as naturopathy, which employs methods like herbal medicine and nutritional changes. I am extremely skeptical of this to be honest; there isn't enough scientific evidence to support most of it. But at least it is theoretically plausible that some of these treatments could be beneficial beyond placebo. I would be very skeptical of recovery claims in general, no matter the source, but especially if they are trying to sell you a product or service. Still, you may not have much to lose. Money and time mainly. Although I would research any proposed treatments to make sure they weren't dangerous. - Last edited 02-24-14 Dani, from seeds2sprouts is very helpful and always willing to help in any way. Kids can recovery, wether you believe or not but it happens and no they werent misdiagnosed either. TACA yahoo group has a thread specifically about the place you're talking about.Advertisement | page continues below - Last edited 02-24-14 ^^^^^ Magic water will not cure anything. (no matter how much the TACA folks promise you otherwise..) It's modern day Voodoo at it's best. As for their personal claim of 100 children \"Recovered\" so far! WOW - If that was anywhere close to true it would be a BREAKTHROUGH in Autism treatment. Which would be easily substantiated by actual empirical evidence/peer-reviewed articles/studies... (you know that.) & catapult this agency into international fame and fortune.. but hey it's posted on their website so it must be true. \"Cure peddlers\" thrive on blind hope and desperation. Lily (imo of course..) - mommytoaronInactivePosted 02-24-14 Homeopathy has statistically less than one molecule of whatever substance per 'dose' It's literally sugar. As PP said, if you want to go down this road, integrative medicine is a better approach. - Homeopathy is favored water that has the \"memory of\" a curative substance. The only problem with that is that water does not actually have a memory. It has two parts hydrogen to one part oxygen. Homeopathy is the worlds longest running pseudoscience scam. - Thanks for your honest opinion. Can they legally claim the 100 recoveries?

Is there any truth to anything? - Belief is a tremendous placebo. When we believe something is working we unconsciously work harder to make an outcome. - tPosted 02-25-14 One thing that puzzles me is if you go see a homeopathic practioner, they honestly believe it works. I have met two so far and they honestly appear to believe in it and spent years and lots of money to go to school to learn about it.I hate to think all of these practioners are scam artists, kwim? Just looking at the other side of it, homeopathy didn't work for us but it makes me wonder why. I have read blogs also of parents who swear by it. I dunno.... "}
