Mechanisms underlying vaccine responses overlap with those regulating immune responses in health and disease. Therefore, an understanding of mechanisms underpinning these responses will have broad implications. Variation in immune response genes cont ributes to impaired vaccine responses 2-4. Understanding the contribution of genetic variants to vaccin e responses is likely to be particularly important in ear ly life given the generalized functional immaturity of the immune system in infants and the highly vari able kinetics of its maturation over the first few years of life5-7. However, studies of genetic influences on early childhood vaccine responses are scarce. Since a number of genes from several pathways are likely to be important, a targeted approach is necessar y. This thesis explored the effects and interactions of genes associat ed with atopy, as atopy, or the genetic risk for it, has been associated with modulation of ear ly childhood vaccine responses. This thesis aimed to: 1) investigate geneti c variants associated with atopy on early childhood vaccine responses; 2) examine interactions between these genetic variants and non-genetic factors; 3) appro ach developmental genetic infl uences on genetic effects and their interactions; and 4) extend findings on vaccine responses to other immunological phenotypes and disease outcomes. This thesis investigates three paediatric coho rts. Diphtheria and tetanus vaccine responses were investigated in a cohort of Australian ch ildren recruited antena tally on the basis of a family history of atopy. Pneumococcal vaccine responses were investigated in two Dutch paediatric cohorts recruited on the basis of mi ddle ear disease, speci fically acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. This a pproach allowed for the examination of genetic effects, including gene-environment interactions and epistasis, in separate populations and extension of the findings to disease outcomes . In chapter 2, genetic effects, including 12 epistasis, of the IL-4/IL-13 axis on pneumo coccal vaccine outcomes are explored. In Chapter 3, genetic effects of the IL-4/IL-13 axis, including gene-e nvironment (parental smoking (PS)) interactions on di phtheria and tetanus vaccine responses are investigated and extended to analyses of immune responses to non-vaccine antigens. In Chapter 4, the antecedents of childhood vaccine responses and developmental genetic effects are explored by analysing the contribution of genetic vari ation and gene-environment (parental smoking) interactions in the IL-4/IL-13 ax is to cord blood responses. In Chapter 5, the role of an important polymorphism in a key innate immunity gene, CD14 -159T, is examined including age-dependent effects, on pneum ococcal vaccine responses and middle ear disease outcomes. In Chapter 6, the inte raction between genetic polymorphisms in cytokine genes and gender upon va ccine responses at 2 years is investigated. During the tenure of this thesis, I also had the opportunity to contribute to rela ted work investigating gene-environment interactions and their contribution to atopic outcomes in other cohorts. The resulting manuscripts are included in the appendices. In summary, the main findings of this thesis were: 1) genetic polymorphisms in the IL- 4/IL-13 axis, selected on the basis of an asso ciation with atopy, were associated with lower pneumococcal humoral vaccine responses compared to those with the re maining alleles; 2) children with these alleles and who were exposed to PS had lower humoral and cell- mediated responses to diphtheria and tetanus vaccinations, and this relationship was not found in the absence of this exposure; 3) th e interaction of genotype and PS extended to responses to non-vaccin e antigens, including those repres entative of the innate immune system; 4) these genotypes were also associ ated with lower cord blood immune responses, especially cord blood IL-10 responses, and the magnitude of reduction was greater in those exposed to PS; 5) gender-dependent genetic a ssociations of the an CD-14 -159T allele, previously associated with atopy, was associated w ith lower humoral pneumococcal vaccine responses and an increased frequency of middle ear disease. Taken together the findings in this thesis supported the importance of the genetic underpinnings of atopy to vaccine respons es and other immunologically mediated phenotypes. Additionally, they re inforced the necessity for jo int consideration of genetic and non-genetic variables in genetic associati on studies and that these assessments should 13 be undertaken within a developmental fr amework. Furthermore, they suggest the importance of epigenetic factors in vacci ne response regulation. Finally, given the increased frequency of alleles associated with impaired vaccine responses in PS exposed individuals in many developing countries compar ed to the studied populations, they suggest that the combination of genetic and environm ental may disproportionately impair vaccine responses in deve loping countries. Ultimately, the enhanced understanding of gene tic, non-genetic factors and their nexus may result in improved use of existing vaccines and the development of novel efficacious vaccines. 14 15 1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW 16 INTRODUCTION Vaccination has markedly reduced the burden of many infectious diseases, eliminated (smallpox) and has the potential to eliminate8 some naturally acquired infections. Vaccination is being used or developed for an increasing range of both infectious and non-infectious diseases. As vaccine response mech anisms overlap with those regulating immune responses in health and disease an unders tanding of mechanisms underlying vaccine responses will have far-reaching implications. Genetic variation contributes to the variance in vaccine responses 2-4. Understanding the contribution of genetics to vaccine responses is likely to be particularly important in early life given the generalize d functional immaturity of the i mmune system in infancy and the highly variable maturation kineti cs during this period. Furtherm ore, the potential impact of an improved understanding of vaccine response is greatest in infancy and early childhood as they bear a disproportionate infectious di sease burden. Therefore, this thesis studied genetic influences on vaccine responses in infancy and early childhood. 17 LITERATURE REVIEW A short history of vaccination The word vaccine is derived from the Latin word vaccinus (pertaining to cows), from the root word vacca (cow) and relates to the use of cowpox virus inoculation for immunization against smallpox. In the cont ext of infectious disease, a vaccine is a suspension of attenuated or killed microorganisms, or of antigenic proteins derived from them, administered for the prevention, ameliorati on, or treatment of infectious diseases9. In addition to the longer standing methodologies us ing attenuated or killed microorganisms and toxoids, more recent innovations have included subunit vaccines, including virus-like particles 10, conjugate polysaccharide vaccines 11and nucleic acid vaccines 12. While Edward Jenner is generally identified as the \"father\" of vaccination, attempts at vaccination predate his work w ith cowpox. Tables 1 and 2 summarise the development of human vaccines prior to and after Jenner, respectively. 18 Organism (date) Individual(s) Comments 7th century Indian Buddhists Ingested snake venom 10th century Chinese Unverified reports of inoculation and variolation* 18th century Chinese A medical text \"The Golden Mirror of Medicine\" described four forms of inoculation against smallpox: 1. plugging the nose with cotton wool powdered scabs 2. powdered scabs blown into the nose 3. wearing the undergarments of an infected child 4. packing the nose with vesicle fluid smeared on cotton 17th century Chinese Use of powdered white cow fleas for oral smallpox vaccination Mid 18th century Francis Home Inoculation# of humans against measles 1721 Lady Mary Wortley Montagu Introduced variolation (figure 1) to England upon her return from Constantinople 1774 Benjamin Jesty A cattle breeder wh o after contracting cowpox from his herd deliberately inoculated his wife and children with cowpox to avoid a smallpox epidemic Table 1. Outline of the development of human vaccines prior to Jenner *variolation: purposefully infecting a person with smallpox (Variola) to minimise the severity of the infection and to induce immunity against subs equent infection. #inoculation: the introduction into the body of the causative organism of a disease Jenner's was the first scientific attempt to co ntrol an infectious disease without transmitting the disease13. His experiments were founded on th e local folklore that those who contracted cowpox \"did not take the smallpox\"14. He proved that cowpox could be passed directly between an infect ed person and healthy indivi duals and prevents smallpox infection. Seminal events in vaccine development and te chnology subsequent to Jenner are outlined below. The concepts of attenuation, virule nce and the necessity for revaccination were published by Dumesnil in 1879 14. Following observations of impaired virulence of the 19 chicken cholera bacterium following accidental prolonged exposure of chicken cholera culture to air, Pasteur developed an attenua ted chicken cholera bacterium in the late 1870s15. This demonstrated that a weakened form of the infectious ag ent itself could be used for vaccination. This weakened form would also be less likely to transmit other diseases. During the same period, he extended his work on attenuated bacteria to anthrax vaccination16. The first chemically attenuated viral vaccine, rabies, was administered to humans in 188517. The first \"killed\" vaccine, the kill ed hog cholera \" virus\" vaccine, was developed in 1886 and the first killed vacci nes for humans, typhoid and cholera, were developed in 189618, 19. The findings in 1888 20 that diphtheria was toxicogeni c and that antitoxin neutralised diphtheria toxin in vitro result ed in the development of th e first toxoids: diphtheria and tetanus in the early 20th century 14. In 1923, Glenny and Hopkins demonstrated that diphtheria could be transfor med into a toxoid by formalin21. This was discovered serendipitously when the containers of diphtheri a toxin were cleaned with formalin as they were too large to be autoclaved. The form alin rendered the toxin so weak that the experimental animals survived its effects. The first human vaccination for tetanus was performed in 192622. Two developments in culture techniques transf ormed the development of vaccines. Firstly, the use of the chorioallantoic membrane of the fertile hen's egg as a medium for growing viruses in 1931 23, as previously this required liv e animals which was expensive and associated with increased risks of allergic disease. Secondly, work by Maitland and Maitland in 1949 24 using cultures of minced chicken ki dney in media composed of chicken serum and mineral salts to grow vaccinia viru s. This was the forerunner of work on human poliovirus in the late 1940s25 that demonstrated the ability to grow human viruses outside a living host in a relatively easy and safe manner. The development of new technologies in the 199 0s including reassort ment, reverse genetics and cold adaptation provided new tools for the development of novel vaccines. Specifically, these techniques underpinned the ge neration of non-parenteral live, attenuated, viral vaccines that confer prolonged immunity, i.e. the co ld- adapted influenza vaccine 14. 20 Vaccines based on bacterial proteins, pol ysaccharides, and protein conjugated polysaccharides augmented the vaccine armamentarium. Their development was prompted by factors including adverse reactions to the whole cell pertussis v accine. Acellular pertussis vaccines based on the main protective antigens of Bordetella pertussis (toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin) were subsequently developed26, 27 and first licensed for use in 198114. During the 1970s and 80s, multiple bacterial vaccines comprised of purified capsular polysaccharides were developed. Ho wever, the multiplicity of pneumococcal serotypes complicated the development of a pneumococcal vaccine. Austria developed the first polyvalent pne umococcal polysaccharide vaccine in 197728; it contained 14 antigens initially but was later increased to 23 antigens14. Subsequently, to improve immunogenicity, Schneerson joined a carrier protein (polyribosylribotil phosphate) to diphtheria toxoid to develop the first conjugate polysaccharide vaccine29. Pneumococcal vaccines are discussed in detail later in th is introduction. Recombinant protein vaccines represented the next great progress in vaccinology. Particles of Hepatitis B surface antigen found in infected individuals were immunogenic, protective and non-infectious 30, however, the rise of the Huma n immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic and limited sources of human plas ma derived Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) drove the cloning of the gene for this antigen12. This approach re duced the risk of possible contamination by undetected foreign agents. Three contemporary factors have provided furt her impetus for vaccine research: (1) the application of vaccines to non-infectious conditions; (2) recent, and potentially further, bioterrorist attacks; and (3 ) the threat of pandemics, in cluding human immunodeficiency virus, the influenza virus and the severe acute respiratory synd rome coronavirus. Combined with advances in vaccine design and production, these fact ors provide fertile ground for continuing advances in vaccinology. 21 Live/ Attenuated Killed whole organism Protein or polysaccharide Genetically engineered 18th Century Smallpox (1878) 19th Century Rabies (1885) Typhoid (1896) Cholera (1896) Plague (1897) Early 20th Century Tuberculosis (Bacille-Calmette-Guerin) (1927) Yellow Fever (1935) Pertussis (Whole cell) (1926) Influenza (1936) Ricketssia (typhus) (1938) Diphtheria (1923) * Tetanus (1927)* pertussis* Anthrax# Hepatits B recombinant (yeast or mammalian cell derived) Acellular pertussis (some components) Lyme (Eschericia coli recombinant) Human Papilloma virus (recombinant virus like particles) Table 2.

Modified from Plotkin, Vaccines, 4th ed. 22 The Organisms and their associated diseases Diphtheria Diphtheria is an acute, toxin-mediated disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The disease name derives from the Greek diph theria, meaning leather hide, and describes the classical appearan ce of the oropharyngeal membrane. It was described in the 5th Century BC by Hippocrates 14, and epidemics were described in the 6th Century AD by Aetius 31. The bacterium was first observed in diphtheritic membranes by Klebs in 1883 and cultivated by L\u00f6ffler in 1884 32. As described above, antit oxin was invented in late 19th century 20, and toxoid was developed in the 1920s22. Corynebacterium Diphtheriae C. diphtheriae is an aerobic gram-positive bacillus . Toxin production (toxigenicity) only occurs when the bacillus is itself infected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacteriophage) carrying the genetic information for the toxin (tox gene). Only toxigenic strains cause severe disease. Manifestations include inf ections of the upper resp tonsillar and laryngeal ia) and cutaneous diphtheria. Complications, secondary to systemic dissemi nation of the toxin, in clude myocarditis and neuritis, both of which are associat ed with substantial mortality rates 14. The overall case- fatality rate for diphtheria is 5%-10%, with higher death rate s (up to 20%) in persons <5 and >40 years of age 33. The case-fatality rate for diphthe ria has changed very little during the last 50 years33, reinforcing the role of vaccination. Epidemiology Diphtheria occurs worldwide, but clinical cases are more prevalent in temperate zones. Human carriers are the reservoir for C. diphtheria, and are usually asymptomatic. In outbreaks, high percentages of children are found to be transient carriers. Transmission is most often person-to-person spread from the respiratory tract and rarely, transmission may occur from skin lesions or fomites33. Diphtheria was once a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children. In England and Wales during the 1930s, diphtheria was among the top three causes of death for children <15 years of age 34. This rapidly decreased with the widespread use of toxoid in 23 the late 1940s. Subsequently, in the USA, diphtheria was seen most frequently in Native Americans 34and persons in lower socioeconomic strata 33. The frequency if infection in Native Americans might be, at least in part , attributable to a genetic predisposition. Although diphtheria disease is rare in the United States, it appears that Corynebacterium diphtheriae continues to circulate in areas of the country where it was previously endemic 33. Diphtheria continues to occur in other parts of the world, with a major epidemic beginning in 1990 in countries of the former Soviet Union. By 1994, the epidemic had affected all 15 Newly Independent States (NIS), with more than 157,000 cases and 5000 deaths reported. In the six years from 1990 through 1995, the NIS accounted for over 90 percent of all diphtheria cases reported to the World Health Organization from the entire world35. The outbreak is believed to be due to se veral factors, including a lack of routine immunization of adults 33, but vaccine failure might also contribute. Diphtheria toxoid Toxoid was developed around 1921, but was not widely used until the early 1930s. It became routinely used as a combined prepara tion with tetanus toxoid and pertussis vaccine in the 1940s. It is produced by growing toxigenic C. diphtheriae in liquid medium and the filtrate is incubated with formaldehyde to convert toxin to toxoid. It is adsorbed onto an aluminium salt and preserved with thiomersal. Diphtheria toxoid is available combined with tetanus as paediatric DT or adult T d, and with both tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine as DTPa. Paediatric fo rmulations (DT and DTPa) contain a similar amount of tetanus toxoid as adult Td, but contain 3-4 times as much diphtheria toxoid 14. DTPa vaccines have been combined with other vaccines to facilitate universal vaccination by simplifying vaccine delivery. The vaccine us ed in Australia currently is INFANRIX\u00ae PENTA (GlaxoSmithKline). Its active ingred of IU (10 U) HBsAg 40 D-antigen units of poliovirus Type 1, 8 D-antigen units of poliovirus Type 2 and 32 D-antigen units of poliovirus Type 3, all adsorbed to aluminium salts. In Western Australia, INFANRIX\u00ae PENTA (GlaxoSmithKline), a combination of DTPa, inactivated polio vaccine and Hepatitis B vaccine, is recommended at 2, 4 and 6 months and 4 years of age36. 24 After a primary series of three properly spaced diphtheria toxoid doses, a protective level of antitoxin (defined as >0.1 international units of antitoxin/ml), is reached in over 95%37. However, there is debate concerning the mi nimum protective level, with no antibody level conferring absolute protection14 Tetanus Tetanus is an acute, often fatal, disease caused by an exotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. It is characterized by genera lized rigidity and skeletal muscle spasm, which usually involves the jaw (lockjaw) and neck and then becomes generalized. Although records from the 5th century B.C. contain clinical descript ions of tetanus, Carle and Ratton were the first to produce tetanus in animals by injecting them with pus from a fatal human tetanus case in 188438. During the same year, Nicolaier produced tetanus in animals by injecting them with samples of soil39. In 1889, Kitasato isolated the organism from a human victim, showed that it produced disease when injected into animals, and reported that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies40. In 1897, Nocard demonstrated the of passively transfe rred antitoxin; passive immuniza tion in humans was used during World War I 41. Tetanus toxoid was deve loped by Descombey in 192442, and the effectiveness of active immunization wa s demonstrated in World War II. Clostridium tetani and tetanus C. tetani is a gram-positive, anaerobic rod that ma y develop a terminal spore, giving it a drumstick appearance. The organism is sensi tive to heat and cannot survive in the presence of oxygen. The spores, in contrast, are very resistant to heat, routine antiseptics, autoclaving and many chemical agents. They are widely distributed in soil and in the intestine and faeces of horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens. Manure-treated soil may cont ain large numbers of spores . In agricultural areas, a significant number of human adults may harbor the organism. The spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contaminated heroin 41. C. tetani usually enters the body through a wound a nd in the presence of anaerobic conditions the spores germinate. Toxins , including tetanospasmin, are produced and disseminated via blood and lymphatics. They act by interferi ng with release of neurotransmitters at sites within the nervous system including peripheral motor end plates, 25 spinal cord, brain, and the sympathetic ner vous system. Seizures may occur, and the autonomic nervous system may also be affected41. Complications of generalised tetanus include laryngospasm and/or respiratory muscle spasm and hyperactivity of the autonomic ner vous system. In recent years, tetanus has been fatal in 11% of reported cases41. Epidemiology Occurrence is worldwide and orga nisms are found primarily in the soil and intestinal tracts of animals and humans. Transmission is primarily by contam inated wounds. It is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is infectious, but not contagious. Tetanus toxoid was introduced into routine childhood immunization in the US in the late 1940s and after this tetanus incidence rates fell steadily41. In contrast, tetanus remains prevalent in developing countries, where ne onatal tetanus is one of the most common causes of neonatal death43. Tetanus toxoid Details of the toxoid and its administration are described above. Following a properly administered primary series, essentially all recipients achieve anti toxin levels above a minimum protective level of 0.01 IU/ml41. Antibody levels subsequently wane and, therefore, boosters are reco mmended at Some pneumococci are encapsu lated, their surfaces composed of complex polysaccharides, These polysaccharides are pr imarily responsible for pathogenicity 45-47. More than ninety serotypes, differing in capsular composition, have been identified 48. Most serotypes can cause disease, but only a few are responsible for the majority of pneumococcal infections. S. pneumoniae is a common nasopharyngeal commensal, however, the precise relationshi ps between carriage, infect ion and the development of natural immunity are undetermined. Colonization of the upper respiratory tract begins 26 shortly after birth. At the age of one year, approximately 50% of children have been colonized at least once. From age 3-5 years, the carriage rates progressively decline to adults rates of 20-30%.9, 45-49 When mucociliary clearance is impaired, colonization is followed by rapid replication and clinical infection. Th e bacterium then activates inflammatory mediators, which further impair s clearance, leading to local and systemic symptoms.47 If the bacterium ascends via the Eustachian tube, it may cause acute otitis media (AOM). Pneumococcal disease in children The burden of pneumococcal disease among children <5 years of age is significant. In the United States, an estimated 17,000 cases of invasive disease occu r annually, of which 13,000 are bacteraemias without a known site of infection and about 700 are meningitis. An estimated 200 children die every year as a result of invasive pneumococcal disease, with the highest rates occurring in children <2 years of age. Additi onally, an estimated 5 million cases of acute otitis media occur each year among children <5 years of age50. Children of certain ethnic groups in the United States, particularly Alaskan Native, certain American Indian groups, and African Ameri can, have increased rates of pneumococcal disease50. The cause for this is unknown but may be partly related to genetic predisposition. Pneumococcus is reported in up to half of the cases of acute otitis media (AOM) in childen.51 In many countries, otitis media is the most common indication for the prescription of antibiotics.52, 53 In the mid 1990s, an estimated 14 million otitis episodes per annum occurred in the USA, with total medical costs of around $US 3-5 billion for children under the age of 5 54. Limited and/ or controversial effects of medical 55, 56 and surgical 54, 57-64 treatments of middle ear disease have stimulated efforts to develop preventive measures including vaccination. Protective antibodies against encapsulated bacteria are directed against capsule polysaccharides and are serotype specific. Polysaccharides are able to induce antibody responses in the absence of T-cells and are re ferred to as T-cell i ndependent or avidity maturation after repeated antigenic stimulus. 65 Furthermore, the immune responses to these antigens 27 develops later in ontogeny, around 18-24 months of age, compared to TD antigens.66 In in- vitro studies, effective phagocytosis of pneumococci by polymorphonuclear cells and IgG 2 antibody titres may be lower in children with frequent, recurrent, AOM compared to healthy controls 71-73. Efforts to develop effective pneumococcal vaccines began as early as 1911, with the first marketed in 1946. However, with the advent of penicillin in the 1940s interest in the vaccine declined, until many patients were observe d to die despite antibiotic treatment. By the late 1960s, efforts were again being made to develop a polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine 50. Several vaccines based on the capsul ar polysaccharides have since been developed. Clinical efficacy of 8- and 14-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in children were evaluated in the early 1980s, and were moderately and marginally efficacious in children older and younger than 2 years of age, respectively 11, 74-80. Subsequently, increasing valency and conjugation to car rier proteins proved efficacy. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vacci ne (PPV23) that is currently available contains 25 g of capsular polysaccharides of each of the pneumococcal serotypes 1, 2, 5, 33F, which were chosen on th e basis of their prevalence in invasive pneumococcal infections. 81-86 All immunoglobulin clas ses are included in the response to PPV23, although, among IgG subclasses, IgG 2 predominates87. In children below 2 years age, polysaccharide vaccines' immunogenicity is limited, as polysaccharide antigens are and to overcome this pneumococcal capsular antigens are conjugated to a and 23F 197 (PCV7, Prevnar \u00ae, Wyeth Lederle Vaccines), is in use and 11-valent are under investig ation. The serotypes included in PCV7 are responsible for 69-79% of reported invasive pneumococcal dis ease cases in children aged <5 years in England and Wales, and the 9-valent and 11-valent vaccines cover 77-87% and 82-91%, respectively. 88, 89 PCV is immunogenic in infants, induces antibodies in serum and mucosal 28 secretions, produces immunologic memory and has the potential to progressively increase avidity and opsonophagocytic capacity of an tibodies upon repeated immunisations.90 Furthermore, PCV7 induces good antibody resp onses in children with recurrent AOM.91, 92 However, despite induction of IgG antibodies and >95% efficacy of these conjugate vaccines against vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease, 93, 94 efficacy in preventing mucosal colonization an d infection with conjugate vacci ne serotypes is at best 50% 95-101 and there has been an accompanying in crease of non-conjuga te serotypes in nasopharyngeal carriage, middle ear dis ease and invasive pneumococcal disease.96, 99, 102-105 While IgG antibody concentrations are used to assess immune responses to PCV or PPV, no definitive minimum protective levels have been determined for the individual serotypes. Functional assessments of pneum ococcal vaccines, such as assays of opsonophagocytosis, provide alternate methods of assessing prot ection, however they may be labour-intensive and difficult to perform on large numbers of samples 106. To improve the sensitivity of quantitative assessments of pneumococcal IgG response, blocking of non-specific antibodies, initially by preabsorption with purified capsular polysaccharides and subsequently by additional preabsorption w ith pneumococcal type 22F polysaccharide (PS), Immunosorbent (ELISA). Preabsorpti improved correlations with opsonophagocytic assays, 106 this has allowed more functionally relevant quantitation of response and with the development of microsphere tec hnology high-throughput simultaneous analysis of multiple serotypes has become possible 107. This technology may improve future studies of vaccine response. Currently in Western Australia, PCV7 is reco mmended for all children at 2, 4 and 6 months and PPV23 is recommended for indigenous Australians at 18 months of age 36. 29 The immune system and vaccine responses The vertebrate immune system has evolved to detect and remove foreign pathogenic microorganisms via its two components: innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immune system While mechanical epithelial barriers and digestive enzymes form the preliminary defence against pathogens, upon penetration of these ba rriers, the innate im mune system provides the main resistance to pathogens in the first minutes to days of an infection 108 with systems capable of distinguishing pathogens from se lf-structures. This occurs via pattern- recognition receptors (PRRs) that bind to phyl ogenetically molecular patterns (PAMPs) 108. The PRRs are ubiquitously expressed on cells of the innate immune system, including polymorphonuclear phagocytes (PMN), monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer ce lls and, to some extent, epithelial or endothelial cells 109. They can initiate a variety of host defence pathways including complement activation, apoptosis, opsonisati on, phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory gene expression 108, 109. CD-14, an important component of innate immunity, will be discussed in detail. CD14 CD14 is essential to the recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of gram- negative bacterial cell walls (also called endotox in). Although initially characterized as the LPS receptor 110, CD14 is also involved in responses to lipoteichoic acid of gram-positive bacteria 111, peptidoglycan of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria 112, mycobacteria 113 viruses, iratory syncytial virus (RSV) 114. CD14 is constitutively expressed as a membrane fo rm (mCD14) on the surface of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, as well as an inducible soluble serum form (sCD14) 115. Common exposures to bacterial infections in early life may influence immune ontogeny as Th1 maturation is initiated by microbial stimulation 116. CD-14 is a key component of the interface of the developing imm une system with microbial exposure. Therefore, genetic variation in CD-14 may modulat e the immune priming effect of microbial exposure and the development of vaccine responses. Of not e in the context of pneumococcal vaccine response, CD14 involvement has been describe d in macrophage responses against purified 30 capsular polysaccharide of S. pneumoniae 117. The CD14 gene, on chromosome 5q31.1 118, contains one exon that encodes 356 amino acids, and no introns 119. mCD14 is a 50-55 kDa glycoprotei n attached to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) tail, al lowing it to be proximal to the membrane while lacking a transmembrane domain 120. sCD14 lacks the membrane anchor and is consequently smaller at 49 kDa 121. Examination of the crystal structure of the CD14 receptor reveals a large hydrophobic pocket near the amino terminus of a horseshoe-shaped structure 122, amino acid residues criti cal for the binding of LPS 123 are clustered within this pocket, suggesting it is the site of LPS binding 122 , with the structure also providing a basis for its ligand diversity 122. CD14 lacks a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain and so has no inherent signalling capabilities. Signalling o ccurs through a hete romeric receptor complex of MD-2 124 and TLR4, to which CD14 presents LPS (Figure 1). Subsequent to LPS binding, adaptor molecules, including MyD88 125, MyD88 adaptor-like (Mal) 126, TRIF or TICAM-1127, and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) 128 are recruited via their interaction with the TIR domain of TLR4 129. In turn, phosphorylation of inte rleukin receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) results in the of the transcription factors NF- B, ATF-2-c-Jun and IRF- 3, resulting in DC maturation, and the induc tion of genes regulate d by IFN including IFN- CD14 resulting in a MyD88-dependent signalling pa thway that culminates in the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- , IL-2, IL-6 and IL-12, via NF- B 132. 31 Downstream Signalling Figure 1. The CD-14 receptor complex involved in LPS recognition (adapted from Aderem and Ulevitch, 2000133). Many CD14 gene polymorphisms have been identified, with a promoter polymorphism; C- 159T 134, the most studied. TT homoz ygotes have been demonstrated to have an increase in sCD14 levels, and a decrease in total seru m IgE, suggesting a role for CD14 in the regulation of IgE production and diseases medi ated by IgE, including allergy and asthma 134. Subsequently, this SNP was associated with both protection 135-138 and predisposition 139-143 to allergy and asthma. These apparently conflicting results have been suggested as evidence for gene-environment interaction, sp ecifically that genes and environment are complexed in non-linear relationships, such that the phenotypic expression of a given genotype differs by environmental exposure(s) 144. Accordingly, the a ssociation of this polymorphism with IgE has been shown to differ by degree of exposure to animals144. Furthermore, its relationship with asthma varies according to age 145 suggesting that these relationships also need be assessed within a developmental context. Functional importance of the C-159T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been demonstrated. Sp transcription factors can ac tivate genes with GC boxe s in their promoters 146, and Sp3 has been shown to be a repressor for many promoters 147, 148. The C-159T SNP resides in an Sp-binding GC box. The T alle le reduces the homology between the GC box 32 and the Sp consensus sequence, and decreas es the affinity of Sp3 for the GC box 149. Additionally, reporter vectors have been used to demonstrate that this allele had greater transcriptional activity in monocytes compared with the C allele 149. sCD14 has similar effector capacities to mCD14 and thereby overcomes a functional deficiency of cells that do not constitutiv ely express mCD14 (e.g. endothelial cells, epithelial cells, astrocytes) 150. sCD14 levels have been a ssociated with increased IFN- and decreased IL-4 in mit ogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 134. sCD14 effects are concentra tion dependent, and, depending on the level of sCD14, it can divert LPS from mCD14 and transfer it to plasma lipoproteins, t hus inhibiting immune responses against LPS 151. Accordingly, elevated sCD14 le vels have been reported in disease states including gram-negative shock 121, polytrauma and severe burns 152, multiple organ failure 153 and HIV-1 154. Regulation of CD14 levels is crucial to appropriate immune responses. Adaptive immunity In contrast to the innate immune system , the adaptive immune system evolved more recently and is found only in vertebrates. It recognises pathogenic antigens via receptors that are located on the surface of T and B cells, generated through somatic gene rearrangements. Receptor-antigen interac tion results in of lymphocytes, production of antigen-specific an tibodies and the generation of immunologic memory. Clonal expansion and differentiation in to effector cells is a prerequisite for adaptive responses hence the dela y, typically 4 to 7 days post infection, compared to innate responses. 155 Signals providing information a bout the origin of the antige n and the appropr iate response are required to activate adaptive immunity. These are provided by the co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines, including interleukins (IL) and interferons (IFN) 156. T cells require two signals to become activated: the presentation of an antigen complexed to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) clas s II molecule, and the expression of CD80 and CD86 molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells. The latter is mediated by the innate immune system via transmembrane si gnalling proteins call ed Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their induction of the tr anscription factor nuclear factor- B (NF-B) 157. 33 Adaptive immunity has humoral and cell-med iated arms. The humoral response is modulated by B-lymphocytes. Immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors on these cells interact with antigen epitopes to induce forma tion of plasma cells that secr ete different antibody isotypes (IgM, IgG, IgA and IgE) that circulate systemi cally to act at distant sites. Cell-mediated responses are mediated by T (thymus-derived) lymphocytes and by cytokines that act over very short distances. Many cells secrete and respond to cytokines, however, T cells are the major cytokine responder and effector cells. There are two main classes of T cells defined by their expression of CD4 or CD8 antigens. CD4 positive T cells and CD8 positive T cells are referred to as class II and clas s I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted cells, respectively, as they recogni ze antigenic peptides complexed with either MHC class II or MHC class I molecules at th e surface of antigen presenting cells. A major role of CD4 positive T-cells is to provide help for B cells to generate antibodies and they are therefore referred to as T- helper cells (Th). Conceptuall y, there are two subsets of Th cells (Th1 and Th2 cells) that are distinguis hed by their secretory cytokine profile and effector functions, however, functionally th ese subsets overlap. Characteristic Th1 cytokines include IL-2, initiate switc hing of IgM to IgG, IgA or IgE production. A major role of CD8 positive T cells is to recognise and lyse inf ected target cell s; hence they are referred to as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Cytokines are crucial to the di rection of immune responses, wi th for instance IL-4 initiating switching from a Th-1 to a Th-2 response and IL-12 inducing strong Th-1 responses (reviewed in 14). Four molecules that are of particular importance to Th-2 responses, IL-4, IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), IL-13 and IL-10 will be discussed in detail. The IL-4 to IL-13 axis IL-4 is on chromosome 5q31.1, has 4 exons, is approximately 10 kb in size 158 and is 12 kilobases downstream of IL13. It is a pleiotro pic cytokine, with effects including the commitment of na\u00efve T cells to the Th2 cytokine phenotype 159 and promotion of isotype switching of B cells towards IgE synthesis 160. 34 The IL-4R gene is on chromosome 16p12.1-p11.2 and encodes the 825 amino acid alpha chain of the interleukin-4 recep tor. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms, a membrane-bound and a soluble form, have been described. IL-4 binds to IL-4R and confers signal to effector cells, as described below. The IL-13 gene is clustered with IL 3, IL5, IL4, and CSF2 on chromosome 5q 161 and encodes for 132 amino acids. IL-4 and IL-13 are produced by Th2 cells, in response to antigen receptor engagement, and by mast cells upon cross-linkage of the high-affinity receptor for IgE 162, 163. These cytokines can elicit similar re sponses, many of which are as sociated with asthma and allergy. However, in general IL-4 is more active in regula ting Th2 development, whereas IL-13 is more active in regulating airway hypersensitivity and mucus hypersecretion and Th2 inflammation of the bowel 164, 165. IL-4R is a transmembrane recep tor composed of 2 subunits: th e 140-kD high-affinity alpha chain, shared with the IL-13 receptor; and the common gamma chain, which is shared by several interleukin receptors 116 and modifies chain signalling 166. IL-4 interacts with IL- 4R with high affinity leading to dimerisation with either the common chain (IL-2R ), a component of receptors for a numb er of cytokines, to create a type I receptor, or with IL- 13R1 to form a type II receptor. IL-13 binds with high affinity to IL-13R 1 which induces heterodimerisation with IL-4R to form a complex identical to the type II receptor. Alternatively, IL-13 may bind with even greater affinity to IL13R 2, which fails to induce a signal and acts as a decoy receptor (figure 2). The C-terminal tails of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor subunits interact with tyrosine ki nases of the Janus kinase family (e.g., JAK1) leading to interaction with STAT6, which binds to consensus sequences in the promoters of IL4- and IL13-regulated genes. The subtle differences in IL-4 and IL-13 signalling due to polymorphisms near docking sites in IL4R may have profound implications for allergy and asthma 167; similarly they may also have significan t ramifications for vaccine responses. 35 Figure 2 . Schematic illustration of the interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes. Modified from Chatila, T.A.2004. The effects of cytokines, including IL-4, are dependent on the cytokine milieu and epigenetic modifications, in cluding histone acetylation 168. The degree of histone acetylation at particular loci is proportional to transcriptional activity. Histones in the cytokine loci (IFN- ; IL-4) of naive T cells are unacetylated, but upon TCR stimulation they are rapidly and progressively acetylated 168. The acetylation at the IL-4 locus occurs early, regardless of Th1/Th2 pol arizing conditions, correlatin g with early transcription 168. The maintenance of acetylation depends on ST AT4 and STAT6 signaling and also on the transactivator activity of TBET and GATA-3. Additionally, epigenetic modifications are important in lineage flexibility and commitment. When CD4-positive T cells are primed to become either Th1 cells preferentially expres sing subset of cytokines (parti cularly IL-4), these T cells acquire polarized cytokine gene acetylation patterns 169. Whereas histone hyperacetylation of IFN- and IL-4 promoters in Th1 and Th2 cells , respectively, was stable, central memory T cells had hypoacetylated cytokine genes th at became hyperacetylated upon polarization after appropriate stimulation. However, all Th1 and most Th2 cells expressed the 36 alternative cytokine when stimulat ed under opposite Th priming conditions169 suggesting that most human CD4-positive T cells retain bo th memory and flexibility of cytokine gene expression169. Cytokine genes influence the expression of other cytokine genes on the same and separate chromosomes. In mice, the Th1 and Th2 pathways, defined by cytokines IFN- and IL-4, respectively, comprise 2 alternative CD 4 positive T-cell outcomes, with functional consequences for the host immune system. These cytokine genes are on different chromosomes. The Th2 locus control region (LCR) regulates the Th2 cytokine genes complexing with promoters of IL-4, IL-5, a nd IL-13, and although these genes are spread over 120 kb they are closely juxtaposed in the nucleus in a poised ch romatin conformation. In addition to these intrachromosomal effects, interchromosomal interactions between the promoter region of the IFN-gamma gene on ch romosome 10 and the regulatory regions of the Th2 cytokine locus on chro mosome 11 have been described 170. These loci were physically associated within the nucleus and structures sensitive to methylation, a key epigenetic process, within the Th2 LCR regulated these interactions. 170 Therefore, genetic variation in IL-4 and IL-13 ma y have pivotal influences in coordinated intrachromosomal and interchromosomal regulation of cytokine gene expression. Polymorphisms in genes of the IL-4/ IL-13 axis. Polymorphisms in genes of the IL-4/IL-13 axis have been associated with asthma and allergy in several studies. Polymorphisms in IL-4 have been associated with increased serum total IgE levels 171, 172 and asthma 173, 174. Polymorphisms in IL-13 have also been associated with risk for allergic asthma 175, increased serum IgE levels 176-178 and asthma 177. Additionally, polymorphisms in IL-4R have been associated with asthma and related atopic phenotypes179-184, either individually or in combin ation. A number of SNPs have been identified within these genes and those inve stigated in this thesis were chosen on the basis of demonstrated or likel y, by virtue of location (exonic, promoter or other regulatory region), ability to influence gene expression. There have been numerous associations be tween polymorphisms in these genes and non- allergic disease states 185suggesting broad implications of the differences in expression resulting from these genetic variations. 37 Interleukin-10 IL-10 was initially characterized as cytoki ne synthesis inhibito ry factor (CSIF) 186. It initiates a wide variety of activities upon bi nding to its cellular receptor complex, however, its principle function may be to limit the magnit ude of an immune response. Its effects are mediated by multifarious mechanisms and cell types. The mechanism of IL-10 inhibition of cytokine production was initia lly believed to be an inhibition of the antigen-presentation capacity of macrophages 187and dendritic cells 188-191. However, further investigations revealed that IL-10 also plays important ro les in directly blocki ng cytokine production 188; including CD80, CD86, and MHC Class II 192, 193; and modulating chemokine secretion 194, 195. It also modifies chemokine receptor expression 196, 197, increases 2-integrin ligand (e.g., ICAM-1) expression 193, and increases free radical generation 198. In concert, these effects limit the magnitude of activation and concurrent cyto kine release by T cells during the antigen specific immune response. IL-10 partially inhibits the inducti on of activities initiate d by other cytokines, notably IFN- , IL-2, TNF- , and IL-4. IL-10 has also been shown to promote the development of B1 cells 199, to enhance the surv ival of B cells, T cells, and tumour cells 200, 201, and, paradoxically, to induce apoptosi s in chronic B cell leukaemia cells 202. Additionally, IL-10 promotes the activity of NK cells 203. In the context of infection and atopy, it is notable that mice with an IL-10 gene deletion have in creased Th1 responses 204and enhanced clearance of bacteria 205, 206 and other microbes 207, 208. These mice also show exaggerated asthmatic 209and allergic responses 210, 211. IL-10 also promotes the differentiation of dendritic cells that lead to the differentiation of Type 1 regulatory cells (Tr1) both in vitro and in vivo 212and the effects of IL-10 on Tr1 cells may be central to the immunosuppressive effect of IL-10. Twin studies have suggested that 74% of variability in IL-10 production is inherited 213. Three promoter polymorphisms -1082A/G, - 819 C/T and -592 C/A, in tight linkage disequilibrium, lie in a putative transcription factor-binding site 214suggesting their importance to IL-10 regulation. The -592A allele has been associated with diminished IL- 10 production215; an increased risk if alcoholic liver disease216; increased risk of HIV and an increased rate of prog ression to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)217. 38 Three major promoter haplotypes (GCC, ACC an d ATA) have been described in different populations 218, 219. The GCC haplotype has been asso ciated with high IL-10 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cel l culture, whereas the ATA haplotype showed lower transcriptional activity than GCC haplotype 220. Various studies from different populations have shown the association of IL10 polymor phisms either at the genotypic or the haplotypic levels with various asthma-associated phenotypes 218, 219, 221and polymorphisms in IL-10 have been associated with altered hepatitis A vaccine responses222. 39 Vaccine response Vaccine failure may be primary, characterise d by a failure to produ ce antibodies after an encounter with antigen, or secondary, which occurs despite the production of antibodies. Studies on measles have revealed insights into as pects of vaccine failure. The majority of vaccine failure is considered to be primary 2 and antibody response among MMR- vaccinated children is variable, with 2-10 % being seronegative after the first dose 223 and almost 2 % of the seronegative childre n not converting after a second dose 224. Furthermore, children not responding to the first dose, but producing an antibody response after the second dose, were still six times more likely than first dose responders to develop measles upon exposure 225. Measles outbreaks have occurr ed among previously vaccinated individuals, with some outbreaks affecting 20-75 % of vaccinated subjects 226. Understanding the factors associated with th ese failures may be central to reducing the burden of vaccine preventable diseases. Genetic risk for atopy and vaccine response The relationship between infant vaccination and the risk for development of atopic disease is an ongoing area of investigation that has yielded controversial a nd complex results. Infant vaccination per se might influence s ubsequent development of atopic disease or atopy and vaccine responses might be infl uenced by similar genetically perturbed pathways5. Resistance to atopic and inflam matory disease in early childhood may be attributable to mechanisms associated with th e functional transition of the imm une system from a state of relative intrauterine quiescence to a more vigor ous state required to combat the postnatal environment 5. The capacity of the foetal Th1 re sponse is preferentially dampened to prevent placental damage 227. This occurs via Th1 inhibitory mediators from the placenta 116 in concert with specific controls, including hypermethylation, of cytokine genes in fetal CD4 positive T cells (white and watt 2002). Postnatal microbial exposure, including intestinal flora 228, progressively upregulates Th1 capacit y. However, the kinetics of this maturation varies between populations and may be slowest amongst children at high genetic risk of atopy 229, with possible consequences fo r immune mediated phenomena in infancy and early childhood. These include: in creased risk for allergic symptoms in 40 infancy 230, attenuated, and Th2 polarised, memory responses to DTPa vaccine 229, 231, reduced antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccine 232 and a reduced abil ity to generate Th-1 memory to BCG vaccine 185. Identifying the genes contributing to this proc ess, and their interaction with environmental factors, is central to understanding the basis of these obs ervations. Hence in this thesis, variants in genes associated w ith atopy have been investigated for their relationships with vaccine responses in childhood. 41 Vaccine genetics An understanding of host genetic factors influenc ing vaccine responses is important as it may result in new approaches to improve vaccine efficacy. A twin study on childhood vaccine responses found between 44 % and 78 % of the variati on in responses was genetic in origin 233. Studies of genetic influences on vaccine response have focussed on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and have predominantly involved adu lt populations. Associations between HLA class I and II alleles and anti body responses to many vaccines have been shown in adults, including over-represent ation of the HLA-D RB1*0701 allele in non- responders to the influenza vaccine 234 and association of HLA- DR3 and DR7 alleles with non-responsiveness to hepatitis B vaccination 235. Associations were also found between polymorphisms in both class I and II HLA ge nes and antibody responses to the measles vaccine in schoolchildren, with low measles an tibody levels associated with both the presence of HLA-DRB1*07 and the absence of HLA-DRB1*13 236 and the presence of HLA-DQA1*05 and the ab sence of HLA-DQA1*01 237. Other associations between HLA alleles and vaccine responses have been repor ted and have been reviewed by Ovsyannikova et al 2006 3. Since the immune system in early life is immature, when compared to older children and adults, different genes may be a ssociated with childhood vaccine responses. In a study of heritability of vaccine responses, Newport et al 233 demonstrated the importance of genes outside the HLA system in childhood vaccine responses. Differences in allele frequencies of SNPs in non-HLA immu ne response genes may be associated with variable vaccination responses between these populations. Nota bly, the allele frequency of SNPs in IL-4 238, and other Th2 genes 239 vary between populations and an IL-4 haplotype has been associated with Hepatitis B vaccine responses 240. A polymorphism within this haplotype is increased in fr equency in African populations 238, which is noteworthy given the observed differences in Th2 cytokine production between Africans and Europeans and their suggested importance for vaccine design 241. The effect of evolution on vaccine genetics In 1859 Darwin proposed his theory of natural sel ection i.e. that variation in traits between individuals exists within a population and competition for lim ited resources, predation and 42 disease act to select for indivi duals most suited to survive in their local environment. These individuals are then able to mate and transmit the traits that allowed them to survive 242 and the species evolves. Human examples of natural sele ction are malaria and thalassaemia. The thalassaemias are a group of inherited haemoglobinopathies caused by the abnormal production of globin chain precursors. Heterozygotes are normally asymptomatic (thalassaemia minor) and lead normal lives, whereas homozygote affecteds manifest severe life-threatening anaemia (thalassaemia major) and, if left untreated, ha ve significantly diminished life expectancy 243. The cost of thalassaemia major to an individual's health means that the allele responsible would normally be selected against and eliminated from the gene pool. However, the incidence of thalassaemia re mains high within populations historically exposed to malaria 244-248. The geographical correlation between the incidence of thalassaemia and malarial infections lead to the hypothesis that th alassaemia provided a survival advantage in areas of endemic malarial infection. The Haldane Malaria Hypothesis proposed that delete rious genetic polymorphisms, sp ecifically those resulting in thalassaemia, had been selected to high fre quencies in malaria-infested human populations as they provided protection against malaria 249, 250. Accordingly, the survival advantage in thalassaemia minor compensated for the negative selection associated with the thalassaemia major 251, 252. Although the mechanism of protecti on in heterozygotes is unknown, the epidemiological evidence for this protection is unequivocal 253, 254. Whilst Darwin described the theory of natura l selection, it was Mende l that provided its mechanism in 1866 when he proposed that traits were transmitted from parents to offspring in discrete units of inheritance 255. These units of inheritanc e were later named \"genes\" by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1909 256 and the field named \"genetics\" by William Bateson in 1906257, both from the greek \"genno\", meaning \"to gi ve birth\". Evolutionary theory, as we know it today, coalesced when Mendelian genetics and Darwinian selection were combined with the mathematics of population genetics. A seminal work in this synthesis was the \"Genetics and the or igins of species\" by Theodosius Dobzhansky, 258 in which Dobzhansky defined evolution as \"a change in the fre quency of an allele in a gene pool\". 43 The hypothesis has been proposed that there is a general pattern of recent evolutionary adaptation of the immune response to particul ar regions, which is reflected in allele frequency differences between populations, and that these adaptations can produce differences in disease susceptibility259. Modern man's ancestors lived in environments where infectious tropical diseases would have been endemic and the possibility has been raised that these diseases would have sele cted for proinflammatory alleles of immune response genes. Following migration to temperate regions these proinflammatory alleles would have been selected against due to overly vigorous responses to innocuous environmental agents and subsequently would have reduced in frequency259. That the proinflammatory alleles in se veral immune response genes are increased in frequency in populations with long-term origins in the tr opics compared to those with long-term residence in temperate regi ons supports this observation260-262. By corollary, when the former populations relocate to the temperate regions they have a higher incidence of allergic inflammatory diseas es than the latter populations 259. The above hypothesis may be extrapolated to non-allergic diseases. Variations between ethnic groups in the incidence of non-allergic diseases with an inflammatory component have been demonstrated. These include: cancer 263, 264, hypertension (REF), stroke 265, diabetes 266 and renal failure 266. A specific example of differences in allele frequencies between ethnic groups in non-allergic diseas e with an inflammatory component is the angiotensin gene 235 threonine allele, which has b een reported to be more common in hypertensive cases than in non-hypertensive controls267 and was more common in Japanese268, African-Americans 269 and Nigerians 270 compared with European-Americans 271. However, ethnicity encompasses more than ju st shared genetic heritage. It may also be a proxy for common lifestyle, diet and, in some instances, access to health care and socio-economic status. Thus, ethnicity can be expected to correlate with different prevalences of disease 264. However, ethnicity correlates with genetic background, supporting a role for genetics in the observed differences in disease incidence between ethnic groups 272 and therefore, some inferences can be made from allele frequency data 273. Ethnic differences in responses to Hepatitis B 274, measles275, 276 and Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine277 have been reported. Whilst some of these differences may be attributed to environmental fact ors, support for genetic factors remains in studies that have 44 assessed environmental factors directly274 or that have assessed different ethnic groups within the same geographic region277. Differences in allele frequencies between ethnic groups may contribute to the observed varia tion of vaccination response between these groups. Therefore, it may be important to assess for these differences in future vaccine trials, and ultimately understanding these differe nces may be important to future vaccine design. Given that differences in the allele frequency of genes between ethnic groups may reflect biological selection; these differences may provide a basis for selection of candidate genes for immunological phenotypes. In this context, it is notewort hy that the frequencies of a number of alleles of genes examined in this th esis, primarily selected on their basis of their association with allergy, va ry by ethnic group and are increased in populations with long- term origins in the tropics 141, 278. Genetic interactions and vaccine responses Gene-environment interactions and epistasis The influence of a gene on phenotype is modi fied by epistatic genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors have been re ported to influence vaccine responses. For example, smoking has been associated with both impaired 279, 280, and elevated, responses to vaccination 281. As exposures in early life are likely to interact with a child's genotype to modulate responses to environmental factors 282, the probability of det ecting genetic effects on vaccine responses is increased when analyses are stratified by specific environmental factors 283. An interaction between animal expos ure and CD-14 on an atopic outcome has been described above. Evidence for gene-envi ronment interactions involving the IL-4RA include the daycare-gene (IL-4R ) interaction effect on IFN- responses in the first year of life 282, the association of the IL4R Q576R polymorphism with atopic eczema in children not given antibiotics 284 and an increased rate of declin e in lung function in those with specific IL-4R genotypes 285. Gene-environment interactions have also been shown for the IL-13 gene, including with parental smoking and serum IgE 286 and with active smoking and the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 287. Additionally, IL-13 gene- environment interaction may contribute to th e difference in serum IL-13 levels between monozygotic twins discordant for smoking. Unde rstanding these intera ctions may clarify 45 the apparently conflicting result s of both genetic and environm ental association studies of vaccine responses. The effect of interactions between genes th at function sequentially within a known pathway have been demonstrated for atopic outcomes , specifically genes of the IL-4-IL-13 axis 285. As discussed above, interactions between T h1 and Th2 genes may also be important. Murine studies demonstrated physical interchr omosomal interactions between Th1 and Th2 loci that were associated with changes in ge ne transcription. Nota bly, these interactions were strongest in na\u00efve CD4+ T-cells and, if these effects are reproduc ible in humans, they may be greatest in infancy and early chil dhood. Epigenetic modifications have been proposed to mediate these interactions 170 as well as gene-environment interactions288. While these gene-gene interactions are biologically plausible, low numbers in combinatorial analyses hampers their stat istical investigation. However, improved statistical techniques, includi ng multifactor dimensionality reduction, are addressing this limitation 289. Age-dependent genetic effects Genetic effects are age dependent. Age depe ndent effects of the CD-14 C-159T on atopic outcomes have been reported 145 and subsets of genes important to vaccine responses have also been suggested to vary over development 233. There is a paucity of reported vaccine research addressing developmental genetic effects. Gene-gender interaction The influence of gender on the pathogen esis and expression of many diseases290, 291, including atopic diseases 292 has been explored. The mechanisms underlying these differences are debated, however, differential gene expression could underlie some of them293. Sexually dimorphic gene tran scription is shared by many phyla 293 and is necessary to achieve different phenotypes from the same genome and gender influences human gene expression at X-chromosome and autosomal loci294-297. In animal studies, gender is a major determinant of immune response to infection; notably, disease severity in this study was proportional to local expression of IL-4 and IL-10298. Gender and genotype 46 interact. Gender-dependent ge netic effects of polymorphisms in immune response genes, including IL-10299,300, on atopic301-304 and non-atopic phenotypes;299, 300 and pre-pubertal gender-dependent effects of HLA alleles on an tibody responses to diphtheria and measles vaccine response305 have been found. However, gende r-dependent genetic effects of cytokine gene polymorphisms have not been reported previously. 47 Conclusion A number of factors support the importance of genetic variance as a component of the total variance of vaccine response. Understanding these genetic factors will ultimately yield improved vaccine efficacy. Since a number of genes from several pathways are likely to be important, a targeted approach is necessary. This thesis explored genes associated with atopy, as atopy, or its genetic risk, has been associated with m odulation of vaccine responses. Additionally, it explored these gene tic effects in a developmental context as well as the interactions between ge nes and environmental factors. 48 References 1. Organization WH.

The interleukin (IL)-4 pathway, including IL-4, IL-13 and the IL-4 receptor chain (IL-4R ), is central to humoral responses and therefore could have an impact on vaccine responsiveness. Objective: To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-4, IL-13 and IL-4 R genes influence pneumococcal serotype specific IgG antibody responses. Methods: SNPs in the (C 589T, G2979T), the IL-13 gene (G 1112A, Arg130Gln) and in the IL-4 R gene (Ile50Val, Gln551Arg) were investigated in isolation and in combination, for their influence on serotype specific IgG antibody responses upon combined pneumococcal conjugate and polysaccharide vaccinations in children with a history of recurrent otitis media. Results: Lower antibody responses were observe d for alleles previously associated with atopy, IL-4 589T, IL-4 2979T and IL-4 R 551Gln. Effects were stronger in gene haplotype combinations or in multiple haplotype combination analyses. Conclusion: This study highlights the importa nce of host genetic factors in vaccine responses. Furthermore, it supports the appro ach of studying the effect of combinations of multiple alleles, in haplotypes or in combinations of haplotypes, on complex phenotypes within a biological pathway. 61 Introduction Streptococcus pneumoniae may cause severe invasive in fections including sepsis, and meningitis or lower respiratory tract infec tions, like pneumonia. It is also the most commonly reported bacterial cause of upper resp iratory tract infecti ons such as otitis media1, 2. Host defense against S. pneumoniae depends largely on opsonization by antibodies and complement3, followed by phagocytosis a nd intracellular killing by leukocytes and macrophages4, 5. Prevention by vaccination is the favoured strategy against pneumococcal infection because of the persisting mortality and morbidity associated with pneumococcal diseases despite antibiotic treatment, and the rapid emergence of multi-drug resistant S. pneumoniae 6. Current pneumococcal vaccines contain capsular polysaccharides from the most prevalent pneumococci aim to protective anti-capsular serotype -specific opsonizing antibodies. The optimal design of vaccines requires unders tanding of the factors controlling disease and immune pathways. Significant differen ces in immune responses upon vaccination between individuals and different ethnic gr oups have been described, suggesting genetic influences are important in determining the magnitude of vaccine responses 7, 8. The relative contributions of gene tic and environmental factors to vaccine responses are yet to be determined, but associations be tween specific genes and vaccine antibody responses have been described7, 9. To date, research on gene tic influences on vaccine responses has mainly focused on hum an leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles10, 11 and the immunoglobulin allotype genes12, 13. Clearly, many additional genes may be involved and therefore a systematic approach is needed to prioritise which genes to examine. We investigated genetic variation in interle ukin 4 (IL-4), IL-13 and the IL-4 receptor chain (IL-4 R ), as they are components of the pathway regulating antibody responses by B cells. IL-4 and IL-13 are pleiotropic cy tokines produced by mast-cells, basophils, and T cells14. They are T helper 2 cytokines that trigger isotype switching from IgM to IgE in B cells15. Furthermore, they enhance the expr ession of surface molecules, such as the IL-4R chain, the low affinity receptor for IgE (Fc RII, CD23) and MHC class II, and down-regulate the IgG type I receptor (Fc RI). Moreover, IL-4 is necessary for the promotion of its own production 16. IL-13 shares several biol ogical functions with IL- 414, 17, but also has unique roles in mediating immune responses18, 19. The receptors for IL-4 and IL-13 share a common chain: IL-4 R . IL-4 R dimerizes with the common chain in the IL-4 receptor, which is expressed on T and B cells, and with the IL-13 R 62 1 chain in the IL-13 receptor, which is expressed on B cells only14, 20. Polymorphisms in genes coding for these cytokines and th eir shared receptor, including atopy and asthma phenotypes. Furthermore, atopy has been associated with altered kinetics of the maturation of vaccine responses27 and atopic eczema has been associated with delayed maturation of the antibody response to pneumococcal vaccine28. Therefore, this study investigated the hypothesis that single nucleotide polymor phisms (SNPs) in IL-4, IL-4 R and IL-13, genes previously associated with atopy, in isolati on and in combination, would be associated with impaired antibody responses upon combined pneumococcal conjugate and polysaccharide vaccinations. 63 Methods Patients and vaccinations Serum and DNA were available from 121 random ly selected children with recurrent otitis media participating in one of two randomised controlled pneumococcal vaccination trials investigating prevention of recurrence of ot itis media in the Netherlands29, 30. Both studies were approved by the ethical committees of participating hospitals and institutions. Written informed parental consent was obtained from all subjects. Pneumococcal polysaccharide specific IgG antib ody responses against the 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F were ascertained. The first trial group consisted of 89 children ag ed 1 to 7 years who had a history of 2 or more physician diagnosed episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) in the previous 12 months. These children received the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar \u00ae, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphi a, PA, PCV7). Children below 24 months of age received a second dose of PCV7 4 weeks later. After pneumococcal conjugate vaccination all children received a 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination 6 mo nths later (Pneumune \u00ae, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA, PPV23). The second trial group consisted of 32 children aged 2 to 7 years with a history of at least two prolonged periods of bilateral otitis media with effusion (OME), each lasting 3 months or longer and documented by an ENT sp ecialist. These children were vaccinated with PCV7 once followed by a PPV23 boos ter vaccination 4 months later. Since we have previously shown that bot h groups of children display similar antibody responses after vaccinati on, these groups were pooled for data analysis 31. PCV7 consists of 2 g each of capsular polysaccharides of pneumococcal serotypes 4, 9V, 4 g 6B serotype 18C oligosaccharide, each conjugated individua lly to mutant non-toxic diphtheria toxin (CRM 197). PPV23 consists of 25 g of capsular polysaccharides of each of the pneumococcal serotypes 1, 2, Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood, co llected at study entry, using a QIAamp DNA Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Patient s were genotyped for SNPs in IL-4 (C 589T, G2979T), IL-4 R (Gln551Arg) and IL-13 (G 1112A) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme digestion.

Serum was isolated and stored at 20\u00baC until analysis. Post vaccination IgG an tibody levels to all PCV7 serotypes, 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F, were measured by ELISA as described previously35. Minimal detection levels for these pneumococcal serotypes in our assay were 0.03, 0.09, pneumococcal cell wall polysaccharide buffer was used for assay standardisation37. Statistical analyses The IgG antibody levels appeared to be positivel y skewed. Consequently, their geometric means (GM) were calculated after appl ying a logarithmic transformation. A general linear model was used to compare the geometric means between the genotype s and haplotypes, adjust ed for the covariates of interest, namely age, gender, type of ear disease, number of PCV vaccinations and total IgE levels. When one of the homozygous genotype fre quencies was less than 10%, this genotype was pooled with the heterozy gotes before testing. P-values less than 0.05 were considered st atistically significant . SPSS 12.0.1 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical analyses. 67 Results All genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. As expected, given their co- location on chromosome 5q31, significant linkage was observed betwee n SNPs in the IL-4 and IL- 13 genes (table 2). IL-4 G2979T IL-13 G- D' scores indicating linkage between SNPs on the same chromosome. P<0.0001, except for * p=0.004Analyses by genotype Pneumococcal specific IgG antibody responses were analysed for each of the six individual SNPs (table 3). For the IL-4 C 589T and IL-4 G2979T SNPs, antibody levels against all seven pneumococcal serotypes were lowest in those ca rrying a CT/TT and GT/TT genotype, respectively. For the IL-4 C 589T SNP these differences were significan t when using a model recessive for the C allele for antibodies against serotypes 4 and 23F (p=0.002 and p=0.05). For the G2979T SNP a trend was observed for antibodies against these same serotypes when using a model recessive for the G allele (p=0.07 and p=0.06). For the IL-4 R Gln551Arg SNP, antibodies against all seven serotypes were highest in carriers of Gln/Arg and Arg/Arg genot ypes compared to those with common Gln/Gln homozygotes. These differences were significant for antibodi es against serotypes 4, 18C and 14 (p=0.001, 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). For these three SNPs showing significant differences, a percentage difference in the pneum ococcal serotype specific IgG antibody response between the polymorphic genotypes and the co mmon genotype was calculated (figure 1). For the IL-13 G 1112A SNP, lower antibody levels were found in those with polymorphic GA/AA genotypes compared to common GG homozygotes, except for antibodies against serotype 23F. 68 Differences did not reach significance. For the IL-13 Arg130Gln and IL-4 R Ile50Val SNPs, no significant differences in an tibody levels were observed. 69 IL-4 C-589T IL-4 G2979T 35 64 22 77 36/3 80 35/5 86 30/4 4 4.4 2.8 0.002 4.5 3.2 0.07 4.1 4.2 2.7 0.1 3.2 5.8 0.001 4.3 3.1 0.09 4.1 3.5 0.5 6B 1.3 1.0 0.5 1.3 1.1 0.5 1.0 1.4 1.0 0.6 1.1 1.5 0.3 1.4 0.9 0.2 1.2 1.1 0.7 9V 27.0 17.8 0.1 26.2 21.4 0.4 19.0 27.3 25.3 0.4 22.4 30.5 0.2 26.6 19.9 0.3 25.4 21.6 0.6 14 73.5 65.8 0.7 71.1 70.1 0.9 73.1 69.0 71.0 0.9 65.4 87.8 0.3 18C 9.1 8.5 0.7 9.4 8.3 0.5 8.2 9.9 7.5 0.4 7.7 12.1 0.02 9.4 8.1 0.5 9.1 8.5 0.7 19F 10.4 10.3 0.9 10.2 10.2 0.9 11.0 9.9 11.0 0.9 9.9 12.1 0.5 10.9 9.3 0.6 10.2 10.8 0.9 23F 4.8 3.0 0.05 4.9 3.2 0.06 3.3 4.6 4.8 0.3 4.0 5.0 0.3 4.2 4.2 0.9 4.2 4.3 0.9 Table 3.

Given the results of single SNP analyses, it predicted that those haplotypes composed of two alleles associated with high antibody responses would be associated with the greatest antibody responses. Similarly it was predicted that haplotypes co mposed of two alleles a ssociated with low antibody responses, would be associated with lowest antibody responses. For the purposesstudy these were designated as \"high responder\" and \"low responder\" haplotypes respectively. In the IL-4 C 589 and IL-4 G2979 alleles, was indeed associated with the highest antibody responses against pneumococcal serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 19F and 23F compared with the T*T low responder haplotype. These differences were significant for antibodies against serotypes 4 and 23F (p=0.04 and 0.05 respectively) (table 4). F 71 predicted low responder haplotype was Val*Gln. Antibody levels against all pneumococcal serotypes indeed were highest in those with an Ile*Arg haplotype, exc for antibodies against serotype 23F. Differen levels between th Ile*Arg and Val*Gln haplotypes were signifi cant for antibodies against serotypes 4 and 18C (p=<0.001 and 0.03 respectively) and a trend was observed for serotype 14 (p=0.07). For the IL-ept ose with 13 Arg130Gln SNP no clear high or low responder genotype was observed, o no clear high or low responder haplotype co uld be predicted. No consistently higher s antibody levels against the seven pneumoco ccal serotypes were observed with any individual haplotype. 72 R IL-13 p G*Ar g A*Gl n p N 185 33 15 82 185 27 4 4.1 2.9 0.04 7.9 3.2 <0.001 4.0 3.5 0.8 6B 1.3 1.0 0.4 1.5 1.2 0.5 1.2 1.0 0.5 9V 25.3 20.2 0.4 32.3 25.5 0.5 25.1 22.0 0.6 14 71.4 66.0 0.8 127.4 66.1 0.07 69.7 84.4 0.5 18C 9.1 8.1 0.5 14.4 8.1 0.03 9.1 8.0 0.5 19F 10.5 10.3 0.9 12.9 10.3 0.6 10.8 13.0 0.5 23F 4.4 2.9 0.05 4.0 4.6 0.6 4.2 4.5 0.7 Table 4. Geometric mean pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotype specific IgG antibody concentrations ( g/ml) according to IL-4, IL-4 R and IL-13 haplotypes. Since significant differences with both the IL-4 and the IL-4 R haplotypes were observed for antibodies against pneumococcal serotype 4, we investigated combinations of these two haplotypes. Carriers of both low responder haplotypes IL-4 T*T and IL-4 R Val*Gln showed lower antibody levels (GM 2.6 g/ml) than when only the two individual haplotypes were investigated (GM of 2.9 g/ml in IL-4 T*T and 3.2 g/ml IL-4 R Val*Gln carriers; figure 2). Thus, a syne rgistic effect was observed, resulting in significantly lower antibody levels against pneumococcal serotype 4 in those with both low responder haplotypes compared to those with both high geometric mean antibody level against pneumococcal serotype 4 according to IL-4 and IL-4R genotype, haplotype and haplotype combination. Synergistic effect and thus a greater discriminating power of individual haplotypes versus single loci and of haplotype combination ve rsus individual haplotypes 74 Discussion This study demonstrates associ ations of individual SNPs a nd haplotypes in IL-4 and IL- 4 R with pneumococcal vaccine antibody responses. The IL-4 589T, IL-4 2979T and IL-4 R 551Gln alleles were associated with significantly lower pneumococcal antibody levels in single SNP analyses. Several lines of evidence suggest that the IL-4 589T allele may be associated with dys-regulated immune responses. The IL-4 589T allele has previously been associated with increased IgE levels21, 24, 38, 39, an increased frequency and rate of progression of disease in HIV infected patients40 and increased susceptibility to Kawasaki's disease41. Furthermore, it was shown that amongst children with severe malaria, total IgE levels were significantly elevated in those carrying the IL- 4 589T allele, suggesting the possibility th at there is a relationship between susceptibility to severe malaria, IgE production and genetic variation in IL-442. IL-4 induces B cell activation and modifies humoral B cell responses to both T cell dependent and T cell independent stimuli43. The IL-4 -589 T allele enhances IL-4 transcription in vitro44. Therefore, prima facie, the T a llele might be expected to be associated with increased humoral responses to vaccines. However, Vos and colleagues showed T cell independent humoral responses to be enhanced by short-term exposure to IL-4, in the absence of IFN- but suppressed by persistent IL-4 exposure45. Thus, humoral responses may be dependent upon the cytokine microenvironment and the length of exposure to this microenvironment. Therefore, under certa in conditions an IL- 4 allele associated with increased IL-4 tran scription might be asso ciated with decreased humoral responses. These effects may be further modified by the coexistence of genetically mediated alterations of IL-4 R function. Furthermore a gene-environment interaction between day-care a ttendance in the first 6 months of life and the IL-4 R Ile50Val locus on lipopolysaccharide induced IFN- production has been shown46. Therefore, relationships between indivi dual alleles or haplotypes and vaccination responses may be further dependent on mi croenvironmental, macroenvironmental and developmental influences. As for the IL-4 -589T allele, the IL-4 2979T allele has been associated with asthma 22. However, no functional studies on this SNP ha ve been reported. Functional data on the IL-4 R Arg551Gln SNP is conflicting47, 48. However, the 551Gln allele has been associated with asthma and atopic phenotypes49, 50. That the IL-4 and IL-4 R alleles 75 that have been associated with atopy show a diminished antibody response in our study is consistent with the association of atopy with altered kinetics of the maturation of vaccine responses and of atopic eczema with delayed maturation of the antibody response to pneumococcal vaccine27, 28. This might suggest a relationship between atopy, genotype and the responses upon pne umococcal vaccination, possibly brought about by an altered cytokine milieu secondary to an altered Th1/Th2 balance. Significant associations with genotype or haplotype were not demonstrated for antibody responses to all serotypes and of the studied pneumococcal serotypes, serotype 4 was most consistently associated with genotype. Potential reasons for lack of consistent replication across all serotypes in this st udy include: true vari ation in the underlying association between genotype and outcome (effe ct heterogeneity), type 1 error or lack of power 51. Possible biological explanations for variati on in the underlying association of genotype with individual serotypes include differing immunogenicities between serotypes, related to variations in the chemical structure of polysaccharide capsules, and/or variations in the magnitude of polysaccharide specific response dependent on the prevalence of specific serotypes, and thus the presence or absence of natural priming. It is possible that the effect of the studied SNPs might be insufficient to significantly augment IgG antibody responses against poorly immunogeni c and/or low prevalent serotypes. Conversely, with high immunogenic and/or highly prevalent serotypes the relative contribution of genetic variation may be small. Thus an association would be most likely to be revealed in serotypes of inte rmediate immunogenicity and/or prevalence. Haplotypes composed of IL-4 and IL-4 R SNPs, showed a higher discriminative power in vaccine responsiveness compared to SNP analyses, indicating a synergistic influence on antibody responses of haplotypes over indivi dual SNPs. Comparing combinations of the IL-4 and IL-4R haplotypes, revealed the greate st magnitude of difference in antibody responses, with carri ers of two poor responding haplotypes having the lowest antibody levels. Thus furthermore showing an a dditive genetic effect of combinations of haplotypes over single haplotypes. Studyi ng haplotypes of multiple polymorphisms in one gene has been described to be more in formative than analysis of single SNPs in genetic association studies of complex diseases 52. The importance of investigating gene- gene interactions in complex biological pathways has also been demonstrated49. The additive effect of haplotyp e and haplotype-haplotype combination analyses, compared 76 to single SNP and single haplot ype analyses respectively, repo rted in this study supports the approach of studying the effect of comb inations of multiple loci, both within and between genes, on complex phenotypes. The findings of this study provide additional support for the importance of host genetic factors in vaccine responses. Understanding these influences is likely to be important for the development of improved and novel vaccines. 77 References 1. Fedson DS, Scott JA.

Genetic variants associated with atopy, and the environmen tal factor parental tobacco smoke (PS) exposure, independent ly alter immune responses. Objective: To investigate the hypothesis that genetic variants associated with atopy and their interaction with PS influen ce infant vaccine responsiveness. Methods: In 200 infants with parental atopic history, relationships were sought between polymorphisms in IL-4, IL-4R and IL-13 genes, PS and immune responses to diphtheria/tetanus vaccination. Findings: Analyses stratified by PS unmasked negative associations between atopic alleles of these genes and vaccine outcomes. The most consistent involved the IL-4R 551 QR/QQ genotypes which were associated in polyclonal T-cell responses a nd innate immune responses, in PS exposed infants. Conclusion: PS potentiates suppressive effect s of variants in immune response genes in children. These effects are not observed in the absence of this exposure. Ultimately this finding may have implications for infant vaccina tion in countries with high smoking rates. It may also have broader implications in relation to environmental toxicology as it demonstrates specific mechanisms through wh ich the developing immu ne system may be differentially sensitive to lo w level toxicant exposures. 83 Introduction Globally, more than 50% of children under 5 y ears of age who die do so from infectious diseases1. Vaccination is unequivocally important in prevention of these diseases. The importance of genetic influences on vaccine responses is suggested by differences in vaccine responses between individuals and ethnic groups2, 3, and evidence for high heritability of specific antibody and T h2 cytokine responses to vaccines4-6. Understanding these genetic influences should elucidate vaccine response mechanisms, ultimately resulting in improved vaccine efficacy. Associations between specific genes and vaccine responses have been reported 3, 7 but studies have predominantly focused on HLA and immunoglobulin allotype genes8, 9. Many other genes may modulate vaccinat ion responses therefore a targ eted approach is necessary. Genes associated with atopy are potentially important, as an atopic family history and atopic eczema are associated with dela yed maturation of responses to tetanus10, and pneumococcal vaccine respectively11. Therefore, variations in genes previously associated with atopy, including Interleukin-4 (IL-4), Interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4R ) and IL- 1312, may influence vaccine responses. IL-4 and IL-13 are pleiotropic cytokines that interact with IL-4 receptor alpha (IL4R ) to signal to effector cells13. Their functions include induction of IgG4 and IgE antibody s ynthesis by B-lymphocytes and differentiation to a Th2 phenotype. Environmental factors also influence vacc ine responses. Notably, smoking has been associated with both impaired 14, 15, and elevated responses to vaccination16. Therefore, as exposures in early life are likely to interact with a child's geno type to modulate response to environmental factors17, and the probability of detecting genetic effects is increased when analyses are stratified by specific environmen tal factors, including environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)18, we investigated the effects and interaction of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-4, IL-13 and IL4R genes and the environmental factor parental smoking (PS), on responses to dipht heria and tetanus vaccine in a cohort of children at risk of atopy. We hypot hesised that genetic variants associated with atopy would modulate vaccine responses and that thes e effects would be modified by PS. 84 Methods Population 200 children aged 2 years, born between July 1996 and July 1998, from a previously described Western Australian birth cohort recruited on the ba sis of parental history of atopy19. PS was defined by parental report, at 2 year-old questionnaires, of current cigarette smoking by either or both parents. Skin prick test (SPT) reactivity to a standard panel of allergens (Hollister Stier Labs, Spokane, Wash), which included house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; HDM), perennial rye grass, cat pelt, fresh egg. Histamine and normal saline were included as positive a nd negative controls, respectivel y, as previously described19. An SPT was regarded as positive if the wheal diameter was 3mm greater than the negative control. Data on other potentially important exposures were coll ected including the dichotomous variables daycare attendance, pet exposure (dog and/or cat) and other children in the house. Vaccines and Vaccination Schedules At ages 2, 4, and 6 months, the subjects received DTPa (acellular pertussis) (Infanrix; GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) or DTPw (Polio Sabin ; (MMRII; Merck, Sharp & Dohme or Priorix; GSK) was administered at age 12 months. At 18 months, a further dose of DTPa or DTPw and Hib vaccination was given. The last DTP vaccine prior to blood collection was DTPa in 44\u00b75% of individuals. Three percent of individuals never received whole cel l DTPw prior to blood collection. Measurement of vaccine specific antibody concentrations Blood samples were obtained at 2 years of age (mean: 2 years 15 days, range: 1year 335 days to 2 years 35 days) and serum was isolated and stored at -200C. The levels of anti- diphtheria and anti-tetanus Ig G were measured by ELISA. Cell preparation and culture 85 Peripheral blood was collected at age 2 year s and processed to yield peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as previously described. PBMC were cultured at a concentration of 1x10 6 cells/ml in serum supplemented (SEB). Cells were incubated either alone, or together with tetanus toxoid (0.5 LF/ml; CSL, Australia), PHA (1 g/ml; of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (1 ng/ml, Al exis Biochemicals, San Fluorometry PBMC were cryopreserved at co llection and batch analysed in groups of 10 within a short period and with identical reagents 10. The level of IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 in-house TRF as previously described20. The limit of detection for these assays was 10 pg/ml. As previously described, 21 responses that were below the limits of detection (including zeros) were ascribed a value equivalent to half the limit of detection. Lim itations in cell numbers secondary to small volume blood samples in some individuals resu lted in fewer cytokine response outcomes compared to antibody response outcomes. Genotyping Genotyping was performed automated (Varian Helix-System \u00ae) using the method developed by Oefner and Underhill22. Accession number, forward (F) and reverse (R) primer sequences, and restriction enzymes, where relevant, for each SNP are described belo w. Underlined bases in primers indicate a base change to create restriction enzyme site and amino acids are numbered from the beginning of the mature protein. IL-4 C-589T: rs2243250, F- Statistics Responses were skewed and therefore were log transformed to approximate a normal distribution, as previously described 21. Regression models were used to assess genetic associations. The time between last vaccine dose and blood sampling was negatively correlated with vaccine responses (diphthe ria toxoid : p<0\u00b70005 and tetanus toxoid: p<0\u00b70005) and IL-10 responses (p=0\u00b7049) To accommodate this correlation, linear regression was applied to derive residual values, corrected for the interval. The adjusted levels of antibody response were calculated with means of log values of the antibody response plus the corresponding residual values, and were used for the further analysis. Subsequently, PS was added to these models, and then the intera ction effect of genotype and PS. Given, in general, the low frequency of alleles previous ly associated with atopy, models dominant for were also performed and were in accordance with findings from parametric analyses. Interactions were investigated by comparison of geometric means (GM), correct ed for time between last DTP vaccine dose and blood sample collection, between genotype gr oups after stratification for PS. A p-value of <0\u00b705 was considered significant. No adju stments were made for multiple testing in investigations were based on an a priori hypothesis and we have described all tests performed23, 24.All analyses were performed using SPSS version 11\u00b75. 87 Results Phenotypic Characterist ics and Associations Overall, 21% (n=42) of the cohort was exposed to PS. There was no significant association between parental smoking, gender or SPT and responses, between genotype and SPT or between the combination of genotype and sm oke exposure and SPT. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction effect of atopy (SPT) and pa rental smoking on any of the responses studied. GM and 95% c onfidence interval of the tota l specific IgG to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids stratified by PS are s hown in Table 1. There was no significant relationship between type of DTP vaccine gi ven and vaccine responses (data not shown). Correlations between antibody and cytokine resp onses were investigated using Spearman rank correlation. All significan t correlations were positive. These included: tetanus and diphtheria antibody responses (r=0\u00b7599, p<0\u00b7 000); tetanus antibody responses and all es ((r= 0.274 stimulated IL-10 (r=0.187, p=0.03) responses. No diphtheria antibody vaccine response was less than 0.01 IU/ml, the generally accep ted minimum level gi ving some degree of protection25, and 1.4% of tetanus antibody levels were below the protective level of 0.15 IU/ml26. Investigation of genotypic associations and the interaction of smoking and genotype upon vaccine-specific immune responses Genotypic effects All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and allele frequencies were consistent with previous reports. Analysis of the IL-4 C-589T SNP revealed a positive association of the T allele with antibody response to diph theria toxoid (p=0\u00b7049 and p=0\u00b702, respectively) (Figure 1). There were no further significant asso ciations between the remaining loci and vaccine responses. 88 No parental smoking (n=158) Parental smoking (n=42) pp n % n % Male 97 61 19 45 0\u00b707 SPT 3mm 35 22 10 23 0\u00b778 and ch aracteristics with geometric mean (GM) IgG and 95% confidence intervals for diphtheria and teta nus toxoids and tetanus toxoid stimulated cytokine levels stratified by parental smoking.

Va lues plotted are corrected fo r time between last dose of vaccine and blood collection. Genotypic effects after stratification by PS To investigate whether the relation of genotype to outcome differed depending on PS exposure vaccine responses were compared between genotype groups within those exposed and unexposed to PS. There was almost perf ect correlation between prenatal parental smoking status and parental smoking status at 2 years of ag e and this precluded examination of prenatal a nd postnatal parental smoking. In unexposed subjects, those with IL-4 -589 CT/TT genotypes had higher diphtheria (p=0\u00b7005) and tetanus (p=0\u00b7 04) antibody responses (table 2) compared to those with subjects with the CC genotype. Furthermore, those with IL-4R I5OV II / IV genotypes had non-significantly higher diphtheria (p=0 \u00b708) antibody responses, compared to those with the VV genotype. 90 In exposed subjects, those w ith the IL-4 -589 CT/TT genotypes, compared to those with the CC genotype, had decreased tetanus antibod y decreased tetanus toxoid-stimulated IL- 4R QR/RR genotypes, compared to those with the had reduced antibody responses, (Diphtheria: p=0\u00b703; Tetanus: p=0\u00b702, IL-10: p=0\u00b7014 and IL- 13: p=0\u00b701 responses (see table 2, figure 3). There was also a non-significant reduction in tetanus toxoid-stimulated IL-5 (p=0\u00b706) responses. Furthermore, those w ith responses compared to the CC genotype. Significant findings in exposed individuals were re-examined with adjustment for other potentially important e xposure variables (i.e. da ycare attendance, pet exposure and number of siblings); th e results were largely unchanged. 91 Table 2.

Interaction effects Regression models were used to explore the pos sibility of an intera ction between genotype and PS upon vaccination responses. The interac tion effects of IL-4 C-589T genotype and PS on antibody responses to diphtheria and te tanus antibody responses were significant (p=0\u00b702 and p=0\u00b7002, respectively). This e ffect was also significant for the IL4R I50V and tetanus antibody responses (p=0\u00b702). Ot her smoking-genotype interaction effects approached significance. These included -4 C-589T: tetanus toxoid-stimulated responses and IL-4R Q551R diphtheria (p =0\u00b708) and tetanus (p=0\u00b707) antibody responses, see table 2. Signi ficant associations were re-examined with the inclusion of other exposure variables, as ab ove, in the linear regression models; results were largely unchanged. Investigation of polyclonal T-cell and innate immune responses The most consistent finding was the interaction of IL-4R Q551R and PS on vaccine responses including specific IgG production by B-lymphocytes. To investigate the site(s) of action of this polymorphism in the i mmunological cascade leading to IgG production, this interaction was further explored in cell populations which exert their effects \"upstream\" of IgG-producing B-lymphocytes , notably T-helper cells which drive immunoglobulin class switching in B-lymphocytes and cells of the innate immune system 94 which activate T-helper cells. Hence, in additi on to cytokine responses to vaccine-specific stimuli, cytokine responses to polyclonal T-cell activation stimuli and to TLR ligands that trigger innate immune cell responses were dete rmined and analysed after stratification for PS exposure. There were no significant genotype-related differences amongst those not exposed to PS, however in PS exposed subjects differences were demonstrated. Specifically, and consistent with analys es of vaccine-specific responses, IL-4R 551 QR/RR genotypes were associated with lowe r responses compared with the QQ genotype (see figures 4 and 5).

Individuals with IL-4 -589 CT /TT genotypes, i.e. genotypes containing at least one allele previously associated with atopy, had an increased IgG antibody response to diphtheria vaccination. Consistent with our findings, the IL-4 -589T allele was associated with elevated antibody respons es against malaria antigens27, and IL-4 haplotypes containing the IL-4 -589T allele were f ound more commonly in Hepatitis B vaccine responders compared to non-responders 28 It is also pertinent to note studies on vaccine responses in children, including those to diphth eria and tetanus vaccines, revealed a major contribution to genetic varian ce from genes outside HLA loci7, and in this context our current results point to gene s in the IL-4/IL-13 axis. Prima facie, the finding of increased antibody re sponses amongst children with IL-4 alleles associated with atopy contrasts with reports of delayed maturation of adaptive immune competence in children at high genetic risk (H R) of atopy (including those with a parental history of atopy), in particular in relation to the functions of T-helper (Th) cells which drive antibody production 29. However, we have shown that a ttenuation of Th-cell activity is transient in HR children and \"rebounds\" at the e nd of infancy to create a state of heightened activity relative to children at low risk10 Further indicative of this rebound effect is heightened vaccine-specific Th-memory responses in 6yr old atopic children29. Collectively, these observations suggest that the direction and magnitude of the genetic effects associated with atopy risk on vaccine re sponses in childhood vary with age. In this context it is noteworthy that ag e-related variation in effect has been shown with another polymorphism associated with atopy, namely CD14 C-159T30. Our most novel finding concerned interactions between genotype and parental smoking on antibody responses to vaccine. Specifically, atopy-associated SNPs in the genes for IL-4 and IL-4RA were associated with increased vaccine responses in children of non-smoking parents, but with lowered res ponses in children of smokers. Further support for the notion that environmental factors interact with gene s in the IL4/IL-13 axis to modulate immune responses in childhood are the daycare-gene (IL-4R ) interaction effect on IFN- responses in the first year of life 17; the association of the IL4R Q576R polymorphism in children 97 with atopic eczema not given antibiotics, but not in those given antibiotics31and linkage studies implicating ETS in the unmasking of sensitivity to asthma susceptibility genes12, 18. This study identifies specific genetic targets for ETS eff ects on responses to vaccine antigens. Moreover, that the effects in this study are only evident agai nst a specific genetic background further supports the \"gene x environment\" paradigm in determining phenotype. IL-4 and IL-4RA are highly plausible candidate genes in the context of this study, given the major role of IL-4 in driving the growth and differentiation of the B-lymphocytes ultimately responsible for the magnitude of the primary outcome, viz. antibody production. However, the antibody data per se provide no insight into the natu re of or site s of action of the ETS effects that unmask suscep tibility to these genetic vari ants. To investigate this we assessed the activity of other cell types, which function in antibody responses upstream of B-lymphocytes. Specifically, we examined Th-memory cells, which are the principal sources of the cytokines driving B-lymphocyte maturation, and cells of the innate immune system, which provide the initial signals to tr igger Th-cell activation in response to vaccine antigens or polyclonal stimuli. In children with the IL-4R Q576 QR/RR genotype a broad spectrum of vaccine-specific (Figure 2 and 3) and polyclonal (Figure 4) cytokine responses were attenuated in parallel with specific IgG antibody production, but only in those with ETS exposure. Of particular no te, the capacity of cells of th e innate immune system in ETS-exposed IL-4RA Q576R QR/RR children to respond to the TLR ligands LTA and pansorbin was also markedly attenuated (figure 5). Cells of the innate immune system are widely distributed upon and w ithin mucosal tissues interfacing with the outside environment, and provide the first line of immunological defence against foreign antigens, as well as playing an instructive role in controlling ensuing adaptive immunity. Accordingly, our finding of defective TLR responses in these children pinpoints the ETS effects on vaccine immunity to this initial cellular step in the immunological cascade. This findi ng is highly plausibl e in the light of earlier studies. In particular, active smoking has been demonstr ated to markedly attenuate priming of immunologically naive adults against influenza vaccine 14, and passive smoke exposure of animals has been shown to exert comparable effects32.3 Of particular note, these earlier studies identified cells of th e innate immune system as one of the primary targets for the immunomodulatory effects of tobacco smoke33. Moreover, in animal models, these ETS 98 effects could be reproduced by vapour phase components, including ox ides of nitrogen, which are common constituents of urban air pollution 34, suggesting that these findings may be generalisable to environm ental factors other than ETS. Precisely how ETS exposure of children infl uences adaptive immune function outside the respiratory tract remains to be determin ed. However, given that ETS exposure can deleteriously affect immune functions in adults, our present results may not be surprising. The molecular mechanism(s) mediating ETS effects upon the specifi c genes is unknown. However, it is clear that they do not invol ve ETS-mediated changes in DNA sequence and are hence \"epigenetic\". There are numerous reports of epig enetic regulation of immune response genes, including IL-435, 36, and epigenetic effects of smoking on immune function have been reported in other systems but epigen etic mechanisms were not directly addressed here. Smoke exposure has been implicated in experimental studies in damage to both respiratory mucosal and systemic immune function32-34, and in this case may work via either route. That stimulation of distal mucosal surfaces by environmental agents can modulate the differentiation and/or functiona l activity of bone marrow derived immune cells is well established, the archetypal exam ple being stimulation of the gastric mucosa by commensal bacteria, which is recognised as a principal mechanism driving the postnatal maturation of the immune system during infancy (reviewed in37). The corollary that signals generated from the respiratory mucosa, by environmental stimuli including ETS, can contribute to (and possibly in terfere with) this process is accordingly not radical. Given the vast majority of antibody respons es were above generally accepted minimum levels of protection for diphthe ria and tetanus infection and th at cytokine responses were determined in-vitro, the clinical implicat ions of our findings are unknown. However, in interpreting these responses it is notable that no antibody level may confer absolute protection25. Additionally, the cytokine responses were also impaired and the clinical implication of this in combination with th e reduced antibody levels is also unknown. If our findings are to have health implications, these may be greatest in developing countries, as cigarette consumption is increasing in developing nations38, and the alleles associated with impaired immune responses in childre n of smokers are more common in many of these countries39, 40. Further research is needed to clarify these issues. 99 This study has several limitations including: 1. It was unable to assess the differential effects of maternal and paternal smoking, in-utero versus ex-utero exposure or dose- dependent effects, due to the relatively sma ll number of smoking mothers 2.Cotinine levels were not measured and using parental repor ts to assess smoking exposure is subject to recall bias. However, such bias is likely to be independent of th e genotypes studied and would therefore likely skew the estimate s of interaction effects towards the null hypothesis41. 3. Without a healthy control group it ca nnot be said whether the demonstrated associations are specific to, or independent of, a high genetic risk of atopy and 4. No corrections were made for multiple testing. We elected not to make such corrections because (i) they can be overly conservative and may inflate type II errors and (ii) our analyses were based on an a priori hypothesis23. Instead, we have c hosen to describe all statistical analyses carried out and to discuss the results. We agree with Rothman24 that there is little to be gained by adjustment, provided that the a ll analyses are described when the study is reported and there is a lot to be lost by it if anything other than the results of all hypothesis tests are reported. In conclusion, this study identifies genetic influences on, and gene -smoking interactions effecting vaccine responses. It suggests a role of genetic variants associated with atopy in modulation of vaccine responses and supports the joint considera tion of genetic and environmental factors in studies of complex phenotypes. Accordingly, failure to account for gene-environment interactions could have contributed to inco nsistent associations of both genetic and environmental factors with v accination responses. Understanding these interactions may enhance understanding of mechanisms regulating vaccine responses. Finally, and particularly as effects on mu ltiple arms of the immune response were demonstrated, these findings may have imp lications for the pathogenesis of immune mediated disorders. 100 Acknowledgements We thank the parents and children for their participation in this study. 101 References 1.

Objective: To investigate the hypothesis that cord blood (CB) immune responses relate to subsequent vaccination responses and are in fluenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-4/IL-13 axis and parental smoking (PS) in children at high risk of atopy (HR). Methods: In subsets of a cohort of 263 individuals selected on a parental history of atopy, relationships were sought between phytoh aemagglutinin (PHA) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-stimulated cytokine responses from CB mononuclear cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected at 6 and 12 months, and vaccine responses at 2 years of age. Subsequently, the associ ations of polymorphisms in IL-4, IL-4R and IL-13 genes, parental smoking and CB responses were investigated. Findings: A negative correlation of SEB-stimul ated IL-10 CB levels tetanus toxoid specific IgG Tox) (p=0.004) at 2years of age was demons trated. This correlation was lost at 6 months and was positive at 12 mont hs (p=0.008) of age. There were lower CB IL- 10 levels in those with the IL-4 2979 CT/ TT (p=0.04) and the to the remaining genotypes at these loci. An inverse linear relationship between haplotypes with an increasing number of alleles previously associated with and CB IL-10 (PHA: p=0.049 and SEB=0.02) compared to th e remaining haplotypes were found. Additionally, there was a greater difference in those with the IL-13 \"low-responder\" haplotypes, compared to the remaining haplot ypes, in those exposed to PS compared to those unexposed. Conclusion: CB cytokine responses predic t early childhood vaccine responses in HR children, relate to genotypes of the IL-4/IL-13 axis and associate with the interaction of PS and IL-13 haplotype. Taken togeth er with previous findings on th is cohort this suggests that the interaction of genotype and PS al ters vaccine response ontogeny. 107 Introduction Vaccination is one of the most important public health interventions. Whilst a developmental dynamic of vaccine responses in children at risk of atopy has been described, its determinants remain unclear. Dy sregulated newborn resp onses to antigens are associated with altered risk for immune ba sed phenomena in infancy and early childhood1, and prenatal immune experiences, as measur ed by cord blood T-cell responses, are a determinant of resistance to infection 2. Therefore, in a cohort en riched for atopy, this study explored antecedents of childhood diphtheria and tetanus vaccine responses by investigating the interrelations hips between immune responses in cord blood and at six and 12 months of age with vaccine re sponses at two years of age. Host genetic factors influence cord blood cytokine responses 3 and exposures in early life, and by corollary prenatal exposures, are likely to interact with an indi vidual's genotype to modulate subsequent responses to environmental factors4. Furthermore, genetic 5, 6 and gene-environment5 interactions, especially those that involve parental smoking, have been shown to effect vaccine responses. Therefore, we investigated the influence of the interaction of host genetic factors with pa rental smoking on cord-blood responses and how this related to later vaccin e responses. We selectively examined single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL-4/IL-13 axis as they are key modulators of host immune responses, with their functions including direct ing differentiation of na\u00efve T cells towards a Th2 phenotype 7, 8, and associations have been found between SNPs in these genes and responses to pneumococcus6, tetanus and diphtheria vaccines5. 108 Materials and methods Subjects Cord and peripheral blood were available for phenotypic analyses on a subset of individuals from a total of 263 children, born between July 1996 and July 1998, from a previously described Western Australian birth cohort recruited on the ba sis of parental history of atopy9. Limitations in the quantity of cord blood available for stimulation by individual T- cell mitogens, combined with the unavail ability of genotypic information on some individuals, resulted in discrepancies between the numbers of cytokine responses analysed by each genotype and at each time point. Depe nding on the cytokine studied and the time- point investigated genotypic associations with phytohaemagglutin in (PHA)-stimulated responses were analysed for between 172- 187 individuals and for staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) responses these relationships were examined in between 132 and 169 individuals. The Ethics Comm ittee of the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children approved the study protocol. Cell preparation and culture Blood was collected from umbilical cords a nd peripherally at ages 6 and 12 months, cryopreserved and processed to yield cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as previously described 10, 11. Mononuclear cells were cultured at a concentration of 1x106 cells/ml in AIM-V serum-free medium (Gibco Life Technologies, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). Cells were incubated either alone, or together with PHA (1 g/ml; Murex Biotech, UK), SEB (200 0.5 Lf/ml [CSL, Parkville, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN in culture supernatants of cord and peripheral blood was determined by in-house TRF as previously described 12. The limit of detection for these assays was 10 pg/ml. Limitations in cell numbers sec ondary to small volume blood samples in some individuals resulted in fewer cytokine response outcomes compared with antibody response outcomes. As previously described 13, responses that were below the limits of detection (including zeros) were ascribed a value equivalent to half the limit of detection. Vaccine response outcomes at tw o years of age were measured by TRF (cytokines: IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IFN- tetanus toxoids) as previously described5. PCR-RFLP and denaturing HPLC as described previously (ref). Haplotypes were inferred using PHASE version 2.1 14, 15. 109 Statistics Cytokine responses were skewed and theref ore were log transfor med to approximate a normal distribution, as previously described 13. Regression models were used to assess genetic associations. To inve stigate the effect of PS expo sure on genetic associations, Geometric means (GM) were compared betwee n genotype groups after stratification by the dichotomous variable PS. Given, in general, the low frequency of alleles previously associated with atopy, models domi nant parametric analyses were also performed and were in accordance with findings from parametric analyses. Linear regression was us ed to explore the relationship of the number of cigarettes smoked on cord blood responses and the relationship of cord blood responses to vaccine outcomes at two y ears of age. PS and genotype we re subsequently added to linear regression models of cord blood respons es versus 2-year vaccine outcomes. A p- value of <0\u00b705 was considered significant. No adjustments were made for multiple testing as investigations were based on an a priori hypothesis and we have described all tests performed22, 23. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 11\u00b75. 110 Results Phenotypic analyses Cord blood responses versus vaccin e responses at 2 years of age Cord blood SEB and PHA stimulated IL-10 leve ls were inversely associated with IgG responses to tetanus toxoid at two years of PHA stimulated IFN- levels were positively associated with IgG responses to tetanus toxoid (SEB: B (PHA: B 0.62,beta 0.20, p=0.046), respectively, at two years of age, table 1. The addition of genot ype and/or PS did not significantly change these associations. No significant associations of the remaining cord blood cytokine responses with vaccine respons es were found and ther efore these cytokine responses were not investigated at the remaining time-points.

There was no significant relationship betw een the number of cigarettes smoked per day and cord blood responses. Genetic Analyses SNP associations with cord blood responses All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Allele frequencies were consistent with previous reports. Signifi cant associations were found; in all cases genotypes containing at least one allele previously associated with atopy were associated with impaired cord blood responses (see tabl e 3, figure 1). Overall, cytokine responses were reduced in those with atopic genotypes (see figure 1). It was noteworthy in the context of the phenotypic analyses that in all comparisons PHA and SEB-stimulated IL-10 responses were lower in those with genotypes containing at least one allele previously associated with atopy (see fi gure 2). Significantly lower SE B-stimulated IL-10 responses were found in individuals with significantly lower in individuals with IL-13 CT/TT compared with 3 .

Specifically, haplotypes containing no, 1 or 2 alleles of SNPs prev iously associated with atopy were assigned a value of 0, 1 or 2 respectively. No significant associations were found between IL-4 haplotypes and cord blood responses. Signi ficant associations were found for IL-4RA haplotypes with PHA (p=0.049) and SEB-stimulat ed (p=0.009) IL-10 (figure 3) with an increasing number of atopic alleles ne gatively associated with IL-10 responses (figure 4). This trend was present for IL-13 haplotype and SEB-stimulated IL-10 responses (p=0.08). 116 Figure Geometric Mean (GM) Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-stimulated IL-10 levels.

It was associated with extremely low GM PHA an d SEB stimulated IL-10 cytokine responses (PHA: GM 15 for both low responder haplot ypes versus 305 for other combinations, p=0.03 and SEB: GM 5 for both low res ponder haplotypes versus 59 for other combinations, p=0.08). However, the significanc e of this is unknown as there was only one individual with both lo w-responder haplotypes. SNP associations afte r stratification by PS Results were stratifed by PS to explore if ge netic effects varied depending on PS exposure. In those unexposed to PS, the IL-13 -1112 CT/TT genotypes were associated with significantly reduced PHA stimulated IL-5 responses (p=0.03) compared with CC individuals. Additionally, the association of these genotypes with PHA-stimulated IL-10 responses approached significance (p=0.06) a nd the p-value for SEB-stimulated responses was 0.08. In those exposed to PS, the IL-4 -589 CT/TT and IL-4 2979 GT/TT genotypes were associated with reduced SEB-stimulated IFN- responses genotypes B-stimulated IL-10 responses (p=0.045) compared with the remaining genotype at is locus and the IL-13 Arg/Gln and IFN- (p=0.04) responses compared with the genotype at this locus. 119 Haplotypic associations after stratification by PS Prior to stratification haplotype s were grouped as described fo r unstratified analyses. In analyses of haplotypes categorised by the numbe r of alleles of associated with atopy, a number of associa tions was found. In the abse nce of PS exposure there was an inverse relationship between haplotypes with an increasing number of atopic PHA-stimulated IL-10 responses and IL-4 haplotypes (p=0.06). In the presence of PS, there was a negative association between IL-13 hapl otypes with increasing numbers of atopic alleles and PHA and SEB-stimulated IL-10 responses in the presence of PS (p=0.048 and p=0.006, respectively). Consistent with the above, analyses of \"low-responder\" haplotype s compared with the remaining haplotypes were associated with se veral reduced responses. In the absence of PS exposure IL-4R \"low-responder\" haplotypes were asso ciated with p= 0.02, (PHA: p=0.20 and SEB: p=0.26) were lower in the \"low- re sponder\" haplotypes. In the presence of PS IL-10 st ratified by parental smoking. Shaded bars are those exposed to parental smoking and wh ite bars are those unexposed. T-G: promoter polymorphism Given the above associations with levels associations of the IL-10 C-592A polymorphism with phenotypic outcomes at all studied time-points we re investigated and no significant associations were found. 121 Discussion This is the first study to investigate the relations hip of cord blood cytokine levels and subsequent cytokine responses with early childhood vaccine outcomes. The findings showed an age dependent relationship of IL-10 responses with vaccine outcomes that parallels the known ontogeny of vaccine respon ses in children at high risk of atopy (HR) 10.The data presented herein highlighted the importance of genetic variants in the IL- 4/IL-13 axis to cord blood cytokine responses in these children and suggested that the combination of PS and specific genotypes may perturb the ontogeny of vaccination responses. In utero, the fetal immune response is cons trained to prevent placental toxicity 24. This is achieved by mechanisms including regulation of fetal Th cell cyt okine gene expression25, 26. Postnatally, Th cell function is progressively upregulated. The kinetics of this maturation, which drives antibody and cell mediated re sponses, is highly variable between individuals 10and is slowest amongst HR children. However, the attenuation of Th-cell activity is transient in HR child ren and \"rebounds\" at the end of infancy to create a state of heightened activity relative to children at low risk10. IL-10 is a pleiot ropic cytokine with increasingly recognised immune regulatory roles 27 and is a highly plausible candidate for regulation of vaccination response ontogeny. Th e demonstrated temporal variation in the direction and magnitude of the association of this cyt okine with vaccine outcomes is consistent with its dynamic developmental infl uence. The finding of a negative association of cord blood IL-10 levels with vaccine re sponses, with a subse quent loss of this association at 6 months followed by a positiv e association at 12 months parallels the restriction of the fetal immune response and, in HR children, the persisting reduction in Th cell function during early infancy and the rebound thereafter. Additionally, the consistent positive relationship between IFN- cytokine levels following polyclonal stimuli at all studied time points is concordant with the findings that the development of tetanus toxoid Th-1 memory in infants is related to the rate of maturation of thei r overall polyclonal Th-1 response capacity 10. The differing profiles of associati on with vaccines outcomes of PHA and SEB stimulated IL-10 responses are note d. The PHA-induced IL-10 responses did not appear to be consistent with the ontologica l paradigm paralleled by the SEB-induced IL-10 responses. This may speak to the proposed Staphylococcal enterotoxins and atopy. Appli cation the normal skin of atopic and non-atopic individuals has been shown to selectivel y upregulate SEB-reactive T-cell receptors 28and to induce eczema 29. Additionally, studies in children suppor t the potential modi fying effect of SEB on childhood atopy 30. The skin of patients with eczema is frequently colonised with enterotoxin excreting S aureus strains 31. To explore if examina tion of active eczema might provide further insights, by serving as a proxy marker of Staphylococcal enterotoxin exposure, analyses were stratified by eczema st atus and no significant associations were found (data not shown). However, these indi rect assessments do not refute possible interrelationships between eczema, SEB and atopy. This study's findings underline the importance of genetic factors to cord blood cytokine responses and, given the associa tions of these responses with subsequent vaccine outcomes, suggest that genetic effects are pivotal to the developmenta l processes underlying vaccine responses. Taken together, the results of this study suggest a generalised impairment in the measured cytokine responses in those with genotypes and haplotypes composed of alleles previously associated with atopy. The most consistent genotype associated reduction in 122 response occurred with IL-10, this is particularly notable given the associations of IL-10 levels with subsequent vaccine responses de monstrated in this study. Genotypic effects on vaccine responses32, 33 and other phenotypes 33 vary with age and therefore need to be assessed within a developmental context. The ge netic associations of the IL-4/IL-13 axis in this study, when combined with previously reported associations of these genes with vaccine responses at two years of age, pa rallels the immunological ontogeny in HR children. Specifically, cord blood cytokine responses were imp aired in those with atopic genotypes, whilst at two years of age (duri ng the rebound phase), in the absence of PS, individuals with these ge notypes had augmented responses to vaccine antigens 34. Cytokines, including IL-10, are of prime importa nce to the establishm ent and regulation of effector functions of na\u00efve T cells. The interind ividual variability of th e effect of IL-10 is consequent upon a combination of timing, kinetics and dose of it and other cytokines within its microenvironment 27. Genotype influences at least some of these factors. It is notable in the context of this study's findings that ther e is a regulatory interplay between the IL-4/IL- 13 axis, GATA-3, a transcription factor centr al to Th2 cell differentiation, and IL-1035-39; and that the increased producti on of IL-10 in the presence of GATA-3 has been suggested to result, at least in part, from the indire ct effects of Th2 cyt okines, including IL-4 40, 41. Therefore, it is plausible that genetic variants in the IL-4/IL-13 axis may influence IL-10 levels. Given the association of IL-4/IL-13 ax is polymorphisms with IL-10 levels and the associations of IL-10 levels with vaccin e outcomes demonstrated in this study, in combination with the reported relationships between these polymo rphisms and vaccine responses, it is possible that IL-10 levels ma y mediate the effects of polymorphisms in the IL-4/IL-13 axis on vaccine responses. Although the fetal effects of maternal active smoking would be expected to be greater than passive smoking, exposure to the latter may exert in-utero effects. Prenatal smoke exposure has been associated with varyi ng effects on cytokine responses including increased IL-13, a trend towards lower IL-10 42 and decreased IL-4 and IFN- 1. Genetic variations and their interactions with this exposure may have contributed to the reported differences. No significant associations between PS and cytokine responses were found in this study, which might be partly attr ibutable to sample size. However, the most significant and consistent reductions in IL -10 levels occurred in PS exposed individuals with atopic genotypes and haplotypes of IL-13. These findings are supported by reported smoking-IL-13 gene interactions 34 43 44, 45. The compound effect of PS and genotype on cord blood IL-10 levels may be attributable to independent negative effects of these factors or a genetic interaction. Maternal smoking disrupts the pulmonary mucosal 46 and foeto-maternal barriers47, 48 and has been associated with transplacental transfer of enviro nmental tobacco smoke (ETS) constituents49. Analogous to disruption of the skin barrier function 50, disruption of pulmonary mucosal and placental barrier function ma y facilitate contact of antigen with antigen presenting cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), and elicit a variable eff ector cell cytokine response dependent on the cytokine milieu and/or other intrinsic properties, including genotype, of the host immune response. DCs are crucial to the initiation and regulation of immune responses, including T cell activity 51 at mucosal surfaces 52, 53, and have been identified in the pulmonary mucosa 54 and the decidua 55. The effects of IL-10 on T cells are believed to be largely mediated by its effect on DCs 56, 57. In the context of this study's findings, ETS has been associated with diminish ed DC IL-10 production during infancy58 and atopic 123 subjects may also have an intrinsic in ability to up-regulate DC IL-10 production 57. Therefore, the combination of genetic variatio ns associated with atopy and smoke exposure in a population enriched for atopy might be expe cted to be associated with lower IL-10 levels. PS may directly alter cytokine gene expression. Smoke exposur e alters gene expression in respiratory mucosa 59 and other tissues60, including placenta61, 62, is genotoxic in humans 63, and is associated with genotoxicity and a ltered gene expression after transplacental exposure in fetal mice 64. Additionally, smoking disrupt s epigenetic processes 65-67 that have been implicated in modulation of expression of cytokine genes, including IL-4, and their transcription factors 68, 69. The interaction of smoking and genotype may perturb the ontogeny of the vaccination responses given that PS compounded the reduction of cord blood responses by atopic genotype, and vaccine responses at two years of age in those with the combination of at opic genotypes and PS exposure we re lower compared with unexposed individuals with the same genotype. This study has several limitations. Firstly, bei ng unable to assess the di fferential effects of maternal and paternal smoking due to the re latively small numbers of smoking mothers. Secondly, being precluded from the direct invest igation of prenatal versus postnatal smoke exposure given the low numbers of individuals that ceased smoking postnatally. However, the smoking-gene interactions demonstrated in the studied cord blood responses suggest that some of the effect of PS may occur pr enatally. Thirdly, cotinine levels were not measured and using parental reports to assess smoking exposure is subject to recall bias. Mothers may underreport smoking 70, therefore, fetuses exposed to active maternal smoking in this cohort may be greater in number than that reported. Mothers report paternal smoking accurately 71 and there is assortative mating for smoking 72, therefore, a possible advantage of using the combined meas ure \"parental smoking\" is that it may be relatively accurate. Fourthly, without a heal thy control group, whether the demonstrated associations are specific to, or independent of, a high genetic risk of atopy cannot be ascertained. Fifthly, a single IL-10 promoter polymorphism was assessed; future studies will investigate IL-10 promoter haplotypes. Fi nally, no corrections were made for multiple testing. We elected not to make such co rrections because (i) they can be overly conservative and may inflate type II errors and (ii) our analyses were based on an a priori hypothesis22. Instead, we have chosen to describe a ll statistical analyses carried out and to discuss the results. We agree with Rothman 23 that there is little to be gained by adjustment, provided that all analyses are de scribed when the study is report ed and there is a lot to be lost if anything other than the result s of all hypothesis te sts are reported. In conclusion, cord blood cytokine respons es are predictive of early childhood vaccine responses in HR children and toge ther with cytokine responses at other time points parallel, and may underpin, the kinetics of postnatal maturation of vaccine responses in these children. The association of the IL-4/IL-13 ax is genotype with, and the interaction of PS and IL-13 upon, cord blood cytokine levels support the importance of these factors on cord blood responses. Finally, this study's findings ta ken together with prev ious findings on this cohort suggest that the inte raction of genotype and PS may alter vaccine response ontogeny. 124 References 1.

CD14 plays a key role in innate immunit y, including defense against path ogens associated with otitis media, a major pediatric health care issue. The T allele of the CD14 C 159T polymorphism has been associated with increased serum CD14 levels. Objective: To investigate the hypothesis that the CD14 159T allele is protective against recurrent acute otitis media in children. Methods: The association between CD14 promot er genotype and the number of acute otitis media episodes was eval uated both retrospec tively and prospectively in a cohort of 300 children. Serotype specific IgG antibody responses after pneumococcal vaccinations were examined according to CD14 genotype to compare immune responsiveness across genotypes. Results: An age dependent association wa s found: TT compared with CC homozygotes aged between 12-24 months had fewer episode s of acute otitis media (41% vs 79% respectively, p=0.004), this relationship bei ng absent in older children. Additionally, TT homozygotes showed higher serotype speci fic anti-pneumococcal IgG antibody levels. Conclusion: Our data suggest that genetic va riation in CD14, a molecu le at the interface of innate and adaptive immune responses, plays a key role in the defense against middle ear disease in childhood and in pneumococcal vaccine responsiveness. These findings are likely to be important to these and ot her immune mediated outcomes in early life. 131 Introduction Otitis media (OM) is the most common reason fo r a child under 3 years of age to visit a general practitioner and re presents a major pediat ric health care issue1, 2. , and viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, play a role in the onset of inflammation of the middle ear cavity. Innate defense systems capable of quickly distinguishing potential pathogens from self-structures ar e important for protection from infection, particularly at early age when adaptive immune responses to many microorganisms, including encapsulated bacteria, are immature3. CD14 plays a central role in the innate immune defense against many microorganisms causing otitis media. First characterized as the endotoxin/lip opolysaccharide (LPS) receptor 4, CD14 appears to also be involved in responses to lipoteichoic acid from gram-positive bacteria5, viruses7. The CD14 crystal structure provides a basis for this ligand diversity8. Involvement of CD14 in macropha ge responses against purified capsular polysaccharide of S. pneumoniae , the most important bacterial pathogen associated with OM, makes CD14 a biologically plausible candidate to investigate for its function in the immune defe nse against middle ear infection9. CD14 is expressed in a membrane bound form (mCD14) on the cell su rface of monocytes and neutrophils, but is also present in serum as a soluble prot ein. Soluble CD14 (sCD14) has the ability to confer pathogen responsiveness to cells th at do not constitutivel y express CD14 on their membrane 10, 11, and to enhance mCD14 mediated responses to both LPS and peptidoglycan 12. CD14 is also an important molecu le for optimal functioning of Toll- like receptor 413, a principal membrane signaling molecule through which mammals sense infection14. A functional polymorphism in the promoter of the CD14 gene (C 159T) has been described previously15. The T allele is associated with enhanced transcriptional activity in a monocytic reporter assay and increased sCD14 levels in epidemiological studies15- 17. Since increased sCD14 levels would enhan ce immune responsiveness, we hypothesized that the T allele would be protective against middle ear infections. To this end, a cohort 132 of children with a history of recurrent AOM was used to analyze the number of children suffering from the otitis-prone condition, defined as having had 4 or more acute otitis media (AOM) episodes per year, according to CD14 C-159T genotype18. Furthermore, the presence or absence of AOM recurre nce according to CD14 genotype was studied prospectively. IgG serotype specific antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccinations were investigated in relation to CD14 promoter genotype to compare immune responsiveness across genotypes. 133 Methods Study population to investi gate occurrence of AOM The number of AOM episodes experienced in th e last year was anal yzed according to CD14 genotype in 300 children who participated in a randomized cont rolled trial on the clinical efficacy of pneumococcal vaccines in prevention of AOM19. All children were between 1 and 7 years of age and had a hi story of 2 or more physician documented AOM episodes in the year before study entry. In the original study, half of the subjects received pneumococcal vaccines, whereas the other half was randomized to receive hepati tis A or B vaccinations. As it is assumed that Hepatitis vaccination has no signif icant impact on AOM recurrence, we prospectively analyzed the presence or ab sence of AOM recurrence according to CD14 genotype in the 161 subjects who received hepatitis vaccines during the 18 months follow-up period. Study population to investigate pneumococcal vaccine responses The association between the CD14 promoter polymorphism and the serotype specific conjugate followed by pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccinations was investigated in 71 children pa rticipating in two large vaccination trials investigating prevention of recurrence of otitis media by pneumococcal vaccinations in the Netherlands 19, 20. Given that the number of doses the number of doses of pneumococcal vaccine given was age-dependent and that serum IgE was associated with genotype we focused our vaccine response analysis on two groups of children who had received the same number of doses of pneumococcal vaccine and for wh om serum IgE levels were available. We acknowledge that the use of two similar cohorts may intr oduce heterogeneity, however we note that there were no significant di fferences in the general and non-vaccine immunological phenotypes between these two groups (data not shown), that they were both drawn from Dutch Caucasian populations and that we have previously shown that both groups of children display simila r antibody responses after vaccination 21. The first group consisted of 48 children, aged 2 to 7 years, with a history of 2 or more physician diagnosed episodes of acute otitis media in the previous 12 months, randomly 134 selected from the study population partic ipating in the randomized controlled vaccination study described above. These childr en received the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar polysaccharide vaccine 6 months later (Pneumune \u00ae, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA). The second group consisted of 23 children, aged 2 to 7 years, who had suffered from at least two prolonged (lasting 3 months or longe r) episodes of bilatera l otitis media with effusion, documented by an ENT specialist, and who were therefore referred for ventilation tube placement. These children we re also vaccinated with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine but with an interval of 4 months. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) consisted of polysaccharides from pneumoco ccal serotypes 4, 4 each conjugated individually to mutant toxin (CRM 197). The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) consisted of 25 g polysaccharides from each of the pneumoco ccal serotypes 1, by the particip ating hospitals' and in stitutions' ethics committees. Parental written informed consent was obtained for all subjects. DNA extraction and genotyping Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood collected at study entry using a QIAamp DNA Blood Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germ any). Patients were genotyped for the CD14 C-159T polymorphism using polymeras e chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme digestion with Ava II (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI), as described by Baldini and coworkers15. Measurement of pneumococcal serotype specific antibodies and immunoglobulins Blood samples for determination of pneumoc occal antibodies were obtained 4 weeks after the pneumococcal polysaccharide booster vaccination. Serum was separated and stored at 20\u00baC until analysis. Post vaccination IgG antibody levels to all PCV7 serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F were measured by ELISA as described 135 previously22. Minimal detection levels for th ese pneumococcal serotypes were 0.03, 0.09, 0.12, 0.61, 0.05, 0.11, and 0.08 g/ml, respectively. All se ra were pre-incubated overnight at 4\u00baC with pneumococcal cell wa ll polysaccharide (CPS) in for assay standardization24. Serum immunoglobulin levels (IgM, IgA, Ig G) and IgG subclasses were measured by rate nephelometry in sera obtained at enrollment of the study and stored at 20\u00baC until analysis. Total serum IgE levels were determined by ImmunoCAP\u00ae(Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Statistical methods To assess differences in general and immunological characteristics ANOVA (age, immunoglobulin breastfeeding, daycare attendance, smoking) and Kruskal-Wallis tests (siblings) were used. For retrospective analyses, children were categorized based on the number of AOM episodes in the year before study entry. Si nce having had 4 or more AOM episodes per year is defined as the otitis prone condition 18, children were classifi ed as those with 2-3 AOM episodes per year or those with more than 4 AOM episodes per year. For the prospective analyses the outcome measur e was the presence or absence of AOM recurrence. Chi-square analyses were em ployed to investigate differences between groups according to CD14 genotype in both re trospective and pros pective analyses. To test differences between antibody levels after pneumococcal vaccinations according to CD14 genotype, a general linear model with adjustments for age, gender, type of ear disease and log total IgE level was used. Add itionally, a model recessive for the C allele was employed, with adjustments as above. P- values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. SPSS 12.0.1 for windows (SPSS In c., Chicago, IL) was used for all analyses. 136 Results General characteristics and immunological data on the cohort with recurrent AOM are described in table I. There were no sta tistically significant differences across CD14 genotype for age or gender, serum IgM, IgA, IgG and IgG subclass levels, or environmental risk factors known to predis pose to recurrence of AOM. Notably, total serum IgE levels were significantly higher in CC and CT carriers compared with TT homozygotes (p=0.01) (Table 1).

Since innate immunity influe nces adaptive immune responses25, we investigated pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations according to CD14 genotype in a group of children with recurrent or prolonged OM. General characteristics and serum immunoglobulin levels of this study cohort according to genotype are shown in table 4. There were no significant differences in distribution of genotypes by age or gender and also total IgM, IgA, IgG and IgG subclass levels did not differ significantly according to genotype. As we have previous ly shown that both groups of children display similar antibody re sponses after vaccination 21, these groups were pooled for analysis of antibody responses. 139 Parameter Value of parameter for CT p-value* Age (95% CI) 4.2 (3.5-4.9) 4.5 (3.9-5.1) 4.1 (2.9-5.2) 0.7 Boys (%) 13 (68.4) 28 (71.8) 5 (38.5) 0.1 AOM (%) 14 (73.7) 26 (66.7) 8 (61.5) 0.8 IgM (g/l) 1.4 1.3 1.4 0.7 IgA (g/l) 1.0 1.1 0.8 0.6 IgG (g/l) 10.2 10.0 9.4 0.8 IgG 1 (g/l) 8.3 8.1 8.0 0.9 IgG 2 (g/l) 1.2 1.3 1.2 0.9 IgG 3 (g/l) 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.9 IgG 4 (g/l) 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.4 Table 4.

In children up to 24 months of age, TT homozygotes had fewer AOM episodes in prospective and retrospective analyses than did CC homozygotes. Importantly, TT homozygotes had higher specific IgG respons es to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes in a group of children with AOM and OME. The higher antibody levels in TT carriers s uggest a more vigorous adaptive immune response against S. pneumoniae, one of the main pathogens in AOM. This enhanced immune response may contribute to the re duced number of episodes of middle ear infections. That enhanced IgG antibody pr oduction may be related to the reduced middle ear infection frequency is supporte d by the findings that IgG anti-capsular antibodies after pneumococcal vaccinations protect against acute otitis media in infants 26, 27, and that otitis-prone patients have lower total IgG levels 28 as well as lower pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine responses7, 29-31. That CD14, as a pivotal molecule in innate immunity, plays a more prominent role in early life, is in accordance with a previous report of age dependent effects of the CD14 C159T polymorphism32. Polymorphisms in other innate immunity genes such as Mannan-binding Lectin (MBL) also have the highest impact early in life33, 34. The association of MBL polymorphism s with the risk of upper resp iratory tract infections in early childhood was greatest in children aged 6-17 months35. The finding of an age dependent effect of the genetic variation in innate immune molecules being most evident in early childhoo d is consistent with the prime importance of the innate immune system between 6 and 24 months of age. Du ring this period of development, maternally derived antibodies have waned and the adaptive immune system is immature, particularly with respect to polysaccharide antigen responses 3. Conversely, with subsequent maturation of adaptive immune responses, genetic variation in innate immune responses may be of lesser importan ce, and hence, associ ations with these variants may become less evident. Determining the mechanism by which CD14 influences the magnitude of pneumococcal specific antibody responses and the devel opment of otitis media would be of 142 considerable importance, but at present remains unclear. In preliminary experiments, however, we observed higher IL-6, TNF and IL-10 cytokine homozygote donors compared with cultures from CC homozygotes. Furthermore, the addition of recombinant sCD14 to PBMC cultures from CC donors resulted in leve ls of these cytokines comparable with those observed in TT homozygotes, suggesting sCD14 is positively associated with pro- inflammatory cytokine secretion (see addendum ). These findings are consistent with the pro-inflammatory role of sCD14 in bacter ial meningitis in mice, and with the finding that administration of recomb inant sCD14, concomitant with S. pneumoniae results in enhanced release of IL-6 and TNF36. The protective role of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in the innate immune defense against bacteria is well established37, and it is known that innate immune responses have a profound influence on the quality and intensity of the subsequent adaptive immune response25, 38, 39. Furthermore, an important role for these pro-inflammato ry cytokines, i.e IL-6, TNF to polysaccharide antigens, has been described32, 40-42. Therefore enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses in TT homozygotes upon natural exposure to AOM pathogens, secondary to increased sCD14 levels, might explain the observed lower otitis media frequency in these TT homozygote subjects. An additional finding from preliminary experime nts, which is in accord with previous reports 15, 43, 44, was lower total IgE levels in TT homozygotes, i.e. in the group of subjects with higher pneumococcal specific IgG levels. Our data suggests an inverse relationship between IgG and IgE levels according to CD14 genotype. The associations of genetic variation in CD14 with atopy43and that atopy may predispose to increased susceptibility to pneumococcal- or respiratory tract infections 45-47 and impaired pneumococcal vaccine responses48 further supports the impor tance of atopy to these outcomes. Environmental factors such as breast-feeding, number of siblings, day care attendance, and tobacco smoke exposure , which are known to contribute to the development of recurrent otitis media 49, were equally distribu ted across CD14 genotype in our current study so are not likely to expl ain our findings. Our data therefore suggests that the effect of the CD14 polymorphism is separate from and additional to these known environmental factors. A limitation of our study is that we investig ated the number of o titis episodes and antibody responses in overlappi ng, but not identical cohorts. Future research in other 143 cohorts, specifically in a larg e prospective birth cohort, is required to further investigate the impact of innate immunity pathways a ssociated with CD14 in relation to infection susceptibility and vaccine responses at vary ing ages. Our findings could conceivably be attributable to another polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with the studied polymorphism, but there are now several lin es of evidence to suggest that the polymorphism we studied is the most likely cause of our findings10. Since the CD14 promoter polymorphism may be associated w ith both the clinical course of recurrent AOM in young children and with antibody responses upon pneumococcal vaccination, further studies of additional components of this innate immune pathway, such as Myd8850, IRAK451, NEMO52, and IB53 are warranted. In conclusion, our data suggests genetic vari ation in CD14, a molecu le at the interface of innate and adaptive immune responses, plays a key role in the defense against middle ear disease in childhood and in determining pneumococcal vaccine responsiveness. These findings are likely to be important to these and other immune mediated outcomes in early life. 144 Addendum CD14 promoter polymorphism and IL-1 and IL-6 are the most important cytokines regulating the magnitude of the anti-polysaccharide antibody response.32 We therefore hypothesized that a difference in cytokine profile betw een CC and TT homozygotes could explain the observed difference in the number of otitis episodes and the IgG antibody response after pneumococcal conjugate and polysaccharide vaccination. To that end we analyzed cytokine profiles in supernatants of whole blood cultures of 5 CC and 5 TT homozygote adult donors. Higher le vels of IL-6, TNF and IL-10 in supernat ants of whole blood cultures of TT homozygotes were observed. Th is difference was seen after 18 hours of culture (Figure1A), and was even more pr onounced after 72 hours, with a significant difference in IL-6 levels (Figure 1B). Subsequently, we investigated if this associ ation is a direct effect of differences in sCD14 levels. The cytokine production in supernatants of in-vitro lymphocyte cultures of four CC adult donors, cultured with increasing amounts of recombinant sCD14, was studied (Figure 2A, B). The cytokine profile s in supernatants of lymphocytes cultured with high levels of sCD14 we re similar to those in TT homozygotes, i.e. there was a significant increase in in supernat ants of whole blood indicate SD) , IL-1, IL-6, TNF and cultures from CD14 -159CC (open bars) and CD14 -159TT (closed bars) homozygous adult donors afte r 18 hours (A) and 72 hours (B). IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-12p70, and IL-13were < 1pg/ml in all cases. P<0.05 was considered significant as indicated profiles in supernatants of CD14-159CC homozygous donors cultured for 18 (A) and 72 (B) hours with no added sCD14 (open bars), 4.2 ng/ ml sCD14 added (gray bars) and 104.2 ng/ml sCD14 added (closed bars). P<0.05 was considered significant as indicated with * 147 Acknowledgements The work described in this paper was financially supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research an d Development ZonMW (grant numbers 002828480 and 90461092), the Netherlands Health Insurance Company Zilveren Kruis- Achmea, an Australia-Europe Scholarship 2004 funded by the Australian Government through the Department of Education, Scien ce and Training and promoted by AEI, the Australian Government International Education Network, and the Ter Meulen Fund, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Gender-specific genetic effect s have been demonstrated on many phenotypes, however, their influence on vacc ine response is unknown. Objectives: To investigate gender-specific effects of cytokine gene polymorphisms on vaccine response. Method: In 263 2 year-old subjec ts selected for parental hist ory of atopy, we investigated gene-gender interaction eff ects and tetanus toxoids (TetTox) using a likelihood-ratio te st and comparing an unrestricted (with interaction) and a restricted (without interaction) model. In teractions identified were explored by stratification for gender. Findings: For TetTox responses, an interacti on p value C-589T wa s p=0.10. After stratification, we found associations with alleles associated with atopy. Boys with IL-4 of and TetTox (p=0.018) responses compared with AA homozygotes. Overall, the most consistent pattern was a reduction in TetTox re sponses in girls with genotypes associated with atopy. Conclusion: Our findings support the interaction of primary ge netic and modifying factors on vaccine responses, the importance of atopic genetics to vaccine responses and investigation for gender-specific eff ects in genetic association studies. 153 Introduction Childhood vaccine1 responses are highly heritable and polymorphisms in cytokine genes have been associated with these responses 2, 3. However, genetic variants modulating vaccine responses do not operate independently of other inherited and non-genetic factors2. That gender may be one such factor is supported by: (1) The associ ation of gender with vaccine responses4-8, adverse effects of vaccination9 and cytokine levels10. (2) Gender's influences on gene expression at X-chromosome and autosomal loci11-14. (3) Gender- specific effects of HLA allele s on antibody responses to diph theria and measles vaccine 15 and of a cytokine genes on atopic16-19 and non-atopic20-22 phenotypes. We selected cytokine genes associated with atopy as they have been linked to altered vaccine responses2, 23 with the quality of these genetic associations being modified by non-genetic variables2. Additionally, considering that flexibility of cytokine gene expression may be greater earlier in development 24, relationships between gender, cyt okine genes and vaccine responses would be optimally analysed in early childhood. Therefore, in this study, we investigated a cohort of 2 year olds, selected by parental history of atopy, to determine whether gender- specific effects on vaccine responses to dipht heria and tetanus toxoids were related to polymorphisms in cytokine genes associated with atopy.154 Methods Population Sera and extracted DNA were available on a 202 children aged 2 year s, born between July 1996 and July 1998, from a previously described Western Australian bi rth cohort recruited on the basis of parental history of atopy25. Parental smoking (PS) was defined by parental report, at 2 year-old questionna ires, of current cigarette smoki ng by either or both parents. Vaccines and Vaccination Schedules At ages 2, 4, and 6 months, the subjects received DTPa (acellular pertussis) (Infanrix; GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) or DTPw (Polio Sabin ; (MMRII; Merck, Sharp & Dohme or Priorix; GSK) was administered at age 12 months. At 18 months, a further dose of DTPa or DTPw and Hib vaccination was given. The last DTP vaccine prior to blood collection was DTPa in 44\u00b75% of individuals. Three percent of individuals never received whole cel l DTPw prior to blood collection. Measurement of vaccine specific antibody concentrations Blood samples were obtained at 2 years of age (mean: 2 years 15 days, range: 1year 335 days to 2 years 35 days) and serum was isolated and stored at -200C. The levels of anti- diphtheria and anti-tetanus IgG were measur ed by ELISA. No diphtheria antibody vaccine response was less than 0.01 IU/ml, the gene rally accepted minimum level giving some degree of protection26, and 1.4% of tetanus an tibody levels were belo w the protective level of 0.15 IU/ml27. Genotyping Genotyping automated (Varian Helix- System\u00ae) using the method developed by Oefner and Underhill28. IL-10 A-592C (rs 1800872) and IL-12 A1118C SNP were geno typed as previously described16, 31. Statistics Vaccine responses were skewed and therefor e were log transformed to approximate a normal distribution, as previously described 32. To accommodate the negative correlation between antibody response and the time interv al of last vaccine dose and blood sampling, linear regression was applied to derive residual values, co rrected for the interval. The adjusted levels of antibody response were cal culated with means of log values of the antibody response plus the corres ponding residual values, and were used for the further analysis. Given the low genera l frequency of alleles previously associated with atopy, models dominant for th ction between genes and gender on the vaccine outcomes was investigated usi ng a likelihood-ratio te st and comparing an unrestricted (with interaction) and a restricted model (without interaction). Subsequently, interactions were explored by stratification for gender. A p-va lue of <0\u00b705 was considered significant. No adjustments were made for multi ple testing in investigations were based on an a priori hypothesis and we have described all tests performed34, 35.Interactions were investigated using Inercooled Stata version 9.0, all other analyses were performed using SPSS version 11\u00b75.156 Results Genotypic and Phenotypic effects Genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibriu m and genotype frequencies were similar to previous reports, see table 1. Genotypic e ffects of the polymorphisms in IL-4, IL-4R and IL-13 have been described previously2. The only significant association was between the IL-4 -589 CT/TT genotypes and increased di phtheria toxoid res ponses (p=0.049). The additional genotypes investigated in this study showed no association with vaccine responses. Gender was not associated with vaccine response, see table 2.

Geometric Mean (GM) IgG to diphthe ria and tetanus toxoids categorised by gender Interaction effects Comparison of the unrestricted and the restri cted model was used to investigate the interaction between genes and gender on vaccine responses. Given our sample size we selected a p-value of <0.15 as a cut-off for further analyses. For tetanus toxoid response, the following four SNPs had a p value < 0.15 for the interaction, namely IL-4 C-589T interaction term for IL4 C-589T SNP was p=0.10, the p- values for the remainder of the inte raction terms were greater than 0.15. Genotypic effects after stratification by gender We further investigated the effect of th e four SNPs identified above on the antibody responses stratified by gender, see table 3. In boys there was a significant difference (p=0.011) in levels of diphtheria toxoid res ponses, individuals with IL-4 -589T alleles (CT/TT), previously associated with atopy, had increased responses compared with CC homozygotes, with no difference found in girl s. The same pattern was found for tetanus toxoid responses (p=0.042), Figure 1. Additionally, for the IL-4R I50V SNP boys with genotypes with a V allele (IV/VV), previously associated with atopy, had higher levels of diphtheria (p=0.039) and tetanus toxoid (p=0.077) responses compared with II homozygotes. In contrast, girls with IL10 A-592C with genotypes containing an allele previously associated with atopy (AC/CC) ha d significantly lower levels of diphtheria (p=0.028) and tetanus (p=0.018) toxoid res ponses compared with AA homozygotes.

Significant differences remained for the above associ ations of IL-4C-589T and IL-10 for the with increased diphtheria and tetanus toxoid respons es; however, the results were not significant (p=0.068 and p=0.087, respectively). Sample size precluded stratification by PS within gender-genotype groups. 161 Discussion This is the first study to demonstrate gender-dep endent effects of cytokine genes on vaccine responses and these findings are consistent w ith gender-dependent e ffects of HLA genes on diphtheria toxoid responses15. We demonstrated an increased antibody response in males and a decreased antibody response in female s with genotypes associated with atopy. The effects reported herein are independent of th e previously reported gene-parental smoking (PS) interaction2; further support the interaction of pr imary genetic and modifying factors on vaccine responses and enhance the understa nding of the role of genetic factors associated with atopy upon vaccine response. Taker together our findings show an increas e in vaccine antibody response in boys with genotypes previously associated with atopy and a reduction in these responses in girls with these genotypes. This apparent dichotomy of effect has previously been shown for the IL- 4R I50V polymorphism 17. A gender differential in gene transcription is shared by many phyla 36 and this divergence is necessary as ma les and females use a similar genome to achieve distinct phenotypes. This results in di fferent selective pressures between males and females; with a genetic variant producing a slight advantage in males not doing so in females or vice versa36 . The reproductive tissues are the most sexually dimorphic tissues in most mammals and gene-ontol ogy analysis identified func tional gene classifications differentially expressed between male and fe male gonads, notably, immune response genes were among these subsets37. However, gender-biased differen ces in gene transcription are not limited to the gonads11-14, 38, 39 and may particularly occur in tissues with multifarious physiological roles 37, and therefore could involve tissues of the immune system. The influence of gender on the pathogen esis and expression of many diseases 40, 41, including atopic42 and inflammatory diseases, has been reported. The mechanisms underlying these differences are debated, however , gender-dependent differences in disease incidence and progression are thought to be due, at least in part, to the influence of sex hormones and their effect on gene expression 36. Accordingly, sex steroids influence T cell populations, specific antibody production and proinflammatory mediators43. However, human sex-biased gene transc ription may limited to hormone-dependent effects as hormone-independent sex-specific transcriptio nal regulation has b een shown in mammals39 162 and gender-dependent genetic effects may be seen prior to the pubertal hormonal surge. Evidence in humans to support gender-depende nt genetic effects includes differences in non-immune response gene expres sion in prepubertal children44 and gender-dependent effects of polymorphisms immune response including IL-10 20,21 on atopic19, 45-47 and non-atopic peripubertal16 and postpubertal individuals18-22, 46, 47. Gender-dependent effects of IL- 10 promoter polymorphisms include the association of the -592A allele, as part of a haplotype, with increased IgE in male asthmatics18, the -592A -lactam allergy in atopic women17, the -1082G allele with longevity in men, but not in women21, and with lower numbers of CD8 positive T cells in old men, but not old women49. Furthermore, in twin studi es of IL-10 production, female gender was associated with impaired responses50. IL-4R I50 has been reported to be associated with predisposition to and protection from -lactam allergy in atopic women and non-atopic men, respectively17. Additionally in animal studies, gender is a major determinant of immune response to infection, with disease severity proportional to local expression of IL-4 and IL-1051. These observations support the biological plausibility of the findings in this study, however, the clinical implications of our findings are unknown as the vast majority of antibody responses were above generally accepted minimum levels of protection for diphtheria and tetanus infection. However, no antibody level may confer absolute protection26 and understanding the mechanisms underlying these observations may ultimately result in improved vaccine efficacy. Epigenetic mechanisms have been propos ed to modulate gender-dependent genetic effects42. In this context it is noteworthy that methylation of CpG dinucleotides, a key epigenetic phenomenon regulating cytokine gene transcription (reviewed in52 ), has been shown to have a gender-differential53. Notably, promoters are enriched for CpG dinucleotides54 and the majority of reports of gende r-dependent genotype effects have been found in association with promoter polymorphisms18-22, 46, 47. Methylation is also integral to the prototypical gender-specific ge netic process of X-inactivation55. Interestingly, X- inactivation is an example of monoallelic exclusion i.e. the process of expressing only one of two alleles of a gene and monoallelic expression has been implicated in regulation of immune genes including cytokine genes56, 57. Therefore, it is possi ble that gender may exert its effects through epigenetic influences and may be mediated through the mechanisms including methylation a nd monoallelic exclusion. 163 Neonatal tetanus is a major killer of newbor ns in developing count ries; WHO estimated that approximately 400 000 cases occur annually58. Maternal passive immunisation is protective for neonatal tetanus, th erefore, if the reduction in tetanus vaccine responses in girls with genotypes previously associated w ith atopy compared to the remaining genotypes seen in this study persisted into childbearing years then infant s of these mothers may be at particular risk. The risk to th ese particular infants, if they are exposed to PS, may be compounded by the demonstrated negative inte raction of atopic genotypes with PS on vaccine responses. These potential negative im pacts might be disproportionately felt in developing countries given the frequency of some of the ge notypes associated with lower responses to tetanus toxoids in females have been reported to be more common in developing countries59, 60. This study has several limitations including : (1) without a healt hy control group it is uncertain whether the demonstrated associations are specific to, or independent of, a high genetic risk of atopy. (2) No corrections were made for multiple testing. We elected not to make such corrections because (i) they can be overly conservative and may inflate type II errors and (ii) our analyses we re based on an a priori hypothesis 34. Instead, we have chosen to describe all statistical anal yses carried out and to discus s the results. We agree with Rothman35 that there is little to be gained by adjustment, provided that all analyses are described when the study is reported and there is a lot to be lost if anything other than the results of all hypothesis tests ar e reported. (3) Sample size precluded detailed investigation of the interaction of exposures with gender-dependent ge netic effects. In conclusion, gender-genotype in teractions may influence vacci ne response, and failure to consider this may have contributed to underreporting of these interactions, as many genetic association studies have contro lled for gender rather than inve stigated its impact on genetic effects. Ultimately, understanding gender-sp ecific genetic effects may yield improved vaccine responses and reduce the gl obal infectious disease burden. 164 References 1.

The study also explored the interactions of these genetic variants with environmental factors, and the findings were extended to inve stigate associations with mi ddle ear disease. Importantly, failure to account for the nexus of genetic effects and non-genetic influences, within a developmental context, would have discount ed the importance of the each of these variables. In Chapter 2, the findings are described on associations of genetic polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their associat ion with atopy, in IL-4, IL-4R and IL-13 with lower pneumococcal vaccine responses. This supported the importance of sequence variations in these genes, and atopy per se, to modulation of pneumococcal vaccine responses. For the first time, this study found that additive genetic effects of polymorphisms within a biological pathway influenced vaccine respons es, reinforcing the importance of a systems approach to biological investig ations. The postulate was assessed that the influence of genetic polymorphisms would be dependent on the microenvironmental milieu and suggested, on the basis of a reported gene-env ironment interaction of a polymorphism in the IL-4R gene, that gene-environment interacti ons would modify vaccine responses. In Chapter 3, a mechanism by which environm ental factors can unmask the impact of genetic sequence variants on vaccine responses is described for the first time. Individuals with atopic alleles a nd exposed to parental smoking (PS) had impaired humoral and cell- mediated responses to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, this associ ation was not found in those unexposed to PS. This interaction was most significant with the IL-4R Q576R polymorphism and supported previous intera ction effects demonstrated with this 168 polymorphism. Furthermore, th is interaction of PS and ge netic status was found in non- vaccine immune responses, including those repr esentative of the innate immune system. This variation in genetic effect without an associated change in DNA sequence supported the concept that this was due to epigenetic influences on genes involved with vaccine responses. As the frequency of alleles associ ated with impaired responses in PS exposed individuals and the exte nt of cigarette smoking have both be en reported to be increased in populations in developing count ries, compared with developed nations, confirmation of these findings outside this sel ected population would have si gnificant implications for the health of people in developing countries. Th e association of the IL-4 -589T polymorphism with increased humoral responses to diphtheri a vaccine paralleled the known dynamics of the maturation of vaccine responses in atopic individuals. This relationship was inverted by PS exposure suggesting that PS might disrupt the ontogeny of the immune response in those with atopic genotypes. Environmentally and temporally mediated associations of th e alternate alleles of a SNP with the same phenotype have been described previously 1 and do not negate biological plausibility. The association of the IL-4 C-589 a llele with increased responses to diphtheria toxoid with the apparently cont rasting association of the IL-4 C-589 T allele with increased pneumococcal vaccine responses in unstratified analyses is noted. These findings might be a consequence of 1. The differing ages of the children with respect to the ontogeny of the immune response (less than 2 years of age versus 2 year olds), 2 . Divergent mechanisms of response to polysaccharide-conjugate and prot ein based vaccines, 3. Be secondary to differential population ascertainment (middle ear disease versus atopy) or 4. Might reflect as yet unstudied environmental influences; cohort limitations pr ecluded meaningful analysis of the smoke exposure in the middle ear disease populations. In Chapter 4, investigations on the ant ecedents of childhood vaccine responses are described. The study demonstrated that atopic genotypes and haplotype s were associated with generalised reductions of Th1 and T h2 cytokine responses in cord blood. This impairment was most significant for IL-10 a nd suggested that atopic genotypes might perturb immune regulatory mechanisms. The responses were further reduced by the superimposition of PS on the background of susceptible IL-13 genotypes, and this finding was concordant with known interactions of IL-13 genotypes and smoking and supported 169 the suggestion that PS and atopic genotypes mi ght act in concert to influence immune system ontogeny. This might have broad implic ations for diseases with atopic and/or inflammatory components. In Chapter 5, the investigation is described of a cohort selected fo r middle ear disease for the effect of the CD14 -159T polymorphism, a molecule at the interface of innate and adaptive immune responses, on phenotypes with known associations with atopy, pneumococcal vaccine responses and middl e ear disease frequency. The study found impaired vaccine responses and a predisposition to otitis media in thos e with an allele of CD-14 previously associated with atopy. Pre liminary experiments suggested that increased sCD-14 levels might mediate thes e effects. Age-dependent e ffects of this polymorphism on the frequency of episodes of otitis media were found, with the association being greatest in children less than 2 years of age. This finding was consistent with re ports of age-dependent genetic effects of this polymorphism and th e impact of another innate immunity gene, mannose-binding lectin, in early life, and supporte d the need to assess genetic associations within a developmental context. This study's fi ndings extended the association of genetic polymorphisms in immune response genes to vaccine responses outside of a population selected on the basis of atopy, as this inve stigation involved a cohort with middle ear disease. In Chapter 6, the extension of the analysis of the genetic interactions to the assessment of gender-dependent genetic effect s on vaccine responses is described. An association was found between the IL-10 -592C polymorphism and impaired humoral vaccine responses to tetanus toxoid in girls. This finding was inde pendent of the interaction of PS and genotype and was consistent with reported gender-dependent genetic associations of IL-10 promoter polymorphisms with other phenotypes. Should this relationship persist into adulthood, and given the previously described population differences in allele frequency, it could have implications for neonatal tetanus, as passive immunisation is an important protective factor. Additionally, the study demonstrated opposing e ffects of the IL-4 C-589T polymorphism in males compared with females, supporting the concept that genetic variation can have opposite effects between genders. Furthermore, the variation in effect of the same allele reinforces the concept of epigenetic influen ces in vaccination respons e. Promoters are key 170 sites of epigenetic processes, including methylation, and could explain why the majority of gender-dependent genetic a ssociations were found with promoter polymorphisms. Within the appendices are two papers the auth or contributed to duri ng the tenure of this thesis. The first describes a novel polymorphism, IL4R Ala57Thr, which was common in an isolated Arctic population, but almost non-existent in other populations. Studying the association between th is polymorphism and populations w ith similar genetic backgrounds but residing in divergent environments provided a unique method of assessing the role of the environment. There was evidence that this polymorphism might be protective for atopy. Its population-specificity highlighted the need for screen ing for unique sequence variants within candidate genes in multiple populations , and the high frequency of the Thr57 allele in the Inuits suggested that it became fixe d through natural selec tion. The second paper described the differences in magnitude and dire ction of associations of genes associated with atopy ( and ADRB2 Arg16Gly) and atopic outcomes between Inuits living in contrasting environments. A change from a traditional Arctic lifestyle to a wealthy Western environment could lead to loss ( SCGB1A1 A38G and rhinitis), gain and reversal ( ADRB2 Arg16Gly and lung function) of a potential genetic susceptibility to disease. These findings were consistent with known environment-dependent associations with the CD-14 C-159T polymorphism. Taken together, the study's findings: 1) suppor ted the importance of atopy and its genetic predispositions to vaccine responses and other phenotypes; 2) reinforced the need for joint consideration of genetic and non- genetic factors in genetic asso ciation studies; 3) supported assessment of genetic factors within a developm ental context; 4) suggested that epigenetic mechanisms were important to regulation of vaccine responses and; 5) provided evidence that the combination of genetic and envi ronmental factors may act in concert to disproportionately impair vaccine re sponses in developing countries. There are a number of key areas for furthe r study. Further experiments are planned to investigate the associations of the studied a nd other genes associated with atopy in multiple cohorts, including unselected populations. Additionally, other gene-environment interactions, including the inte raction of microbial load, su ch as bacterial endotoxin, and ubiquitous toxins, including air pollutants wi th genes associated with atopy should be 171 sought. It is important to investigate th ese factors in developing countries, where the burden of infectious diseases is greatest. Nota bly, studies of measles vaccine responses are a priority, as measles is a lead ing cause of infectious disease in some of these countries. To this end, preparations are underway to expl ore genetic influences on measles vaccine failure in an extensively phenotyped African population collected around the time of a measles outbreak. Ideally, longitudinal assessmen t of populations would al low for investigation of developmental genetic phenomena. Accordingl y, studies are underway to assess genetic influences on diphtheria, tetanus and measles vaccine responses at 5 years of age in the studied cohort and further e xperiments are planned to inve stigate later time points. Optimally, a prospective, unselected longit udinal cohort with extensive, objectively measured prenatal and postnatal outcome and exposure variables coul d be ascertained and investigated. The development of population base d data linkage systems, as is occurring in Western Australia, may facilitate novel approach es to the investigati on of such a cohort. To supplement the candidate gene approach to vaccine respon se regulation, the search for further genetic modifiers of vaccine respons e could be extended using a whole genome scan using a case (\"low-responder\")-control (\"high- responder\") design. Areas linkage could be microarray, posit ional candidates could be sequenced and tagSNPs identified. Subsequently, associations between these tagSNPs could be sort in further populations. Finally, investigations of potential epigenet ic mechanisms regulating vaccine reponses are warranted. ChIP-on-chip technologies could be used to explore th e potential role of chromatin modification in vaccine response regulation in a genome wide manner, and individual experiments could target specific epigenetic interactions. In conclusion, enhanced understanding of ge netic and non-genetic factors and their nexus may result in improved use of existing vacci nes, the development of novel efficacious vaccines and provide insights into other phenotypes with an immunological component. 172 APPENDICES 173 173 APPENDIX 1 ASSOCIATIONS 2, Rhona 3, Nicholas de Klerk 4, Giovanni Rossi5, Isabel Hagel6, Maria Di Prisco6, Neil Lynch6, John Britton7, Hall7, Arthur Musk8, Jack Goldblatt 3, Peter Le Sou\u00ebf 1, The Greenlandic Population Study Group*. 1 School of Paediatrics and Child Health, Univer sity of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. 2Respiratory Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Copenhagen, H:S Bispebjerg Hospital, Denmark. 3Genetic Services of Western Australia, Prin cess Margaret Hospital, Perth, Australia. 4Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research.

In Inuits, the polym orphisms were evaluated for associations with atopy, rhinitis, asthma and pulmonary function. Results: Thr57 was in tight li nkage with Ile50 (D' = 1, r 2 = 0.13) and was common (33%) in the Inuits, but rare (< 0.6%) in all other populations. In Inuits living in Denmark, Thr57 (in a dose-dependent manner) and the Ile50/Thr57 haplotype were associated with lower risk of atopy (p linear = 0.003, p = 0.034, respectively), atopic rhinitis (p linear = 0.012, p = 0.021) and atopic asthma (p linear = 0.02, p = 0.03). In Inuits living in Greenland, Thr57 was not associated with atopy or atopic diseases, but Ile50 was weakly associated with lo wer risk of developing atopy. Conclusion: A novel IL4R polymorphism, Ala57Thr, was co mmon in Inuits and rare or absent in other populations , and Thr57 was associated with a lower risk of atopy in Greenlander Inuits living in Denmark. This finding suggests that a full investigation of a gene by environment relationship can only be achieved if each gene is screened for novel polymorphisms in each new population studied. 175 Introduction Atopy is characterised by elevated IgE production in response to common allergens and is strongly associated with asthma and rh initis. Although the environment plays an important role in the development of atopy and allergic diseases, interactions with genetic factors are likely to underlie dis ease aetiology. The identification of these genetic factors is complicated by the heterogenous nature of th e condition, as well as the probability of low, and age-related, penetrance of multiple interacting genes. 1, 2 Genome-wide screens, linkage and associ ation studies have implicated several chromosomal regions and potential candida te genes that may be involved in the pathogenesis of atopy.3-8 One of these candidates is the gene coding for the alpha chain of the IL-4 receptor ( IL4R ).4, 9 The IL-4 receptor is a complex transmembrane receptor composed of two subunits: the 140-kD high-affinity chain; and the common chain, which is shared by several interleukin receptors,10 and modifies signalling of the chain.11 The IL-4R subunit is shared by the receptors of IL-4 and IL-13, which are both important pleiotropic TH2 cytokines that share many functions, including mediating isotype switching to IgE synthesis. The IL4R gene is therefore an ideal candidate for atopy susceptibility because of its crucial role in allergic inflammation through its function in IL-4 and IL-13 signalling. Additionally, the gene is located on ch romosome 16p12.1-p11.2, which is a region that has been linked to atopy and enhanced IgE responsiveness.3-5 Twelve non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the coding region of the gene (NCBI SNP website), and many of thes e have been associated with asthma and related atopic phenotypes,12-15 either individually or in combination. Of these SNPs, only two, Val106Gly and Ile50Val, are in the extracellular domain of the receptor (amino acids numbered from the beginning of the mature protein). Val106Gly (NCBI SNP website) has no reported associations thus far whereas Ile50Val has been studied extensively and has been associated with IgE levels and atopic asthma.13, 16 As for all other known polymorphisms associated with atopy or asthma, the Ile50Val associations have not been replicated in other populations.17, 18 In haplotype studies, Ile50Val, together with Gln551Arg and Ser478Pro, has been associated with atopic asthma,19, 20 and total IgE levels and asthma,21 respectively. The Ile50Val polymorphism has also 176 been shown to alter receptor function in cellular assays, either in isolation,13 or in combination with Gln551Arg.19 A study of South Dakota Hutterites and several outbred populations, showed that alleles, or haplotypes, showing the strongest associations differed significantly in ethnically diverse populations.9 These data suggested either the existen ce of yet to be identified di sease-susceptibility mutations outside the IL4R gene coding region, or that diffe rent risk-conferring haplotypes were population specific. During a routine screening of the IL4R gene, we identified a novel SNP, Ala57Thr, that changes the amino acid sequence of the extracellular domain of the receptor. The SNP is a G A substitution 21 bases downstream from Ile50Val, and was found in high frequency in Greenlander Inuit populations. Given the proximity of this SNP to Ile50Val and the central role played by IL4R in atopy and asthma, we hypothesised that this variant would be a ssociated with atopy and its re lated diseases. This paper describes the results of an investigation on the association of Ala57Thr and Ile50Val, analysed in isolation and in combination, w ith atopy and other atopic diseases in two Inuit populations, living in e ither Denmark or Greenland. In order to assess whether this SNP was population specific, cohorts from diverse ethnic and geographical backgrounds were genotyped for Ala57Thr. 177 Methods Study Populations Inuits from Greenland The Inuits are indigenous to Greenland and ar e related to the Inuits of Canada, Alaska and Siberia. Inuits make up approxima tely 90% of Greenland's population of 56,000 and an additional 8,000 Inuits live in Denmark. Inuits from Denmark In Denmark, first generation Greenland I nuit immigrants aged between 18-60 years were identified, randomly selected and sent a health questionnaire. In this study, Inuit ethnicity was defined by se lf-identification or by having at least one Inuit parent. Between 1997 and 2001, data were collected from adult Inuits living in Denmark and Greenland. 9, 22, 23 In Greenland, Inuits were recruited from Nuuk (the capital city), Qasigiannguit (a town) and f our remote settlements in Uummannaq. In total, 3327 Inuits from Denmark and Greenland were invited to participate in the study, and information was obtained from 2046 (61%) of these. The participation rate was 54% in Denmark and 66% in Greenland.23 This study was approved by the appropriate local ethics committees in Denmark and Greenland and Prin cess Margaret Hospital in Perth, Australia. All participants had been given oral and written information, and had given their informed written consent before enrolment. Seven other populations In order to determine if the new IL4R SNP, Ala57Thr, was population-specific, cohorts from diverse ethnic and geographica l background were genotyped. Participants from these populations were recruited previ ously for other studies, and were selected without regard to their level of health or disease status, unless otherwise stated. The populations included: (1) 386 Danes recruited in a pr ospective study of asthma and allergy in Copenhagen, Denmark;24 (2) 91 Italians from the National Blood Bank of Italy in Genoa; (3) 117 Warao Amerindian s from a community living in the Orinoco River Delta, Venezuela;25 (4) 160 Coche Islanders of mixed ancestry (European, Amerindian, and African) recruited from the island off the coast of Venezuela;26 (5) 159 Ethiopians drawn from a case-control study of asthma in Jimma, Ethiopia;27 (6) 237 Indigenous Australians recruite d from an isolated coastal community in the Kimberley 178 region North-West of Western Australia;28 (7) 179 Australian children of European ancestry recruited as a birth coho rt from Perth, We stern Australia.29 Approval for all participants from thes e cohorts had been given for population polymorphism studies from each of the local ethics committees and from the Ethics Committee of Princess Margaret Hospital for Children. Phenotypic Data (Inuits only) All subjects were clinically examined and completed a general health questionnaire, focussing on features of atopy and respirat ory symptoms. The questionnaire was initially written in Danish, and then translat ed into Greenlandic a nd re-translated back into Danish to ensure that the initial m eaning of the questions was maintained. In Denmark, study subjects were given the choice of either language version of the questionnaire, whereas in Greenland, only the Greenlandic version was used. Atopy Subjects were considered atopic if skin test reactivity was present for at least one of the ten aeroallergens tested. The allergens, tested in duplicate according to the EAACI guidelines, 30 were birch, Timothy grass, mugwort, horse, dog, cat, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus herbarum . test reactivity was considered present if the mean wheal size was at least 3 mm in diameter. Rhinitis, asthma and lung function A general health questionnair e adapted from the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Children (ISAAC) 31 was designed with particular interest in respiratory symptoms. The question \"When not having a co ld, have you ever experienced having - itchy eyes, sneezing, a runny nose, a blocked nose or a diminished sense of smell?\" was used to define rhinitis. Questions on as thma-like symptoms su ch as wheezing, cough on exertion and the use of asthma medicati on were used, together with self-reported asthma and doctor diagnosed asthma, in order to define asthma. Each of the groups with asthma and rhinitis were stratified in to atopic or non-atopic sub-groups based on the results on the skin tests. Lung functi on measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC ), as well as bronchial hyper- responsiveness to histamine measured as dos e response slope (DRS), were assessed as previously described. 22 179 Genotyping Analysis IL4R Ala57Thr All samples were genotyped using DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes.32 Subjects were genotyped by the restriction fragment length 3' (forward) 5' GTT ATC CGC ACT GAC CAC G 3' (reverse). Following amplification, 5 \u00b5L of amplicon was digested with 1 U Bst U I and 1 \u00b5L of the manufacturer's Buffer 2 (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) in a 10 \u00b5L reaction at 60 \u00b0C for 3 h. B stU I digests the PCR product only when the Ala allele is present. When digested, the amplicons with this allele result in 225 and 50 bp fragments which were fracti oned on 2% agarose gel. IL4R Ile50Val Genotyping was using the met hod developed by Oefner and Underhill33 on an automated dHPLC system by Varian (Varian Helix-System AG to avoid amplifying the SNP at position 57. PCR am plicons were then denatured at 95 \u00b0C for 4 min and slowly cooled, at 5\u00b0C-intervals, to 60\u00b0 C, holding for 4 min at each temperature. Five \u00b5L of each sample was injected to a pre-heated ion-paired reversed-phase column (Helix Analysis Column, 3.0 X 55 mm; Vari an, Walnut Creek, CA , USA) and eluted from the column using a linea r acetonitrile gradient at a constant flow rate of 0.45 mL/min. The optimal oven temperature in resolving the 3 genotypes was 65 \u00b0C. The genotyping results for both SNPs were confirmed by sequencing a random subset of samples ABI Prism BigDye Termin ator Kit v3.1. (Applied Biosystems, Foster Haplotypes for the Ile50V al and Ala57Thr SNPs were inferred by using the Bayesian statistical based program PHASE.34 Statistical Analysis Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for each of the SNPs was calculated by means of 2 goodness-of-fit tests. Linkage disequilibrium between the two loci was assessed by calculating Lewontin's D'35 as well as r2. All association analyses were done with logistic or linear regression for binary or linear outcome variables, respectively. Regression models were corrected for age, sex, ethnicity, place of recruitment (in 180 Greenland), smoking status and passive sm oking (for rhinitis and lung function parameters) and height (for lung function parameters). The doubling of sample size in analyses involving haplotypes was corrected for by using robust variance estimates to allow for the duplication of the other within -person covariates. All calculations were performed with the SPSS v11.0 statistical p ackage except for the robust estimates, which were estimated with STATA. 181 Results Population characteristics and genotype , allele and haplotype frequencies Of the 1946 Inuits genotyped for the two IL4R polymorphisms, 1295 were living in Greenland and 651 in Denmark. The dem ographic characteristics of these 2 populations are summarized in Table 1. Th ere were fewer men among the study cohort in Denmark compared with that in Greenla nd (p < 0.001), while there were more Inuits reporting full Inuit ancestry among the cohor t in Greenland (p < 0.001). Smoking status differed slightly between the two study cohor ts (p = 0.064). Prevalence of atopy and rhinitis were significantly different betw een the populations as were lung function parameters of FEV1 % predicted, FEV1/FVC and dose response slope (DRS) (Table 1).

Demographic characteristics of the I nuit study populations in Greenland and Denmark (Note: Total numbers for each phenotype may not add up to 1295 in Greenland and 651 in Denmark because of missing phenotypic data.) 182 Genotype frequencies of the IL4R SNPs were determined for the two Inuit populations (Table 2). The allele frequencies we re 0.82 and 0.72 for Ile50, and 0.35 and 0.26 for Thr57, in Greenland and in Denmark, respectiv ely. The genotype and allele frequencies for both SNPs were significantly different between the two In uit populations (p < 0.0001). All allele frequencies were in Har dy-Weinberg equilibrium when assessed by 2 analysis except for Ile50Val in Greenland (p = 0.03). The two SNPs are in linkage (D' = 1.0, r2 = 0.13) with only three haplotypes pr esent (Table 2). The Val50/Thr57 haplotype is absent from these populations, indicating that the new Thr57 has occurred in linkage with the Ile50 allele. Hence, haplotype frequencies for allele freque ncies for Thr57. The frequenc ies for the haplotypes from both populations differed si gnificantly (p < 0.0001). Greenland Denmark p IL4R N (%) Ile50Val Ile/Ile Ile/Val Val/Val 878 (67.8) 359 (27.7) 58 (4.5) (41.6) 47 (7.2) < 0.0001 Ala57Thr Ala/Ala Ala/Thr Thr/Thr 542 (41.9) 588 (45.4) 165 (39.8) 43 (6.6) < 0.0001 Ile50Val/Ala57Thr Ile50/Thr57 Ile50/Ala57 Val50/Ala57 918 (35.4) 1197 (46.2) 345 (26.5) 592 (45.5) 365 (28.0) < 0.0001 Table 2. Genotype and haplotype frequencies for the IL4R SNPs in Inuits living in Greenland and Denmark The Thr57 allele was found in very low fr equencies in all non-Inuit populations. No individuals homozygous for the Thr57 allele were found in any of the seven non-Inuit populations. Only 4 Ala57/Thr57 com pound heterozygote individuals were found amongst the Danes, one amongst the indige nous Australians and one amongst the European Australians. The novel allele was absent in Italians, Warao Indians, Coche Islanders and Ethiopians. 183 Association studies All association analyses were done separa tely for the two Inuit populations as the prevalence of the phenotypes were significantly different. All regression analyses for the Ile50Val and Thr57Ala SNPs were done using as baseline ge notypes, Val50/Val50 and Ala57/Ala57, respectively. The Val50/Ala5 7 haplotype was used as baseline for all haplotype analyses. Denmark Atopy Analysis of the IL4R Th57Ala polymorphism suggested that the Thr57 allele was associated with a protective dose effect against atopy (linear p = 0.003) and, consistent with this, the only haplotype associated w ith protection against atopy was Ile50/Thr57 (OR = 0.63; p = 0.034) (Table 3, Figure 1). There was a trend for Thr57 homozygotes to be associated with protection agains t atopy (OR = 0.42; p = 0.095) and similarly, individuals with Ala57/Thr57 genotype we re also protected (OR = 0.52; p = 0.005). IL4R Ile50Val was not associated with at opy (Table 3, Figure 1). Severity of atopy (log total wheal sizes and log number of positive skin test reactivity, excluding non- atopics) was not associated with either of the IL4R polymorphisms. In order to assess the effect of the Thr57 allele, indepe ndent of the SNP at position 50, the Ile50Val genotype was added as a c onfounder in the regression analysis. The association with atopy remained (Thr57/Th r57: OR = 0.416, p = 0.098; Thr57/Ala57: OR p = 0.003; linear p = 0.003), suggesti ng that the effect found with Ala57Thr was not due to its linkage with P OR P linear p OR P OR P linear p OR P OR P Denmark Atopy associat ion analyses between phenotypes and the IL4Ra genotypes and haplotypes in Denmark and Greenland. Regression analyses were carried ou t using either Val50/Val50, Ala57/Al a57 or Val50/Ala57 as baseline. 185 Figure 1. Odds ratio for atopy associated with IL4Ra genotypes and haplotypes compared with Val50/Val50, Ala57/Ala57 or Val50/Ala57 in Denmark (A) and in Greenland (B). Error bars represent 95% CI, # represen ts p-value less than 0.01, and * represents p-value less than 0.05. Rhinitis Ile50Val, but not Ala57Thr, was associated with rhinitis (Table 3). Individuals with one Ile50 allele had lower odds of developing rhinitis (OR = 0.45, p = 0.049), with those possessing 2 alleles having the smallest risk of disease (OR = 0.35, p = 0.009). Both haplotypes with Ile50 were associated with lower risk, compared with the haplotype without Ile50 (Ile50/Thr57: OR = 0.68, p = 0.015; Ile50/Ala57: OR = 0.71, p = 0.019). Since there was a large number of individuals with rhiniti s that were not atopic as assessed by skin test (103 non-atopics amongs t 125 rhinitics), further analysis was carried out to determine if the association observed between rhinitis and Ile50Val was due to the atopic or non-atopic group of rhiniti s. Compared with t hose without rhinitis, the association with Ile50Val remained onl y with the non-atopic group (Ile50/Ile50: OR = 0.31, p = = 0.41, p = 0.046). Atopic rhinitis, on the other hand, was associated with the SNP at position 57. Individuals with the Thr57/Thr57 genotype were 4.3 times less likely to develop atopic rhinitis compared with those lacking the Thr57 allele (p 0.036). The e ffect of Thr57 on atopic rhinitis was dose 186 dependent (linear p = 0.012), as was the effect of Ile50 on non-atopic rhinitis (linear p = 0.01). The only haplotype with the Thr57 alle le was associated with protection against atopic rhinitis (OR = 0.52, p = 0.021), Ile50 protected 0.064; Ile50/Ala57: OR = 0.62, p = 0.009). Asthma and lung function parameters No associations were found between asthma and the 2 IL4R SNPs, either individually or in combination (Table 3). However, when the asthmatic group was stratified by atopic status and compared with those w ithout asthma, both the Ile50Val and the Ala57Thr SNPs were associated with atopic asthma. Individuals with Ile50/Ile50 and Ile50/Val50 were 3.4 and 5.3 times less likely to develop atopic asthma compared with Val50/Val50 subjects (p = 0.069 and 0.021, respec tively). None of the 35 Inuits, had the Thr 57/Thr57 deve loped heterozygous for the Thr57Ala SNP were also less likely to develop atopic asthma (OR = 0.25, p = 0.035). Th e Thr57 allele thus appeared to have a dose effect on protection against atopic as thma (linear p = 0.02). The association observed with Ile50Val was possibly the resu lt of the tight linkage between Ile50 and Thr57, as indicated by the haplotype an alyses (Ile50/Thr57: OR = 0.24, p = 0.03; Ile50/Ala57: OR = 0.92, p = 0.826). No associations were found with the non-atopic sub-group. FEV 1% predicted and FEV 1/FVC ratio were not associated with the IL4R polymorphisms. Subjects with the Ile50 allele had lower DRS compared with those without (geometric mean (GM) DRS (% fall in FEV 1/\u00b5M histamine): Ile50/Ile50 GM = 3.60, p = 0.04; Ile50/Val50 GM = 3.52, p = 0.036; Val50/Val50 GM = 4.24). No association was found between the Thr57Ala polymorphism and DRS. Greenland Atopy There were only 46 atopic i ndividuals in the cohort li ving in Greenland. Subjects homozygous for the Ile50 allele had the lo west risk of developing atopy (OR = 0.27, p = 0.032). Those heterozygous for the SNP also tended to have lower risk of atopy, although the effect was not quite signifi cant (OR = 0.33, p = 0.084). However, there were no associations between the Ala57Thr SNP, or the haplotypes, and atopy, even 187 though a trend was observed with the Ile5 0/Thr57 haplotype (OR = 0.54; p = 0.069). Severity of atopy was not asso ciated with either of the IL4R polymorphisms, as observed in Denmark. Rhinitis There was no association between the IL4R SNPs, either individually or in combination, and rhinitis, despite the suffi ciently large number of subjects with the condition (n = 387, Table 3). This lack of a ssociation was also observed for both atopic and non-atopic rhinitis. Asthma and lung function parameters Neither the IL4R polymorphisms nor haplotypes were associated with asthma (Table 3) or any of the lung function parameters (data not shown). 188 Discussion This study reported a novel IL4R polymorphism that was presen t in Inuits, but rare or absent in all other populations. The Thr57 al lele of this polymorphism was associated with a lower risk of atopy in the Inuits in Denmark. An important implication of this finding is that it suggests that if a new population is to be fully investigated for gene by environment relationships, each gene studied will need to be screened for novel polymorphisms that might be unique to that population. In the pr esent study, assessing the same population group living in two distinct ly different environments facilitated an analysis of the influence of environmen tal factors independent of genetics. The novel sequence variation, IL4R Ala57Thr, was 21 bases downstream from the well-studied Ile50Val polymorphism. The Thr57 allele, which appeared to be a recent mutation that had occurred in linkage with the Ile50 allele, was highly specific to the Inuits living in Denmark and Greenland (frequency of 32.5%), but was almost non- existent in several other global populations. Although there have been many reports of ethnic- or population-specific polymorphisms, most of these alleles were found in low frequency, 34, 36 and those in high frequency (>25%) were mainly confined to African and African-American populations.36 Moreover, most of these studies, which aimed to identify polymorphisms in a large number of genes, have been limited either by the small number of ethnic cohorts or a paucity of individuals studied in each population. 34, 37, 38 This study differed from previous investig ations in that the cohorts were from general as well as isolated populations and hence lacked the genetic admixture found in most studied populations. Furthermore, all th e populations had sufficient sample size to provide a 95% chance of successfully detecti ng the SNP if the minimal allele frequency in any was 1%. 39 The Thr57 allele was extremely rare in th e non-Inuit populations, as we found one allele in the indigenous Australians, one in the European Australians, and four in the Danes, in the non-Inuit populations. Possible explanations for the difference in the Thr57 allele frequencies between these populations and the Inuits include: the differential period at which the mutation occurred, founder effect and random drift in a smallish, isolated population, or natural selection favouring the Th r57 allele in the I nuit population as an adaptive strategy to deal with the Arctic environment. 189 Although founder effect cannot be ruled out as an explanation of the high prevalence of the Thr57 allele, the possibility also remains that natural se lection may be responsible. The natural selection explanati on is consistent with the post ulate that the adaptation of the human immune system to the environm ent over many millennia may play a crucial role in current susceptib ility to atopy and asthma.40 Long-term exposure to parasites in tropical populations may have selected for an augmented immune response, as reflected in their high prevalence of pro-inflammatory alleles.41 On the contrary, populations with long-term residence in temperate or Arctic regions do not require an up-regulated pro-inflammatory immune system, which ma y result in deleterious over-reactions to other normally harmless environmental agents. Hence, having a less pro-inflammatory immune system would provide a survival advantage to the Inuit population, who has lived in an Arctic environm ent for at least 19,000 years.42 The IL4R Thr57 allele could have been selected for since it is associated with a lower risk of atopy. This study found an association between the IL4R Thr57 allele and a reduced risk of developing atopy in the Inuits liv ing in Denmark. The protective association seemed to extend to atopic rhinitis and atopic asthma in Denmark, but not to atopic severity. Evidence supporting this asso ciation includes: i) the IL4R gene is located in a region that has been previously linked to atopy;3-5 and ii) the substitution of a polar threonine for the small, non-polar alanine within th e important extracellular domain of the receptor could result in a functional change. Alternatively, the association observed in this study could be the result of linkage disequilibrium between Ala57Thr and another putative disease causing mutati on, or epistatic effects due to interaction with other SNP(s) in the IL-4R or other genes. Further studie s are underway to elucidate the effect of this SNP on atopy and receptor function, and to assess multi-loci interactions. The association between Ala57Thr and atopy wa s observed in Inuits living in Denmark. As with asthma, atopy is a disease state resu lting from the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Since the populat ions studied were of a similar genetic background (with corrections for \"degree of ethnicity\" included in all regression models), the influence of the environment per se could be assessed. The effect of the Thr57 allele was evident in the first generati on Inuit migrants in Denmark, but not in the Inuits in Greenland. This is possibly due to the differing levels of allergens in the two locations. With birch and grass pollen counts negligible in Qasigianguit and Uummannaq, and 100 times less in Nuuk than in Denmark,43 an allergen-sensitisation 190 threshold might not have been reached in Greenland, resulting in non-penetrance. This could be the reason why different populati on studies are inconsistent in reported associations between specific alleles and atopic phenotypes.13, 16, 18 The association of the Ile50Val SN P with atopy has been well-documented, 13, 16 and again not all studies have found a significant relationship.17, 18 In the current study, the association was only observed in Greenland, wi th the Ile50 allele associated with reduced atopy, as opposed to increased atopy in the Japanese,13, 16 but this latter finding needs to be replicated in a larger cohort considering the small sample size of 46 atopic individuals. Nevertheless, the results do suggest that the Ile50 allele would be associated with reduced inflammation. Th is might explain the diminished airway responsiveness, as assessed by DRS, in indi viduals with the allele in Denmark, even though a significant association with atopy was not observed. The association between Ile50Val and non-atopic rhinitis is novel finding. The main trigger of such \"non-atopic\" (as defined by skin test reactivity ) rhinitis in this population was any particulate matter in the ai r, which included pollen, smoke or other irritants. In non-atopic rhinitis, which is associated with nasal and sinus inflammation, allergens that do not cause an allergic skin reaction may still be nasal irritants, as in the case of pollen. Hence, individuals with a less pro-inflammatory genetic profile may be at lower risk of developing non- allergic rhinitis. Furthermor e, the Val50 variant of the receptor, in combination with Arg551, has been shown to exhibit enhanced sensitivity to IL-4, 19 a major stimulus for the production of the potent eosinophil attractant, eotaxin-2/CCL24, from nasal turbinates obtained from patient s with non-allergic rhinitis.44 As there is a lack of literature on the genetics of non-allergic rhinitis, the present findings should be rec onfirmed in other populations. In conclusion, we have found a novel polymorphism, IL4R Ala57Thr, in a gene in a key immunological pathway. The polymorphi sm was common in an isolated Arctic population, but almost non-existe nt in populations from all other locations. Evidence suggests that the polymorphism may be associ ated with a reduction in the tendency to develop atopy. The population-specific natu re of the SNP highlights the need for comprehensive screening for unique sequence variants within candidate genes in multiple populations, and the high frequency of the Thr57 allele in the Inuits suggested the possibly that it became fixed through na tural selection. Additional data such as 191 serum IgE levels and further gene and protei n functional studies are underway to further investigate the present findings and to eluc idate the mechanisms underlying the genetic associations. 192 Acknowledgment The authors are grateful to the Inuits of Nuuk, Qasigianguit, Ummaannaq, and Copenhagen for their kind participation and we are deeply indebted to the personnel of the Greenland Steering Group for the recruitment of the study subjects.

Thus we used a unique approach of investiga ting the effects of different local environments on asthma genotype-phenotype associations in two ge ographically dispersed populations with similar ancestry. Methodology/Principal Findings: Two unselect ed populations of Inuit, living in Greenland and Denmark, with lung function, atopy, asthma, rhinitis and atopic dermatitis using multiple regression analyses. Contrasting magnitude and direc tion of genetic asso ciations were found between the two Inuit populations. For ADRB2 16ArgArg vs. 16GlyGly, lung function was decreased in Greenland and but increa sed in Denmark. The 16Arg allele of ADBR2 was also associated with increased ever asthma in Denmark but not Greenland. For SCGB1A1 38AA vs. 38GG, rhinitis prevalen ce was decreased in Greenland but increased in Denmark. Conclusion/Significance: Environmental factor s may modulate genetic effects, thereby determining not only which genes are associat ed with asthma and allergy, but also the direction of their associations. These results demonstrat e that opposite effects can be found for given genotypes in different envir onments. These findings are likely to be applicable to studies of other complex diseases. 199 Introduction The study of asthma genetics is complicat ed by factors including: 1) polygenic inheritance; 2) different environmental infl uences; 3) variable phenotype definitions and 4) age-related genotypic effects 1. Each of these may contribute to apparent inconsistencies in genotype-phenotype a ssociations. Additionally, genome wide linkage and genetic associati on studies have shown that th e profile of genetic loci associated with asthma varies betw een populations with different ancestry2, 3. The environment plays a central role in as thma pathogenesis although the precise timing and contribution of these factors are unknown4, 5. Many environmental factors have been implicated4, but \"Western lifestyle\" is the most powerful predictor as asthma and allergy are more common in developed compared with developing countries6. However, the importance of Western lifes tyle in genotype-phenotype relationships remains unclear7 as there has been a paucity of st udies critically investigating its influence, or lack thereof, in populations of similar ancestry. Therefore, we compared relationships be tween genotype and consistently defined asthma phenotypes between populations of Inuit living in markedly different environments. We genotyped two populations, on e resident in Greenland, the other in Denmark, for polymorphisms in genes that have previously been associated with asthma and allergic diseases and have biologically plausi ble roles in the pathogenesis of these conditions8-11 12-15. We hypothesized that Inuit living in Greenland would have different genotype-phenotype association profile co mpared with Inuit living in Denmark. 200 Methods Study Populations Phenotype data were collected betwee n 1997 and 2001 from adult Inuit living in Denmark and Greenland. Inuit was define d as being born in Greenland and either having at least one Inuit parent or being Inuit by self identification16. Inuit in Denmark live a predominantly Wester n lifestyle with respect to housing, pets, diet, occupation, daycare and healthcare 17. In Denmark, Inuit were identified by the central population register and those from the urban areas of Denmark were invited to participate (n = 1385)16-18. Enrolled subjects (n = 739 or 53%) underwent an interview, clinical examination, lung f unction studies and venepuncture . DNA was available from 89% (657) of participants. In Greenland, all inhabitants of a town on the west coast of Greenland, Quasigianguit, were invited to participate in this study. Quasigianguit is a rural town of mostly hunters and fishermen living a relatively traditional lifestyle in terms of diet, work and home environment 18. Participants (n = 618) answered a self-administered general questionnaire, underwent a clinical ex amination, lung function studies and venepuncture. DNA was available from 615 study participants. Phenotypes Phenotypes obtained for this study include history of asthma, atopy, rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and pulmonary function paramete rs as defined by the Division of Lung Disease of the National H eart, Lung and Blood Institute19-21. A questionnaire in either Greenlandic or Danish was used in this study. The questionnaire was originally written in Danish and translated into Greenlandic then back translated into Danish to ensure accuracy. The Greenlandic questionnaire was used in the Greenland Inuit population whereas the Inuit in Denmark were given a choice of filling out either questionnaire18. 201 The questionnaire included general health questions on respiratory phenotypes (ever asthma, rhinitis, atopic dermatitis; Table 1) and factors of possible importance for the development of allergic dis ease such as age, gender and tobacco smoking status. Current smoking was defined as reported da ily tobacco consumption during the last year. Ex-smoking was defined as cessation of smoking more than 6 months previously. Additionally, as a measure of ethnicity, the an cestry of the subject's grandparents was recorded18. 202 Phenotype Definition Atopy Wheal size of at least 3mm to any of the alle rgens tested, such as birch, grass, mugwort, horse, dog, dust asthma Ever asthma was defined as a pos itive response to 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 listed below. 1) Does your breathing ever sound wheezy or whistling? 2) Do you have attacks of shortn ess of breath with wheezing? 3) Do you experience wheezing, chest tightness, c ough, breathlessness with any of the following: at rest, with exertion, with emo tional stress, with exposure to cold air, with chest infection or head cold? 4) Do you experience wheezing after exposure to: dust, fumes, mould, po llen, food, pets or drugs? Rhinitis A positive response to questions 1-10 or 2-11. 1) Do your (rhinitis) symptoms come suddenly like attacks? 2) Does the trouble usually last more than an hour? 3) Do your eyes itch? 4) Do you have sneezing spells (m ore than three sneezes in a row)? 5) Do you often have a runny nose? 6) Do you often have a blocked nose? 7) Have you lost your sense of smell? 8) Do you have eye or nose trouble in the winter? 9) Are your eye or nose troubles worse during a particular season (spring, summer, autumn, or winter)? 10) Have you ever come into close contact with anything that you feel caused or worsened your eye or nose trouble (grass, flowers, trees, animals, food, drink, aspirin, dust, smoke, or stress)? 11) Do you take medicine for your eye or nose tr ouble?

Phenotype definitions used in this study. Skin prick tests (SPT) were performed in accordance with guidelines of The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology22. Allergens comm on and pertinent to both Greenland and Denmark were used: bi rch, grass, mugwort, horse, dog, cat, two house dust mite species ( Dermatophagoides Pteronyssinus Atopy was defined as at least one SPT resul ting in a wheal size of 3 mm or greater (Table 1). Lung function tests were carried out using spirometry as described by Backer et al 23. 203 Genotyping DNA was isolated from periphera l blood using standard methods24. Genotyping oglobin 1A 1 of the Cluster Mast cell chymase (CMA1 ) and of the beta 2 adrenergic receptor ( ADRB2) were done using previously described methods10, 11, 25, 26. Genotyping accuracy was confirmed by the DNA sequencing of a random 10% of the population (Applied Biosys tems, Foster City, CA.). Data Analysis Data were analysed using the statisti cal package SPSS (Version 11, SPSS, Chicago, IL.). Genotype frequencies were assessed for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Multiple regression analyses were used to analys e data, adjusting for potential confounders including gender, age and genetic admixture. In view of th e reported effect of tobacco smoke on the pathogenesis of asthma27, all asthma and pulmona ry function regression analyses included exposure to tobacco smoke . Furthermore, due to the potential confounding effects of height on pulmonary function, FEV 1 and FVC statistical outcomes were adjusted for height. A p- value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. European population An unselected subset of the Northern Eur opean Danish population (n = 200) was also recruited and genotyped to allow comparis on of genotype frequencies between this population and the two Inuit populations. Ethics All subjects gave informed consent prior to participation and the study was approved by the Greenlandic, Danish and Australian ethics committees. 204 Results Population demographics and genotype frequencies The demographic characteristics for both populations are summarised in Table 2. Genotype frequencies for the Inuit and Europ ean 'control' populati on are detailed in Table 3. Overall, there were consistent marked differences in genotype frequencies between Inuits and Europeans, but only sma ll differences between the two Inuit groups. All genotypes were in Ha rdy-Weinberg equilibrium. Inuit in Greenland Inuit in Denmark n 618 739 Gender (male)* 47% (289) 27% (198) Age Full Inuit 91% (560) 53% (382) Table 2.

The prevalence of smoking in Inuit was lower in Denmark (current smoker = 59%) than in Greenland (curre nt smoker = 72%) and more Inuit had quit smoking in Denmark than in Greenland (19% vs. 16% respectively). Both populations had similar mean l ung function levels, age and height. ADRB2 Arg16Gly and lung function (FEV 1 and FVC ) In both Inuit populations, ADRB2 Arg16Gly was associated with altered lung function (Figure 1a and Figure 1b). The 16Arg a llele was associated with decreased FEV 1 and FVC in Greenland and increased FVC in Denmark. In Greenland, compared with those homozygous for 16Gly (mean FEV 1 = 3.27 L, mean FVC = 4.14 L), Inuit homozygous for 16Arg had lower lung function (mean FEV 1 = 206 3.13 L, p = 0.04; mean FVC = 3.96 L, p = 0.03). Similarly, those heterozygous for the Arg16Gly polymorphism also had lower lung function (mean FEV 1 = 3.09 L, p = 0.007; mean FVC = 3.90 L, p = 0.004). In Denmark, Inuit with 16ArgArg had higher FVC (mean = 4.08 L) compared with Inuit with 16GlyGly (mean = 3.93 L; p = 0.023). The 16A rg allele was also associated with a linear stepwise increase in mean FVC in this population ( FVC = 0.07 L, p = 0.022). The relationship between Arg16Gly and FEV 1 followed the same trend as the association between Arg16Gly and FVC, alt hough this relationship was not 1a. ADRB2 Arg16Gly and FEV 1 among Inuit living 207 it living in Greenland and Denmark. ADRB2 Arg16Gly and ever asthma In both populations, the odds of having ever had asthma was increased for Inuit who had the 16Arg allele, however only in Denm ark was this increased risk significant (Figure 2). In Greenland, compared with Inuit homozygous for the 16Gly, both 16ArgGly and 16ArgArg had non-significantly higher odds of ever asthma (OR = 1.76, 95%CI = 0.51- 6.16, p = 0.374; OR = 1.99, 95%CI = 0.57-6.96, p = 0.281, respectively), but the observed differences did not reach statis tical significance in either case In Denmark, Inuit with 16ArgArg were 3.1 (95%CI = 1.04 - 9.28) times more likely to have ever had asthma compared with Inuit with 16GlyGly (p = 0.043). Inuit heterozygous for this polymorphism were 2.9 (95%CI = 1.00 - 8.58) times more likely to ever had asthma compared with 16Gl yGly Inuit and this odds approached significance (p = 0.051). Compar ed with Inuit who had 16Gly Gly, those with at least one 16Arg allele (16ArgGly and 16ArgArg combined) were 3.0 (95%CI = 1.05 - 8.55) times more likely to have ever had asthma (p = 0.04). 208 0.1110 16ArgGly 16ArgArg 16ArgGly 16ArgArg Greenland Denmark 16GlyGly Figure 2 .

SCGB1A1 A38G and rhinitis The SCGB1A1 38A allele was associated with decr eased odds of rhinit is in Inuit in Greenland (p<0.05) but not in Denmark (Figure 3). 209 3 . SCGB1A1 A38G and Odds of Rhinitis in Inuit living in Greenland and Denmark. Inuit in Greenland with 38AA were less likely to have had rhinitis compared with either Inuit with 38GG (OR = 0.26, 95%CI = 0.07-0.92; p = 0.037), 38AG (OR = 0.25, 95%CI = 0.07-0.93; p = 0.038) or both combined (OR = 0.26, 95%CI = 0.07-0.91; p = 0.035). Inuit in Denmark who had 38AA had a 1.97 (95%CI = 0.82-4.76, p = 0.131) times increased odds of having had rhinitis compared with Inuit with 38GG, but this did not attain statistical significance (p>0.05). No associations were observed between ADRB2 Arg16Gly and atopy, atopic dermatitis and rhinitis in both Inuit populations, nor were any associatio ns observed between SCGB1A1 A38G and ever asthma, atopy, atopic dermatitis, FEV 1 FVC in both Inuit between ADRB2 and any of the phenotypes investigated in this study. 210 Discussion The present study investigated the effects of different local environments on the magnitude and direction of asthma genotype-phenotype associations in two geographically dispersed populations with similar ancestry. We report that local environment modulated the profile of asthma genotype-phenotype associations in these populations, affecting not only the presence or absence of associati ons but also their strength and direction. A number of review articles have compared genetic association studies across multiple populations 3. However, these investigations ha ve often compared populations with different phenotype definitions and/or subject select ion criteria. No study has examined a number of asthma candidate genes in two relatively large populations with similar genetic ancestry, recruited c ontemporaneously by the same investigators using the same phenotype assessment methods and yet located in contrasting environments. In fact, there are environmental and lifestyle differences between Inuit living in Greenland and Inuit living in Denmark. In Greenland, more Inuit hunt and eat traditional foods such as fish, marine mammal s (whales, seals and walrus), polar bears and birds than in Denmark (60.4% and 84.9% versus 0.4% and 4.5% respectively)18. Inuit in Greenland are exposed to less aeroallergens, such as dust and pollen, than their counterparts in Denmark17. Indoor pet ownership is al so less common in Greenland than in Denmark (less than 2% comp ared with almost 20%, respectively)17. However, most homes in Greenland kept sleigh dogs out doors. Although the quality of education is the same, less Inuit finish their education in Greenland than in Denmark18. We hypothesised that local environment play ed an important role in the phenotypic manifestation of asthma by modulating gene penetrance. In studying two genetically similar Inuit populations exposed to strongly contrasting environments, we found that a change from a traditional Arctic lifestyle to a wealthy Western environment could lead to loss ( SCGB1A1 A38G and rhinitis), gain and reversal ( ADRB2 Arg16Gly and lung function) of a potential genetic su sceptibility to disease. Such differences between populati ons would have either been diluted or 211 remained undetected if the data from the tw o populations had been pooled. In addition, the unmasking of an association between ADRB2 16Arg with 'ever asthma' and the loss of the protective SCGB1A1 38A association with rhini tis in the Denmark population pointed to an unmasking of an inflammato ry potential in Inuit living in Denmark, possibly due to their Western lifestyle18. Thus divergent environmental exposures in these two genetically simila r populations were the likely cause of the different genotype-phenotype association profiles. The SCGB1A1 A38G-rhinitis association found in the Greenland Inuit population was contrary to expectations based on associat ion and functional studi es. Given that the SCGB1A1 38A allele had less transcriptional activity than the 38G allele28, and low levels of SCGB1A1 were associated with rhinitis29, 30, we expected 38A to be associated with an increased incidence of rhinitis. However, in Greenland, 38A was associated with a decreased incidence of rh initis (Figure 3). In Denmark, Inuit with the same allele showed an increased incidence of rhinitis, al though this relationship was not significant. These data suggested that the 38A allele's potential to influence the development of rhinitis is environment specific. In Denmar k 38A's potential to contribute to rhinitis may be unmasked by environmental factor s, such as exposure to aeroallergens18, whilst in Greenland, due to the presence of di fferent environmental factors, 38A was associated with protection from rhinitis. This was corroborated by the rhinitis prevalence data for the two populations, whic h showed increased rhinitis in Denmark compared with Greenland (Table 2). We found an association with the ADRB2 16Arg allele and an increased incidence of ever asthma, but this relationship was signifi cant only in Inuit in Denmark (Figure 2). Previous studies have associated the ADRB2 Arg16Gly polymorphism with asthma prevalence 14, 15. The 16Arg allele was associated w ith decreased incidence of asthma in Northern Chinese15 and increased incidence of asthma in Chinese ever smokers14. Taken together these two st udies suggested that the ADRB2 Arg16Gly polymorphism may affect asthma susceptibility and that its effects are modulated by environmental factors such as tobacco smoking. As a relatively high percentage of both Inuit populations in this study had smoked tob acco sometime in their life, it was not surprising that our findings were similar to the findings in Chinese ever smokers14. The 212 lack of association between this polymorphi sm and ever asthma in Greenlandic Inuit may be due to different environmental exposures between the two Inuit populations. Environmental factors may alter which allele is associated with an outcome. The bi- directional association of the ADRB2 16Arg allele with lung function between the two populations was of particular in terest. The 16Arg allele wa s associated with decreased lung function in Greenland, consistent with other studies 12, 13, while the same allele was associated with increased lung function in Denmark. That environmental factors might contribute to opposing associa tions is supported by asthma studies involving the CD14 gene 31-33. In these studies, association of the CD14 -260CC genotype (synonymous with CD14 -159CC) with asthma and allergic parameters was dependent on the environment. In low endotoxin environmen ts, the -260CC was associated with asthma and allergic phenotypes while in high endotoxin environments it was the -260TT that was associated with asthma and allergy32, 33. Although there was a degree of population stratification due to genetic admixture and unequal gender ratio between the two Inuit populations, this was corrected for in the regression models. Genotype frequencies for Inuit residing in Denmark showed only small differences from those living in Gr eenland, but both Inuit gr oups showed marked differences in genotype frequencies compared with the European population (Table 3). Our analyses were unadjusted for multiple testing as: (1) the associated polymorphisms have been shown to either ch ange the gene function or actio n of the resulting protein in genes known to be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma 8, 12, 14, 28, 34; and (2) such adjustment can be overly conservative and since the results were based on an a priori hypothesis, we have described all statistical analyses carri ed out and discussed each result35. In conclusion, asthma genetic studies ha ve produced conflicting associations across ethnically and geographi cally diverse populations3. However, for the most part, these studies have failed to account for gene-environment interactions. The present study addressed gene-environment interacti on with asthma-related phenotypes by studying subjects with similar genetic backgrounds exposed to different environments using consistent phenotyping methods. This st udy provided evidence for the importance of gene-environment interacti on on these phenotypes and found th at environmental factors 213 altered the profile of genes associated with asthma and allergic disease. Environmental factors associated with Wester n living (such as diet, indoor pets and pollution), may act to modulate gene penetrance in asthma and allergic disease. This study has important implications for the interpretation of past a nd future population studies on asthma and is applicable to other complex diseases. 214 Acknowledgements This work was supported by the NHMRC (Australia) program grant #211912, The Asthma Foundation of Wester n Australia and the Danish Lung Association.
