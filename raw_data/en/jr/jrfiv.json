Acupuncture is a process in which we insert very small needles at specific acupuncture points (acupoints) on the body. Your pet has 14 energy channels flowing through their body, and the acupoints are all located where these channels intersect. Animals have roughly 173 acupoints, areas where nerve endings, lymphatic vessels, and mast cells are dense and abundant. Stimulating the acupoints helps to release serotonin, endorphins, and other chemicals to relieve pain and heal damaged tissue. At its core, acupuncture is able to help the body heal by triggering a host of physiological changes. Is Acupuncture Painful? While the procedure does involve needles, acupuncture should cause little to no discomfort in your pet. Some pets may even become relaxed and a little sleepy while they're being treated. We're happy to offer other options for pets that are fidgety or cannot tolerate needles, such as laser acupuncture and aquapuncture, which are more comfortable for sensitive patients. "}
