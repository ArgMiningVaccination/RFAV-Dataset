Your first visit may take up to 2 hours long as you will be meeting with an Allergist either in-person or virtually, who will assess need for testing which may be done during the appointment. For in-person visits, we suggest you allow for at least two hours for parking. Free valet parking is available at entrance 11, off of Oak street. We are located in the 1982 building, which is attached to the new Teck Acute Care Centre. Please DO NOT TAKE antihistamines Benadryl (diphenhydramine) or Gravol (dimenhydrinate) for 3 days prior to the appointment and antihistamines such (cetirizine) for 5 days prior to the appointment as they interfere with the skin test. FOR EVERY APPOINTMENT please bring the following - Patient and their Health Care Card - Details of suspected allergens and symptoms related to possible reactions - ALL of your child's allergy and asthma medications and devices (eg. Spacer, aerochamber) See the following brochures for information on food challenges: [What is a Food Challenge brochure.pdf](/Allergy-site/Documents/What%20is%20a%20Food%20Challenge%20brochure.pdf) [What to Bring to Your Food Challenge brochure.pdf](/Allergy-site/Documents/What%20to%20Bring%20to%20Your%20Food%20Challenge%20brochure.pdf) Patients needing bloodwork will be directed to the BCCH Outpatient Laboratory located on the 2nd floor of the 1982 building (take the elevators by the Second Cup coffee shop up to the 2nd floor, and then turn left twice). There will be signs on the wall to guide you. We are a teaching institution and proud to offer a specialty residency program for physicians training to be specialists in Pediatrics and Clinical Immunology and Allergy. During your visit, you will likely be assessed by a medical student or resident (a medical doctor who is training to be an independent practitioner). "}
