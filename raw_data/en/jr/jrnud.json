Drawing on esoteric tradition as well as scientific research, such as Rupert Sheldrake's morphic field studies, the author maps out the human energy field in all its subtleties, providing diagrams of the human energy body, the spectrum of states of awareness, the multilayered fields of consciousness, and the psychoenergetic dynamics of the transformation process. Through compelling testimonials of powerful healings, Adams demonstrates how the processes of healing and of peak spiritual experience are closely aligned with harmony within the larger energetic field of consciousness. Proposing a new model of consciousness, reality, and energy healing that incorporates the anomalous phenomena that occurs on the outermost edges of human experience, the author draws these many strands together to outline not only a multilayered approach for different kinds of energy healing modalities, such as Reiki, breathwork, EFT, and remote healing, but also a useful program of self-help that anyone can follow to make lasting improvements to their physical, emotional, and spiritual health.", "sitename": "Scribd", "date": "2022-01-04", "cleaned_text": "of the Healing Field: Energy Medicine, Psi Abilities, and Ancestral Healing Written by [Peter Mark Adams](https://www.scribd.com/author/688172923/Peter-Mark-Adams) Narrated by [Robin Douglas](https://www.scribd.com/contributor/683962478/Robin-Douglas) Rating: 5 stars 4/5 () About this audiobook Illustrates the role of transpersonal fields of consciousness in healing a range of issues, from inherited family and ancestral problems, to past lives and womb trauma, to near-death experiences, merged identities, and spirit attachment Shares remarkable cases of healing and personal transformation from the author's more than 20 years of energy healing work, as well as experiences from other gifted healers, psychics, and shamans Provides diagrams of the human energy body, the spectrum of states of awareness, the multilayered fields of consciousness, and the psycho-energetic dynamics of the transformation process Sharing remarkable cases of healing and personal transformation from his and his wife's more than 20 years of intensive professional energy healing work as well as experiences from other gifted healers, psychics, and shamans, Peter Mark Adams illustrates the role of transpersonal fields of consciousness in heal ing a range of issues--from inherited family and ancestral problems to past lives and womb trauma to near-death experiences, merged identities, and spirit attachment.
