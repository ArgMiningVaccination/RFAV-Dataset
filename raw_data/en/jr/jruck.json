MD012610- 01A1 Jimanez (PI); Signorile (Co -I) 05/09/2019 - Promotion in the Prevention of Anxiety and Depression: The Happy Older Latinos are Active (HOLA Study: RO1. Given the prevalence and morbidity of depression in later life, the inadequacies of current treatment approaches for avert ing years living with disability, the inequities in access to the mental health care delivery system, and the workforce shortages to meet the mental health needs of older Latinos, development and testing of innovative strategies to prevent depression and a nxiety are of great public health significance and have the potential to change practice. The study will compare the effectiveness of HOLA and healthy lifestyles education in reducing risk factors for major depression and generalized anxiety disorder among older Latinos with subthreshold depression or anxiety; compare the impact of HOLA and healthy lifestyles education in reducing the 2- year incidence and recurrence of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder among older Latinos with subthreshold depression or anxiety; and, compare the effectiveness of HOLA and healthy lifestyles education in improving health -related outcomes among older Latinos with minor or subthreshold depression or anxiety among older Latinos with minor or subthreshold depression or anxiety.
