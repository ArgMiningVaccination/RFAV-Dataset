Baxter is proposing a software update that will provide user prompts to support correct troubleshooting of the upstream occlusion alarm. Proposed Performance Improvements, FY21 -22 Met/ Not Met Results The management of medical equipment End of Life (EOL) documentation to help the Biomedical Engineering Department to plan ahead of time and to work with department leaders to purchase replacement medical equipment. To ensure proper medical equipment operation and to allow a proper timeline for the Biomedical Engineering Department to Biomedical Engineering has collected EOL documentation from Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) that state the EOL date and confirms that end of manufacturer support. Biomedical Engineering will cont inue to collect EOL documentation in order to plan ahead in replacing medical equipment. Page 26 of 48 communicate with the manufacturer as to what parts/services will be available in order to maintain the medical device/system in service. The overall goal is to avoid any delay in p atient care and improve hospital operations. Met Medical Equipment Lifecycle Planning: Continue planning 2 -3 years in advance as to what medical equipment will need to be replaced and what the total cost will be. Met Medical equipment has been identified that is currently not supported by the manufacturer or has reached its End of Life (EOL) date. A 1:1 meeting will be held with department leaders in the Fall to discuss their capital equipment submissions in Novemb er. Collaborate with the IT Security and Network Operations teams to develop a standard procedure for adding medical devices to the network on the ZSFG campus. Met A Biomedical Committee lifecycle group has been formed to discuss and write up a standard procedure. Create a policy and procedure for new medical equipment that is brought on the ZSFG campus that will connect to DPH network and/or stores ePHI. Met A procedure has been created with DPH IT to ensure any medical device that needs to be connected to the network is connected in a timely manner. Define a capital strategy that would involve communication with ZSFG senior/executive leadership as to when a device(s) will need to be replaced. Having a proper plan in place would help leadership in determining what device(s) should be included in their annual budget and if any requests need to be submitted to the capital equipment committee. Met Department leaders are informed about any medical equipment that is no longer supported by the manufac turer or has reached its EOL. This information is also communicated during the monthly Value Analysis Committee (VAC). Proposed Performance Metrics for FY22 -23 Target Comments and Action Plan Page 27 of 48 Medical device repairs 90% completion within 30 days The Biomedical Engineering Department receives an average of 300 -plus medical device service requests per month, the majority of which are repair requests. As service requests are received via phone or online ticket submission, they are logged into a datab ase, assigned to a biomedical technician, who then will provide a solution. Requests for life support (LS) devices are prioritized for repair. Meet with Biomedical team bi -weekly to troubleshoot and discuss unresolved device repairs and work with vendors to become compliant with DPH. Revive risk assessment of medical equipment in Biomedical Engineering's CMMS database and update the Biomedical Engineering Medical Equipment Management Plan (MEMP) 100% The plan is to follow TMS (Biomedical Engineering CMMS) database embedded clinical equipment risk classification formula which is E+A+[(P+F+U)/3]. Once all medical devices in the database have an assigned risk score then the MEMP will be updated and presented at an EOC committee meeting. EFFECTIVENESS The Medical Equipment Management Program has been evaluated by the multi -disciplinary Environment of Care Committee and is considered effective. GOALS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT IN FY22 -23 Provide further training for all Biomedical Technicians in order to continue insourcing PM and repair services. Reduce the total cost of ownership for each medical device Reduce the service turnaround time Hire a Biomedical Technician with dialysis background to provide support when Outpatient Dialysis (Ward 17) moves to building 5 and expands its patient stations from 13 to 30. The new area is expected to open in 2024 Page 28 of 48 Work with department leaders to develop a medical equipment lifecycle plan to replace medical devices/systems every 2-3 years. Define a capital strategy that would involve communication with ZSFG senior/executive leadership as to when a device(s) will need to be replaced. Having a proper plan in place would help leadership in determining what device(s) should be include d in their annual budget and if any requests need to be submitted to the capital equipment committee. Met with department leaders in the Fall to prepare for their capital equipment submission in November. Continue developing a definite path to identify me dical technology that will bring ZSFG to the forefront of health care and overall to improve the rate of change at ZSFG when it comes to medical equipment technology. Page 29 of 48 V. SAFETY MANAGEMENT SCOPE Safety Management is designed to identify and address potential safety risks in the ZSFG environment. At ZSFG, Safety Management is shared by two complementary programs, Patient Safety and Environmental Health and Safety: Patient Safety is a function of Quality Management and oversees the organization's patient safety plan and national patient safety goals. Patient Safety reports via Process Improvement and Patient Safety Committee (PIPS). Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) focuses on staff health, safety, and well -being. The Environmen tal Health and Safety Department provides consultation, resources and training to create, maintain and improve the hospital's working environment. The goals of EH&S are to reduce or eliminate staff injuries and illnesses and create a safe environment for a ll persons including staff, patients, clients, and visitors at the ZSFG site. EH&S reports their activities through the Environment of Care Committee in both this chapter and the Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Chapter. The Safety Management Program's scope encompasses all departments and areas of the ZSFG campus, except for UCSF research activities, which fall under UCSF management. ACCOMPLISHMENTS Worked with Materials Management, Infection Control and DOC Logistics to identify alternate PPE to address COVD -related supply shortages. Maintained injury rate comparable to years that EH&S was fully staffed, despite operating at 33% staffing for the entirety of the pandemic PROGRAM OBJECTIVES/ PERFORMANCE METRICS The following metrics provide the Environment of Care Committee with information needed to evaluate performance of the Safety Management Program activities and to identify further opportunities for improvement: AIM: Show continued progress in reducing staff injuries and injury rates , measured by no increase in Recordable Injury Counts or Injury Rates from FY2017 -2022 Met: Injury counts and the standardized injury rate (\"Incidence Rate\") decreased from FY20/21 - FY21/22. Objectives & Performance Indicators Result s Page 30 of 48 OSHA Recordable Injuries July 2017 - June 2022 Page 31 of 48 EFFECTIVENESS Effectiveness is based on how well the goals are met and how well the scope of the performance metrics fit current organizational needs. Recognizing the significant challenge of reducing staff injuries and given the very limited resources available, the En vironment of Care Committee has reviewed the Safety Management Program and found it to be effective, but needs improvement based on the objectives and performance metrics indicated in the Plan. Page 32 of 48 VI. SECURITY MANAGEMENT SCOPE The scope of the Security Management Plan is to assure the ongoing provision of a safe, accessible, and secure environment for staff, patients, and visitors at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Campus.

UNSUNG HEROES OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF CARE COMMITTEE Traditionally, the Environment of Care (EOC) Annual Report consists of seven chapters which align with Joint Commission requirements for management of a hospital's EOC. Reflecting ZSFG's strong emphasis on collaboration and a shared mission and vision, EOC activities at ZSFG include far more th an these seven -chapter heads and their programs, with other program participants working hard behind the scenes, without getting recognition for their valuable contributions. This section identifies some of these participating groups, their EOC activities in the past year, their accomplishments, and challenges: Page 45 of 48 Materials Management Major EOC Activities: Ensure continuity of medical supply coverage for the hospital Ensure standard work is maintained and proper inventory management for the storage areas managed by Materials Management Conduct regular walkthroughs of supply and medication rooms, inspect and monitor medical supply storage areas and identify/address non -conformances Accomplishments: Redesigned and improved Weekly Supply Shortage Summary to include \"at a glance\" green, yellow, red, color code to assist staff with quickly identifying critical supply items In collaboration with Medline (Prime Vendor) and clinical staff, launched weekly Backorder Projection report and meeting, including clinical stakeholders, to identify and discuss in advance potential/real projected shortages and increase hospital awareness Relaunching of CPD inventory management/stocking of PPE in Clean Rooms, which was disabled for 2 years as a result to COVID and the global supply crisis Challenges: Ongoing global supply crisis continues to cause challenges/gaps impacting our ability to maintain adequate supply coverage for the hospital . Department of Environmental Services (EVS): Major EOC Activities EVS maintains the built environment of the facility where healthcare services are provided, following regulations and guidelines, i.e., OSHA, TJC, CDC, AORN, APIC, and AHE. The EVS works in collaboration with Infection Control preventionists to review and revise policies and procedures for environmental cleaning that includes proper use of PPEs. Also ensures safe and effective chemicals selection and use for achieving disinfection. The policies include essential items such as checklists, timelines, and frequenc ies, and develop a mechanism by which to assess and improve consistency and quality. We develop and update new Porter orientation program and maintain a standard of cleanliness by providing a reporting methodology for tracking compliance and effectiveness of cleaning processes (ATP tests). EVS is responsible for pest control activities, by implementing an integrated pest management program (IPM) to mitigate exposure to pests in the facility. Page 46 of 48 EVS collects, transports, separates, and discards waste streams, such us Regular and Regulated Medical Waste, Recycle and Compost, etc. We Train staff in the proper handling and separation to minimize landfill waste. EVS participates in the twice a month EOC Rounds to make sure Porters follows proper protocols during their tour of duty. Also, to minimize the risk of accidents by following proper cleaning standards. EVS completes on -line work orders/requests for cleaning projects; requests for tables, chairs, trashcans and segregated containers for compost/recycling/confid ential. Accomplishments Worked in collaboration and guidance of IC for the participation in a joint San Francisco Chapter of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) and Association for the Healthcare Environment (AHE) pilot project. The project aims to standardize environmental cleaning practices in local healthcare facilities, and to decrease HAI. A group of Porters and Supervisors were trained and certified in CHEST (Certified Healthcare Environment al Services Technician). The project was successfully completed, resulting in an increase in patient and staff satisfaction, HCAHPS and e- Videon (patient satisfaction) scores. Monitored and complied with all trainings and provided key information to IT for the proper creation of the EVS module for the new Electronic Health Record (EHR), to be used at ZSFG. Worked to implement Epic Electronic Health Record system in our department. Implementation was successful and we have eliminated most of the manual work to provide cleaning services to ZSFG. Collaborated with the Department of Human Resources, early in the new year, to hire and train the large number of employees necessary to replace the retirees and long-term leave of the previous season. Following this, with the advent of the Covid -19 crisis, worked again with HR Dept. to acquire a number of new DSW workers, kindly provided by SFO and the Public Library, needed to deal with the ongoing pandemic. Challenges The department is dealing with an increase in Capital project work cleaning across campus and Extended Leave of Absence of front-line staff that resulted in a substantial increase in OT hours used. We are working with HR Operations to expedite hiring EVS staff and reduce OT. Department of Infection Prevention & Control (IC): Major EOC Activities IC provides technical guidance and oversight to the Environmental Services Department. This includes the review and revision of policies and procedures, ensuring safe and effective che micals are selected/used for achieving disinfection, and providing a reporting methodology for tracking compliance and effectiveness of cleaning processes. Page 47 of 48 IC obtains input from EOC stakeholders to develop and update annual infection prevention and control educational material for staff. In addition to daily IC rounding, IC participate d in the twice a month EOC Rounds to identify infection prevention and control issues and process gaps until COVID -19 safe work practices required their temporary suspension . IC has worked with six of the seven EOC chapters to establish standard work that incorporates infection prevention and mitigation strategies in critical aspects of their work with the Security Management chapter being the exception. Accomplishments IC, EH&S, Facilities Management and Capital Projects collaboration on development of standard work for construction projects. This successful collaboration continues to find opportunities for improvement to include participation in the dev elopment of a master planning document for ongoing seismic safety upgrade projects and renovation of building 5 from inpatient to outpatient setting . IC increased efficiency for Facilities Management by modifying the IC permit process for small scale renov ation and construction projects . The combined contractor work permit now allows projects whose IC risk assessment places in a no or low risk to patients category to proceed without an additional stand -alone IC permit. IC worked with Facilities Management to assess and improve workplace environments to meet the needs of COVID -19 social distancing practices. Challenges There are multiple competing \"high priority\" issues and projects which make it difficult for IC to establish stable partnerships with the v arious departments, e.g. nursing, EVS, Facilities and the ORs, to allow for CQI activities. The primary focus for IC department since February 2020 has been the COVID -19 pandemic. The activities done in response to COVID -19 include the development of a C OVID -19 FAQ intranet site that is maintained by IC program manager, multiple site visits to majority of campus to assess safe work practices, creation and implementation of multiple COVID -19 specific policies in addition to modification of existing policie s, primarily related to use of PPE and development of appropriate COVID -19 patients based on their phase of diagnosis, illness and exposure status . Other e xamples of on-going issues include high patient census, implementation of the new electronic healthc are record (EHR) system with its new processes for managing infection and isolation needs, and the multiple current and planned construction activities across the campus. Department of Pharmaceutical Services (DPS, \"Pharmacy\") Major EOC Activities Page 48 of 48 DPS is responsible for ensuring the safety and integrity of pharmaceuticals in medication rooms to comply with the various regulatory requirements (eg. Board of Pharmacy, CDPH -Title 22, TJC). This includes checking the medi cation room for proper labeling and storage, security & documentation of compliance for emergency drug supplies, access to pertinent information (eg. LASA list, High Alert medications list, Do Not Crush list). DPS participates in the twice a mo nth EOC Rounds to identify medication labeling and storage issues and gaps. Accomplishments Provided medications and staffing to COVID Command Center, Containment sites and alternate care sites throughout the city during the COVID -19 pandemic Medication -related information (eg. LASA list, High Alert Med List, Hazardous Drugs, Do Not Crush list) is now readily available electronically on the VDI desktop Continued to work with Materials Management to transition from multi -pack IV fluid bags to single pack thereby mitigating the repeat findings of undated bags that were deemed \"expired.\" Challenges Medication room size and configuration variations from one nursing unit to another, making it difficult to standardize storage processes. Continuing to optimize EPIC functionalities to improve workflow for Nursing and Pharmacy In addition to the listed groups, Andrea Chon, RN, MSN, the nursing liaison for EOC activities requires special recognition fo r actively and aggressively participating in EOC rounds, and taking information and issues raised at EOC Committee meetings back to her peers with nursing management and leadership.
