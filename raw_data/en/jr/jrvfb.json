People are becoming more stressful with worry, tension and anxiety causing so many psychological disorders which hampers the di gestion and is causing hyperacidity, gastritis, dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disorder and anorexia and all these pathological disorders are covered under the broad umbrella of Amlapitta in Ayurveda. Amalpitta is among the 80% of the top 10 life threatening disease of the world that are due to faults in dietary habits. In ayurveda sign and symptoms of Amalpitta mentioned by ayurveda stalwarts looks very similar to GERD and gastritis. In ayurvedic terminology, Agni (digestive fire) is considered as the protector o f the human body while Ama (toxic) is the cause of disease. So, the main cause is the indiscretion in taking food which leads to three types of Doshic (physical energies Vata, Pitta, Kapha) imbalance and found in the Grahini (duodenum) whi ch is considered as the seat of the digestive fire or Agni. It is also said that eating and fasting during indigestion leads to problems like acidity, heartburn, gastritis which is referred as Amalpitta.
