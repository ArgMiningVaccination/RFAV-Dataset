[Spud](/wiki/User:Spud)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Spud)) 04:47, 13 November 2018 (UTC) I've never understood how other people often view patriotism as unyielding admiration and pride for one's country - to me there is no greater devotion or civic responsibility than to be honest of your country's problems, measure their scope and qualities, and dedicate the effort needed to surpass them. The continued pursuit of excellence in all things, to strive for what is greater, to look for new heights is to me a greater love for one's country akin to a parent wanting their child to have a better life than they have. Looking upon the past as a golden age instead of looking to the future as a golden age yet to come, one which challenges us and provides new opportunity for achievement is sad.

An apology[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive296&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] I went and made a user page on a guy I didn't agree with. I posted on his user page instead of his talk page. I barely remember this because I was drunk and upset when I did it. The wiki record is very clear. I was out of line, denied it, and it took me some time to realize that I screwed up. I have some pent up frustrations and anger that I tend to funnel into boards. I also have some very real emotions that I cannot express anywhere else. I am sorry for dumping here like it doesn't matter. I didn't believe I did, but I have been drinking lately, and I checked up on my activity. Turns out I've misplaced some anger and frustration here, and I'm embarrassed about that. I will try harder to respect userspace, because I always wanted that respect myself, and I have not always got that. I will go to the talk page if I have criticisms of a user. I will use a more epistemological approach before I go smacking anybody down. I'm sorry, I did the bad thing. I was too cool for school.

It seems easy to understand, I guess, since everything in the universe is made up of the same base atoms. But then I wonder if people jump to that onto \"you are the universe\" or how the sense of separate and independent things is just an illusion. My guess is that (just to illustrate) that the universe is clay and despite all the different forms it might take it's still just clay and not separate from anything else. That what you mistake to be another object is just the universe, aka clay in this case. It just came into my mind one day when he said that and from what I read in other Eastern philosophy, wanted to see if there was anything to it. [Machina](/w/index.php?title=User:Machina&action=edit&redlink=1) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Machina)) 02:48, 18 November 2018 (UTC) - OK. If you remember what you learned in general physics and chemistry, the atom is the basic unit of ordinary matter. (Don't bother with the more exotic varieties for now.) But there are different kinds of atoms; the periodic table now has over 100 elements. The claim that someone is the Universe just because he or she is made out of the same ingredients makes as much sense as saying you are an ant because your are a carbon-based life-form. Different things can be made from the same building blocks. I understand that some people, such as yourself, find philosophy interesting. However, if you want to truly understand how the Universe works, I recommend studying the physical sciences. Key to science is empiricism, or comparing models, hypotheses, and theories with experiments and observations, and eliminating or refining them accordingly.

A novel I am writing: This is the beginning, tell me what you think[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive296&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] Chapter 1: Romney Edwards returned home after a week long engineering conference in Alaska. The trip was uneventful. It was the middle of the day, Romney expected to see his life partner and children. They were nowhere to be found. Timothy's car was still in the driveway and their children's coats were still on the rack. Even their shoes were still in place. Romney knew they were not on a walk, it was the dead of winter and snow covered the ground. Looking around the house Romney found no signs of forced entry. In the dining room there was three day old Macaroni and cheese on the table. It was lunch. Something was horribly wrong here. There was no scrap of evidence to show that Romney's family even left the fucking house! The bedrooms were completely empty. Romney was now completely terrified. Then he heard an almost demonic voice in his head along with the agonising cries of his family. Romney crossed himself and said a Hail Mary. Then the demonic voice said as clear as day, \"God won't save you or your family. Timothy and your kids are now my family\". Romney grabbed his bottle of holy water and crucifix. He was no priest but Romney would force the probable demon to talk and possibly find his family. Romney shouted as he splattered holy water, \"Demon! Spawn of Satan! Tell me where my family is! In the name of Christ Jesus\"! The voice just laughed, \"You are correct on one thing Romney, I am a demon. I will tell you though that Satan is not real\". Romney froze for a second, fear stabbed him like a burning knife. Then Romney said with bravery, \"Lord God, dispel the darkness from this room and protect me from the night\". The demon found this to be completely amusing. It made a decision though. This choice was part of the demon's plan so it would work out. The demon stated while pretending to be terrified, \"Okay Romney, God is forcing me to give back your family\". Out of the shadows Timothy and the four children came back. At first Romney was completely happy until he noticed that they were covered in bites and blood. Each family member had a horrifying smile. Timothy and the kids attacked Romney then consumed his flesh. Things got worse when the mutilated Romney stood up. Romney and his family went out into the daylight seeking people to consume.

The trip was uneventful. It was the middle of the day, Romney expected to see his life partner and children. Something was off. At first Romney was not overly concerned. He heard the television playing shows from Cartoon Network. Romney's children would watch Cartoon Network often. He saw an open romance novel on the coffee table, Timothy kept his romance novels on that table. Things seemed way off without question. Romney called out for Timothy or the children. No answer just silence. They were nowhere to be found. Timothy's car was still in the driveway and their children's coats were still on the rack. Even their shoes were still in place. Romney knew they were not on a walk, it was the dead of winter and snow covered the ground. Looking around the house Romney found no signs of forced entry. In the dining room there was three day old Macaroni and cheese on the table. It was lunch. Something was horribly wrong here. Romney continued to call out their names. Still no response. The bedrooms were completely empty. Romney pulled out his smartphone to call the police. It was simply to mention that he could not find his family. After the call Romney had to wait 20 minutes for an officer to arrive. In the meantime Romney took some aspirin for a headache he suddenly developed. He figured it was just a tension headache. Waiting for the police to show up seemed to take an eternity. A wave of pain rippled through Romney's head. Every single nerve hurt like crazy. The pain continued. When the police showed up, Romney let the officers in. After introductions the tall Hispanic cop, Officer Elroy Hernandez stated, \"You say your husband and four children went missing, yet there is no evidence that they ever left. The car is in the same place. However, we didn't see the coats on the coat rack. The shoes are gone and there were five sets of footprints in the yard that led to the sidewalk. Mister Edwards, there is nothing out of the ordinary\". The average sized French looking officer, Kyle Le Pine added, \"Sir, it seems that you have not slept in days. Have a nice day and get some rest\". The police left. Romney now had no clue as to his next course of action. Walking through the house he noticed that the coats and shoes were indeed gone. But the footprints in the snow led to the garage and not the sidewalk. This whole thing made no sense. Romney went to his neighbors house to ask if they saw anything. He knocked on the door of Franklin Marshall's house. Franklin opened the door and Romney asked, \"Franklin, have you seen my family\"? Confused, Franklin asked Romney, \"What are you talking about? I was over at your house two hours ago. I was fixing your broken water pipe. Then me and Timothy talked about last night's basketball game at Lansing Christian College. Our boys at the Community College beat them\". Romney said with sheer panic in his voice, \"I cannot find them anywhere. They are gone and the cops told me something completely different\". With a very heavy sigh Franklin said, \"Your husband and kids are playing outside in the yard right now. I don't know what the Hell you are talking about\". With that Franklin shut the door. Romney saw the rotting lunch on the dining room table. Going back to the house Romney saw the three day old lunch. That was there for sure. He left everything in place in hopes of figuring this mystery out. Romney was now desperate. Everything contradicted each other. Around 6:30 p.m. Romney heard some sort of murmur from the kitchen. At least it seemed like the kitchen. In the kitchen Romney heard the murmur again but it the noise now came from the laundry room. He went into the laundry room but the murmur now came from the den. This time Romney was not going to search for the murmur. The headache was not helping. Back in the living room Romney collapsed onto the sofa. The intense agony robbed him of his energy. Waking up, Romney noticed that the murmur began to sound like a voice of sorts. It didn't sound human. He was not even sure if it was a voice. Outside the sun rose. Romney had been up for a few hours but unsurprisingly there was still no sign of anybody. The neighbors just left for work. So he could not contact them. Romney was finally out of ideas. Then the murmur came back, moments later it became an articulated voice. This strange voice stated in an insulating manor, \"Your husband, your three girls and boy joined my family. How about you join us? We had some raw dog flesh for breakfast. Yummy\". Now this was completely absurd. This all had to be one long, night terror. It was the most logical explanation. Yes, it made much more sense. Romney would just have to wake up. As for when he got off the couch, it was a dream within a dream. Not one piece of these events were real. The voice came back, it was laughing. Romney told the voice, \"I am real. I only am manipulating your reality as part of my plan. That is all I will say about it\". Romney laughed himself. That voice was not real. He was in a deep sleep. He grabbed a beer and switched the television to the news. The screen flickers until static was on. Nice. The voice then said, \"Idiot, ignoring me will not make me leave. How about listening to your family\". A symphony of voices filled Romney's head. It was the voices of Romney's family. The sense of relief was gone. Now panic was back. All the original feelings were back along with panic. Unnatural laughter was everywhere. Romney now was considering whether the voice was or was not paranormal in nature. Again the voice returned, \"Know what you are thinking Romney, and you are on the right track. I am paranormal. Keep guessing. Lets see if you can determine what I am\". He went to his bedroom, Romney grabbed his crucifix and holy water. Was Romney going completely insane? Anybody's guess. Rushing downstairs Romney crossed himself. Then he shouted, \"Evil spirit! I may not be a priest like dad wanted but fuck it! The power of Christ compels you\"! Romney splashed holy water all over while waving his crucifix. The voice went silent for a moment. He was confident that the holy water was working. Romney shouted about Jesus again. The voice was annoyed, \"Um really? Are you really serious? Priests time and time again tried exorcisms. They don't work. It has been 400 years since last being annoyed by a human. Let alone someone who was not a priest. Okay, you can have your family back\". Finally the nightmare was over. Everything in the house was back to normal. Timothy and the kids stepped out of the kitchen. Without warning Romney was tackled to the floor. The children were the first to sink their teeth into Romney's flesh. Timothy latched onto Romney's throat. The last thing Romney thought was, \"Just a nightmare. Tomorrow little Gregory has a dentist appointment\". The now cannibalistic family consumed a large amount of Romney's flesh. Moments later Romney stood up to join his family. They went out into the daylight seeking people to consume. -- [Rationalzombie94](/wiki/User:Rationalzombie94) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Rationalzombie94)) 01:08, 20 November 2018 (UTC) - Ok there is a problem here, and that is your novel will be really short if you write like this.

Just saying. \u2014 Dysk ( [contribs](/wiki/Special:Contributions/D)) 14:14, 20 November 2018 (UTC) It is only the first chapter and Romney is not a main character. It is just a start.

You write like a stilted high schooler writing a narrative essay. Your prose stutters. It tries to be punchy and surprising over and over and in the end it feels like nothing at all is happening instead of lots of sudden events. I can't tell if your dialog is meant to be funny, but it's not, which is the worst place to be. We never gain any pathos for your character or grounding to sympathize with them. This partially happens because all their internal monologue is about the situation at hand, which feels very \"tell don't show\". - Some specifics about specific pieces of writing: - \"With a very heavy sigh Franklin said\" should absolutely never be this wordy, unless you want to look and sound like a fanfiction.net writer trying to write a baddass. Just \"Franklin sighed\" please. We lose no descriptive meaning but cut 5 words. - \"I only am manipulating your reality as part of my plan.\" <- a huge violation of show-don't-tell. There's a reason that villains monologing is a tired cliche. A reader should be able to infer the nefariousness of a situation. - Using a very short paragraph for scene change feels stilted and if a reader isn't paying attention they might think that your Franklin character is showing up moments after the police do and why aren't the police still there. - There's absolutely no buildup of the zombies themselves representing any threat. If your target tone is horror, you missed it. Threats that announce themselves aren't threatening. Threats that don't hint that something is out of place aren't threatening. Slow methodical buildup unsettles a reader and can then be punctuated by first relief as concerns about the threat are dismissed, and then you can do your murders. It's very very very hard to do good horror in writing. - If the disembodied voice is your primary antagonist, it should not be introduced so fully. A hint at most. Make people wonder. - I dunno. Again, I'm not a writer, but I think there's some big areas for improvement, more in the general stuff I listed first, but the specifics were things I thought were illustrative.

The first paragraph still doesn't work as an effective attention-grabber. Why should I, the reader, give a shit that this man's business conference wasn't eventful? Secondly, Romney's reactions still escalate way too quickly once the voice shows up. And then there's your writing. This story reads like a police report. Everything is blandly explained to us. The difference between that kind of writing and the level of prose you're going for is detail. I don't want to hear about how Romney waited 20 minutes for the police; I want to read about him pacing in desperate impatience, or constantly looking out the windows, or smashing something against a wall in frustration. I don't want to read about how Romney heard a murmur at 6:30, I want to read about how the strange sound sent chills down his spine for an unknown reason, or how he grabbed a small knife even though he knew it was probably nothing, or how immediately after he heard the sound his headache abruptly got worse. I don't want to read about how Romney's family \"ate a large amount of his flesh.\" Scare me, you motherfucking writer of horror! I want to read about how his kid bites one of his fingers off and gulps it down! I want to read about how Timothy mockingly asks Romney how his business trip went before gouging one of his eyeballs out and slurping on it. I want to read about how Romney is choking on his own blood as one of his own children snaps his jaw down to get at his tongue. These are all just examples of what you could do, of course, but I'm making a point. Detail is essential to story.

It was the middle of the day, Romney expected to see his husband and children. Something was off. At first Romney was not overly concerned. Though Romney had concern. He saw what looked like splattered blood on the carpet, as if a struggle took place. Concern quickly jumped to fear. Who would want to hurt his family? Other than some hate filled gay basher. Timothy was Romney's husband and he was a respected Unity Church minister. Romney worked as a computer engineer and he designed communication devices for the disabled. None of them were bad people. Even worse, none of the kids were around; even Timothy was gone. Several items were scattered around. The romance novel Timothy just bought was torn up. Bits of dried pus were on the ripped pages. Romney then noticed his oldest daughter's favorite hat had footprints on it. He called out the names of his family, no response. Romney pulled out his cellphone to call the police. He told the 911 operator of what happened. After the call Romney had to wait for an officer to arrive. After the call Romney took some aspirin for a headache he suddenly developed. He was not sure if the headache was from jet lag or tension. Waiting for the police to show up seemed to take an eternity. A wave of pain rippled through Romney's head. Every single nerve hurt. It was like someone poked each nerve with a needle. The pain continued. When the police showed up, Romney let the officers in. Both officers searched the entire house but found nothing out of the ordinary. In the living room, the tall officer Elroy Hernandez sat down in the chair across from Romney. Officer Hernandez told Romney, \"You say your husband and four children went missing, yet there is no evidence that they ever left. Then you stated that blood and pus were splattered around. I and my partner saw nothing wrong. My partner is doing a second sweep of the house. We want to be completely sure\". The other Officer by the name of Kyle Belmont came into the living room. Officer Belmont told Hernandez, \"I looked through every inch of this house but there was no indicators of criminal activity\". Hernandez interjected, \"One more thing Mr. Edwards, you told us that you came back from a business trip in Alaska\". Romney wondered what the business trip had to do with anything? It was true that he was tired but not tired enough to hallucinate. The living room fell silent for a little bit until Officer Belmont broke the silence. Belmont asked Romney, \"Are you okay sir\"? After a few more moments Romney told Belmont about the business trip; along with a flight delay. The officers nodded in agreement; both came to the same conclusion- Romney was just delirious from jet lag. On both police walkie talkies there was an urgent call for backup. Officer Hernandez quickly mentioned to Romney, \"We have to leave. An incident is taking place. Have a nice day and get some rest. You are delirious from jet lag. Bye\". Before Romney could say anything the officers were already out the door. Great. Romney knew what he saw. All Romney could do was rationalise the entirety of the supposed events. Maybe what Romney noticed was just a hallucination. Though that did not explain where everyone else went to. Romney decided to ask his neighbor Franklin Marshall. After leaving the house Romney started to cross the street; out of nowhere, a blood soaked woman darted out from in between houses. This woman was screaming like a wounded dog. Just as Romney turned the woman vanished into the shadows; the woman literally disappeared into the shadows. Going towards the spot where the woman ran to Romney found no possible way for someone to flee. Instead of solving that mystery Romney focused on his original task; Romney knocked on Franklin's door. Franklin Marshall opened the door, Romney was standing outside. It was a rare occurrence for Romney to come over. The only time Romney would come over to Franklin's house is if there was an emergency. Romney asked Franklin, \"Have you seen Timothy, Gregory, Amy, Bree or Amelia\"? With a sigh Franklin let Romney into the house. Franklin did not like Romney; however, he was willing to help people in need. Romney told Franklin everything that he went through in the past couple of hours. Franklin did not buy it. It was true that Franklin had not seen Romney's family. That part was certain; but the damage Romney described was a load of nonsense. Franklin told Romney, \"I didn't see the kids or Timothy. Maybe they went for a walk or something? Don't know. Now go home I have to get to class. I have an exam to take\". That did not help Romney get any closer to figuring out what was happening. Romney went back to his house; he was completely and utterly frustrated. No one was helpful. Back inside, Romney made a peanut butter sandwich for dinner. Franklin went outside to his car, he had about 45 minutes until class started. As Franklin started his car there was the sound of a young girl screaming that could be heard close by. Turning his head, Franklin saw a little girl. This girl also had multiple bite wounds that looked weeks old. A squirrel darted out from under the car but the girl grabbed it. This girl began eating this squirrel. Franklin watched in scared fascination. Much of the squirrel was eaten; bones, flesh along with muscle were chewed and swallowed. The girl walked into a shadow. When the sunlight moved, both the shadow and girl were gone. Romney saw the rotting lunch on the dining room table after eating. The rotten food was not there five minutes ago. Romney then heard some sort of sound in his head, followed by an abrupt headache. He needed sleep badly. The last time Romney got sleep was about a day ago. Romney thought he would take a nap on the living room sofa. The planned nap became deep sleep. During Romney's deep sleep there was a voice of indeterminate origin but it spoke English; but the sentences were not articulate. The deep sleep continued; the unknown voice began to speak proper English. Romney heard the voice talking about various people. This voice did not sound aggressive at all north was it directed at Romney; not at first though. The voice turned its attention to Romney. Suddenly the voice yelled, \"Hello Romney! I was just talking with Timothy! Sorry I ignored you\"! Waking up, Romney felt a chill go down his spine. All he knew was that there was a voice during the deep sleep. Then the unknown voice from his dream came back. This voice stated in an insulating manor, \"Your husband, your three girls and boy joined my family. How about you join us? We had some raw dog flesh for breakfast. Yummy\". Now this was completely absurd. This all had to be one long, night terror. It was the most logical explanation. Yes, it made much more sense. Romney would just have to wake up. As for when he got off the couch, it was a dream within a dream. Not one piece of these events were real. The voice came back, it was laughing. There was horrible intentions behind the laughter. Once the laughing stopped the voice spoke, \"I am real. I only am manipulating your reality because it amuses me\". Romney laughed himself. That voice was not real. He was in a deep sleep. He grabbed a beer and switched the television to the news. The screen flickers until static was on. Nice. Now the voice said, \"Idiot, ignoring me will not make me leave. How about listening to your family\". A symphony of voices filled Romney's head. It was the voices of Romney's family. The sense of relief was gone. Now panic was back. All the original feelings were back along with panic. Unnatural laughter was everywhere. Romney now was considering whether the voice was or was not paranormal in nature. Again the voice returned, \"Know what you are thinking Romney, and you are on the right track. I am paranormal. Keep guessing. Lets see if you can determine what I am\". He went to his bedroom, Romney grabbed his crucifix and holy water. Was Romney going completely insane? Anybody's guess. Rushing downstairs Romney crossed himself. Then he shouted, \"Evil spirit! I may not be a priest like dad wanted but fuck it! The power of Christ compels you\"! Romney splashed holy water all over while waving his crucifix. The voice went silent for a moment. He was confident that the holy water was working. Romney shouted about Jesus again. The voice was annoyed, \"Um really? Are you really serious? Priests time and time again tried exorcisms. They don't work. It has been 400 years since last being annoyed by a human. Let alone someone who was not a priest. Okay, you can have your family back\". Finally the nightmare was over. Everything in the house was back to normal. Timothy and the kids stepped out of the kitchen. Without warning Romney was tackled to the floor. The oldest daughter Amelia grabbed Romney's arm; Amelia twisted the left arm until it broke inside the socket. Gregory forced his small hands into Romney's abdomen. Romney screamed as Gregory pulled out pieces of intestine. Bree latched onto Romney's right eyeball with her teeth; she bit down thus popping the eyeball. Amy slammed her body in to Romney's legs; both legs broke. Timothy stepped up as the kids were eating their dad. Just before Romney was completely dead Timothy sarcastically stated to Romney, \"Hope you enjoyed your business trip because you are not happy with being a meal\". The last thing Romney thought was, \"Just a nightmare. Tomorrow little Gregory has a dentist appointment\". The hungry children finished with their meal but the hunger remained. Timothy led the children outside; there were plenty of people to eat in the city. Romney's corpse started to move. Romney used his bloody, broken arms to drag himself around; he wanted to join his family for a meal. -- [Rationalzombie94](/wiki/User:Rationalzombie94) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Rationalzombie94)) 00:31, 21 November 2018 (UTC) Stop RZ: Your writing is unspeakably bad.

I have strong opinions about why that hasn't happened. [ikanreed](/wiki/User:Ikanreed) [Bleat at me](/wiki/User_talk:Ikanreed)19:26, 21 November 2018 (UTC) I have just read [it](https://www.ocasio2018.com/gnd). I think it is refreshingly progressive. She wants the following done within 10 years of the adoption of the plan. - 100% of national power generation from renewable sources Renewable energy is currently responsible for under 20% of U.S. power generation. So this goal is quite ambitious, though not entirely unfeasible. The U.S. has a lot of potential for renewable energy\u2014 such as [2,000 GW of untapped offshore wind power](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2018/11/14/despite-hurdles-offshore-wind-energy-potential-is-generating-hype-in-the-u-s/#623613c28422)\u2014and the industry is booming. It is, however, not a good idea to leave out nuclear power. (While one could make the case that nuclear power is renewable, it is not normally identified as such.) The almost 100 extant nuclear reactors in the U.S. generate approximately 400 GW of power, or 20% of the country's electricity. It is better to replace them with new reactors (Generation III+) rather than renewable power stations, which have lower energy densities, i.e. they require more space. Furthermore, nuclear reactors are the safest source of energy. ( [Source 1](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20928053-600-fossil-fuels-are-far-deadlier-than-nuclear-power/). [Source 2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#3c330ae5709b).) - building a national, energy-efficient, \"smart\" grid; Pretty reasonable. The national power grid also needs to be highly decentralized for reasons of security. Renewable energy makes this easy. - upgrading every residential and industrial building for state-of-the-art energy efficiency, comfort and safety; Expensive, but worthwhile. In any case, this is being done at the local level, though at arguably too slow a pace. - decarbonizing the manufacturing, agricultural and other industries; - decarbonizing, repairing and improving transportation and other infrastructure; - funding massive investment in the drawdown and capture of greenhouse gases; [Carbon capture technology has just gotten a lot more efficient](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44396781). So this is actually quite realistic. High-quality infrastructure plays an inordinately important role in the strength of an economy, any economy, and currently, U.S. infrastructure needs to be upgraded. Many jobs will be created in the process, directly and indirectly. However, one needs to be careful because U.S. construction costs are among the highest in the world, thanks to a combination of poor contracting practices, financial mismanagement, and overly powerful labor unions. New York's [East Side Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_Access) project is a prime example. While she does not mention these explicitly, I'm pretty sure she has [mass transit](/w/index.php?title=Mass_transit&action=edit&redlink=1) and [high-speed rail](/wiki/High-speed_rail) in mind. Better public transportation reduces the number of vehicles on the road, and therefore carbon emissions. The Federal Railroad Administration recently introduced new [rules](https://railroads.dot.gov/newsroom/fra-issues-final-rule-promote-safe-and-efficient-high-speed-passenger-rail-operations) that would allow rail operators to purchase more modern trains that are faster, more energy efficient, and safer. This comes just in time for a mass transit and HSR boom. - making \"green\" technology, industry, expertise, products and services a major export of the United States, with the aim of becoming the undisputed international leader in helping other countries transition to completely carbon neutral economies and bringing about a global Green New Deal. There is much money to be made with green technologies. At present, the U.S. and China are leading the world in renewable energy investments, as they should. I don't see why they should not speed up. (However, while the U.S. has been retiring her coal power plants, [China has been building more, not just at home but also abroad](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46310807).) Regardless of its official stance with respect to the Paris Climate Agreement, [the U.S. has actually reduced its carbon emissions when most other countries have failed to do so](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2018/07/04/four-new-ways-america-is-number-one-in-energy/#58119d6d6e15).

Equally problematic is the image reinforced inKasinga's case that Africans' primitivity is fully to blame for Africa's problems, whether social or economic, and that a heavy dose of \"civilization\" will go far to bring Africa into the modern world.\" - \"In this sense, Kasinga's political asylum in the United States is sought on the grounds that, without the help of the enlightened West, she, like all other African women who come from societies which practice any form of female circumcision could not escape their culture's stricture that they be mutilated, hence perpetuating the same old colonial image that Africans are slaves to their cultural values, which offer no way out for thosewho wish to be free from them. Cultural complexities and heterogeneities are thus avoided entirely. Once that avoidance becomes normalized, is it any wonder that one isleft with an impression that a renewed Western civilizing mission is necessary, since there seems to be no other way of eliminating these \"horrendous\" acts of \"mutilation\"? While the culture-bound (African) body is mutilated, the objective body (Western) is freeand untouched. Given that the media is so quick to present this familiar image of the oppression of \"primitive\" African tradition against the liberating freedom of life in the democratic West, one might wonder to what extent Kasinga cleverly played upon these colonialistimages to help attain her stated \"dreams\" of a relatively affluent lifestyle that was not so attainable at home in Togo.

Surely this cannot be, since it's often performed at childbirth and by definition the women raised in this society will not be able to \"escape their culture's stricture\" should they later regret it, and yet it seems the author is saying exactly that. This author appears to come from a culture that practices it for non-religious reasons as a rite of passage, as many groups do. However I can provide some background on those who do it for religious purposes. The Hanafi school of fiqh considers FGM as mustahabb, encouraged though not required, and the reasoning is quite bluntly that is denies female sexual pleasure, which is seen as a means to ensure women stay virgins until married and then do not cheat. Among colloquial circles it may have the additional benefit of making the woman 'tighter' (at her expense) if the aftermath of the procedure requires stitching. That being said who is actually willing to do this depends. The Grand Mutfi of Egypt issued a fatwa calling for it and was mostly condemned or ignored by Egyptians, where FGM is not common, but in Somalia it is near universal and if challenged will be defended on religious and social grounds - really the same thing, since the argument will be \"Allah commands women to preserve their chastity, and this practice makes sure they do so, so we do it.\" [Lord Aeonian](/wiki/User:Aeonian) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Aeonian)) 16:54, 22 November 2018 (UTC) - \"...is the author saying a woman has a choice in the matter, or that she could just say no to the practice?\" I would not spend too much time trying to understand that text.

In order to cover all time zones, a holiday message appears on RationalWiki 12 hours before the start of the day in UTC. It stays until 12 hours after the day ends in UTC. So when the Thanksgiving message first appeared, it was already Thursday 22 November on some of those little islands in the Pacific, even though it could still have been Tuesday 20 November where you were. The message will automatically disappear when Friday 23 November has finally come to all pats of the word. You don't have to ask anyone to take it away.

Be glad that you only have to cope with four noun cases. The Greek verb, with its imperfect, perfect, aorist, and pluperfect tenses, indicative, subjunctive, and optative moods, and active, middle, and passive voices, all of which will be formed on stems that show extensive ablaut and other variations. Then you get two whole sets of everything, one goes on thematic -o verbs and the others on athematic -mi verbs. It amazes me that such a language could have been spoken by Spartan helots. Seriously, Greek verbs are a real piece of work.

Latin verbs, as you probably know already, have four principal parts. Know those and the whole rest of the setup can be generated; moreover, those parts have recurring patterns to recognize. For Greek verbs, you need to know six parts, and they too fall broadly into families. The saving grace of the system is that neither language really has many 'irregular' verbs; that only means that the irregularities are baked into the 'principal parts' system, but once you have those foundations down the rest of the scheme can be assembled by rule. The personal endings are not that daunting; they resemble one another throughout the paradigms.

Took to French and German pretty quickly in school, but always did much better at reading/listening comprehension than anything involving using the languages myself. I'd just say get a grasp of the verbs and how to recognize them, which everybody else is saying, and then listen to or read anything you can and focus on the organization of sentences around the verbs. [Impertive, me to you] Find every verb you can, even if you don't know what it translates to.

You also don't get to ascribe how they saw this foreign devil as \"peaceful.\" - No, what's criminal is this numbnut thinking he can waltz into a tribe that has literally had no interaction with the outside world and not thinking that if he sneezed, his germs could wipe them out. It's Conquistador levels of dumbfuckery, all because he thought they needed to hear about his invisible friend. Also, criminal by whose standards? Are you applying your definition of law to a tribe that has lived by their laws, on their land, for millennia? Who the fuck do you think you are? - \"Honestly, I'm rooting for the tribals on this.\" As far as I know, this guy was trying to convert the tribe without the use of force. Thinking that the tribe was right to kill him is really crazy. Does trying to convert an isolated tribe without even knowing their language make sense? No, it's stupid and risky. Is killing a man with arrows because it shouts \"believe in Christ\" right? No, it's criminal. - One doesn't need a certificate to call oneself a [missionary](/wiki/Missionary), just like one doesn't need a certificate to call oneself a generic [preacher](/wiki/Preacher).

Either you hold every last country to this standard, or you hold no countries to this standard. They as a country banned him from traveling to their island, he ignored that ruling and went anyway, they punished him for it. Was their method immoral? Probably. Can you hold them legally accountable? Nope. Why? Because your country can't impune on their sovereignty.

Let's set the record straight on many things. Because this is getting annoying. - 1. My thoughts on the border is this. I believe that the these economic migrants should get their citizenship legally. My ancestors came here legally so should they. Why does this concept provoke such a hostile reaction by left-wingers? Lt's go down the list illegal immigration harms our nation, it is such a spit in the face of those who actually did the hard work to earn their citizenship. So then this dumb fuck tries to use two separate circumstances to say I'm a hypocrite. Let me explain the difference. The \"refugees\" from Latin america are in no way the same as the Indian tribe that killed that moron. Let's start with the border, [User:GrammarCommieclaims](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie)that I'm saying that the tribe doesn't have sovereignty and that I don't support them. That's false they could build a wall like Trump and I'd be perfectly okay with it. They shouldn't be prosecuted IF THEY STAY ON THE GODDAM ISLAND! if they step off then they can be prosecuted for manslaughter. That's all I said. Let me ask you something [User:GrammarCommie](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie)if a Native America(Or whatever PC word you'd prefer I use) kills someone on US soil can they avoid justice if they go on the reservation? Well technically, but if they leave they can and should be prosecuted you dumbfuck That's what I was saying. - 2. Since you're bringing this other stuff up let me address it. I don't really care about Abortion. Roe V. Wade is unconstitutional but aside from that large fact I really don't care. I personally oppose it but it should be legal, if maybe not tax payed. As for gamergate you're only dredging that up because I called you out for your hypocrisy on your talk page.

That said, I think he [deserves some props](/wiki/Stopped_clock) for coming in peace rather than trying to convert them to his religion at gunpoint, unlike [some](/wiki/Muhammad) [of](/wiki/Christopher_Columbus) [his](/wiki/British_Empire) [predecessors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire). At the end of the day, I believe what he did [was not malicious, but very stupid.](/wiki/Hanlon%27s_Razor) If only he understood the unintended consequence of bringing 21st-century diseases to a relatively primitive island. I also think the fishermen and even the Indian government itself should have done more to avert this potential disaster to the inhabitants of the island. [G Man](/wiki/User:G_Man) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:G_Man)) 07:26, 29 November 2018 (UTC) - Ultimately, whenever you visit people with the sole purpose of spreading an idea, ideology, religion, new way of doing things, new way of seeing the world etc. is that there is a very real danger...and that danger is both to you and to the other people. I do wish he would have had the chance to live and be fruitful and that his parents didn't have to suffer the horror of a son, killed and his body dragged around. But... No matter how certain you are of the ideas you transmit nor how sure you are that they may benefit people and be successful...you cannot be completely sure they will benefit the people and one should recognise that when doing this, you are placing both you and the people who visit in danger. I don't believe this poor young man considered it. Some ideologies (and most religious ones) feed into an overwealming confidence and certainty that their ideas are not just true but will always help others willing to listen. No doubt he as with so many before were blind to this and that the idea that they were putting the people into contact in danger, never ever occurred to him. It's religious/ideological arrogance. He knew the risks to himself, took those risks and ended up dead. Tragic for him and his family...pretty unsurprising to everyone else. He didn't question his overall plan enough to the point where he rigorously challenged his mission and the potential fall outs and almost put the people in very serious danger of near extinction. The lesson should be clear but the thing about Missionaries is they continue with the basic principles of spreading the good news which were used 2000 years ago and an almost wilful shutting out of the failures, disasters, mass suffering, destruction and human collateral that come the good news idea-salesmanship.

For those who have NetFlix-- and who actually give a damn-- one might do worse than to check out a program on said service called \"The Toys That Made Us\".

Yes, global. Nothing in it about sinister sexist plots to undercut women, though.

So that what is real doesn't change but what is an illusion does? It just seems like an assumption based on \"i said so\". From what I have learned reality is \"the way things are\" and in that case it's that things change. If they didn't then they would be an illusion. Thoughts?

[Machina](/w/index.php?title=User:Machina&action=edit&redlink=1)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Machina)) 23:33, 25 November 2018 (UTC) - In the Hindu faith, illusion generally equates with Maya, originally the power with which a god can make human beings believe in what turns out to be an illusion, or, the force which creates the cosmic illusion that the phenomenal world is real. To express this in western terms, the illusion is not real, only existing in the mind of the people experiencing it. Thus, reality is \"how things are\" in the physical realm, as opposed to what is effectively clouded perception in the minds of those affected by \"illusion\". The key thing is that the illusion has no form outside of the mind. Of course what is reality can change, but that is not taken into account in the Hindu faith, which is approximately that \"Brahman\" is the one true state, or the \"the one reality\". It is expressed as static in that sense. \u2014 Dysk ( [contribs](/wiki/Special:Contributions/D)) 00:37, 26 November 2018 (UTC) - Sounds like nonsense to me.

However the same station has a philosophy universitary teacher who has a nice collection of epic fails when mixing physics and astronomy witht the Bible) talking about the End Times (you know the storyboard too well: Adam and Eve, Noah and the Flood and this being much worse, Rapture, 144,000 lucky ones, one thousand years of Jesus' reign as a first taste of the brainwashing awaiting to those fortunate enough once everything goes to dev/null), Lake of Fire, Mark of the Beast, God being just because everyone would see if his name is written in the Book of Life (ie: if they believed or not), people are lost because they do not believe, blah, blah). Nothing new until the man mentioned deserts becoming lush lands (fuck those ecosystems) and the Battle of Armaggedon being a match between a 200 million strong army formed by the ones of India, Japan, and China that would fight against Satan after the latter had defeated the ones of Russia and the Arabic countries just to join Satan in order to stop the Second Coming (non-Christian (read: non-Fundagelical) countries which should give a hint). I seriously wonder if that asshole knows something about the logistics that such an army would need, not to mention I very seriously doubt they'd have enough manpower to raise it (and if the still existing frictions between Japan and other Asiatic countries after WWII would not ruin the effort). Naturally they dislike amillenianism.

I read that [you must take PrEP daily for it to work](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep.html) - 2) I agree that PrEP is cheaper than HIV treatments, but treating a healthy individual with PrEP still costs more than other HIV prevention methods. Such costs are probably exorbitant to prevent HIV in third world countries - 3) That is a case in which I see PrEP as a good option: If one is in a stable relation with an HIV-positive partner. But that's no the general case. [Thinker](/wiki/User:UnlicensedThinker)( [unlicensed](/wiki/User_talk:UnlicensedThinker)) 16:37, 1 December 2018 (UTC) - 1 it really depends on your circumstance. if you continually at risk of infection ie, long term partner, you a sex worker, or you just like to party, you need it in your system. if you just like to go crazy at the sauna once a month you dont - few days bfore so its in your system, a few days after to catch any residues traces. if you are no longer at risk you do not need to keep taking the stuff. - 2 this is all kind of dependant on having an effective health system in the first place - thats going be the case on literally every health issue everywhere all the time and you will have to rely on condoms, and its never been suggested that this will end hiv forever. the point on cost is you can stop stop taking prep when you are not a risk. infection means a lfe long commitment of daily medication, hospital visits, and associated health difficulties. if you are at risk and you have the option, prep is there. condoms are still there too. preventing that infection in the first. condoms have not been working, the same way abstainence does not work. it sets impossible standards. everywhere where drives for condoms, 'healthy' sexual practises happen, infection rates initially drop then they creep up and up. and lets be clear, prep is only usually offered if you are at risk. if you are a good boy, are monogamous, never too pissed, hold everything while you find a rubber, make all the good life choices then congratulations you can sleep well in your ivory tower, because you wont ever need prep in the first place - you were never at risk. those at risk - its another layer of protection, an effective one. its a puritanical argument to say, well condoms are fine, how about a bit of self control? it condemns people for human failings, it increases the inevitable drain on resources of infection, and makes infection more common because people get infected when they need not increasing the resorvoir. then suddenly you at risk too because its no longer gays and drug users with it. - 3 see point 2. its for those risk. no one is suggesting the virginal mother reilly, whole life in a nunnery should dose up in case she gets a bit frisky on the benedictine. some communities are more at risk than others. some idiviuals. people are human. they have human failings. they make poor choices. they sometimes get dealt a shitty hand. prep helps prevent compounding those problems. if we all could live as saints there would be no need for many things. we cannot, and must face reality. [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 17:24, 1 December 2018 (UTC) - 1) If I had to guess, I would say that there is some time window within if you take PrEP you are protected, so what you said would make sense. However I keep finding sources recommending a daily dose, and without knowing how long such time window would be I cannot speculate. - 2) The type of health system can help lowering the cost for the single individual, by moving it to the community, but the cost doesn't disappear. This is why I see PrEP not suited for HIV prevention in third world countries, for example. - The rest of what you wrote seems a rebuttal to an argument I never made. [Thinker](/wiki/User:UnlicensedThinker)( [unlicensed](/wiki/User_talk:UnlicensedThinker)) 17:59, 1 December 2018 (UTC) - i not really sure the relevence of third world countries to cost. if you cant afford it, you can t afford it - the choice has already been made. there are more issues there than prep. for those fortunate enough to be in areas of the world with functioning health systems the cost of condoms vs prep? as a flat price, without regard for the potential costs of their results, the reasons why some results are better than others? sure condoms probably cheaper. at the outset. but you need to look at the outcomes. prep substantially reduces infections. that means substantially less spent on drugs. substantially less of a drain on resources. substantially less of a human cost - then hands down prep wins. the 'argument you never made' is if condoms work why fund prep? you need context to answer that, and that context further answers the more unspoken question of 'why fund a drug so people can party/do things unpalatable to my sensibilities?' - this is an argument that you have made, not so bluntly, but essentially - elsewhere it is made by others more strongly, more knowingly. you cannot answer these questions if you just look at the balance sheet, but it does make it easier to make choices that brutally punish many people for the most human of failings.

It's hard to accurately measure their effectiveness because it depends on so many factors (including correct use), but studies give figures of anything from 69%-94% at preventing transmission where one partner is seropositive. Regarding third world countries I was thinking about projects funded by first world countries to help them. Of course third world countries cannot afford PrEP by their own. \"'why fund a drug so people can party/do things unpalatable to my sensibilities?' - this is an argument that you have made, not so bluntly, but essentially\" No, I didn't. Feel free to write a rebuttal, but I didn't make such argument. As far as my understanding goes: For people at daily or at most weekly risk of HIV contagions (sex workers, who has a stable partner with HIV, operators with at strict contact with HIV patients...), PrEP is a good option. For people at occasional risk of HIV contagion, PrEP doesn't seem significantly better than condoms. For massive HIV prevention, like in third world countries, PrEP is probably too expensive and complicate to administer, so that funding traditional HIV prevention methods would be more effective. [Thinker](/wiki/User:UnlicensedThinker)( [unlicensed](/wiki/User_talk:UnlicensedThinker)) 19:40, 1 December 2018 (UTC) - sorry but yes you did make that argument 'Consequentially, I don't see many situations where PrEP would be a better approach to HIV prevention than using condoms and reducing risky sexual behaviors.' your words. its further made where you state situations where you believe prep would appropriate - drs and nurses, the monogamous with a partner who is postive, sex workers. thats paragons of virtue and thoswe compelled by circumstance into a bleak existance. sex workers aside, the faithful lover and medical professionals seem only at risk from their own selflessness. these are not the centre of massive spikes in infection rates. drs and nurses are not even at risk - they know to avoid needlestick injuries and they can be better dealt with via pep (post exposure prophaltic, in case you assumed a typo). im not sure how you are gauging 'occasional risk' when you compare someone in a stable relationship with someone whose hiv status is known (we know that it is those who are UNAWARE of their status are the ones overwhelmingly more likely to pass on an infection) to your average gay male deep into the party scene multiple partners, cocktails of drugs? this is the at risk group, and its just false to say prep isnt significantly better when its had an overwhelming effect with massive drops infection rates. see the link above. its this group that have been buying prep on the internet before it was even offered on the nhs. its why we even know what prep is. infection rates actually spiked in the murkier part of the gay world before prep hit the scene,now they are lower than they've ever been. and i should stress my examples are generally from the gay world, a particular aspect of it especially at risk because i am steeped in that world. their are other communities with equal amounts risk i just cannot comment on - i can claim no insight in the various ethnic communities similarly blighted or how cultures put them at risk. i know there is an element of coercion - the guy just wont use condoms dont you trust him? (hes been sleeping around). is there not enough risk there? the london experience has provided such postitive effects that you cant just hand wave it away as 'not significant' and a poor assessment of the risks actual real people find themselves in. you need to look a little deeper [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 20:50, 1 December 2018 (UTC) - Saying \"Consequentially, I don't see many situations where PrEP would be a better approach to HIV prevention than using condoms and reducing risky sexual behaviors\" is different from \"why fund a drug so people can party/do things unpalatable to my sensibilities?\" You can see that, for example, because in the first sentence there's no mention to my sensibilities, while in the second they are central. If you don't see that, then we cannot have a conversation. [Thinker](/wiki/User:UnlicensedThinker)( [unlicensed](/wiki/User_talk:UnlicensedThinker)) 09:48, 2 December 2018 (UTC) - can you really not see what can be inferred from what you said? I mean, if i've drawn the wrong conclusion from that then maybe clarify. Its a conclusion reinforced by other things you said. Yes, your statement with its reference to risky sexual behaviours is different to mine with its reference to sensibilities. But only in phrasing. they amount to the samething, a point made clearer when you dont ignore what i said immediately before and after, stripping it of context. If you want quibble about semantics, then you are correct -we cannot have a conversation [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 15:21, 2 December 2018 (UTC) - I already clarified: I never made such an argument.

[Thinker](/wiki/User:UnlicensedThinker)( [unlicensed](/wiki/User_talk:UnlicensedThinker)) 16:57, 2 December 2018 (UTC) - The program is not specifically designed for those who regularly engage in reckless sex (though it is an important demographic) but is for any and all LGTB who engage or will engage in men with men sex. Those who participate in the project range from this charicature description of \"gay men who party irresponsibly and take the drug so they can ditch the condom\", which by the way is extremely degrading and offensive, to those who have a rare slip-up, to those who are always careful and safe, to those who are still virgins and want to take precautions (which is pretty sensible). The prep program is meant to compliment other HIV avoidance programs including distributing free condoms and numerous educational programs (both of which have been very successful). When I hear someone say \"I'm on the prep\" this doesn't communicate to me \"I'm a reckless horn dog who likes skin to skin ejaculation\" but says \"I'm informed and I'm careful about it\" because saying this to a possible sex partner is a great icebreaker and helps bring up the subject for a quick and frank talk about their attitudes towards safe sex. This program has been extremely successful and it has saved millions upon millions in future HIV treatment and definitely some lives. I cannot think of a single reason to not continue with the program in other countries, that is, unless you believe the nasty steotypes of LGTB men who praise the pills as a way to not have to cover up anymore. It happens. It is not however the point of the program. And money aside...isn't it a good thing to avoid the spread of HIV? Even if it did cost more than possible HIV treatment in the future (which it doesn't)? [Shabi](/wiki/User:Shabidoo) [DOO](/wiki/User_talk:Shabidoo)21:47, 2 December 2018 (UTC) - i can't say im entirely say im entirely convinced about people not using prep as a reason to skip the rubber. My point is they were skipping it anyway. Condom usage has been declining for years, and australia that decline saw a sharp increase after prep. Condom usage has always declined after the intial upsurge after a campaign. Tutting in disapproval only ever gets us far. My argument has always been its a irrelevant for people to complain about the reasons some maybe taking prep when lower infection rates benefits everyone. It makes everyone safer. I also find it a little rich that when people complain about the promiscuity of gay men. Ifs its such a big deal for them maybe should have let us get married earlier. They never wanted to respect our relationships, then get upset when you dont settle down. Cunts. [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 22:55, 2 December 2018 (UTC) - Guys, nobody here is making moral judgements on gay sex. I understand that often people do, but since this conversation isn't the case, I don't see the point of reiterating that the \"promiscuous HIV spreading gay\"-stereotype is wrong. We are in agreement on that, so let's focus on PrEP. - @ [Shabidoo](/wiki/User:Shabidoo)\"...to those who are always careful and safe, to those who are still virgins and want to take precautions (which is pretty sensible)\" In such cases it seems to me that the protection given by PrEP is not worth the effort. I mean, taking everyday an expensive pill, for reducing the already low probability of contracting HIV using condoms on few sex intercourse? - \"And money aside...isn't it a good thing to avoid the spread of HIV?\" Of course is a good thing, but money are finite. I'm not saying that not a penny of third countries aids should be spent on PrEP, but I'm wondering how much should be spent to obtain the better results. Obviously with the same money we can buy more condoms that PrEP. [Thinker](/wiki/User:UnlicensedThinker)( [unlicensed](/wiki/User_talk:UnlicensedThinker)) 14:09, 3 December 2018 (UTC) - i honestly dont understand what you want here. You started this thread to discuss prep. We are discussing prep. Discussing prep means you discuss gays and promiscurity, you discuss sex and drugs, what is or isnt moral. Thats it. Nothing else. It all of that. You want to talk about cost? Fine, talk about cost because you will talking about gays and sex. There is no argument on cost that is not fundementally about gays and sex. None. Why, for example, if its too costly why are birth control pills funded? Why are a whole host minor ailments and measures funded? Why is prep not or shouldnt? No answer that does not involve gays and sex. If you say its not cost effective for some groups, then guess what? You will be talking about gays and sex. And there is no sense in talking about the third world and the cost of prep. Its pointless to consider anywhere with spotty healthcare, huge cultural issues and other major issues make its effectiveness neglible. Even in the US, you have to factor in health coverage and massive disparities along racial lines. We can discuss places where infrastructure is in place for prep to be viable. For me, thats london, where a disproportionate amount of cases are with gay men. Gays and sex. [AMassiveGay](/wiki/User:AMassiveGay)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:AMassiveGay)) 16:38, 3 December 2018 (UTC) - You rush to conclusions to quickly. I never said that we don't have to talk about gay and sex, I said that we don't have to reiterate \"that the promiscuous HIV spreading gay-stereotype is wrong\" since we are in agreement. - Regarding third world countries, I have already said that I'm talking of PrEP funded by first world countries. If a humanitarian project has a certain budget to help a third world country reducing HIV, how much should be spent on condoms and how much on PrEP to maximize the results? I would guess more on condoms.

He said that PrEP is indeed used as a kind of emergency pill after unprotected sex, but that it is better to take it constantly. Precisely, before starting PrEP one should have at least a month of abstinence and three tests to be sure that he is HIV-negative (because taking PrEP while HIV-positive can make what he called \"resistances\" to the treatment), and when it's started PrEP should not be interrupted without asking a doctor.

[Thinker](/wiki/User:UnlicensedThinker)( [unlicensed](/wiki/User_talk:UnlicensedThinker)) 17:10, 5 December 2018 (UTC) - and where do we go from here? what is you are trying to get at? at almost every step ive given a view or make point, tried to add context or perspective. i cant say how useful that was because it was flat out ignored because 'thats not what i said!!!' i clarify, i explain what i meant, where your argument led, what else needs to considered, i ask you what you meant, 'thats not what i said!!!' jesus christ, throw me a fucking bone here. i have no clue what your point is here. what direction are you coming from? we are talking about things here that are directly relevant to the lives of my friends and my own, about one of the few things on this site where i feel that i may have actual useful insight from actual direct and relevant experience. a different perspective, or counter argument would be great, necessary even, but you give me nothing to work with. i am literally questioning my sanity right now and this has not helped at all - first, lets kill this third world countries. ive answered this twice already. go back, read them both, understand them, look and your question and see why its idiotic. done that? see what i mean? just to be certain, i'll clarify again. the third world, dozens of unconnected countries, beset by varying problems of all kinds, of which hiv/aids is a literally apocolyptic one, countries where healthcare is often inadequate, out of date, or entirely absent, where infrastructure in general is poor or absent, governance ranges from poor to corrupt to genocidal, wars and insurrections are rife, in that context, the relevance of asking 'condoms or prep', your hypothetical dilemma? its only a question for places set up for its effective use. im not coming back to this, that one is done. - i honestly dont understand what you want here. You started this thread to discuss prep. We are discussing prep. Discussing prep means you discuss gays and promiscurity, you discuss sex and drugs, what is or isnt moral. Thats it. Nothing else. It all of that. You want to talk about cost? Fine, talk about cost because you will talking about gays and sex. There is no argument on cost that is not fundementally about gays and sex. None. Why, for example, if its too costly why are birth control pills funded? Why are a whole host minor ailments and measures funded? Why is prep not or shouldnt? No answer that does not involve gays and sex. If you say its not cost effective for some groups, then guess what? You will be talking about gays and sex. And there is no sense in talking about the third world and the cost of prep. Its pointless to consider anywhere with spotty healthcare, huge cultural issues and other major issues make its effectiveness neglible. Even in the US, you have to factor in health coverage and massive disparities along racial lines. We can discuss places where infrastructure is in place for prep to be viable. For me, thats london, where a disproportionate amount of cases are with gay men. Gays and sex. - i can't say im entirely say im entirely convinced about people not using prep as a reason to skip the rubber. My point is they were skipping it anyway. Condom usage has been declining for years, and australia that decline saw a sharp increase after prep. Condom usage has always declined after the intial upsurge after a campaign. Tutting in disapproval only ever gets us far. My argument has always been its a irrelevant for people to complain about the reasons some maybe taking prep when lower infection rates benefits everyone. It makes everyone safer. I also find it a little rich that when people complain about the promiscuity of gay men. Ifs its such a big deal for them maybe should have let us get married earlier. They never wanted to respect our relationships, then get upset when you dont settle down. Cunts. - The program is not specifically designed for those who regularly engage in reckless sex (though it is an important demographic) but is for any and all LGTB who engage or will engage in men with men sex. Those who participate in the project range from this charicature description of \"gay men who party irresponsibly and take the drug so they can ditch the condom\", which by the way is extremely degrading and offensive, to those who have a rare slip-up, to those who are always careful and safe, to those who are still virgins and want to take precautions (which is pretty sensible). The prep program is meant to compliment other HIV avoidance programs including distributing free condoms and numerous educational programs (both of which have been very successful). When I hear someone say \"I'm on the prep\" this doesn't communicate to me \"I'm a reckless horn dog who likes skin to skin ejaculation\" but says \"I'm informed and I'm careful about it\" because saying this to a possible sex partner is a great icebreaker and helps bring up the subject for a quick and frank talk about their attitudes towards safe sex. This program has been extremely successful and it has saved millions upon millions in future HIV treatment and definitely some lives. I cannot think of a single reason to not continue with the program in other countries, that is, unless you believe the nasty steotypes of LGTB men who praise the pills as a way to not have to cover up anymore. It happens. It is not however the point of the program. And money aside...isn't it a good thing to avoid the spread of HIV? Even if it did cost more than possible HIV treatment in the future (which it doesn't)? - I already clarified: I never made such an argument. If you want that I make it clearer: I'm not going to make an argument based on my sensibilities (Why should I?) - can you really not see what can be inferred from what you said? I mean, if i've drawn the wrong conclusion from that then maybe clarify. Its a conclusion reinforced by other things you said. Yes, your statement with its reference to risky sexual behaviours is different to mine with its reference to sensibilities. But only in phrasing. they amount to the samething, a point made clearer when you dont ignore what i said immediately before and after, stripping it of context. If you want quibble about semantics, then you are correct -we cannot have a conversation - Saying \"Consequentially, I don't see many situations where PrEP would be a better approach to HIV prevention than using condoms and reducing risky sexual behaviors\" is different from \"why fund a drug so people can party/do things unpalatable to my sensibilities?\" You can see that, for example, because in the first sentence there's no mention to my sensibilities, while in the second they are central. If you don't see that, then we cannot have a conversation. - Actually homophobia manifests itself in unconscious bias. Happens all the time. First, it is not true that people have a tiny probability of contracting STD even when having safe sex. Especially for the passive partner the rate of condom failure is actually quite high and if the active partner has HIV then the possibility of contracting it is higher than you think. Those with multiple partners, yet still safe and protected, climb up the probability ladder and yes, the prep program is useful. In England, post prep program, new cases of HIV transmission was a small fraction of the previous years. The rate of new infections going down has a knock-out effect. If someone is as careful as possible yet still contracts HIV they may pass it on to other people who are also as careful as can be (short of abstinence) because daily HIV tests are also impractical (and expensive). The program is not just effective for those who engage in reckless sex but for those who practice safe sex who have an admittedly small chance of HIV contraction...but by no means miniscule. - I'm not saying this is the case for anyone arguing against the cost of Prep here...but I have most certainly noticed a bias against treatments which are pricey in some countries and yet seem to have no problem with expensive preventative programs with anyone else. If cost was really the issue we'd be talking about something else. It comes from an unconscious bias that manifests itself in many ways. I've known people who even have no problem with non-elective surgery paid for by healthcare and yet complain about the cost of Prep for gay men, the only program they have ever complained about cost and the only medical cost I have ever heard complaints about, in my life. Preventative medicine is quite expensive, screening for rare cancers, vaccines for nearly eradicated diseases etc. Expensive programs for something people are very unlikely to suffer, expensive, and yet no one is much bothered by that. - The cost of the program depends wildly on the country to you live in. Prep is pretty cheap in some European countries because the government negotiates very hard with pharmaceuticals and despite humming and hawing from the Pharmaceuticals like \"we cannot afford to bother with your market if the price is lower than this\", in they end they do bother with that market with a fraction of their \"lowest possible price\". It is usually substantially cheaper than what states mostly pay in the US, to a lesser extent in Canada and Australia. If saving money is really at the top list of concerns then I would recommend fighting against high drug prices, government apathy towards pharmeceuticals, buying insanely expensive experimental machinery, and even corruption regarding pharmaceuticals and borderline-cosmetic surgery being covered by a public system. Not a preventative HIV program that has been wildly successful and need not be expensive at all so gay men stop contracting HIV at an alarming rate. Why is this one of the only times people complain about the cost?

More condoms, you cry. there is no shortage of them. you can buy them in any store. you dont need to though, there bowls full of them, free, next to the peanuts at every bar i go into, handed out free at the clinics where you get tested, or you can get them sent free to your home after asking on line. they will continue to be so available, with or without prep. the advice to use condoms, to get tested - is everywhere, hammered into us constantly since 'dont die of ignorance' leaflets were posted through peoples doors, and will continue to be with or without prep. quibbling about medical best practice or calling for things we are already doing is not an argument for or against prep.

Canadians are surprised by how high the prices are in Spain. People from Spain note the higher price in the UK and British people note how higher prices are in France. In effect (depending on what state in the US you are from) gas costs nearly 2.5 times as much in France than in the US. Most of this is taxes. I remember while living in Canada if we were near the US border we'd hop over to New York or New Hampshire and fill it up (and buy affordable liquor and other goods). The savings were enormous. In any case, imagine how much paying 250% more for gas would affect your life.

Furthermore, the TGV is too expensive for many to use, and its low-cost service, Ouigo, has yet to break even. Both require subsidies.

If only I knew how to start an infomercial, and there was somebody or something that could deal with my misery and or angst without just asking if I have it and strawmanning the symptoms! But I, myself, don't have time for that! If anybody has the answer to how to deal with the existential dread I feel every time I hear about the self-described \"intellectual dark-web\" or the self-described \"Ku-Klux-Klan\" that all have active platforms, without me actually having to read or listen to any of it anymore, I'm paying! I mean, I'd pay good money if I had it to not deal with the repercussions of hateful, ignorant speech. I would also pay if I could ask each member of the Eric-Weinstein-nominated \"intellectual dark web\" if they really like being associated with the term \"dark web,\" a place where you buy drugs and hitmen and child porn, by a guy who happily works for a real human who wants to replace his own blood with children's blood to extend his own life, on a libertarian paradise island. If only there was a service that could meet my needs! If only somebody could take me to the libertarian paradise island! Infomercial go? Timeshare? Anybody> - If you're looking for pure, concentrated angst instead, perhaps you might be interested in MISERYTM, a brand-new product by LunaCorp!
