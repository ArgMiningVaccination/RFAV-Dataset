The Founders of Terrain Natural Medicine Dr. Emily Wiggins My goal is to help you feel better so you can live the life you want. In order to do that well, I want to hear your story. I have the medical training to assess and diagnose and treat you but it's the art of medicine that will really help me guide your body to lasting health. I want to listen to how you got to be where you are and to understand your experience. This will help me individualize your care and develop a plan that suits you, your needs and who you are, as a whole. Period. Now, let's get you feeling better! Dr. Kelcie Rosendahl I believe that you have the right to experience freedom within your own body, however that looks and feels to you. My dog is my world, I spend as much time as I can in the outdoors (preferably climbing rocks), believe in the power of community and honest conversations, consider movement as a form of medicine (be it stretching, walking, or running), and am driven by both my love for the natural world, and hope for what naturopathic medicine can bring to not only your life, but the world at large. What People Are Saying \"My experiences working with Dr. Wiggins to achieve optimal body-mind health and address longstanding wellness-related obstacles has been truly excellent.

Those are qualities I hope for when seeking out a medical professional. With Dr. Rosendahl, you get that, and then some. I highly recommend Dr. Rosendahl if you are looking for a doctor that is willing and able to find the underlying issues to your medical challenges\" \u2014 Rob M. \"I met with Emily periodically throughout my pregnancy. Having her on my team gave me so much confidence that I was doing everything possible to support my body and my baby's growing body. After the birth of my healthy baby girl, I also met with Emily postpartum to focus on what I needed to replenish my body and to support nursing. I am now 7 months postpartum and my baby and I are thriving, we definitely owe that to Emily's guidance and expertise in women's health.\" \u2014 Sarah L. \"I have been a patient of Dr Rosendahl for a few years, and I can honestly say she is hands down the most positive, genuine, and knowledgeable Dr I've ever had.
