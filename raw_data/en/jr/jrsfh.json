Maine is experiencing extreme scarcity of blood products to support patients should they have a bleed or hematoma from a deep muscle injection. Thus, strong considerations and judicious clinical discretion is advised for those patients who may be at risk for bleeding from a deep muscle injection. Contraindications for administration in patients who otherwise meet the eligibility per EUA criteria include: Clinically significant heritable bleeding disorder or bleeding diathesis despite a normal platelet count. Platelet count <20,000/uL . drug(s), or heparin agents,unless they can be safely held in advance. Dual antiplatelet therapy for stent or other considerations. As experience with this drug expands and as stress on the blood supply lessens, these parameters will be re -evaluated.Oral and IV outpatient treatment for COVID -19Overview of oral and IV therapies Class Oral Intravenous Antivirals Paxlovid x Paxlovid Authorization FDA has issued an EUA for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID -19 in adults (12 years of age and older weighing more than 40 kg) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID -19, including hospitalization anddeath, Paxlovid may only be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, andphysician assistants thatarelicensed orauthorized under state lawtoprescribe drugs inthe towhich (two 150 mgtablets) with 100 mgritonavir (one 100 mgtablet) for 5days. eGFR <30mL/min: Currently notrecommendedContraindications and Precautions History of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions to theactive ingredients oranyother components.

If supplies cannot be provided to all moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals because of logistical constraints or supply limitations, the Panel suggests prioritizing their use for those who are least likely to mount an adequate response to COVID- 19 vaccination or SARS -CoV-2 infection and who are at risk for severe outcomes. 1COVID -19Treatment Guidelines, SeeNIHStatement onPatient Prioritization forOutpatient TherapiesWho is at risk for severe disease?
