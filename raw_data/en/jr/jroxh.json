This supplement contains the raw root ingredient, not the traditionally prepared composition. So far I mostly feel more energetic and less stressed. I take it with water before launch. The pill is medium size. It doesn't leave an after taste, but it does have an earthy smell (similar to cut grass). The product feels high quality and the price is affordable. The bottle and packaging is pretty good. It has an easy to use flip cap and the bottle uses recycled plastic (good for the environment). In summary, it feels a good value product and I'll order it again. I've struggled with hair loss for more than twenty five years and did not expect these to work at all but at less than fifteen bucks for 100 capsules and a lot of good reviews, figured not? I was gobsmacked when around three months later, fuzzy new growth started thickening up my hairline. Wouldn't be without them now and my son - whose father is as bald as an egg- is taking them now too,in case he got his dad's dodgy genes. Might take a few decades to know for sure tho so don't expect an update until 2050 ;) I kid you not, three months after starting these I noticed a bunch of new growth around my hairline. This has high-quality ingredients. Doesn't matter your age it's a good thing to take it's actually a type of ginseng which everyone should be taking if not this kind take a different kind. The packaging is cute. The benefit is pretty noticeable in a male if he has problems with in potency. He should see an improvement on this supplement. I don't know that there are any concerns but talk to your doctor if you have them. There is no taste you swallow this .ginseng should really be a part of everyone's diet. Have a great day please thumbs up good luck I'm so happy to have found this supplement! I love it. Add this to your diet if you want strong beautiful dark hair! It's improved my energy, and will benefit your hair tremendously! Packaging is cute and small and the quality is amazing! No concern for after taste and the ingredients seem authentic He-shou-wu or Fo-Ti is a traditional ingredient in Chinese medicine for hair. I have found this product very effective in reducing hair loss and keeping the hair healthy (different hairdressers over the years have commented on how healthy my hair is even when I do a home job every 4 weeks to lighten my hair). I have been taking Fo-Ti everyday for 15 years now and my hair is going grey at a much slower pace than my younger siblings'. I feel good about this brand since using this product though not all of my hair is blackened but about 30% of my hair has been blackened so far. I saw people mentioned in their review that consuming coffee is not making this product effective as much as possible in blackening hair. I drink coffee daily so hope the producer should confirm the side effect of coffee and should advise consumer whether or not coffee shouldn't be consumed or the daily limit of coffee amount that can be consumed with this product to be more effective in blackening hair. thanks I'm taking these for post-viral hairless I'm experiencing. It's vast and distressing! I was using a TCM tincture that had Fo-Ti has it's first ingredient, it was helping immensely (energy wise too) but unfortunately it was too expensive to continue. I bought these not thinking they'd do much but to my surprise the bald/sparse patches around the crown of my head continued to fill in. I'm not shedding as much either. Fo-ti is also known as \"he shou wu,\" which means \"the black-haired Mr. He.\" I bought it because they said they would make black hair. It's a Chinese herbal medicine that calls Hasuo. It's also good for hormonal balance. I try to not take too much Herbal Medicine because it is bad for the liver. I read that the possible toxicity is a burden on the liver. I don't take it whole year. I finished one bottle and need to rest for few months and take it again. So, I'm a post-menopausal woman in my 60s who is worried about my receding hairline. BUT not as worried as I was! I am on my second tub now, so it's taken a while, but I have a lot less hair loss (my parting isn't looking as wide), my hair is thicker and my receding patches at the sides are less than they were. Didn't think I would be, but I'm pretty impressed! I have seen no change in the colour of my roots as other reviewers mention, but less hair loss is making me happy. It's an easy capsule to take. I would suggest sticking with it for a while before you decide if it works for you. "}
