As the increasing internet adoption further strengthens the opportunity matrix, we see these interventions translating into a bigger outreach for IndiaMART going forward. While keeping our eyes firmly on our long-term goals, we continued to make strategic investments in building the ecosystem to enable businesses and facilitate online commerce in the long term. Our path for strong growth is clearly defined and we strive for greater success as we move into the next phase of the journey for the transformation of businesses.The transformation journey on which we, at IndiaMART, embarked more than two decades ago, scaled new heights during FY 2022. Taking giant leaps in the new environment catalysed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we innovated contemporary solutions by embracing new technologies and automation tools to address the emerging needs of suppliers and buyers in response to the dynamically changing external eco-system.Empowering Businesses Message from MD & CEO Dear Shareholders As you are aware, this financial year witnessed major transformation in the Indian Economy. From being impacted by COVID-19 Wave 2 in Q1 to a phase of recovery by Q4, it witnessed many troughs and crests. We, at IndiaMART, moved with agility to cater to the changing external dynamics and the evolving needs of our stakeholders during the year. Our role evolved from helping the nation fight pandemic at the start of the year to contributing to economic growth and fast-paced recovery by the end of the year. We closed the year with a wave of excitement as we saw good recovery and invested significantly in strengthening our capabilities to leverage emerging opportunities and to progress in our journey of business enablement. Prioritising strategic growth With our thrust on Empowering Businesses, we, at IndiaMART, achieved strong business growth during the year. Our Collections from customers grew by 32% to ` 9,317 million, Deferred revenue witnessed a growth of 25% to ` 9,066 million and Paying Subscription Suppliers grew from 152,394 as of March 2021 to 169,324 as of March 2022. To effectively meet the evolving needs of our growing supplier and buyer network, we made focussed investments in the expansion of channel sales partners as well as hired ~1,000 new employees to strengthen our resource base across our product, sales and service functions. The impact of these investments became visible in the last quarter of the financial year as we added our highest ever paying subscription suppliers. Responding with speed to the changing market needs, we came out with new innovations across our product lines and sales network. In addition to strengthening the value proposition for Indian Suppliers, we launched an exclusive service for Indian exporters, 'IndiaMART Verified Export Services', which enables 50,000 export-oriented sellers on IndiaMART's platform to expand their business across the globe. This year, we also made progress on conversational commerce as we launched many features in our Lead Manager System to drive better business enablement. We invested in advanced technologies to enhance matchmaking and boost system efficiencies during the year. I am happy to share that our improvement in relevancy through AI/ML and behavioural data-driven algorithmic matchmaking, our strong tech-enabled, user-friendly and cost- effective platform, have increased customer satisfaction tremendously. Our business enquiries have also grown to 97 million for FY 2022. As employees are one of the important stakeholders, we took a pioneering step of introducing the first-in-the-industry 'Weekly payout of Salary' regime across all levels in the organisation. This was done primarily by taking into account the changing preferences of new-age employees and providing them with better liquidity during the month. Our efforts to build a larger eco-system to nurture business enablement and digital commerce were also manifested in our various strategic investments during the year. We identified Accounting as an important need for businesses and therefore, acquired Busy & Livekeeping and invested in Vyapar & Realbooks. With these acquisitions and investments, we are now present in all the segments of accounting as we aim to build up a new business line over the next 3-5 years. Additionally, in line with our strategy of enabling businesses and online commerce, we have made multiple investments in the areas of logistics, supply chain, vertical commerce, financing and other business enablement softwares. Cumulatively, these initiatives will help us further strengthen our core business proposition of product discovery and conversational commerce. Looking ahead with optimism Going forward, we will continue to augment our technology and product suite for further ease of our customers. Our negative working capital business model, strong zero-debt balance sheet, category, regional diversification, and brand awareness will further drive our efforts to realise our customer promise. Coupled with the rapid growth in internet adoption & mobile penetration, we are well poised to leverage the future growth opportunities and are evolving accordingly. In conclusion On this note, I would like to take the opportunity to thank each one of you for your sustained trust in IndiaMART. I am also grateful to our stakeholders, whose continued support and commitment has made it possible for us to make doing business easy and stay firmly on course of our long-term goal. I am confident that together, we shall further empower small and medium businesses, who have emerged as a formidable force in steering India's growth story which we are committed to partnering.

These strong network effects continue to translate into a growing supplier and buyer base, which is well balanced across Metro Cities, Tier II Cities and the Rest of India.

A carbon footprint measures the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from all the activities across an organisation or for a specific product or service. This includes energy consumption in buildings, fuel consumed by the company-owned vehicles and may Emissions measure indirect emissions associated with activities outside the organisation's operations, i.e., the value chain. Value chain analysis evaluates every step of business operation, from raw materials to the eventual end-user. IndiaMART has followed the GHG protocol methodology as laid down by the Organisational footprinting Standard - ISO 14064-1, to calculate its carbon footprint into different scopes as follows: This includes the direct emissions that result from activities within the organisation's control like, on-site electricity generation, heating, cooling, company-owned vehicles, fugitive emissions.This includes indirect emissions from any electricity, heat, etc. purchased and used in the office premises namely, imported electricity - Grid/TPPScope 1 emissions Scope 2 emissionsUse of certified green buildingsLow carbon emissions Negligible waste and minimum water consumption Annual Report 2021-22 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 52 53*Calculated using Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissionsTotal GHG Emissions Green Buildings Particulars FY 2022 (tCO2e) 1 Emissions (tCO2e)* GHG Emissions intensity (tCO2e/million rupees of turnover) Due to inherent nature of online business, electricity consumed in the office premises forms the major portion of the emissions.

Our strong network effect continues to translate into a growing buyer and supplier base, well-diversified across geographies. OUR REVENUE MODEL Our revenue primarily comes from providing subscription- based offerings to the suppliers.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\"Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2022, and its profit and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date. BASIS FOR OPINION We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements. KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. DESCRIPTION OF KEY AUDIT MATTER Revenue Recognition See note 2.3(c) and 19 to the standalone financial statements The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Company generates revenue primarily from web services and follows a prepaid model for its business. Revenue from web services is recognised over the period of the contract as and when the Company satisfies performance obligations by actually rendering the promised services to its customers. These services are delivered using IT systems which manage very high volume on daily basis and generate reports from which the Company recognises revenue, and hence there is inherent risk around the existence and accuracy of revenue recognition. We have identified revenue recognition from web services as a key audit matter because of the significance of web service revenue to the financial statements and its recognition based on high volume of data generated by internal IT systems.In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence: We assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition accounting policy and its compliance with applicable accounting standards. We evaluated the design and implementation of key internal financial controls and operating effectiveness of the relevant key controls with respect to existence and accuracy of revenue recognition on selected transactions. We, with the involvement of IT specialists, evaluated the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of management's general IT controls and key application controls over the Company's IT systems which govern revenue recognition, including access controls, controls over program changes and interfaces between different systems. We selected a sample of transactions using statistical sampling and performed tests of details including reading the contract, identifying performance obligation and its link with actual rendition to assess whether the criteria for revenue recognition are met. We tested completeness and accuracy of web services revenue and collection from underlying relevant source documents generated by IT systems with accounting system. We assessed the adequacy of disclosures in the standalone financial statements.OTHER INFORMATION The Company's Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company's annual report, but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. MANAGEMENT'S AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company's Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/loss and other comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors. Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 144 145 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at 31 March 2022, based on the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the \"Guidance Note\"). MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS The Company's management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\").Annexure B to the Independent Auditor's report on the standalone financial statements of IndiaMART InterMESH Limited for the year ended 31 March 2022 AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were established and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of such internal financial controls, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements. MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements. INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the standalone financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety: (i) Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; (ii) Level 2 - inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and (iii) Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting Company's assumptions about pricing by market participants. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the standalone financial statements on fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. The Company's management determines the policies and procedures for recurring fair value measurement, such as investment in Optionally Convertible Cumulative Redeemable Preference Instruments (OCRPS) and investment in equity/ preference instruments of other entities measured at fair value. External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as unquoted investments in OCRPS, and investment in equity/preference instruments of other entities. Involvement of external valuers is decided upon annually by the management. Selection criteria include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. The management decides, after discussions with the Company's external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case. At each reporting date, the management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the Company's accounting policies. For this analysis, the management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. This note summarises the accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes. Disclosures for significant estimates and assumptions (Note 3) Disclosures for valuation methods and quantitative disclosure of fair value measurement hierarchy (Note 29) c) Revenue from contracts with customers and other income Revenue from contracts with customers The Company is primarily engaged in providing web services. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the services is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government. The disclosures of significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from contracts with customers are provided in Note 3. The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised. Rendering of services Revenue from web services is recognised based on output method i.e. pro-rata over the period of the contract as and when the company satisfies performance obligations by transferring the promised services to its customers. Revenues from lead based services is recognised based on output method i.e. as and when leads are consumed by the customer or on the expiry of contract whichever is earlier. Activation revenue is amortised over the estimated customer relationship period. Advertising revenue is derived from displaying web based banner ads and sale of online advertisements. Revenue from banner advertisement is recognised pro rata over the period of display of advertisement as per contract. Revenue from sale of online advertisements is recognised based on output method and the Company applies the practical expedient to recognize advertising revenue in the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice. Contract balances Trade receivables A receivable represents the Company's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in section m) Financial instruments. Contract liabilities A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised. The company recognises contract liability for consideration received in respect of unsatisfied performance obligations and reports these amounts as deferred revenue and advances from customers in the balance sheet. The unaccrued amounts are not recognised as revenue till all related performance obligations are fulfilled. The company generally receives transaction price in advance for contracts with customers that run up for more than one year. The transaction price received in advance does not have any significant financing component as the difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price of the service arises for reasons other than the provision of finance. Other income Interest income For all financial assets measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating EIR, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. Dividends Dividend is recognised when the Company's right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend. d) Property, plant and equipment Capital work in progress and property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing parts of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 160 161 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 Capital work in progress includes cost of property, plant and equipment under development as at the balance sheet date. Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date is classified as capital advances and cost of assets not ready for use at the balance sheet date, are disclosed under capital work- in- progress. The Company has adopted component accounting as required under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. The Company identifies the components separately, if it has useful life different from the respective property, plant and equipment. Based on the analysis, Company believes that it does not have any asset having useful life of its major components different from the property, plant and equipment, hence Company believes that there is no material impact on the financial statement of the Company due to component accounting. Depreciation is calculated on a written down value basis using the rates arrived at based on the useful lives prescribed under Schedule II to Companies Act, 2013. The Company has used the following rates to provide depreciation on its Property, plant and equipment: Asset Annual rates Computers 63.16% Furniture and fittings 26.89% Office equipment 45.07% Vehicles 31.23% An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date is classified as capital advances and cost of assets not ready for use at the balance sheet date are disclosed under capital work- in- progress. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. e) Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. Unique telephone numbers are amortised on a written down value basis at 40% annually. Intangibles being Software acquired by the Company are amortised on a written down value basis at 40% annually. Advances paid towards the acquisition of intangible assets outstanding at each balance sheet date are classified as capital advances and cost of assets not ready for use at the balance sheet date, are disclosed under capital work- in-progress. f) Leases (as lessee) The Company's lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for buildings. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (\"ROU\") and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short- term leases) and low value leases. For these short- term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows. Finance leases were capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments were apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges were recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit or loss. A ROU asset was depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there was no reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset was depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term. g) Investment in subsidiaries and associates The Company records the investment in equity instruments of subsidiaries and associate at cost less impairment loss, if any. Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 162 163 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 On disposal of investment in subsidiaries and associate, the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is recognised in the Statement of profit and loss. h) Impairment of non-financial assets The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Company's CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts, the Company extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget using a steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can be justified. In any case, this growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the products, industries, or country or countries in which the entity operates, or for the market in which the asset is used. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. For properties previously revalued the impairment is recognised in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation surplus recognised through OCI. After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life. An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. i) Taxes Current Income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date. Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income (loss) or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. Deferred Tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income (loss) or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Sales/ value added taxes/ Service tax/ Goods and service tax (GST) paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales/ value added taxes/ GST paid, except: When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. j) Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre- tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the standalone financial statements. Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 164 165 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 k) Retirement and other employee benefits Short-term obligations Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non- monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect of employees' services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented under other current financial liabilities in the balance sheet. Post-employment obligations Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme. The Company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident fund. The Company recognizes contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognized as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund. The Company operates a defined benefit gratuity plan for its employees i.e. gratuity. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method. Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of: The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and The date that the Company recognises related restructuring costs Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement of profit and loss: Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and Net interest expense or income Other long-term employee benefit obligations Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within the next twelve months, is treated as short- term employee benefit. The Company measures the expected cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. The Company treats accumulated leave expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as long- term employee benefit for measurement purposes. Such long-term compensated absences are provided for based on the actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method at the reporting period- end. Actuarial gain/loss are immediately taken to the statement of profit and loss and are not deferred. The Company presents the entire leave as a current liability in the balance sheet, since it does not have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for twelve months after the reporting date. l) Share-based payments Employees of the Company also receive remuneration in the form of stock options (ESOP) and stock appreciation rights (SAR) as share based payment transactions under the Company's Employee Stock Option Plan and Employee Stock Benefit Scheme. Both of these are equity settled share based payment transactions. The cost of equity settled transactions is determined based on the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model. That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transaction at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The statement of profit and loss expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense. Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Company's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or performance conditions. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/ or service conditions are satisfied. When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense had the terms not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification. Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element of the fair value of the award is expensed immediately through profit or loss. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share. m) Financial Instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset. Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: Debt instruments at amortised cost Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) Debt instruments at amortised cost A 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 166 167 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in other income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss. This category generally applies to loans to employees, trade and other receivables. For more information on receivables, refer to Note 29. Debt instruments at FVTOCI A 'debt instrument' is classified as at FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met: a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and b) The asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss. On de- recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method. Debt instrument at FVTPL All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Derecognition A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when: The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company could be required to repay. Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure: Financial assets that are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, deposits, trade receivables and bank balance Trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115 The Company follows 'simplified approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables or contract revenue receivables. The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the Company determines that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL. Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. The 12-month ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL which results from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original EIR. When estimating the cash flows, an entity is required to consider: All contractual terms of the financial instrument (including prepayment, extension, call and similar options) over the expected life of the financial instrument. However, in rare cases when the expected life of the financial instrument cannot be estimated reliably, then the entity is required to use the remaining contractual term of the financial instrument Cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as income/ expense in the statement of profit and loss (P&L). This amount is reflected under the head 'other expenses' in the P&L. The balance sheet presentation for various financial instruments is described below: Financial assets measured as at amortised cost, contractual revenue receivables and lease receivables: ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off criteria, the Company does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying amount. Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: ECL is presented as a provision in the balance sheet, i.e. as a liability. Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: Since financial assets are already reflected at fair value, impairment allowance is not further reduced from its value. Rather, ECL amount is presented as 'accumulated impairment amount' in OCI. For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the Company combines financial instruments on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to enable significant increases in credit risk to be identified on a timely basis. Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Company's financial liabilities include trade payables, security deposits and other payables. Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 168 169 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022are recognized in OCI. These gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to P&L. However, the company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to borrowings. De-recognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. n) Foreign currency transactions The Company's financial statements are presented in INR which is also the Company's functional currency. Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company at its functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. However, for practical reasons, the Company uses an average rate if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively). o) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference dividends and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Partly paid equity shares are treated as a fraction of an equity share to the extent that they are entitled to participate in dividends relative to a fully paid equity share during the reporting year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, bonus element in a rights issue, share split, and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. p) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. q) Segment reporting Identification of segments Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The Company's activities of providing e-marketplace services for businesses is considered to be a single business segment. The analysis of geographical segments is based on the areas in which customers are based. Segment policies The Company prepares its segment information in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the financial statements of the Company as a whole. r) Share capital Equity shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. s) Dividends Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period. t) Recently issued accounting pronouncements On 23 March 2022, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\"MCA\") through notifications, amended existing Ind AS. The same shall come into force from annual reporting period beginning on or after 1st April 2022. Key Amendments relating to the same whose financial statements are required to comply with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015 are: - Ind AS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment - For items produced during testing/trail phase, clarification added that revenue generated out of the same shall not be recognised in Statement Of Profit and Loss and considered as part of cost of PPE. -Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities & Contingent Assets - Guidance on what constitutes cost of fulfilling contracts (to determine whether the contract is onerous or not) is included. -Ind AS 103 - Business Combination - Reference to revised Conceptual Framework. For contingent liabilities / levies, clarification is added on how to apply the principles for recognition of contingent liabilities from Ind AS 37. Recognition of contingent assets is not allowed. -Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments - The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes when it applies the '10 per cent' test in assessing whether to derecognise a financial liability. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these amendment on its standalone financial statements. 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of standalone financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the management's best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. Therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Company has based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the standalone financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. a) Taxes Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. In assessing the probability the Company considers whether the entity has sufficient Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 170 171 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity, which will result in taxable amounts against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised before they expire. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. The Company has recognised deferred tax assets on the deductible temporary differences since the management is of the view that it is probable the deferred tax assets will be recoverable using the estimated future taxable income based on the approved business plans and budgets. b) Share based payment The Company initially measures the cost of equity- settled transactions with employees using a Black- Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share options and SAR units, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 28. c) Impairment of Non-financial assets Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm's length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a DCF model or other fair value valuation models. In DCF model, the cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Company is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset's performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. d) Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefit) The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in India, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the currencies of the post-employment benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. Those mortality tables tend to change only at intervals in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rates, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market. Further details about gratuity obligations are given in Note 27. e) Fair value measurement of financial instruments When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. See Note 29 and 31 for further disclosures. f) Useful life of assets considered for depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset's expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Company's assets are determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed at each financial year end. g) Leases The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgment. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The Company determines the lease term as the non- cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. 4. IMPACT OF COVID-19 The Company has taken into account all the possible impacts of COVID-19 in preparation of these standalone financial statements, including but not limited to its assessment of, liquidity and going concern assumption, recoverable values of its financial and non-financial assets, impact on revenue and cost, impact on leases, impact on investment in subsidiaries and associates and investment in other entities. The Company has carried out this assessment based on available internal and external sources of information upto the date of approval of these standalone financial statements and believes that the impact of COVID-19 is not material to these standalone financial statements and expects to recover the carrying amount of its assets. The impact of COVID-19 on the standalone financial statements may differ from that estimated as at the date of approval of these standalone financial statements owing to the nature and duration of COVID-19.

Every employee who has completed statutory defined period of service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days salary (last drawn salary) for each completed year of service. The scheme is funded with insurance company in form of qualifying insurance policy. This defined benefit plan exposes the Company to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and salary risk. The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the company's obligation in respect of its gratuity plan and leave encashment is as follows: Gratuity - defined benefit plan As at 31 March 2022As at 31 March 2021 Present value of defined benefit obligation 332.58 287.84 Fair value of plan assets (146.02) (57.30) Net liability arising from defined benefit obligation 186.56 230.54 Leave encashment - other long-term employee benefit plan As at 31 March 2022As at 31 March 2021 Present value of other long-term empoyee benefit 73.65 74.76 73.65 74.76 a) Reconciliation of the net defined benefit (asset) liability and other long term employee benefit plan The following table shows a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances for the net defined benefit (asset) liability and other long term employee benefit plan and its components.

These have been assessed basis counterparty credit risk. ii) The fair value of non-current financial assets and financial liabilities are determined by discounting future cash flows using current rates of instruments with similar terms and credit risk. The current rates used do not reflect significant changes from the discount rates used initially. Therefore, the carrying value of these instruments measured at amortised cost approximate their fair value. iii) Fair value of quoted mutual funds, alternative investment funds and investment trust is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. We do not expect material volatility in these financial assets. iv) Fair value of debt instruments of subsidiaries and equity/preference instruments of other entities is estimated based on replacement cost method / discounted cash flows / market multiple valuation technique using cash flow projections, discount rate and credit risk and are classified as Level 3. v) With effect from 1 April 2021, the fair value of quoted bonds is determined using observable market's inputs and is classified as Level 2 as against earlier classification of Level 1. vi) Fair value of the quoted bonds and debentures is determined using observable market's inputs and is classified as Level 2.c) Following table describes the valuation techniques used and key inputs thereto for the level 3 financial assets as of 31 March 2022 Financial assets Valuation technique(s) Signifcannt Unobservable input rangeInter-relationship between significant unobservable input and fair value measurement Investment in debt instruments of subsidiaries and equity/preference instruments of other entities - Pay With Indiamart Private Limited, Tradezeal Online Private Limited, Mobisy Technologies Private Limited, Mynd Solutions Private Limited, Zimyo consulting Private Limited and Fleetx Technologies Private Limited Market multiple approach0.7x-8.3x The estimated fair value of Investment in Other entities will Increase/ (decrease) if the Market multiple is higher/ (lower) - Tolexo Online Private Limited Replacement cost method Replacement cost NA Sensitivity For the fair value of investment in other entities, reasonably possible changes in Market Multiple by 250 basis points at the reporting date being a significant unobservable inputs, would have the following effect For the year ended 31 March 2022 +2.5% change in Market Multiple 32.73 -2.5% change in Market Multiple (21.09) Following table describes the valuation techniques used and key inputs thereto for the level 3 financial assets as of 31 March 2021 Financial assets Valuation technique(s) Key input(s) Sensitivity Investment in debt instruments of subsidiaries and equity/preference instruments of other entities -Pay With Indiamart Private Limited, Tradezeal Online Private Limited, Mobisy Technologies Private Limited Refer Note below* i) Discount rate ii) Growth rate for long term cash flow projections iii) Future cash flow projections based on budgets.

The capital structure of the company consists of no debts and only equity of the company. The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Company reviews the capital structure on a regular basis. As part of this review, the Company considers the cost of capital, risks associated with each class of capital requirements and maintenance of adequate liquidity. 31 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company's risk management framework. The Company's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Company's Board oversees how management monitors compliance with the Company's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Board is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes regular reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the audit committee. i) Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's cash and bank balances, trade receivables, investments in mutual funds, bonds, loans and security deposits.29 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSS (Contd.) 31 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (Contd.) The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure. Credit risk management considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information including indicators like external credit rating (as far as available), macro-economic information (such as regulatory changes, government directives, market interest rate). Trade receivables The Company primarily collects consideration in advance for the services to be provided to the customer. As a result, the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk on trade receivables. Cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and investments in mutual funds, bonds, debentures, units of alternative investment funds and units of investment trust. The company maintains its cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, inter-corporate deposits and investment in mutual funds, bonds, debentures, units of alternative investment funds and units of investment trust with reputed banks and financial institutions. The credit risk on these instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. Security deposits and Loans The Company monitors the credit rating of the counterparties on regular basis. These instruments carry very minimal credit risk based on the financial position of parties and Company's historical experience of dealing with the parties. ii) Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, who has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Company's short-term, medium-term and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Maturities of financial liabilities The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company's financial liabilities based on contractual payments: Contractual maturities of financial liabilities 31 March 2022 Within 1 year Between 1 and 5 years and thereafterTotal Trade payables 182.96 - 182.96 Lease 940.05 31 March 2021 Within 1 year Between 1 and 5 years and thereafterTotal Trade payables 153.84 - 153.84 Lease Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 202 203 Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 iii) Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include foreign currency receivables, deposits, investments in mutual funds, bonds, debentures, units of alternative investment funds, units of investment trust and investment in other entities. a) Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the company's operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency). The company's exposure to unhedged foreign currency risk as at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 is not material. Currency risks related to the principal amounts of the company's US dollar trade receivables. b) Interest rate risk Investment of short-term surplus funds of the company in liquid schemes of mutual funds, bonds, debentures, units of alternative investment fund and investment trust provides high level of liquidity from a portfolio of money market securities and high quality debt and categorized as 'low risk' product from liquidity and interest rate risk perspectives. Sensitivity Impact on profit before tax For the year ended 31 March 2022For the year ended 31 March 2021 + 5% change in NAV of mutual funds, bonds, debentures, units of alternative investment funds and investment trust.1,149.71 1,108.07 - 5% change in NAV of mutual funds, bonds, debentures, units of alternative investment funds and investment trust.(1,149.71) (1,108.07) 32 SEGMENT INFORMATION Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.

On February 28, 2019, a judgment of the Supreme Court of India interpreting certain statutory defined contribution obligations of employees and employers altered historical understandings of such obligations, extending them to cover additional portions of the employee's income. However, the judgment isn't explicit if such interpretation may have retrospective application resulting in increased contribution for past and future years for certain employees of the Company. The Company, based on an internal assesssment, evaluated that there are numerous interpretative challenges on the retrospective application of the judgment which results in impracticability in estimation of and timing of payment and amount involved. As a result of lack of implementation guidance and interpretative challenges involved, the Company is unable to reliably estimate the amount involved. Accordingly, the Company shall evaluate the amount of provision, if any, on there being further clarity on the matter. 2. The Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Some of these matters include speculative and frivolous claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. The Company records a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions and adjusts these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. The Company believes that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results or cash flows of the Company, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as at 31 March 2022. 3. The Indian Parliament has approved the Code on Social Security, 2020 which would impact the contributions by the Company towards Provident Fund and Gratuity. The effective date from which the changes are applicable is yet to be notified and the final rules are yet to be framed. The Company will carry out an evaluation of the impact and record the same in the financial statements in the period in which the Code becomes effective and the related rules are published. b) Capital and other commitments - As at 31 March 2022, the Company has NIL capital commitment (31 March 2021: 13 Millions). - The Company will provide financial support to its wholly owned subsidiaries, so as to meet their liabilities as and when the same is required.34 THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED FOLLOWING FUNCTION WISE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS (Contd.)

Trade Receivables turnover ratio Increase in trade receivable turnover ratio is on account of better realisation of trade receivables. Trade payables turnover ratio Increase in trade payable turnover ratio is due to improvisation in the payable process thereby reducing payment cycle of the vendors. Return on investment (ROI) RBI had taken measures during COVID-19 in the month of March 2020 hence cut interest rates drastically, and introduced ample liquidity measures. We generated high returns in our liquid fund portfolio due to these liquidity measures in F.Y. 2020-2021. In F.Y. 2022 fixed income investments generated lower returns due to high liquidity in markets. b) Relationship with Struck off companies S.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate financial statements of such subsidiaries and associates as were audited by the other auditors, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\"Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group and its associates as at 31 March 2022, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended. BASIS FOR OPINION We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and its associates in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of reports of the other auditors referred to in paragraph (a) of the \"Other Matters\" section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate financial statements of components audited by them, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. DESCRIPTION OF KEY AUDIT MATTER Revenue Recognition (See note 2.3(d) and 19 to the consolidated financial statements) The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit The Group generates revenue primarily from web services and follows a prepaid model for its business. Revenue from web services is recognised over the period of the contract as and when the Group satisfies performance obligations by actually rendering the promised services to its customers. These services are delivered using IT systems which manage very high volume on daily basis and generate reports from which the Group recognises revenue, and hence there is inherent risk around the existence and accuracy of revenue recognition. We have identified revenue recognition from web services as a key audit matter because of the significance of web service revenue to the financial statements and its recognition based on high volume of data generated by internal IT systems.In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following audit procedures in this area, among others to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence: We assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition accounting policy and its compliance with applicable accounting standards. We evaluated the design and implementation of key internal financial controls and operating effectiveness of the relevant key controls with respect to existence and accuracy of revenue recognition on selected transactions. We, with the involvement of IT specialists, evaluated the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of management's general IT controls and key application controls over the Group's IT systems which govern revenue recognition, including access controls, controls over program changes and interfaces between different systems. We selected a sample of transactions using statistical sampling and performed tests of details including reading the contract, identifying performance obligation and its link with actual rendition to assess whether the criteria for revenue recognition are met. We tested completeness and accuracy of web services revenue and collection from underlying relevant source documents generated by IT systems with accounting system. We assessed the adequacy of disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.OTHER INFORMATION The Holding Company's Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Holding Company's annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed and based on the work done/ audit report of other auditors, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. MANAGEMENT'S AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Holding Company's Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated profit/ loss and other comprehensive income (loss), consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group including its associates in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of each company. AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors. Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 218 219the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements/financial information of such entities or business activities within the Group and its associates to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in paragraph (a) of the section titled \"Other Matters\" in this audit report. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. OTHER MATTERS (a) We did not audit the financial statements of four subsidiaries, whose financial statements reflect total assets (before consolidation adjustments) of INR 863.09 Million as at 31 March 2022, total revenues (before consolidation adjustments) of INR 34.80 Million and net cash outflows (before consolidation adjustments) amounting to INR 8.49 Million for the year ended on that date, as considered in the consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies, have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2022, based on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements criteria established by such companies considering the essential components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the \"Guidance Note\"). MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS The respective Company's management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements based on the criteria established by the respective Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\"). AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITY Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the internal controls based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the relevant subsidiary companies in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements. MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A company's internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. OTHER MATTERS Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in so far as it relates to four subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiary companies incorporated in India.

CORPORATE INFORMATION IndiaMART Intermesh Limited (\"the Company\" or \"the Parent Company\") is a public company domiciled in India and was incorporated on 13 September 1999 under the provisions of the Companies Act applicable in India. The company and its consolidated subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"the Group\") is engaged in e-marketplace for business needs, which acts as an interactive hub for domestic and international buyers and suppliers. The registered office of the Company is located at 1st Floor, 29-Daryagang, Netaji Subash Marg New Delhi-110002, India. The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution passed by Board of Directors on 28 April 2022. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 2.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis as explained in the accounting policies below, except for the following: certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value where Ind AS requires a different accounting treatment (refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments); share-based payments net defined benefit (asset)/liability - Fair value of plan assets less present value of defined benefit obligations. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements. It also requires the management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas where estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, or areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, are disclosed in Note 3. 2.2 Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and associates as at 31 March 2022. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has: Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee) Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee Rights arising from other contractual arrangements The Group's voting rights and potential voting rights The size of the group's holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other voting rights holdersNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 Group subsidiaries and associates are as follows: S.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year/quarter are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to that group member's financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with the group's accounting policies. The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of the parent company, i.e., year ended on 31 March 2022 since the Group's subsidiaries and associate have the same reporting period end. Consolidation procedure: a) Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date. b) Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent's investment in each subsidiary and the parent's portion of equity of each subsidiary. c) Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between entities of the group (profits or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Ind AS 12 Income Taxes applies to temporary differences that arise from the elimination of profits and losses resulting from intragroup transactions. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, if any, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group's accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it: Derecognises the assets (including goodwill, if any) and liabilities of the subsidiary Derecognises the carrying amount of any non- controlling interests Derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity Recognises the fair value of the consideration received Recognises the fair value of any investment retained Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss Reclassifies the parent's share of components previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies The accounting policies, as set out in the following paragraphs of this note, have been consistently applied, by all the group entities, to all the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements except where a newly issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy. a) Statement of Compliance The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as \"Ind AS\") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to time) and other relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2013 (\"the Act\") (as amended from time to time). All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest INR million as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated. b) Current versus non-current classification The Group presents assets and liabilities in balance sheet based on current/non-current classification. An asset is classified as current when it is: (i) Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle (ii) Held primarily for the purpose of trading (iii) Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or (iv) A cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current. A liability is classified as current when: (i) It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle (ii) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading (iii) It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or (iv) There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. The Group classifies all other liabilities as non- current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities. The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing/servicing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle. c) Fair value measurement The Group measures financial instruments, such as Investment in equity/preference/debt instrument of other entities, Investment in mutual funds, bonds, debentures, units of alternative investment funds and investment trust at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: (i) In the principal market for the asset or liability, or (ii) In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their best economic interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety: (i) Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (ii) Level 2 - inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and (iii) Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting Group's assumptions about pricing by market participants Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 232 233 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. The Group's management determines the policies and procedures for recurring fair value measurement, such as investment in equity/preference/debt instruments of other entities measured at fair value. External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as unquoted investments in equity/preference/ debt instruments of other entities. Involvement of external valuers is decided upon annually by the management. Selection criteria include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. The management decides, after discussions with the Group's external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case. At each reporting date, the management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the Group's accounting policies. For this analysis, the management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents. For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. This note summarises the accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes. Disclosures for significant estimates and assumptions (Note 3) Disclosures for valuation methods and quantitative disclosure of fair value measurement hierarchy (Note 29) d) Revenue from contracts with customers and other income Revenue from contracts with customers The Group is primarily engaged in providing web services. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the services is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those services and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government. The disclosures of significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions relating to revenue from contracts with customers are provided in Note 3. The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised. Rendering of services Revenue from web services is recognised based on output method i.e. pro-rata over the period of the contract as and when the Group satisfies performance obligations by transferring the promised services to its customers. Revenues from lead based services is recognised based on output method i.e. as and when leads are consumed by the customer or on the expiry of contract whichever is earlier. Activation revenue is amortised over the estimated customer relationship period. Advertising revenue is derived from displaying web based banner ads and sale of online advertisements Revenue from banner advertisement is recognised pro rata over the period of display of advertisement as per contract. Revenue from sale of online advertisements is recognised based on output method and the Group applies the practical expedient to recognize advertising revenue in the amount to which the Group has a right to invoice. Contract balances Trade receivables A receivable represents the Group's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial assets in section m) Financial instruments. Contract liabilities A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised. The Group recognises contract liability for consideration received in respect of unsatisfied performance obligations and reports these amounts as deferred revenue and advances from customers in the balance sheet. The unaccrued amounts are not recognised as revenue till all related performance obligation are fulfilled. The Group generally receives transaction price in advance for contracts with customers that run up for more than one year. The transaction price received in advance does not have any significant financing component as the difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price of the service arises for reasons other than the provision of finance. Other income Interest income For all financial assets measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating EIR, the Group estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. Dividends Dividend is recognised when the Group's right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend. e) Property, plant and equipment Capital work in progress and property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing parts of the plant and equipment and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Group depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Capital work in progress includes cost of property, plant and equipment under development as at the balance sheet date. Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date is classified as capital advances and cost of assets not ready for use at the balance sheet date are disclosed under capital work- in- progress. The Group has adopted component accounting as required under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. The Group identifies the components separately, if it has useful life different from the respective property, plant and equipment. Based on the analysis, Group believes that it does not have any asset having useful life of its major components different from the property, plant and equipment, hence Group believes that there is no material impact on the financial statement of the Group due to component accounting. Depreciation is calculated on a written down value basis using the rates arrived at based on the useful lives prescribed under Schedule II to Companies Act, 2013. The Group has used the following rates to provide depreciation on its Property, plant and equipment: Asset Annual rates Computers 63.16% Furniture and fittings 26.89% Office equipment 45.07% Vehicles 31.23% An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognised. Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date is classified as capital advances and cost of assets not ready for use at the balance sheet date are disclosed under capital work- in- progress. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. f) Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 234 235 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses (if any). Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognised. Unique telephone numbers are amortised on a written down value basis at 40% annually. Intangibles being Software acquired by the Group are amortised on a written down value basis at 40% annually. Advances paid towards the acquisition of intangible assets outstanding at each balance sheet date are classified as capital advances and cost of assets not ready for use at the balance sheet date, are disclosed under capital work- in-progress. g) Leases (as lessee) The Group's lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for buildings. The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the group assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (\"ROU\") and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short- term leases) and low value leases. For these short- term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Leases for which the group is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows. Finance leases were capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments were apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges were recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit or loss. A ROU asset was depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there was no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset was depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term. h) Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment, or, a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with Ind AS 105. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate. Distributions received from an associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group's share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group's interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. An investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the investee becomes an associate. On acquisition of the investment in an associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. After application of the equity method of accounting, the Group determines whether there is any objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the net investment in an associate and that event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows from the net investment that can be reliably estimated. If there exists such an objective evidence of impairment, then it is necessary to recognise impairment loss with respect to the Group's investment in an associate. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with Ind AS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with Ind AS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases. i) Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 236 237 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022asset's or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators. The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Group's CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. To estimate cash flow projections beyond periods covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts, the Group extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget using a steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can be justified. In any case, this growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the products, industries, or country or countries in which the entity operates, or for the market in which the asset is used. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. For properties previously revalued the impairment is recognised in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation surplus recognised through OCI.. After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life. An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. j) Taxes Current Income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date. Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income (loss) or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. Deferred Tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised, or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income (loss) or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Sales/ value added taxes/ Service tax/ Goods and service tax (GST) paid on acquisition of assets or on incurring expenses Expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales/ value added taxes/ GST paid, except: When the tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the tax paid is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of tax included The net amount of tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet. k) Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre- tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 238 239 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the consolidated financial statements. l) Retirement and other employee benefits Short-term obligations Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non- monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect of employees' services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liabilities are presented under other current financial liabilities in the balance sheet. Post-employment obligations Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme. The Group has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident fund. The Group recognizes contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognized as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund. The Group operates a defined benefit gratuity plan for its employees i.e. gratuity. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method. Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of: The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and The date that the Group recognises related restructuring costs Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement of profit and loss: Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements; and Net interest expense or income Other long-term employee benefit obligations Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within the next twelve months, is treated as short- term employee benefit. The Group measures the expected cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. The Group treats accumulated leave expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as long- term employee benefit for measurement purposes. Such long-term compensated absences are provided for based on the actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method at the reporting period- end. Actuarial gain/loss are immediately taken to the statement of profit and loss and are not deferred. The Group presents the entire leave as a current liability in the balance sheet, since it does not have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for twelve months after the reporting date. m) Share-based payments Employees of the Group also receive remuneration in the form of stock options (ESOP) and stock appreciation rights (SAR) as a share based payment transactions under the Group's Employee stock option plan and Employee stock benefit scheme. Both of these are equity settled share based payment transactions. The cost of equity settled transactions is determined based on fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model. That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transaction at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The statement of profit and loss expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense. Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or performance conditions. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/ or service conditions are satisfied. When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense had the terms not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification. Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element of the fair value of the award is expensed immediately through profit or loss. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share. n) Financial Instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories: Debt instruments at amortised cost Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) Debt instruments at amortised cost A 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 240 241 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in other income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss. This category generally applies to loans to employees, trade and other receivables. For more information on receivables, refer to Note 29. Debt instruments at FVTOC I A 'debt instrument' is classified as at FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met: a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and b) The asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the Group recognizes interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss. On de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method. Debt instrument at FVTPL FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. In addition, the Group may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Derecognition A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Group's balance sheet) when: a) The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or b) The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay. Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure: a. Financial assets that are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, deposits, trade receivables and bank balance b. Trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115 The Group follows 'simplified approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables or contract revenue receivables. The application of simplified approach does not require the Group to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the Group determines that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL. Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. The 12-month ECL is a portion of the lifetime ECL which results from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original EIR. When estimating the cash flows, an entity is required to consider: All contractual terms of the financial instrument (including prepayment, extension, call and similar options) over the expected life of the financial instrument. However, in rare cases when the expected life of the financial instrument cannot be estimated reliably, then the entity is required to use the remaining contractual term of the financial instrument Cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as income/ expense in the statement of profit and loss (P&L). This amount is reflected under the head 'other expenses' in the P&L. The balance sheet presentation for various financial instruments is described below: Financial assets measured as at amortised cost, contractual revenue receivables and lease receivables: ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off criteria, the Group does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying amount. Loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: ECL is presented as a provision in the balance sheet, i.e. as a liability. Debt instruments measured at FVTOCI: Since financial assets are already reflected at fair value, impairment allowance is not further reduced from its value. Rather, ECL amount is presented as 'accumulated impairment amount' in OCI. For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the Group combines financial instruments on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to enable significant increases in credit risk to be identified on a timely basis. Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Group's financial liabilities include trade payables, security deposits and other payables. Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 242 243 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognized in OCI. These gains/ losses are not subsequently transferred to P&L. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to borrowings. De-recognition A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. o) Foreign currency transactions The Group's financial statements are presented in INR which is also the Group's functional currency. Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group at its functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. However, for practical reasons, the Group uses an average rate if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively). p) Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable to equity shareholders (after deducting preference dividends and attributable taxes) by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Partly paid equity shares are treated as a fraction of an equity share to the extent that they are entitled to participate in dividends relative to a fully paid equity share during the reporting year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for events such as bonus issue, bonus element in a rights issue, share split, and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. q) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. r) Segment reporting Identification of segments Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The Group's activities of providing e-marketplace services for businesses is considered to be a single business segment. The analysis of geographical segments is based on the areas in which customers are based. Segment policies: The Group prepares its segment information in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the financial statements of the Group as a whole. s) Share Capital Equity shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. t) Dividends Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Group, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period. u) Recently issued accounting pronouncements On 23 March 2022, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\"MCA\") through notifications, amended existing Ind AS. The same shall come into force from annual reporting period beginning on or after 1st April 2022. Key Amendments relating to the same whose financial statements are required to comply with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015 are: - Ind AS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment - For items produced during testing/trail phase, clarification added that revenue generated out of the same shall not be recognised in Statement Of Profit and Loss and considered as part of cost of PPE. - Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities & Contingent Assets - Guidance on what constitutes cost of fulfilling contracts (to determine whether the contract is onerous or not) is included. - Ind AS 103 - Business Combination - Reference to revised Conceptual Framework. For contingent liabilities / levies, clarification is added on how to apply the principles for recognition of contingent liabilities from Ind AS 37. Recognition of contingent assets is not allowed. - Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments - The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes when it applies the '10 per cent' test in assessing whether to derecognise a financial liability. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these amendment on its consolidated financial statements. 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the management's best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. Therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Group has based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. a) Taxes Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. In assessing the probability, the Group considers whether the entity has sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity, Annual Report 2021-22 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IndiaMART InterMESH Limited 244 245 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2022which will result in taxable amounts against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised before they expire. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. The Group has recognised deferred tax assets on the deductible temporary differences since the management is of the view that it is probable the deferred tax assets will be recoverable using the estimated future taxable income based on the approved business plans and budgets. b) Share based payment The Group initially measures the cost of equity- settled transactions with employees using a Black- Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option and SAR units, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 28. c) Impairment of Non- financial assets Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm's length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a DCF model or other fair value valuation models. In DCF model, the cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset's performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. d) Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefit) The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate; future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated in India, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the currencies of the post-employment benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. Those mortality tables tend to change only at intervals in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases, and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rates, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market. Further details about gratuity obligations are given in Note 27. e) Fair value measurement of financial instruments When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. See Note 29 and 31 for further disclosures. f) Useful life of assets considered for depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset's expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Group's assets are determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed at each financial year end. g) Leases The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgment. The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The Group determines the lease term as the non- cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Group revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. 4. IMPACT OF COVID-19 The Group has taken into account all the possible impacts of COVID-19 in preparation of these consolidated financial statements, including but not limited to its assessment of, liquidity and going concern assumption, recoverable values of its financial and non-financial assets, impact on revenue and cost, impact on leases, impact on investment in associates and investment in other entities. The Group has carried out this assessment based on available internal and external sources of information upto the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements and believes that the impact of COVID-19 is not material to these consolidated financial statements and expects to recover the carrying amount of its assets. The impact of COVID-19 on the consolidated financial statements may differ from that estimated as at the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements owing to the nature and duration of COVID-19.

These have been assessed basis counterparty credit risk. ii) The fair value of non-current financial assets and financial liabilities measured are determined by discounting future cash flows using current rates of instruments with similar terms and credit risk. The current rates used does not reflect significant changes from the discount rates used initially. Therefore, the carrying value of these instruments measured at amortised cost approximate their fair value. iii) Fair value of quoted mutual funds, alternative investment funds and investment trust is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. We do not expect material volatility in these financial assets. iv) Fair value of equity/preference instruments of other entities is estimated based on discounted cash flows / market multiple valuation technique using the cash flow projections, discount rate and credit risk and are classified as Level 3. v) With effect from 1 April 2021, the fair value of quoted bonds is determined using observable market's inputs and is classified as Level 2 as against earlier classification of Level 1. vi) Fair value of the quoted bonds and debentures is determined using observable market's inputs and is classified as Level 2. c) Following table describes the valuation techniques used and key inputs thereto for the level 3 financial assets as of 31 March 2022 Financial assets Valuation technique(s) Signifcannt Unobservable input rangeInter-relationship between significant unobservable input and fair value measurement Investment in equity/preference instruments of other entities Mobisy Technologies Private Limited, Legistify Services Private Limited, Mynd Solutions Private Limited, Zimyo consulting Private Limited and Fleetx Technologies Private LimitedMarket multiple approach0.7x-8.3x The estimated fair value of Investment in Other entities will Increase/ (decrease) if the Market multiple is higher/ (lower)(Amount in ` million, unlesss otherwise stated) Sensitivity For the fair value of investment in other entities, reasonably possible changes in Market Multiple by 250 basis points at the reporting date being a significant unobservable inputs, would have the following effect For the year ended 31 March 2022 +2.5% change in Market Multiple 32.48 -2.5% change in Market Multiple (20.15) Following table describes the valuation techniques used and key inputs thereto for the level 3 financial assets as of 31 March 2021 Financial assets Valuation technique(s) Key input(s) Sensitivity Investment in equity/preference instruments of other entities Mobisy Technologies Private Limited Refer Note below* i) Discount rate ii) Growth rate for long term cash flow projections. iii) Future cash flow projections based on budgets Refer note below** * The fair values of financial assets included in level 3 have been determined in accordance with generally accepted valuation models based on a discounted cashflow analysis, with one of the most significant inputs being the discount rate. ** Sensitivity to changes in unobservable inputs: The fair value of the financial assets is directly proportional to the estimated future cash flow projections based on the budgets approved by the management.

The capital structure of the company consists of no debts and only equity of the company. The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Group reviews the capital structure on a regular basis. As part of this review, the Group considers the cost of capital, risks associated with each class of capital requirements and maintenance of adequate liquidity.29 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSS (Contd.) 29 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSS (Contd.)

The Group's board of directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group's board oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Board is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes regular reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the audit committee. i) Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's cash and bank balances, trade receivables, investments in mutual fund, loans and security deposits. The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure. Credit risk management considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information including indicators like external credit rating (as far as available), macro-economic information (such as regulatory changes, government directives, market interest rate). Trade receivables The Group majorly collects consideration in advance for the services to be provided to the customer. As a result, the Group is not exposed to any significant credit risk on trade receivables. Cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and investments in mutual funds, debentures, units of alternative investment funds and units of investment trust. The company maintains its cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, inter-corporate deposits and investment in mutual funds, bonds, debentures, units of alternative investment funds and units of investment trust with reputed banks and financial institutions. The credit risk on these instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. Security deposits and Loans The Group monitors the credit rating of the counterparties on regular basis. These instruments carry very minimal credit risk based on the financial position of parties and Group's historical experience of dealing with the parties. ii) Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups's reputation. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group's short-term, medium-term and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities, and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. (Amount in ` million, unlesss otherwise stated) 31 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (Contd.) Maturities of financial liabilities The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments: Contractual maturities of financial liabilities 31 March 2022 Within 1 year Between 1 and 5 years and thereafterTotal Trade payables 183.57 - 183.57 486.98 462.39 949.37 31 March 2021 Within 1 year Between 1 and 5 years and thereafterTotal Trade payables 154.28 - 154.28 835.64 464.25 525.67 989.92 iii) Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include foreign currency receivables, deposits, investments in mutual funds, bonds, debentures, units of alternative investment funds, units of investment trust and investment in other entities. a) Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the company's operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency). The company's exposure to unhedged foreign currency risk as at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 is not material. Currency risks related to the principal amounts of the company's US dollar trade receivables. b) Interest rate risk Investment of short-term surplus funds of the company in liquid schemes of mutual funds, bonds, debentures, units of alternative investment fund and investment trust provides high level of liquidity from a portfolio of money market securities and high quality debt and categorized as 'low risk' product from liquidity and interest rate risk perspectives.

The Company is contesting the demand and the management believes that its position is possible to be upheld in the appellate process. No tax expense has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for tax demand raised. (ii) On February 28, 2019, a judgment of the Supreme Court of India interpreting certain statutory defined contribution obligations of employees and employers altered historical understandings of such obligations, extending them to cover additional portions of the employee's income. However, the judgment is not explicit if such interpretation may have retrospective application resulting in increased contribution for past and future years for certain employees of the Group. The Group, based on an internal assessment, evaluated that there are numerous interpretative challenges on the retrospective application of the judgment which results in impracticability in estimation of and timing of payment and amount involved. As a result of lack of implementation guidance and interpretative challenges involved, the Group is unable to reliably estimate the amount involved. Accordingly, the Group shall evaluate the amount of provision, if any, on there being further clarity on the matter. (iii) The Group is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Some of these matters include speculative and frivolous claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. The Group records a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Management reviews these provisions and adjusts these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. The Management believes that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results or cash flows of the Group, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as at 31 March 2022. (iv) The Indian Parliament has approved the Code on Social Security, 2020 which would impact the contributions by the Company towards Provident Fund and Gratuity. The effective date from which the changes are applicable is yet to be notified and the final rules are yet to be framed. The Company will carry out an evaluation of the impact and record the same in the financial statements in the period in which the Code becomes effective and the related rules are published. b) Capital and other commitments - As at 31 March 2022, the Company has NIL capital commitment (31 March 2021: 13 Millions). - The Company will provide financial support to its wholly owned subsidiaries, so as to meet their liabilities as and when the same is required. 37 INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATES The Group has investment in associates as on 31 March 2022 (Refer Note 7).

Return on investment (ROI) RBI had taken measures during COVID-19 in the month of March 2020 hence cut interest rates drastically, and introduced ample liquidity measures.
