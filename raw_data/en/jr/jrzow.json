Is their work similar to a chiropractic or more like a massage therapist with integrated medicine. 13 Answers [Dr. Myleen Simone](/Expert/81738974-Myleen-Simone)Naturopathic Physician SURPRISE, AZ No. We are licensed naturopathic medical doctors meaning that we have a medical degree that trained us not only in conventional medicine but also traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, botanical medicine, physical medicine such as adjustments, iv therapy, diet, vitamins/minerals, homeopathy, amongst other things. Depending on the state we have prescribing rights so we can actually prescribe medicine. [Dr. Cassie Jones](/Expert/81556654-Cassie-Jones)Naturopath La Mesa, CA Naturopathic Doctors are trained as primary care physicians with extra training in natural medicine. If you are looking for manual therapy (chiro adjustments, massage, etc) then you would need to find a Naturopathic Doctor who specializes in sports medicine. NDs are trained in manipulation (chiro adjustments) but not all NDs use these in practice, and not all states allow it. We are not licensed massage therapists. I hope this answer was helpful for you. [Lisa Ballantyne](/Expert/81226718-Lisa-Ballantyne)Naturopathic Physician Gig Harbor, Washington Naturopathic physicians do so much more than chiropractors. We are trained in manipulations similar to a chiropractor, but we also are able to be primary care doctors in many states that include writing prescriptions for medications. We help work on the root cause of a problem and have many tools in our tool box to assist you in achieving your optimal health. In Health, Lisa Ballantyne, ND In Health, Lisa Ballantyne, ND [Genevieve Price](/Expert/82736941-Genevieve-Price)Naturopathic Physician San Diego, CA Naturopathic doctors focus on treating the root cause of disease by performing a thorough history and conducting comprehensive diagnostic testing, and using natural treatments such as herbs, supplements, and individualized diet and lifestyle recommendations. [Sylvia Hood Washington](/Expert/82736438-Sylvia-Hood-Washington)Naturopathic Physician Winfield, IL These are distinctly different but overlapping professions. You need to contact the naturopath and ask about their specific training, licensing and certification. [Brian Costigan](/Expert/8134627-Brian-Costigan)Naturopathic Physician Frankston, Victoria Yes both Chiropractors and Naturopath work along the same lines. Having said that, Natural Medicines, are best when the person is fully aware, and trained for the best things for you. [Liz Zafra Evans](/Expert/82736083-Liz-Zafra-Evans)Naturopathic Physician Victoria, TX We are similar to conventional doctors, but we use 100% natural medicines, diet, and physical activity. Dr. Liz Dr. Liz [Seitheach Wilson](/Expert/81281706-Seitheach-Wilson)Naturopathic Physician Las Vegas, NV We do not implement massage. We attend Medical School and we study natural remedies along side modern medicine. We like to look at a broader scope. Instead of just solving the problems you come to us with modern medicine we like to look at how they came about in the first place and how we can better deal with it. [Dr. Joy S. Edwards](/Expert/511669-Joy-S-Edwards)Naturopathic Physician Atlanta, Georgia No, we do not. Chiropractors work with the bones and the alignment of them. Now, some chiropractors educate on nutrition and the like, but it is definitely two different types of medicine. [Julia St. Clair](/Expert/82735598-Julia-St-Clair)Naturopathic Physician Gilbert, Arizona Hello! Naturopathic Doctors are trained in adjustments that are basically the same that Chiropractors use. We are also trained in soft tissue work as we are aware of how the body all works together. So, we are capable of doing both of the things that you are asking about, however, depending on the comfort level of the doctor, we often refer to chiropractors and massage therapists to help us treat patients who might require these treatments. [Lorenzo J. Anderson](/Expert/82735844-Lorenzo-J-Anderson)Pain Management Specialist | Interventional Pain Medicine Savannah, GA We use Acupressure which is very similar to Chinese Acupuncture for 30 second to reduce and eliminate pain and muscle aches. No needles involved. [Katherine Hope Kipling](/Expert/82734915-Katherine-Hope-Kipling)Massage Therapist Bellingham, WA A naturopath does not have a massage or chiropractic license so they can't practice that. They are more like doctors who try to turn away from prescription drugs and lean toward supplements or other means to help you feel better. [LUCAS FIGUEROA](/Expert/82735861-Lucas-Figueroa)Naturopathic Physician Caldwell, TX No, we do not. But some have a certification in Craneosacral therapy "}
