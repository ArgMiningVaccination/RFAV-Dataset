Introduction Montefiore Health System is a premier academic health system and the University Hospital for Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Combining a nationally -recognized clinical excellence with a population health perspective that focuses on the health needs of communities, Montefiore delivers coordinated, compassionate, science -driven care where, when and how patients need it most. Monte fiore consists of six hospitals and an extended care facility with a total of 2,080 beds, a School of Nursing, and state -of-the-art primary and specialty care provided through a network of more than 150 locations across the region, including the largest sc hool health program in the nation and a home health program. The Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital (MVH), located 12 North Seventh Avenue, Mount Vernon, NY 10550 is a licensed 176 -bed hospital comprised of 124 medical/surgical beds, 8 coronary care beds, 1 2 intensive care beds, 22 Psychiatry beds and 10 AIDS beds. As a community -based teaching hospital, MVH has been serving the medical needs of the community and region since its founding in 1891. As of November 6, 2013, as a part of the Montefiore Health S ystem, a premier academic medical center and the University Hospital system for Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital continues to provide inpatient, critical care and ambulatory services. Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital is a New York State - designated Stroke Center and HIV/AIDS Center, and it is home to the Beale Chronic Wound Treatment and Hyperbaric Center and the Montefiore School of Nursing. Montefiore's partnership with Einstein advances clinical and translational research to accelerate the pace at which new discoveries become the treatments and therapies that benefit patients. The medical center derives its inspiration for excellence from it s patients and community, and continues to be on the frontlines of developing innovative approaches to care. 2a. Montefiore's Mission Statement and Strategy : Montefiore's Mission Statement and Strategy : In January 2009, Montefiore Medical Center com pleted a comprehensive review and update of its strategic plan. The process included the development and approval by its Board of Trustees of revised statements of the medical center's Mission, Vision and Values. Mission: To Heal, to Teach, to Discover and to Advance the Health of the Communities We Serve. Vision: 4 To be a premier academic medical center that transforms health and enriches lives . Values: Humanity, Innovation, Teamwork, Diversity and Equity As part of that process, Montefiore established five Strategic Goals; setting out Montefiore's course for the decade to come: 1. Advance our partnership with the Einstein College of Medicine 2. Create notable Centers of Excellence 3. Build specialty care broadly 4. Develop a seamless delivery system with superior access, quality, safety and patient satisfaction 5. Maximize the impact of our community service The inclusion of an explicit statement affirming Community Service as part of Montefiore's Mission Statement is not new. It has always been one of the core elements of Montefiore's mission. What has changed is the explicit reference to \"advancing the health of the communities we serve\", focusing on making a measurable difference in the health of those populations and communities. This is further sharpened by the inclusion as one of the five strategic goals the imperative, to \"maximize the impact of our community service.\" In pursuing that goal, Montefiore has tasked itself: To better coordinate and focus its resources on specific high prevalence /high impact problems affecting its community; To work internally and with community partners to identify priority health needs, and; To develop and implement more effective broad -based plans of action to address them, and to advance the health of the c ommunities we serve. 5 The rationale behind this change was the realization that we must focus our efforts, if we are to make a real, measurable difference in the health of populations, and communities. That is essentially the same logic as underpins the state's revised Community Service Plan process. Historically, Montefiore has earned a reputation as a leader in the region, state and nation in providing services to its community, by developing and operating an extraordinary array of needed services to t he poor and underserved, and to specific at -risk populations (eg. children, the elderly, the HIV -infected, the homeless and victims of domestic violence). In its updated Strategy, Montefiore included a strategic goal - \"Maximize the impact of our communi ty service\" - that is focused on improving performance in this critical area. It has led to the creation of a new institutional focus for community health improvement activities - the Montefiore Office of Community and Population Health, charged to overs ee, and support and coordinate Montefiore's diverse portfolio of community health improvement programs and activities, enhance Montefiore's capacity to assess and measure the health needs of the communities it serves, identify, assess and select a limi ted number of top -priority health needs in the communities Montefiore serves for specific focus, and lead and coordinate Montefiore -wide efforts, and, where possible working, together and with community partners to make a difference, to measurably improv e the health of the communities we serve. 2b. Community Health Needs Assessment Submission Date Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital's comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Strategy Report submission was approved by the Community Services Committee of the Board of Trustees on November 4, 2014. The Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Report (CHNA & I) report was uploaded to the Montefiore website December 2014 at the URL http://www.montefiore.org/documents/communityservices/2014 -CHNA1 -MV-with-CSS- Inventory.pdf . 6 III. Definition and Description of the Community/Service Area Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital ha s identified the city of Mount Vernon and its surrounding towns and villages as its primary service area. Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital is the only hospital in the City of Mount Vernon, which is the southernmost city in Westchester County. Adjacent to the Bronx, it is the most densely populated community in the County with more than 70,000 citizens within its 4.2 square miles. MMVH also serves a portion of the Bronx population that is supported the Wakefield Campus of Montefiore Medical Center. The co mmunities served by the MMVH are extremely diverse. The service area contains pockets of prosperity, where health insurance coverage is more prominent, along with many economically challenged neighborhoods whose residents are uninsured or underinsured. Mo st of the latter do not access healthcare routinely but rather present only in crisis through the Emergency Department. Mount Vernon is a diverse urban setting, with multiple sub -populations that evidence tremendous variation. In addition to Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital, the community is served by many independent providers including neighboring hospitals/systems, and a Federally Qualified Health Center, which has an overlapping service area. In this setting, the focus is on specific health needs of specific populations, in targeted communities, working with specific partners to address the needs of this community. The ability to apply services in a targeted fashion has been Montefiore's historical approach to developing and operating its programs of community health, and that is the approach we have taken in developing this Community Service Plan. 7 Mount Vernon Service Area 8 3a. The Pop ulation of Mount Vernon According to the 2013 American Community Survey of the U.S. Census, Mount Vernon has approximately 68,000 residents within zip codes 10550, 10552, and 10553. This city is 4.4 square miles; noted as the 8th largest city and 2nd most densely populated city in New York State. This city is located north of the Bronx and bordered by Pelham, Bronxville, Eastchester, and Yonkers. There are approximately 26,000 households in Mount Vernon. The average household size is 2.79 people. Families made up 65.6% of the households; includes both married -couple families (33.4%) single lies (32.2% male, 28.4% female).

Mount Vernon is ethnically diverse. Its population is 12.3% Hispanic, 64.7% African -American, 24.7% White, 2.1% Asian, and 5.3% other. Almost one -third (34.2%) of its reside nts are foreign - born. Among these immigrants, more people speak only English at home than any other language. The city's immigrant communities come from diverse corners of the globe (in order of their numbers): Jamaica, Brazil, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Portugal, the West Indies, Trinidad & Tobago, Italy, Barbados, & Guyana. The city has one of the highest percentages of residents living below the poverty line in Westchester County.

The Mount Vernon unemployment rate of 11.7% is one of the highest unemployment rates in Westchester County. 27.8% of Mount Vernon residents ages 25 and older have received their high school diploma or GED; higher than countywide (19.4%) and statewide (26.8%) attainment rates. 3b. Health Disparities in the Mount Vernon The health status of the city of Mount Vernon was measured across the indicators of overall health status as well as indicators of the social, environmental, and economic determinants of health. While there are areas of improvement, Mount Vernon's rates r emain significantly high, when compared to the remainder of Westchester County. 9 The residents in Mount Vernon have significantly high mortality rates from heart disease, cancer, stroke, and chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRD). Mortality Rates : According to the New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Vital Statistics of New York State report in 2011, Westchester County (which includes the city of Mount Vernon) has an age-adjusted mortality rate of 713.4 per 100,000; similar to the statewid e rate of 753.1. According to the Community Health Rankings in 2014, Westchester County ranked as number 3 out of 62 NY counties to have the lowest mortality rate in New York State. The leading cause of death among Westchester County residents is due to co ronary heart disease (219.7 per 100,000). Asthma & CLRD : According to the NYSDOH, 8.7% of Westchester County adults had asthma from 2008 -2009; lower than the statewide percentage of 9.7%. According to CDC data, the percentage of Westchester County adults with asthma increased to 14% from 2011 -2012; same percentage as New York State. According to an asthma report from New York State Office of the State Comptroller, the asthma prevalence rate among Westchester County Medicaid recipients was 86.7 per 1,000 fr om 2008 - 2009. The prevalence rate increased to 98.4 per 1,000 from 2012 -2013; similar to the statewide prevalence rate of 98.7. The average (age -adjusted) rate of asthma emergency department visits per 10,000 from 2011 was 64.2 in Westchester County. In 2 012, the rate of asthma emergency department visits increased to 67.4 per 10,000. In 2010, the age -adjusted death rate due to chronic lower respiratory diseases among Westchester County residents was 24.3 per 100,000; lower than the statewide rate of 31.1 . In 2011, Westchester County 's death rate decreased to 23.4; remaining lower than the statewide rate of 31.2. Heart Disease & Stroke : The coronary heart disease mortality rate per 100,000 in Westchester County was 119.5 in 2011; similar to the 2010 rate of 117.1. The coronary heart disease hospitalization rate per 10,000 in Westchester County was 35.8 in 2011; similar to the 2010 rate of 36.4. 10 The cerebrovascular disease (stroke) mortality rate per 100,000 in Westchester County was 25.8 in 2011; an increa se from the 2010 rate of 24.0. The stroke hospitalization rate per 10,000 in Westchester County from 2009 -2011 was 22.8; similar to the statewide rate of 24.9. The cardiovascular disease mortality rate per 100,000 in Westchester County was 199.2 in 2011; an increase from the 2010 rate of 195.5. The cardiovascular disease hospitalization rate per 10,000 in Westchester County was 133.1; similar to the 2010 rate of 135.9. Cancer : The mortality rate of all cancer diagnoses in Westchester County was 150.5 in 2010; similar to the statewide rate of 160.2. The type of cancer with the highest mortality rate in Westchester County is lung cancer (36.9 per 100,000; lower than the statewide rate of 41.8). The incidence rate of all cancer diagnoses in Westchester Coun ty was 495.2 per 100,000 in 2010; similar to the statewide rate of 482.5. The type of cancer with the highest incidence rate in Westchester County is prostate cancer (22.6 per 100,000; similar to the statewide rate of 21.3). 3c. Medically Underserved Community The City of Mount Vernon has been designated to have a population and geography that allows it to have the medically underserved population and to be a medically underserved area with respect to its access to primary care services. This categori zation is based on an index value that includes the infant mortality rate, the poverty rate, the percentage of elderly population and the primary care physician to population ratio. Health Insurance: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2010, 17.6% of Mount Vernon adults did not have health insurance in 2013; higher than the countywide (14.9%) and statewide (15%) rates. During the same year, 5.5% of Mount Vernon children did not have health insurance; higher than the countywide (3.1%) rate and statewide (4%) rates. Physician Shortage : As of January 6, 2014, the New York State Education Department, through the Board of Regents at the request of the New York State Department of Health reaffirmed the City of Mount Vernon to be an ident ified Physician Shortage Area in accordance with the Health Resources and 11 Services Administration (HRSA) designation to be Primary Care Health Professions Shortage Areas (HPSAs). While all of Westchester County does not have that designation, Mount Ver non has maintained that designation for over 40 years. 4. Assessment of Community Health Need 4a. Description of Process and Methods Multiple conversations and meetings were convened internally and with external partners, including a thorough review of the data, which determined the activities that would be the focus over the CHNA implementation period. In this Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Report, the documentation of organizations and partners documents those individuals, groups and organizations with whom implementation activities were planned are detailed in the appendices. Additionally, through the development of the New York State Community Service Plan Process, two local health priorities were identified within Westchester County on which all hospital organizations had agreed to participate. As the asset acquisition of Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital occurred after the development and release of the Westchester County Community Health Assessment and Improvement Plan and dur ing a time of transition for the facility, its personnel and the community, the development of a relevant, recognized, and trusted community information solicitation process was paramount to gaining the support and trust necessary to successfully implement any identified health priorities to be implemented in the community. In January 2013, the Westchester Department of Health Commissioner initiated a series of meeting with the acute care, specialty care and federally qualified health centers in the county to form a planning team to collectively identify two local health priorities, with at least one addressing a health disparity in support of the New York State Health Improvement Plan. Members of the pre -existing hospital entities prior to the devel opment of Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital were present, and are still employed by MMVH to provide continuity to this process. Through this process, t wo New York State priority areas were chosen, beyond the process identified in the CHNA as priorities to be addressed in improving the community's health . Those are: to Prevent Chronic Disease; and to Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children. 4.a.i Data Sources Multiple data sources were used to support the identification and selection of the priori ty items, which were identified, selected, and reviewed with partners. A listing and brief summary of the data sources used to complete the secondary data analysis that were used to identify the issues of concern beyond experience and direct observation a re listed below. i. New York State Department of Health Bronx County Indicators for Tracking Public Health Priority Areas 12 ii. The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) iii. NYS Community Health Indicator Reports iv. County Health Rankings v. Community Health Needs Assessment www.chna.org vi. CDC Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Report vii. New York State Department of Health Annual HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report viii. American Community Survey For this data colle ction process for Mount Vernon, when City of Mount Vernon data was not available, a c ustom area estimate for Mount Vernon for the specific indicator was generated using population weighted allocations. These estimates are aggregates of each county which f alls within the custom area, based on the proportion of the population from the county which also falls in the area. Population proportions are determined for each county using 2010 census block centroids. This is accomplished by dividing the summed popula tion of the census blocks (associated with each county) which fall within the custom area by the total population of each county that intersects the custom area. In this way, when a custom area contains 50% of the area of a county, but contains 90% of its population, the figure for that county is weighted at 90% in the custom area tabulation. This approach assumes spatial uniformity of the reported figure throughout the county. The base geography for these calculations is the county. American Community Survey (ACS) \u2014 Developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, the ACS is an ongoing survey that collects annual data on the major characteristics of communities throughout the U.S. The data collected is categorized into four categories: social, economic, demographic, and housing. Social characteristics include topics such as education, disability status, and health insurance status. Economic characteristics describe the income, employment status, and poverty level of U.S. communities. Demographic characteristics inclu de age, sex, and race/ethnicity information. Housing characteristics include topics such as occupancy and vacancy, monthly rent, and household size. Approximately 3.5 million U.S households are randomly selected to participate in the ACS each year. The 201 3 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Questionnaires, datasets, survey results, documentation and more detailed information are available at https://www.census.gov/acs/www/ . Community Health Needs Assessment \u2014 This project was developed by the Advancing the Movement organization and the Center for Applied Research and Environmental Systems (CARES) as a web -based toolkit designed to hospitals, state and local health departments, and other organizations seeking to better understand the needs and assets of their communities . County -level data retrieved from institutions such as the CDC, U.S. Census Bureau, and the Public Health Institute are formulated into customized data reports. The Full Health Indicators Report illustrates the health needs assessment profiles of U.S. counties using local demographics, socioeconomic factors, physical environment data, clinical care data, health behavior factors, and health outcomes . The 2012 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the Community Health Needs Assessment can be found at CHNA.org . 13 County Health Rankings \u2014 This project is a collaboration between the Robert Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Additional data measures used in the rankings were provided by surveys and databases from other organizations such as the Nat ional Center for Health Statistics, CDC, Dartmouth Institute, U.S. Census Bureau, and U.S. Department of Agriculture. This database generates health rankings of every U.S. county and illustrates the correlations between local health outcomes, health factor s, and socioeconomic factors. The county rankings are based on summary scores calculated from individual data measures. The overall Health Outcomes summary score consists of data on the county's mortality and morbidity. The overall Health Factors summary s core consists of data on the county's health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. The 201 2 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. Detailed information on the County Health Rankings can be found at http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/our -approach . NYS Community Health Indicator Reports \u2014 Reports were provided by the New York State Cancer Registry and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The NYS Cancer Registry was established in 1976 to track statewide data of all patients diagnosed w ith cancer. Data collected from this registry include exposure risks, stages at diagnosis, treatment information, and death rates. Each time a person is diagnosed with a tumor, the hospital(s) where that person is diagnosed and/or treated is required by th e Public Health Law Section 2401 to report information about the person and tumor to the Cancer Registry within six months of patient diagnosis. The most recent year for which data on new cases and cancer deaths are available is 2011. Detailed information on the NYS Cancer Registry can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/ . The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual statewide telephone su rveillance system designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample re presents the non -institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older. The survey is conducted in all 50 states and U.S. territories. New York State has participated annually since 1985. Statewide representative samples are collected month ly and aggregated into yearly datasets. The 2011 data is the latest Westchester County -specific BRFSS data illustrated by the NYSDOH. Questionnaires, datasets, survey results, documentation and much more are all available at http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/ . New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Westchester County Indicators for Tracking Public Health Priority Areas 2013 -2017 \u2014 Findings are provided by various agencies such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Center for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), and NYSDOH programs . Detailed information provided by these agencies describe each U.S. community's entire population, including cross -tabulations of age, sex, households, families, relationship to householder, housi ng units, and race/ethnic groups. This NYSDOH report also includes statewide & county -specific data and the 2017 14 targets for numerous indicators for the five major prevention agenda areas: preventing chronic diseases; promote a healthy and safe environment ; promoting healthy women, infants and children; promote mental health and prevent substance abuse; and, prevent HIV/STDs, vaccine - preventable disease and health care -associated infections. The 201 2 data is the most recent data available at the time of thi s report. Detailed information on the NYSDOH Public Health Priority Areas report can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2013 - 2017/about.htm . The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) \u2014 This comprehensive database was established in 1979 as a result of cooperation between the health care industry an d government. SPARCS collects patient level data on hospital discharges, patient characteristics, diagnoses and treatments, and health care services. This database system also collects data on charges for every hospital discharge, ambulatory surgery patien t, and emergency department admission in New York State. This database features the World Health Organization's Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD -9), an official set of codes used by physicians, hospitals, and allied healt h workers to indicate diagnosis for all patient encounters. The 2013 data is the most recent data available at the time of this report. The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid's DRG (Diagnosis -Related Groups) coding system is also featured in the SPARCS d ata. DRGs group patients by diagnosis, treatment, age, and other characteristics. Hospitals are paid a set fee for treating patients in a single DRG category. Detailed information on the SPARCS data can be found at http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/sparcs/ . Westchester County Community Health Assessment & Improvement Plan 2014 -2017 \u2014 The Westchester County Department of Health (WCDOH) plays a leading role in promoting health, preventing disease, and prolonging meaningful life for Westchester County residents. WCDH monitors and controls the spread of communicable diseases, monitors and regulates air and water quality, enforces the state and local sanitary co de, promotes local public health activit ies, and assures the availability of community health services. CDH has collaborated with local hospitals and other community health partners to complete a Community Health Assessment (CHA), which describes the current health status of Westchest er County r esidents, identifies existing gaps and health care barriers, assesses the availability and accessibility of health care services, and specifies public health prioritie s in the County. In addition, a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) has been crafted to lay out the specific objectives, goals, and actions of t he Health Department to address the public health priorit ies identified in the Community He alth Assessment. Detailed information on this report can be found at http://health.westchestergov.com/statistics . 4.a.ii Collaboration and Participants As the Community Health Needs Assessment was being developed, two simultaneous processes were evolving. First, Montefiore was charged with the development of its New York State Community Service Plan submission for the period of 2015 -2017 for the New York State Health Department's Prevention Agenda. For this process, priorities were identified within Westchester 15 County on which all hospital orga nizations had agreed to participate. As the asset acquisition of Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital occurred after the development and release of the Westchester County Community Health Assessment and Improvement Plan and during a time of transition for the facility, its personnel and the community, the development of a relevant, recognized, and trusted community information solicitation process was paramount to gaining the support and trust necessary to successfully implement any identified health priorities to be implemented in the community. In January 2013, the Westchester Department of Health Commissioner initiated a series of meeting with the acute care, specialty care and federally qualified health centers in the county to form a planning team to collectively identify two local health priorities, with at least one addressing a health disparity in support of the New York State Health Improvement Plan. Members of the pre -existing hospital entities prior to the development of Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital were present, and are still employed by MMVH to provide continuity to this process. Through this process, t wo New York State priority areas were chosen, beyond the process identified in the CHNA as priorities to be addressed in improving the com munity's health . Those are: to Prevent Chronic Disease; and to Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children. Second, through the Montefiore Health System's successful application to submit as an Emerging Performing Provider System (PPS) as a part of th e New York State Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Program Application process, the decision was made to collaborate with the Hudson Valley region's other four PPS organizations to complete one comprehensive Community Needs Assessment, resulting in the \"One Region, One CNA\" process. With these three similar activities occurring simultaneously, a streamlined set of data collection tools and methods were developed to gather information to inform the CAN process. 4.a.ii.1 Partners/Organizations 4.a.ii.1.a Partners/Organizations As indicated in Section 4a, the partners listed in this section comprise the individuals, groups and organizations that are participating in the focused Implementation Plan activities that evolve out of the CHNA process. As the CHNA process was conducted simultaneously with the New York State Community Service Plan (CSP) development, there is strong alignment between the areas of focus in this report and the areas presented in the CSP. In Section 7, it is clearly document ed that Montefiore will continue to work on the over 85 existing program initiatives, as each of those initiatives have partners, metrics, and meeting schedules. The Montefiore Health System has significant experience in working with community advisory groups and boards. During the process of initiating the relationship with the Mount Vernon community, the community advisory group platform was utilized as a method of gathering input from key community stakeholders on the health of the community. As the asset acquisition of Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital occurred after the development and release of the Westchester County Community Health Assessment and Improvement Plan 16 and during a time of transition for the facility, its personnel and the communit y, the development of a relevant, recognized, and trusted community information solicitation process was paramount to gaining the support and trust necessary to successfully implement any identified health priorities to be implemented in the community. Th e Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Community Advisory Group (CHNA CAG) was formed for this purpose. This key stakeholder group was made of leaders from civic, municipal and non -governmental service providers, leaders in t he business and faith communities and non -affiliated community residents. Montefiore worked extensively with representatives of the affected communities through this community advisory group to identify health care needs and determine the appropriate confi guration of services. To level set the discussions, the community advisory group participated in an extensive data review session examining over 400 data categories specifically related to the indicators of overall health status as well as indicators of t he social, environmental, and economic determinants of health. After significant distillation, the community advisory group assisted in the review and prioritization of the health needs of this community, as well as the identification of key topics to be included in the comprehensive Community Needs Assessment survey that was distributed in early Fall 2014. This community level approach involving relevant stakeholders that in the targeted community who are interested in the particular health issues being addressed provides for a closer alignment between the community level goals of Montefiore and the health promotion/improvement/maintenance goals of the community. The membership of the Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Co mmunity Advisory Group includes the members listed in the table below: Name Organization Ronnie Cox Community Activist; President of Mount Vernon Educational Foundation; Public Relations Consultant Elizabeth Spiro Administrator for the Guidance Center of Westchester Early Childhood School District; Vice President of Community Outreach for the Mount Vernon Sinai Free Synagogue; Elmira City School District Mary Harris Community Advocate, Senior Citizen; Retired Con Edison Executive; Lifetime Resident of Mount Vernon 17 Diane Atkins Deputy Commissioner City of Mount Vernon Recreation Department Frances Lightsy Principal of Grimes Elementary School of Mount Vernon Pedro Coelho Owner of Padaminas Caf\u00e9& Pizzeria; Brazilian Bakery Jacquelyn Richards President & Owner of local business in Mount Vernon , M.R.

Costello Assistant Superintendent of Business for Mount Vernon City School District Dozene Guishard Director of 99th Street Aging Program; TIAA CREF in NYC As the asset acquisition of Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital occurred after the development and release of the Westchester County Community Health Assessment and Improvement Plan and during a time of transition for the facility, its personnel and the community, the development of a relevant, recognized, and trusted community information solicitation process was paramount to gaining the support and trust necessary to successfully implement any identified health priorities to be implemented in the community. Montefiore met with the Deputy Commissioner, Dr. Cheryl Archibald, and her team to gain a greater understanding of the process for the county in selecting the health priorities. The inter - organizational commit tee that was developed to address the identification of these heath needs consisted of the following membership: Westchester County Health Planning Team Members Organization Name Title 18 Blythedale Children's Hospital Lena Cavanna Director, Community & Media Relations Regina M.

Measures and Resources to Meet Identified Needs Montefiore is a leader in community health and has a long history of developing innovative approaches to care and tailoring programs to best serve the changing needs of its community. These include, but are not limited to the follo wing: Community Service Plan, Community Services Strategy, Accountable Care Organization, Patient -Centered Medical Home, Disease Management Programs, and Community Outreach. The integration of these innovative approaches serves Montefiore well in its ser vices to its community. Montefiore has a vast portfolio of programs and services that address a majority of the significant community health needs identified in the Community Health Needs Assessment. The breadth and depth of the programs and services var y, but each address a need identified in the community. Historically, Montefiore has earned a reputation as a leader in the region, state and nation in providing services to its community, by developing and operating an extraordinary array of needed servi ces to the poor and underserved, and to specific at -risk populations (e.g., children, the elderly, the HIV -infected, the homeless and victims of domestic violence). Beyond its involvement in patient care services to individuals within and (in some cases ) beyond its service area, the faculty and staff at Montefiore are heavily invested in the provision of service to the wider community, through: the education of health professionals; the generation of new knowledge through basic, clinical and social sciences research; affecting health policy through service on a range of professional, governmental and inter-institutional boards and advisory group; and by involvement in programs of community service (like housing preservation) which go beyond the boundaries of health and health care. Montefiore embraces its social responsibility and defines its role broadly, promoting wellness in addition to treating disease and addressing needs ranging far beyond medical care. We extend this responsibility to th e care of our employees and medical staff, many of whom live in the surrounding community. The population Montefiore serves is one of the most diverse in the nation. Montefiore has been an incubator for programs that improve patients' access to culturally appropriate services, and its progressive financial aid policy and robust entitlement enro llment program support access to care for those in need. Historically, Montefiore has viewed community service and community health improvement as a delivery system challenge, reaching out to serve the under -resourced. Services to the community are an e xplicit and essential component of Montefiore's mission and one of its most valued traditions. The medical center has a long history of reaching beyond the walls of its hospitals to identify and meet the needs of its community and has been a national leader in organizing and expanding community -based services. Our commitment to the 55 community has required a multifaceted, continually evolving response, in which the unique capacities of the academic medical center are mobilized to improve the lives of the peo ple and the communities we serve -- not just medically, but socially, economically and environmentally, wherever and whenever our resources can make a difference. For much of our history, community service at Montefiore has been a vital grassroots movem ent. When pressing needs arose that lay beyond the purview of traditional health care, physicians, nurses, social workers, staff and community partners have stepped in to address them. These programs tackle a remarkable range of health problems in the Bro nx; from the epidemics of diabetes and obesity to high rates of teen pregnancy. They come in an equally impressive range of sizes; from an online guide to hundreds of social services to complex federally -funded agencies with hundreds of staff. With the un derstanding that the practice of medicine is a service to the community, we have defined community service to include those efforts at preventing disease, enhancing wellbeing and enacting social change that go beyond traditional health care and its fee -for-service reimbursement system. Through this entrepreneurial spirit, over the past one hundred years in the Bronx, Montefiore associates have developed, independently and in collaboration with other organizations, an impressive array of programs that addre ss many of the needs of our communities. In many cases the programs developed in the Bronx have resulted in national changes in best practices and through our relationship as the University Hospital for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the program s have the capacity to expand the evidence base to improve the health of communities like ours beyond our borders. 6a. Internal Resources and Measures Below is a list of Montefiore programs that address a variety of community needs, including a brief description, the intervention measures that the program captures and the coordination of the program to the larger New York State Prevention Agenda that is also aligned with the New York City Take Care New York initiatives.

WIC is a supplemental nutrition program, providing supplemental food vouchers, nutrition education, breast feeding education, peer counseling and physical fitness education. Women are pre - screened for the program and receive a medical referral to the WIC program from providers, they qualify based on their income. Once they are screened, they receive counseling with a nutritional coun selor. Vouchers are distributed for supermarket purchases on a monthly basis for three months worth of fruits, vegetables, milk, eggs, juice, beans, bread, peanut butter, etc. Counselors encourage breastfeeding for new babies, at six months, new mothers receive vouchers for baby food and cereal. At 12 months, no more formula vouchers are given. Participants see a nutritionist every 3 months and qualification is verified annually. Group education, physical education and food demonstrations are given as well. Montefiore provides space and referrals.

New York State Health Improvement Plan - Implementation Plan and Measures As a part of the Montefiore submission for the New York State Health Improvement Plan for 2015 -2017, required by the New York State Department of Health, two broad focus areas across two priority areas - Preventing Chronic Disease and Promoting Healthy Wom en, Infants and Children, in addition to the large array of services provided by Montefiore were identified. These broad focus areas are (1) Increase Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Se ttings , (2) Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure (3), and (4) Improving Maternal and Infant Health. Across these focus areas, six goals, with specific interventions, performance measures and time fram es, were identified, and are described in the next section. Two Year Plan of Action \u20142015 -2017 The two areas selected by Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital (and the corresponding designations in the Prevention Agenda 2014 -2017: New York State's Health Impro vement Plan) for submission in this Community Service Plan are as follows: Under the Priority Area - Prevent Chronic Disease 1. Increase Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Settings a. Goal 3.3.1 - Increasing screening rates for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers especially among disparate populations Under the Priority Area - Promote Healthy Women Infants and Children 2. Maternal and Infant Health a. Goal 2.2.1 - Increase the proportion of infants born in New York State who are exclusively breastfed during the birth hospitalization The plan of action for each focus area is described in the following sections: 101 Prevent Chronic Disease (Heart Disease) Focus Area 3: Increase Access to High Quality Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management in Both Clinical and Community Settings Goal 3.3.1 - Increasing screening rates for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers especially amo ng disparate populations Strategic Plan: Montefiore has selected to focus on reducing the racial disparities by decreasing the percentage of Blacks and Hispanics dying prematurely from heart related diseases by focusing on reducing tobacco and nicotine co nsumption among these populations in the Montefiore service area as tobacco and nicotine consumption is a leading causal indicator in heart related disease. The implementation of this focus area will strongly combine elements of Focus Area 2: Reducing Illness Disability and Death Related to Tobacco Use and Secondhand Smoke Exposure. Specifically, through the specific implementation of Goal 3.3.1 - Increasing screening rates for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers es pecially among disparate populations, focusing specifically on cardiovascular diseases, through the mechanism of: Goal 2.2.2 - Increasing the number of unique callers to the New York State Quit -Line Goal 2.2.2 - Decreasing the prevalence of cigarette smoking by adults ages 18 years and older There is a strong likelihood of positively trending toward the reduction of the racial and ethnic disparity rates in premature death from heart related disease. Strategic Plan: Montefiore has been successful at increasing the number of unique callers to the New York State Quit-Line with our inpatient populations as we have been able to document 100% contacts for 102 patients at discharge with provision of the New Yo rk State Quit -Line information. In 2012, this covered over 50,000 unique adult, aged over 18 lives. We have also been tremendously successful with the expansion of the smoke free campus to cover all of our locations in addition to our acute care hospita ls and have remained an ardent support of supplemental nicotine replacement therapy in the community as demonstrated by Montefiore's annual distribution of Nicotine Replacement Therapy across the Bronx and the expansion of this practice at Montefiore New R ochelle Hospital. Goals & Objectives: The goal is to increase the rate of unique callers from across our ambulatory populations and within the communities that our ambulatory facilities are located in by enhancing the training of physicians and increasing the quantity and visibility of the education we provide in New Rochelle and the surrounding communities. Evidence Base: The evidence base for the expansion of smoking cessation programs especially using the New York State Tobacco Control program is subst antial. The P OWR Tobacco Cessation Program of the American Lung Association funded through the New York State Tobacco Control Program is Montefiore's partner in this activity. The measures of these activities are constructed within the framework established by the New York State Department of Health Tobacco Control Program. Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets The performance meas ures associated with the increasing of unique callers to the quit line and the decreasing of smoking prevalence in adults 18 year and older are: Performance Measures (Increasing Unique Callers): Number of callers referred to the quit line as documented in the Electronic Medical Record data Incorporate quit line information on patient discharge information Receive reporting through POWR Tobacco Cessation program of referral of patients through the Fax to Quit program to enhance the number of calls/contacts w ith the Quitline Performance Measures (Decreasing the smoking prevalence in adults): 103 Increasing the provision of pharmaceutical Nicotine Replacement Therapy by appropriate clinical staff to individuals who desire to eliminate tobacco use. Increasing the pr ominence of advertising and traditional and social media messaging to increase the likelihood of appropriate messaging reaching individuals with appropriate readiness levels to quit smoking Timeframe targets: Montefiore Mount Vernon Hospital, as a part of the Montefiore Health System is examining the Opt-to-Quit model as an enterprise wide solution to be implemented by 2017, to further enhance the existing utilization of the Fax -to-Quit hotline. Through the Opt -to-Quit platform, the facility or program es tablishes a patient opt -out policy that triggers the referral process and links tobacco using patients to the evidence -based services of the New York State Smokers' Quitline. The Quitline accepts referred patient information through one of the secure infor mation exchange options; patients are contacted by the Quitline within 72 hours or as specified by the provider. All patients are offered Quitline services at initial contact. The Quitline generates a PAR back to the facility which can be accessed on deman d or via electronic or fax delivery. Quitline communications with the patient are continued at 3 -month intervals for up to 12 months. The purpose of the extended contact is to motivate subsequent quit attempts, encourage tobacco using or recently quit pati ents to use Quitline services, and to offer access to appropriate levels of support. Promote Healthy Women Infants and Children Focus Area 2 - Maternal and Infant Health Goal 2.2.1 - Increase the proportion of infants born in New York State who are exclusively breastfed during the birth hospitalization Strategic Plan & Goals Montefiore Medical Center has committed to achieving the goals of the Baby Friendly Hospital initiative and expand this designation as an enterprise wide solution to our Westches ter Hospitals. It has previously signed on to this designation for our Bronx hospitals through the New York City Department of Health's Latch -On NYC Initiative to support breastfeeding mothers and to increase the proportion of women that are achieving the World Health Organization's target rate of having the first six months of an infant's life with exclusive breastfeeding. Initiative Objectives: 104 1. Montefiore will enforce the New York State hospital regulation to not supplement breastfeeding infants with fo rmula feeding unless medically indicated and documented within the infants medical record 2. Provide physical restriction to infant formula by hospital staff including the tracking of infant formula distribution with the health department 3. Discontinue the dist ribution of free promotional formula 4. Prohibit the display and distribution of infant formula promotion materials in any hospital location. The objectives of the Baby Friendly Hospital are: 1. Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. 2. Train all health care staff in the skills necessary to implement this policy. 3. Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding. 4. Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth. 5. Show mot hers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation, even if they are separated from their infants. 6. Give infants no food or drink other than breast -milk, unless medically indicated. 7. Practice rooming in - allow mothers and infants to remain together 24 h ours a day. 8. Encourage breastfeeding on demand. 9. Give no pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding infants. 10. Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or birth center. Evidenc e Base: The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) developed and launched in 1991 as a program of the World Health Organization and UNICEF is a part of the global effort to support and enable mothers to initiate breastfeeding their babies, with the recom mendation for exclusively breastfeeding infants for their first six months of life. This initiative works to the care of pregnant women, new mothers and their infants in hospitals and other health providing institutions due to research and clinically repo rted improved lifelong outcomes in health for both 105 the breastfed infant and the mother. Additional information about the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative can be found here http://www.babyfriendlyusa.org/ . In support of our system wide objectives, Montefiore Mount Vernon will support the Montefiore New Rochelle commitment to support mothers who choose to breastfeed by providing additional support to breastfeeding mothers and minimize practices that can inter fere with that choice such as supplementing breastfeeding infants with formula, unless medically indicated or at the mother's specific request. Participating hospitals also pledge to end the distribution of promotional formula and materials during the hosp ital stay and at discharge. Supporting this institutional initiative is a public awareness campaign to promote the health benefits of breast milk, and to inform women of their right to receive education, encouragement and support to breastfeed their babies if they choose to do so. When hospitals stop promoting infant formula, mothers are more likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies. The evidence supporting this initiative is strong. Performance Measures and Time Frame Targets: In 2012, over 1,847 in fants were delivered at Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital. Of these infants, for the year 2012, 38.4% were exclusively breastfed, 58.6% received supplemental feeding during the initial hospitalization and 92.8% were identified to have been fed any breast milk during the hospital stay. Across the region, from the available WIC statistics provided as a part of the Healthy, Hunger - Free Kids Act of 2010 (the Act), Public Law 111 -296 for the fiscal year (FY) 2012, breastfeeding performance measurements based on program participant data of the number of partially and fully breastfed infants for each WIC State and local agency was provided. The WIC program at the Mount Vernon Neighborhood Health Center saw a total of 648 infants of which 21 were fully breastf ed, 278 were partially breastfed and 349 were fully formula fed. The WIC program at the Westchester County Department of Health, located in New Rochelle, saw 2192 infants, of which 167 were fully breastfed, 896 were partially breastfed and 1129 were fully formula fed. Performance Measures: Identification of the following Exclusion criteria 106 Delivery Type Skin to Skin Contact Labor Pain Management Type of Infant Feeding through Hospital Stay Pacifier Use Rooming In Previous Breastfeeding Experience & Succes s (If Applicable) Feeding Intent Barriers to Breastfeeding (for non -exclusive mothers only) Development of the following: Written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. Train all health care staff in the skills neces sary to implement this policy. Educational materials and messaging that inform pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding Initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth. Lactation maintenance education during separation from infant Establishment of breastfeeding support groups for referral upon discharge Time Frame Targets: The time frame established for achievement of the baby friendly hospital designation for Montefiore New Rochelle is 2017 and Montefiore Mount Vernon is sup porting that goal through its ambulatory services delivery.. Achievement of the entire Latch on NYC for the Bronx hospitals, as a part of the enterprise wide implementation protocol is also expected to be achieved by 2017. Montefiore has established a Br eastfeeding Committee that contains an inter - organizational, interdisciplinary membership from thr three labor and delivery campuses of Montefiore (Einstein, Wakefield and New Rochelle), Jacobi Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Supplementary membership is held by the Assistant Commissioner of the Bronx District Public Health Office and the Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau of Maternal and Infant and Reproductive Health at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygie ne and the Director of the Westchester County Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children program. 107 References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
