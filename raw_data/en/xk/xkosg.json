My wife enjoyed an outstanding facial treatment. Pedicure treatments upcoming in the fall. It is a handy place near municipal free parking in downtown Rockland.Written August 26, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Sarah also did a hand massage and I opted for a peppermint foot wrap. I would recommend Sea Glass Spa.Written July 31, 2023This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews. - Neck pain is the worst! For years, I have had issues with my neck. After a recent MRI, I was told I have a mild case of DDD (Degenerative Disc Disease). Last year in spring, my neck was so bad I had to go on steroids for a few days...and the Dr also insisted I do some Physical Therapy so I did. Though better, I believe it was a total waste of my time, and so over priced even with insurance. I had reviewed videos online on how Physical Therapy helps with Neck issues. I was so excited to go and get help. However, it was nothing like what I had seen on YouTube, in fact not even close. 6 appointments with very little \"Physical Therapy\"! I swear it's all about the paperwork and money in this \"upset\" medical world! Since being introduced to Pam, I now make appointments every 3 weeks. She spends a good amount of time on my neck as well as the rest of my body. Oh, I feel so so good after my sessions. Thanks Pam! And NO THANK YOU TO PT! Over rated, and way over priced!Written January 15, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Do not miss the opportunity for a massage by Susan Peters. She is just the best.Written July 8, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews. - Sue Kelly and the Skin Klinic and Spa are without a doubt the best around. I felt welcomed and comfortable the moment I walked through the door for my first appointment. Sue is extremely professional while also being caring and helpful. She is extremely knowledgeable and very willing to share her knowledge. She explains things very clearly and reviews your options. She is patient and will take all the time you need to have your questions answered. Sue has a way of easing anxiety. She strives to have you achieve your best you! I made the trip to Rockland 5 times this summer for appointments with Sue. It is a four \u00bd hours round trip for me. Well worth every mile!Written October 27, 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

These massages added so much to our vacationWritten September 6, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Jeanie has been the backbone of this place for years, was very kind and let us take a little tour. Beautiful location above the water. After my wife's reading, we stuck around for some Native American drumming down in their church area. It was a nice experience and my wife was able to participate in the circle. Not for everyone, but if you have a metaphysical inclination, this place might speak to you. Cool little Bayside homes nearby, its worth driving around down by the water.Written June 30, 2021This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews. - Michelle was fantastic. She was very prompt in responding to our inquiries and very accomdating. The facilities are modern, clean and very attractive. It is conveniently located a short stroll from downtown Camden. My wife and I had a great 90 minute couples message. My wife was very pleased and my deep tissue message was great. I highly recommend Santuary Dsy Spa while in Camden.Written September 10, 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There are tons of classes for the whole family- plus open swim and climbing. And if the weather is bad, or you just need some more time for the littles to run around- the kids playroom is awesome. There's day care and camp... this place is the hub of the community.Written March 18, 2017This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Best wishes Emma on your new journey! See you next year.Written September 13, 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Very professional and clean spa with the feeling of peacefulness and love abounding.Written April 17, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Candles, soft lighting, beautiful music, healing aromas, and the delicate touch of Sarah Hodgdon leave me feeling like I have had the ultimate pampering experience. Call ahead for an appointment, so you can anticipate the pleasure that awaits! Whether you are local or vacationing, this is a destination that will draw you back for more. Thank you, Sarah!Written August 17, 2013This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We were weary after several days of lugging our backpacks and hiking poles and found Seaside Skin Care & Spa on an internet search. The spa is a short walk from the Belmont Inn, where we stayed, which was great because we were also tired of being in the car. Both the receptionist and the owner (Sandra) could not have been more welcoming and personable. Seriously, they were great! And, most importantly, the facial-- it was unique in that Sandra wove in some serious massage time that was the perfect compliment to an already really great service.Written August 4, 2015This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews. - My wife and I visited High Mountain Hall on a recent trip to Camden. We took vinyasa flow with Stephen. It was my first yoga class and my wife's first in many years. We both enjoyed it very much. Stephen was a great instructor and we enjoyed talking to him before the class started. The space is beautiful as well.Written April 12, 2016This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews. - I have received the most satisfying massages at Bhavana, specifically with Rick Abare. He works methodically and seems to know just where muscle strain is located and how much pressure is needed. The atmosphere is gentle, clean, open, inviting, and brings a sense of calm just walking in the door. Bhavana also provides a complete range of alternative therapies and \"incorporates diverse modalities & a variety of alternative medicine services\" including various styles of Bodywork & Massage Therapy, Infrared Therapy, Acupuncture/Chinese Medicine, Homeopathy & Medical Intuition.Written May 21, 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
