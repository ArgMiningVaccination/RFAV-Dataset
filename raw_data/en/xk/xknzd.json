R i s k T a k e r s The students have no formal inter- scholastic team sports, though they play intelligence-orientated games among themselves. Boys and girls live in separate dormitories. They must all be in their dormitories by 10.00p.m.; and so far only one student has dropped out - because of homesickness. \"They're all risk takers,\" says Dean of Academic Affairs Cecily Cannon Selby, as reported by Time. \"They gave up football and girl friends and being cock of the walk for an unknown challenge.\" One cannot help wondering whether they are the only ones taking a risk - althougli the fact that this is happening at Higli School level and not below miti gates that risk. After all, if their previous education has given them some indicationof man and the needs of society on a broad human basis, at High School agethey can more safely develop those special abilities which, as individuals, they have brought into the world. But has it? There is a great deal of concern in America about the nature and standards of public education. We must certainly take care of our extraordinarily intellectually gifted young people for their sakes and society's, butwe can only properly do so if our concep tion of education as a whole is far different from what it is now. Although our civilisa tion is largely based on man as an intellec tual being, there are other aspects to his nature which we cannot with impunity allow to be ignored, or imagine that somehow they will take care of them selves. Many people have drawn attention to this. Hermann Hesse, who incidentally was a signator to Steiner's 'Address to the German Nation' on the reconstruc tion of society on a more human basis, has worked on this same problem in his novel, Magister Liidi - The Glass Bead Game. His story is about specially gifted students in a ctitious country called Castalia, who were educated in an elite institution devoted wholly in this case to the mind and imagination. W h a t t h i s d i d t o t h e h e a r t a n d s o u l o f one of these students who eventually became the head or 'Magister' of it all,and what eventually happened to him as a result of it, is told as only an observer of all aspects of the human being, like Hesse, could tell it. One cannot help wondering what these incipient intellectual geniuses gathered in North Carolina, and those who are to follow, will be like as human beings twenty or thirty years from now, and what kind of society they will have materially helped to bring about...

We can put it briefly: mean the loss of much enjoymentour food serves to rebuild our body and (because feeding is related with enjoy- to provide us with energy. ment), it is well known that this is an 67erroneous thouglit. If our food consisted merely of such bricks it would have no nutritional value, although the necessity to absorb tliose bricks cannot be denied. Every housewife is aware of this fact. She knows that food that is overcooked and therefore, as it were, half digested, loses some of its nutritional value. The loss of the so-called vitamins does not sufciently explain this fact. Vitamins, after all, suffer the same fate as the rest of the food, they are digested down. This observation leads nally to the conviction: the less food is prepared, the higher its nutritional value. This has led many people to believe that un cooked food is the most nutritious. That is right up to a point, but it must be remembered that nourishment can't be evaluated in theoretical terms only, but t h a t m u c h m o r e w a s n e e d e d t o a c h i e v e the present level of the art of cooking. D e s t r u c t i o n = n u t r i t i o n a l v a l u e T h e r e i s o n e c o n c l u s i o n w e c a n d r a w from all this: the digestion, that is to say the breaking-down of our food, must take place inside our body. This leads to the surprising observation that the digestion (that is the destruction of the food) mainly decides the nutritional value. It will not be easy, in contemporary dietetics, to understand this. If, however, it is not the material result but the digestion itself that is the crux of the matter, then we must ask our selves what digestion really is. Surely not only destruction? That would make it totally incomprehensible that this should necessarily take place within the body. To nd an answer to this question we will conne ourselves for the moment to vegetable foods and ask ourselves rst: what does one eat when one partakes of a plant? Nowadays we say: a substance, matter. But one can equally say: a shape! What is a shape? It is the result of an activity that has created it down to the smallest details. It is an organisation, a structure, that has emerged from a certainpoint of view. For that reason there exists between the various parts of the shape a connection that follows a strict law. Naturally we do not know the point of view that has been at work here. All we mean to say here is that at the basis of each form there is a unity that shows itself to us in its result. Here we must distinguish between the shape and the contour, which is merely the circumscription of the shape vis-a-visthe environment. In view of what follows it is very important to keep in mind the difference between shape and contour. What has all this got to do with the subject of digestion? The best way to discover this is to examine step by step what goes on during the various stages of feeding. Intimate knowledge A l i t t l e e a r l i e r w e h a v e u s e d a n o t h e r expression for eating, namely to partake of food. This phrase can make us aware of the fact that we can actually speak of feeding before there is any question of eating. When do we start partaking of something? Let us imagine that somebody wants to eat a peach. He must rst go and buy one. He goes to a greengrocer's. Let us saythat he lives in a village, knows the owner of the shop, that there are several people waiting to be served and that there is, therefore, ample time to pick and choose. What is the rst thing he has got to do? See if there are any peaches. Tliat means that he must know what they look like to be able to recognise them. Let us sup pose that there is a box of peaches in the shop. He goes towards it and takes the liberty of picking one up. What does he do then? Press very gently, move his ngers very carefully. Why does he do that? To examine the quality of the peach. He will also probably smell it, another way of judging the fruit. If it is too hard, has too little fragrance, he will put it back. If it is satisfactory he willbuy it. Now he goes home and starts to eat it. What happens? He puts a piece of peach in his mouth and tastes it. This can only be done by moving the tongue and the rest of the mouth. One cannot taste with out moving, in the case of solid food not without chewing. That releases the flow of saliva (not to mention the fact that the mouth watered already when he was smelling the peach), and there the real digestion begins. This is made possible by certain elements in the saliva called enzymes,which break down the food. Each partof our digestive tract has its own special enzymes that link themselves with the food. The marvel is that in this breaking- down process, which we call digestion, t h e e n z y m e s t h e m s e l v e s r e m a i n u n changed. Probing form and structure Something penetrates the food, causes a breaking-down and makes a closer judgement possible by means of tasting. If we try to conjure up a vivid picture of this occupation, tasting, and do not think in the rst place of savouring, but rather of the question: what do 1 taste (oneoften closes one's eyes while tasting attentively), then we can introduce new words for tasting: to probe, to investigate, to fathom, to indicate that here we are concerned with a closer acquaintance. Everything, therefore, is a continuation of what happened in the shop: movement, lightly probe the fruit with the ngers (whereby the ngers themselves do not change), smell, evaluate, put back or take away. In the mouth, to take in, to move, to break down with the aid of enzymes that themselves undergo no change (one might call them bio-chemical ngers), to taste,i.e. probe the specic form and structure - a peach tastes of peaches - and to evaluate; if one does not like it one puts the peach back on the plate, if one nds it acceptable one continues to eat it.We have now passed the second stage of eating: our acquaintance with the fruit is now more intimate than it was in the shop. What happens in the stomach? Again we nd rst of all: movement! The stomach does this even earlier, as though it is waiting for something to do. As soon as we think of food, as soon as we be come hungry, more so when we taste something in our mouth, our stomach becomes active. It begins already to secrete enzymes - we will not go into physiological details \u2014 and it is not difcult to think: here is a continuation of the breaking-down process and a more intensive tasting. We often become aware of a tract of tasting in the stomach and this contributes to our sense of well- being. Enjoyment in the mouth, well- being in the stomach. If our stomach does not agree it can rid itself of the food by vomiting. If the food is all right it passes through the out let of the stomach into the duodenum. Again we get the process of movement, digestion, evaluation. If there is some thing wrong with the food this can cause a quicker elimination, diarrhoea. Other wise it will go into the small intestine,that continues the same process: move ment, secretion of enzymes. Does yet another evaluation take place here? Would it be possible to continue thechain enjoyment \u2014 well-being? Can we really think that what happens in the m o u t h ( a n d a l r e a d y b e g a n o u t s i d e ) continues inside during all further stages of the digestion? Intestine is still 'outside' For that purpose we shall have to re fresh and broaden our ideas of what happens in the alimentary canal, where all this takes place. We observe the world around us with our senses - sight, hearing, touch, etc. \u2014 that are located mainly on the outside of the body. This outside is called the skin. When asking if man also has an inside we 89must think of the intestine, which can be compared to a tube that begins in the mouth and ends in the anus. In simpleterms: the actual human body is between the intestine and the skin. In the intestine one is, therefore, not y e t i n t h e b o d y i t s e l f . T h e F r e n c h language expresses this very subtly. It speaks of a milieu exterieur \u2014 in the intestine - as opposed to a milieu i n t e r i e u r - b e t w e e n t h e w a l l o f t h e intestine and the skin. Tlie intestine is an observing surface, just like the skin. That this is not usually mentioned is due to the fact that we refuse to accept a process of awarenessin our body in which we do not actively a n d c o n s c i o u s l y p a r t i c i p a t e . T h i s i s absolutely true: the 'self which in every day life copes with the impressions of our senses, is excluded from the world of perception within. But we can say from the outset: thank goodness. If we tried to meddle in the incredibly wise activities of the inner person, it might have doubt ful consequences. Our organs know better. When we speak here of our organs knowing, we mean a second person within us, who is dealing with every thing that we mentioned in the beginning of this article about the rebuilding of our body. I f w e c o n s i d e r t h e s u r f a c e o f t h e intestine an observing organ then it is a short step towards the understanding that between mouth and stomach there i s t h e t r a n s i t i o n b e t w e e n t w o w o r l d s o f observation. That which occurred outside our body (in the shop), and continued in the mouth, can be considered as continu ing in stomach and intestine and the other digestive organs: a constantly more intimate knowledge of the secret of the shape of our food, in this case the plant which literally gets analysed. In other words: one is dealing with a continuousand deepening acquaintance with the shape; rst seeing, then tasting, and lastly digesting. The digestion is another form, a metamorphosis of tasting! Thisis a concise way of expressing it. When we continue this reasoning in a logical way, starting from the viewpoint that the digestion is a continued, rened tasting and thus an ever more intimate acquaintance with the shape of the plant, the question arises: what interest does the body have in this continuouslyrenewed acquaintance? We must not forget that this interest is at the same time related to the dietetic value of our food, as we have discovered in the beginning. F o r m e d f r o m o u t s i d e We must remember that the plant is not only matter, but at the same time that it represents a shape. The same can be said of the human body. We are dealing not only with matter that replaces loss of matter, but also with a shape (plant) that is being probed, analysed by another shape (body). We have given a certain denition of *shape' and discussed the activity thatbrings it into being. An artist also creates shapes, forms, but this a different kind of creation from that of the shapes in nature. The artist is himself a living being. As long as he is engaged upon the creation of a work of art, his own life is indeed tied up with the form he is creating. When it is nished the form still carried the hallmark of that life, but it is no longer tied up with it. With the living shape, such as the plant and the body, this is different. 'Life' itself has created the form and remains linked with it until death. Then the form as such can not be maintained any longer and dis i n t e g r a t e s i n t o t h e a b o v e - m e n t i o n e d components of bricks. We come again to the question: what signicance is there for the living body in tasting plant-shapes, analysing and probing them? T o n d t h e a n s w e r w e m u s t r s t reflect upon the quintessence of the shape of the plant. As we have already mentioned, this is not covered by the, which IS only the limit of the plant as we see it. The shape is the result of a creative process that stops at a certain point, that 'congeals in an out line.' Where do we nd these forces, whence do they work? From within the environment, from the realm of earth, air, water, heat, and light that all act directly upon the shape of the plant from without. To that extent, the plant is a completely open creature. In its original form it consists of stem and leaves, of lines and planes. In the higher animals (and man, of course) we nd exactly the opposite: they are constructed from the inside, from the intestine. Therefore animals have a content. Plants have no content, they have an 'out-tent', i.e. their environ ment is part of their body, just as that which takes place in our intestine and lungs is part of us. In relation to the plant man has directed his environment towards the inside. Equally one can say that what in man is inside is the environment for the plant, and as our skin is the boundary of thatinside so is the outline of the plant the boundary of the inside that surrounds the plant. That which acts from the air, the water, the soil, etc. on the surface of the plant is therefore really part of the plant. We ought to learn to view the plant in an entirely new way. It's no good standing too close by; we must tackle it differently and study the plant in its environment from a distance. Normally we nd that the plant is composed of roots, stems with leaves, and flowers (we use one of the 'higher' plants as an example). To the question: how do we know that the plant has roots, the only answer is: we see them when we pull the plant out of the soil. Otherwise the plant is fastened to the earth, it is fused with the soil. From this point of view the whole earth belongs to the plant. It is preferable not to think of one plant on its own, but of the layer of plants inasmuch as it coversthe earth. Thus the earth is the round centre in which the plants 'take root', disappear. On the other side, where the flowers are, the plant also disappears in an environment with which it is linked. Where the flower appears the plant stops growing. It is as if an entirely new influence comes into play here, curbing growth and making the plant produce flowers. Here a new world begins, in which the plant as flower begins to radiate with fragrance and colour, in response to everything that comes its from the environment, especially the sun. In the flowering, plant and sun unite. Therefore, the plant has in its flower the same link with the sun as the roots have with the earth. Finally, even the middle part of the plant is not a closed, independent entity. The plant has a direct open link with that which the leaves absorb as light, air, and water, and which causes the synthesis of the chlorophyll and the formation of farina (carbohydrates). One need only remember the stomata on the leaves w h e r e t h i s d i r e c t c o n t a c t w i t h t h e environment takes place. Viewed in this way a plant in its totality is much bigger than one would suspect. Triple articulation If we let our thoughts roam once more over the realm of plants, if we conjure it up in our imagination from a great distance, we nd that the roots, round, calm, and cool, are concentrated in the centre, and that the part that is radiant, changeable, and warm, is on the periphery, whilst in the green middle area of the plant we nd a structure in which the rhythmic repetition of a specic shape, the leaf, can be recognised. Presently we will encounter something similar in the shapes of man and it is important to state right now that we are dealing here with a primeval law: where- ever a rest-seeking tendency interacts with a tendency towards movement, there appears a rhythmic principle 1011/*/ f / y ' f j / ' ' / r - :w-y, Root, leaf, flower are closely related to the human being... Drawing by a 12-ycar-old. (trembling strings of a violin, leaves rustling in the wind, ripples in the sand). In the middle part of the plant, in the area of the leaves, the atmosphere is the environment. In that sense the outward shape of the plant is indeed the boundary with its environment. It is no poetic phantasy, but a concrete fact, that the plant thus represents the link betweentwo worlds \u2014 earth and sky. The ever changing relationship of these worlds in summer and winter is directly reflectedin the realm of the plants, because the plant is a seasonal creature. In this way the plant can be rightly described as a threefold organism: root, stem-leaf area, and flower are the visible writing in which we can read this. In the human gure we can speak of the same phenomenon. The head is rounded, the elements of rest and cool ness belong to the life of head and thought. In the lower part of the body, the area of limbs and metabolism, we nd a radiating form, movement and warmth. It is not for nothing that somebody with a headache asks for a cold compress andsomebody with a stomach ache for a hot w a t e r b o t t l e . B e t w e e n t h e t w o i s t h e r h y t h m i c system, where the principle of rhytlim, of repetition, can be found in the func tions of lungs and heart and in the struc ture of the spine and ribs. Much more can be said about this threefoldness (nowadays one likes to speak of triple articulation). The main thing for us is primarily to look for the similarity between the structure of the plant and the gure of man. From the above rougla description we have seen that the shape of the plant and the human gure are the reverse of each other in their three-fold structure: what the plant has below man has above, and vice-versa. To be contimiedCooking for School Children Some Practical Suggestions b y M A RY H AY D O N Dr. Mees has more rhan thirty years' experience as a doctor in Holland: he is also well known as a lecturer in many c o u n t r i e s a r o u n d t h e w o r l d .Essential for the young child are rhythm, right feeding, right sleep and right exercise. Right feeding is very important and so difcult these days, when we are surrounded by unnatural and articial foods. I am convinced that the right food helps to enable the child to receive all that Waldorf education can offer. We live in this controversial age and too much fanaticism tends to make one into an unsocial being, but for the child's sake one must make every effort to obtain healthy food. Most crops are grown on articial fertilisers, seeds are treated with poisons, ground is sprayed with insecti cides. What is the answer? One must seek out bio-dynamically grown food or, fail ing that, at least organically grown. How to obtain it? There are now many health food stores, there may be a van service or you may be able to grow it yourself: make a compost heap, put in the prep arations, spray your ground with B.D. preparations; then you can prove to your self the difference in the taste and quality of the food grown in this way. Curative eating A w e l l - b a l a n c e d m e a l s h o u l d c o n t a i n root to nourish the head, leaf for the rhythmic system, blossom fruit or seed for the metabolic system and limbs.A harmonious atmosphere in the kitchen has a benecial effect on the food, and the result should also be artistic \u2014 pleasing to the eye as well as to the palate. In school hostel life one meets prej udices in children against foods which they really should take; with patience and careful serving, aided by the enthu siasm of the others, one can usually over come such difculties. One parent, grateful for this, even suggested sending her husband for a curative eating course! Recommended Now to deal with the various types of food that I could recommend: C e r e a l s \u2014 1 0 0 % w h o l e m e a l i s b e s t f o r good home-baked bread. Four grains have a benecially stimulating effect on the organism \u2014 wheat, oats, rye, barley. Muesli, a mixture of cereal flakes with dried fruits, nuts, brown sugar and milk, makes a good meal to start the day.Rice \u2014 the natural, unpolished kind makes good savoury dishes, with meat sauce made with tomatoes or onions, green peppers, etc. Spaghetti or macaroni \u2014 wholemeal \u2014 is good with a savoury sauce and grated cheese. Lentils, buckwheat, millet flakes or 12 13semolina are good for soups. Brown beans are good boiled and served with tomato sauce. Fats - Butter, cream and vegetable oil are the best fats to use. Meat fat is not good as it is absorbed straight into the bloodstream. Margarine should be avoid ed if possible - this has been proved undesirable (ref. Dr. Hauschka on Nutrition*). Sweeteners - unrened sugar - light or dark pieces - molasses - cane syrup or honey are recommended. Milk - should be unpasteurised, if obtainable; it can be turned into a good cream cheese by adding a spoonful of the previous cheese and standing it in a warm place overnight. The more quickly it sets, the less acid it will taste. This is d e l i c i o u s w i t h a l i t t l e c i n n a m o n a n d brown sugar and a little cream, which can be skimmed off before setting. This can also be hung through a muslin and the resulting drier cream cheese served with savoury salt and fresh herbs, such as chives, lovage, garlic, etc., or it can be served sweet with fruit and sugar. Fruits \u2014 All fresh fruits are good and popular, eaten fresh or bottled or made into jams or juices. All dried fruits are very good. Blackberry, elderberry, blackcurrant and many others make excellent juice: cover with cold water, bring slowly to the boil, strain, re-boil with sugar and pour into hot jars, screw lids tightly. Good served with a dash of fresh lemon juice. Eggs \u2014 Free range \u2014 not too often for children, no more than twice a week. Nuts \u2014 All kinds are very good food value. Salt \u2014 Pure sea salt is best, not the packeted kinds such as Cerebos. Vegetables need to be cooked for as short a time as possible and served in an appetising way for children. Cabbage \u2014 shred finely, cook in a small amount of water with a little oil, salt and a few carraway seeds to aid digestion. *Nutrition by R. Hauschka, published by Watkins; out of print. 14cabbage in the sauce. Spinach \u2014 cook in very little water, a squeeze of garlic improves the flavour; can be beaten with a little butter and flour and seasoning. Red cabbage - add a little apple and f r i e d o n i o n , v e r y l i t t l e l i q u i d . Carrots are always popular. Serve raw or cooked in strips or dice and add a little butter and chopped parsley, or serve in a parsley sauce. Swedes or turnips - mash well with butter and season. Parsnips \u2014 good roasted in fat in the oven. Beetroot \u2014 serve hot, grated, seasoned and with a little fried onion; or cold, sliced thinly, with oil, salt, sugar and a dash of cider vinegar; a little garlic or some chopped chives or spring onions improve the flavour. Kohlrabi \u2014 dice, saute in butter with a little chopped onion, season, add a little water, cook till soft. Marrow - not always popular, so needs to be served with something else. Cut into rings, bake in oven in a little butter and ll with minced beef or savoury rice and tomato, or lentils, or perhaps millet with grated cheese. Serve with a brown gravy or white sauce around it and it will look very appetising. Potatoes are better served mashed, fried, roasted or in jackets baked in the oven. Celery or celeriac can be served raw or cooked with a sauce or nely chopped in soups.Leeks \u2014 cut into short lengths to avoid 'strings' and serve with a sauce or chop into a soup. Mixed vegetables make a good meal, if put in layers, seasoned, with small knobs of butter and a little water added, topped with grated cheese and baked slowly in the oven. All vegetables for soups should be diced or cut small and sauted, then thickenedwith flour, millet, semolina, lentils, s p a g h e t t i r i n g s , e t c . R a w f o o d s a r e stimulating to the organism but a strain on the digestive system.JhiAntc Class Twelve pupils enjoy drawing from observation. Herb drawings by an ei^ teen-year-old. One can thicken the liquid and serve the Herbs \u2014 These are used to enhance the flavour but must not dominate. Parsley, sage, thyme and marjoram are the usual herbs. Lovage is good for soups and salads. Rosemary - tuck into a roast joint.Bayleaf \u2014 use in stewed meat or sauces. Sweet basil \u2014 add to soups and salads. Melissa \u2014 use in fruit drinks or salads. Mint with vegetables \u2014 peppermint with drinks. Fennel seeds in sauces, green for salads. Dill in potato soup. Carraway in bread and cakes. Chives in salads. Paprika is very useful, sprinkled on cheese dishes it gives a nice colour and improves the flavour. It can also be added to cream cheese to give variety. Quality In conclusion I should like to emphasise that quality is just as important as quantity. Do not be misled by advertisements \u2014 attractively packeted foods may be time-savers, but they contain many additives. The presentation of the meal is most important \u2014 food arranged on a plate can be anon-descript jumble or an artistic arrangement of the many coloured vegetables. Children's tastes change as they grow up, but it is good if their palates can be trained so that they are able to discrim inate and enjoy good food. The atmosphere during the meal should be one of gratitude and appreciation for the good things nature has provided; grace before the meal is the basis for such a m o o d .

Ilhistration from a Class Eight chemistry main lessonWe are caretakers of our children, we b e a r t h e m i n t o t h e w o r l d w i t h l o v e a n d j o y, a n d g l a d l y t a k e o n t h e t a s k o f parenthood to guard and guide them as new citizens of the earth, from birth until the age of about eighteen, helping them to unfold their individual potentials. We recognise them as free human spirits - not ours, but only in our caring. We protect them from premature differen tiation and hardening, allowing theirtrue being to enter in accordance with the laws of cosmic wisdom, this same wisdom which orders and regulates the passage of our earth from the beginning of time to our present existence, and on into the future. We can study and come to know these l a w s o f w i s d o m , k n o w t h e m i n o u r thoughts, can acquire an ever renewed feeling for them and, with our selfless will and enthusiasm, can nd and apply them in the very details of our everydayexistence in caring for our children. Miracle A child is a being of body, soul and spirit; this is the very basis from which we, as parents and teachers, must work, together with a constant feeling of r e v e r e n c e a n d w o n d e r f o r t h e m i r a c l e that is a child, the perfection that is within a child, with awareness that, given help to overcome his lower nature, this perfection can be reached for. A child takes twenty-one years to reach maturity; this is a preparation for the time when he will become a respons ible and moral human being. How can we as parents, help this process? We can help through giving him the right educa tion and a right diet. In the nding of a right diet for the child, who stems from the spirit, the needs of the soul and spirit must be given prime consideration; the body is but an instrument for their indwelling. W i t h t h e c h o i c e o f c e r t a i n f o o d s w e can affect the speed of development or, conversely, the speed of the incarnatingprocess, which is all important to our aim. Activity-to-overcome Only food of the highest quality, prefer ably Biodynamic, should be given; one is actually dealing with formative forces in food much more than with substance. Biodynamic food has within it the strong est forces inherent in the plants through the growing methods used. These forces need to be met in the digestive process by the inner individual forces of the child, in order to transform the food substance into his own substance; this 'activity-to- overcome' creates will and inner strength. Milk should be fresh and unpasteurised and, if possible, from cows on a Bio dynamic or Organic farm. The quality of the milk is directly related to the way in w h i c h t h e c o w s i t a v e b e e n f e d a n d t h e liglit and life forces which may or may not ensue. Grains should be whole and unprocessed and milled as near as possible to baking (preferably 2 hours) and should be varied among the seven grains: oats, wheat, rye,barley, maize, millet and rice, thus giving nourishment to all seven organs of the body. The four grains of our western clime; oats, wheat, rye and barley can be harnessed to balance one-sidedness in the temperaments by using the grain relating to the opposite temperament. Wheat relates in its qualities to the melancholic temperament; oats to thecholeric, rye to the phlegmatic, and barley to the sanguine. OATS ( Choleric)BARLEY -O/^WHEAT ( S a n g u i n e ) M e l a n c h o l i c ) RYE (Phlegmatic)Drawing by an eighteen-year-old Vegetables Biodynamic practice in the use or preparations and sowing, cultivation, pruning, transplanting and harvesting on the specic days which cosinically relate to the various vegetables, whether they be of root, leaf, flower or fruit and seed nature, all make for plants rich in life forces, far more so than when simply organically grown. Exuberant and lush vegetables can result from excessive compost or dung application, not n e c e s s a r i l y e n s u r i n g a p l a n t o f t h e higliest quality. All chemically grown vegetables should be avoided, even thougli this could mean a less varied choice andgreater expense, and yet at the same time it will be an encouragement to use Just those vegetables which are in season and to avoid those which have been tinned o r f r o z e n . Eggs should be from Range hens, which have been fed with unsprayed grains, but these should be given sparingly and not at all to children during their rst seven years. Eggs being of a substance specic ally for reproduction are very condensed and very indigestible and should always have air incorporated with them through beating or whisking before being cooked. Drawing by a nine-year-old 18Oils and Fats Plant oils such as sunflower, safflower or olive should be used, prefer ably cold pressed. Oils prepared in this way are expensive but could be used very e c o n o m i c a l l y. B u t t e r s h o u l d b e u s e d rather than margerine, which is only a copy and a highly processed food con taining articial colouring and other additives. Sugar Brown, and preferably cane, can be used sparingly and, when possible, replaced by a little honey. Drinks should be only pure fruit juices, without additives - colouring, caramel, phosphoric acid, preservatives, saccharine or added vitamins; all bottle labels should be read as to contents. Otherwise milk, herb teas or water should be given. Cola type and carbonated drinks are highly undesirable. Potentialities But food of the highest quality is not sufcient; we need to bring the right foods at the right time. There is a need to give foods which help the soul and spirit to develop to their full potential - foods used as tools to build the body, which lays the basis, creates the milieu, for free growth, at the right time, of all the potentialities the individual brings with him. By learning to observe the qualities o f t h e d i f f e r e n t f o o d s w e c a n c h o o s e those which help the child in his three different stages of development: from 0-7 years; 7-14 years and 14 - 18 (21) years to help him descend gradually and soundly as a true citizen of the earth. The aim is, at all times, to protect the child from premature hardening in each phase before the work of that phase has been completed. Mother's Milk serves as a child's rst food, it is nature's most perfect food in that it is the most complete food available. Cow's Milk is a plant substance which has been worked on by the animal with out acquiring the animal nature (unlike meat). It therefore requires very littlefurther digestion; it is strong in formative forces, an important builder of the skeleton and nervous tissue, and it brings the incarnating soul and spirit of the child down to earth gently. The First Seven Years of a child's life are devoted to the exercise of his will and the building of his physical body \u2014 the re-moulding of the body inherited from his parents into one more suitable for his own needs. Food can be intro duced gradually from the world of plants starting at the upper pole of the plant with fruits and grains, which work on the metabolism and the limbs, and gradually introducing leaves from the plant's middle realm, which work on thebreathing and circulatory processes, andlastly, introducing roots, from the plant's lower pole, with their mineral elements which aid the head system and the senses. A rhythmical day With the gradual solidication of the body, consciousness awakens and care must be taken not to allow an early rigidity through too intensive a calcica tion and hardening, as this curtails the proper development of the physical body and organs. Meat, eggs, onions, vinegar and mushrooms should not be part of a child's diet at this stage, and only very little salt. Vegetables should be lightly cooked, and not too many raw vegetables should be introduced. Meals should be eaten regularly without giving 'snacks' in-between; this regularity can form the keypoint of a rhythmical day for theyoungster. Meals should be simple and vegetables clearly dened, incorporating the three parts of the plant: grain, fruit and seed; leaf; root. Hard crusts, and later whole grains and nuts can stimulate the proper chewing of food, which is necessary for good digestion. From the age of Seven to Fourteen the concentration is on the Rliythmic System of the child, the development and harmonising of the 'processes' of thebody. Each child needs an individual diet, which can be arrived at through sensitive observation, never enforcing, and meeting the individual preferences in a balanced way. In these years we canbecome aware of, and help to harmonise, one-sided traits which manifest them selves in the temperaments, as already touched upon with the grains. Food for the temperaments Choleric individuals, having a ery na ture, need watery, cooling foods as abalance: rye and rice grains; leafy vegetables and salads \u2014 to strengthen the rhythmic system; raw fruits, melons and cucumbers (watery and cooling); bitter and salty roots - to avoid congestion; celeriac; radish; horseradish; starchy foods - to channel energy into the digestion; foods for chewing; no meat or legumes. Sanguine. This light and airy nature needs to be brought down to earth with farinaceous foods to give metabolism work: wheat and rye; potatoes and mush rooms, occasional meat (earthy foods); \u2014 mineral quality; leaves \u2014 for balancing. Phlegmatic \u2014 water and moon nature \u2014 need to enliven and stimulate with sharp tasting and spicey foods - introducing a good variety: oats (ery); roots; acid fruits; wholegrain cereals; leaves balance; salads with piquant dressing; little liquid. Melancholic - earthy nature - needs to be drawn away, emphasis on sweet and warming foods, cooked to promote ease of digestion: blossoms, honey (from the upper pole of plant); barley, buckwheat and rice; cream; caramel; fruit. Mastery over matter During these years a varied and imagina tive diet should be used incorporating whole grain bread, fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese and cream, cheese andyogurt, a little sh and meat if needed and wanted, but only fresh and never frozen. Efforts should be made to over come strong dislikes by introducing very small quantities to encourage tolerance, this helps one-sided tendencies and helps the child to gain mastery over matter.In the Third Seven Year Period, 14 yearsto 18 (21), young people develop their critical and intellectual capacities, form ing the basis for individual judgement. Here we see the introduction to a grown-up diet. Large appetities abound, bringing warmth to the metabolism to c o u n t e r a c t t h e c o l d n e s s o f i n t e l l e c t u a l thought. Food of good quality should be used in lieu of 'bulk'. Alcohol is very detrimental. In order to carry the responsibility for the diets of our children and young people today, we need a devotion to the task, a reverence for the food plants and other ingredients in our creative handling, and a love for whom we prepare. It is a noble task and one of great joy; it requires work and discipline to perceive and serve the individual needs, and such is the richness of our sacrice. \\ So quickens the soul in the shrine of the heart. So blossoms spirit-power in the light of the world. So ripens man's strength in the glory of God!' Pauline Anderson, mother of ve and wife of a well-known bio-dynamic farmer, has been planning and cooking well balanced meals from her own garden and farm produce for many years. She ran a successful restaurant in S. E. England and is now offering her experience to a similar venture in Edinburgh. 20 21Nutrition Some thoughts . . . It would certainly be a privilege to be able to sense something of the unseen work ings of Nature as, with the helping hand of the gardener, she brings about the growing of root, leaf, flower and fruit of the vegetables of the garden, for here the relationship between Man and Nature is at its most overt. In the wilderness one may feel, through an appreciation of beauty and grandeur, a yearning of Nature for her fullment in tlie becoming of Man. In the goodness of the garden we may feel that this yearning nds expression in the actual substantiality of the plant. H e r e t h e d i f f e r e n t a s p e c t s o f p l a n t nature accrue substantiality in a manner rarely seen in untended Nature, in the root of the carrot, in the leaf of cabbage,in the stalk of celery, in the leaf bud of sprout, in the blossom of cauliflower, in the fruit of the bean, ... The plant becomes food for man, often losing, in the process, something of its natural balance. Yet, of course, the work of Nature and gardener stops short at the producing o f t h e r a w s u b s t a n c e s o f f o o d f o r m a n . 22Then it is the task of those in the kitchen to carry this process to completion, to fashion from these roots, leaves, fruits and seeds a meal t for man, a meal in which the different offerings of the plant are brought together into a new whole. Tliis work in the kitchen, too, need not just be an outward process any more than it is in the growing of the plant in the garden. There, behind the veil of outward visibility, elemental beings must beat creative play, mediators to the plantof the cosmic rhythms of growth, unseen participants in the rhythmic unfolding of the plant on the stage of the earth. In the kitchen these powers can also be at creative play, in the chopping of knife, in the stirring of mixtures, in the transform ing milieu of the pot. Ajid tliis play of elemental workings is in truth not apart from the thoughts and feelings of those in the kitchen and those in its surrounding environment.Drawing by an eighteen-year-old And SO to the meal itself. Each meal is something of a festival, a taking in of the substance of Nature, helping to establish the rhythm of the day in human life. Through an imaginative choosing of menus it echoes, too, the planetary rhythm of the week and, by being based on the seasonal produce of the garden, afrms the greater rhythm of the year.If, at the mealtime, we turn our thoughts back in appreciation to theplant in such words as this Celtic grace; Blessings on the root Blessings on the leaf Blessings on the flower Blessings on the fruit... then perhaps it is not entirely our own fancy when we seem to hear an answer whispering back through the ether ... Blessings on the Man that is to be. H.R. Hugh Ratcliffe ran the kitchen at Michael Hall School for several years.

Substances such as soothing amica, gentle witch hazel, antiseptic calendula and, of course, the beautiful, essential oils, which not only produce awonderful perfume but have their own healing properties, have been understood a n d u s e d f r o m t i m e i m m e m o r i a l a s t r u e aids to our body's intricate balance and function. By isolating the active principles from their natural origins and creating them synthetically in a laboratory, scientists can indeed provide in a most powerful form medicines that formerly came directly from plant life. But it is the natural medicines which have the afnity with the human being, and today the public is coming to feel something is not quite right. Drug induced illnesses are on the increase, and with the knowledge and fear of these has come an upsurge of interest in that much-abused term 'natural' treatments. Disease: imbalance We at Weleda (the name was a title given to a senior Druid Priestess, who was responsible for healing) have, in nearly 50 years' experience, come to provide safe natural medicines for everyday use. We believe that if the natural balance ofBSb is upset, then imbalance \u2014 or disease \u2014 inevitably result. Just as a whole h^^n being consists of a body, soul and spirit, so we believe in using the e l e m e n t s o f n a t u r e a s a w h o l e i n o r d e r to maintain this balance. These principles - t h e b a s i s o f R u d o l f S t e i n e r ' s ' A n t h r o posophical Medicine' - are those on which Weleda was founded in 1923, and to which we still uncompromisingly adhere. In keeping with this idea of the human working as a whole, we see no rigid dividing line between medical and cosmetic treatments. So, although we began making unique medicines, early in the company's history a range of toilet ries was developed at the request of doctors, and the two could thus work in conjunction. We believe that we have developed a gentle, subtle and positive approach which is in tune with the very nature of the human being. The pharmaceutical side of Weleda has evolved a stock of over 3,000 different medications in various permutations of substance, form and strength. All come directly from raw plant and mineral materials, treated so that the essential curative quality is released in the mosteffective way. They are being requested and prescribed increasingly by GPs aswell as those doctors with a special interest in 'alternative' medicine, and are supplied to hospitals, chnics and homes. A number of standard mixtures and remedies have evolved from these for easy home use. Skin: a true mirror Our toiletries reflect and enhance this process. They are made with the knowl edge constantly in mind that the skin is a vital organ of the body, and a true mirror of our inner state of health; thus it must have a harmonious relationship with whatever comes into contact with it.Our toiletries comprise ranges of products for oral hygiene, skincare, hair care and bath and body care - the latter including Weleda's new, entirely natural, spray deodorant. All toiletries are aimed to wards helping the skin maintain a healthy balance. This means using such ingre dients as oils of orange, lavender and rosemary; sunflower oil, olive oil, chlorophyl; extracts of arnica flowers, birch leaves and blackthorn; seaweed, l e m o n s , h o n e y a n d m a n y m o r e . N o mineral oils are used, as they are not absorbed by the skin but simply lie on its surface. Preservative qualities come quite naturally from the essential oils used. Massage Balm is a typical Weleda product and it illustrates the integrity of Weleda's claim to make naturi products. Massage Balm is made by steeping Birch leaves (for their 'tonic' effect) and Arnica flowers (for their therapeutic effect in relieving muscular stiffness and aches) in Sunflower oil for several days, then gently heating for 24 hours to extract the virtues of the herbs. These are then pressed and essential oils of Rosemary and Lavender added for their stimulating effect on the blood circulation of the skin. No preservatives or colourings, in fact, nothing else is added, and the result is a pleasing after- bath oil, a comforting rub for muscularstiffness and aches. This careful process ing and purposeful use of natural sub stances is typical of all Weleda prepara tions. Our factory in Derbyshire retains the feeling of being a 'cottage industry' amongst its staff of 40, which includes two pharmacists and four dispensers, even though we apply sophisticated manufacturing, testing and control tech niques. But modem manufacturing pro cesses go hand in hand with the cultiva tion of herbs in our own garden, the personal gathering of plants from the wild, and careful harvesting at the right time. Many of our products need a two to three months' processing time while the essential elements absorb and amal gamate. Weleda companies are now in 21 countries, and our product formulae differ slightly in each according to indigenous plants available, which will accord with the particular environment and those living in it. W e l e d a m e d i c i n e s a n d o i n t m e n t s a r e invariably used at Waldorf schools all over the world. Our products are widely available in health shops, and due to our special efforts to famiharise retailers with our principles, it is our hope that they w i l l b e s o l d w i t h a w a r e n e s s a n d u n d e r standing. We believe we provide truly ethical products of the highest standard, which work towards the harmony and health of the individual. Weleda products are not tested on animals. Visits by groups of interested people are welcomed so that they may see for themselves that we do what we say we do. Martin Vyner is a former Waldorf parent, and is now Managing Director of Weleda (UK) in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. 30 31iA Healthy Partnership A mother describes her medicinal discoveries by BRENDA HAMMOND It is now more than twelve years since ]-ny eldest children entered the nursery class of a Steiner school and that we as a family began to experience the healtiiy and hannonising effect of this method of education. Soon after this came our introduction to the Wala and Weleda range of natural remedies, (also based on indications given by Rudolf Steiner), which I have found to be of immense benet and value. These two impulses, going hand in hand as it were, have stood us in good stead in the bringing up ofour family. In fact I often wonder how other mothers ever manage without the help of these home remedies, and so Ithought I would like to share a few ofmy experiences with you and tell you about some of the preparations which I nd most useful. Try something else To t u r n o n e ' s b a c k o n c o n v e n t i o n a l medicine is not an easy thing. It needs a certain amount of desperation on one hand, and a certain amount of faith and encouragement on the other! In our case, the desperation was provided by our younger daughter, who was inclined to be chesty. At the end of one autumn, when she was three years old, she became ill with flu and bronchitis and we called opposite: Marigolds, waiercolour hy parent Marije Rowling.the doctor. He suggested we put her onto an antibiotic in order to clear every thing up quickly before the start of the winter. I agreed, although 1 was against the frequent use of antibiotics. An hour later, a bottle of bright pink, foul- smelling, syrupy liquid arrived from the chemist. To actually administer the dose was a traumatic experience because the poor child hated it, and had to be held down while the medicine was poured down her throat. After three days the bottle was nished, my nerves were in shreds, and my daughter wasn't better. 'What now?' I thought, 'Another course of even stronger antibiotics?' I decided that we couldn't continue in this way. The nursery school teacher, who knew our situation, suggested we try the Wala remedy for bronchitis. Faith and encouragement to try a n o t h e r f o r m o f t r e a t m e n t c a m e i n t h e fortuitous forms of my neighbour and my husband's cousin. My neighbour had had good results using homeopathic remedies, and my husband's cousin, soon to qualify as a paediatrician, thought it would be a good idea to try something else, and promised to keep an eye on matters for us. And so we went ahead. The rst thing I discovered was that there was no fuss 33about administering the dose. The drops in a little water were accepted without a murmur and this has been my experience with all the pillules and powders as well. W h a t a r e l i e f f o r M u m ! T h i s f a c t a l o n e was almost enough to persuade me I had made the right decision. After a couple of days of careful nursing, the broncliitiswas gone aiid we then used the convales cent remedy twice a day for six weeks. My daugliter is now fourteen and has been free of bronchial trouble since that day. Healing power After this experience 1 asked advice from the nursery teacher more often, and the next marvellous thing I learned about was Calendula Ointment. This is a salve which Weleda make from marigolds. It is used on cuts and grazes and promotes very rapid, clean healing. I rst used it on our old spaniel dog! She had cut one of the pads on her front paw and we were afraid it would fester. Calendula Ointment is harmless and non-poisonous so it didn't matter if she went on licking her paw as dogs do when they are injured. It was very quickly quite better. Since then I have used Calendula Ointment contin ually and have complete condence in its healing power. Cuts, scratches and grazes quickly form scabs and soon dis appear without a trace. These days I seem to use Arnica Ointment more than anything else. This is because my exuberant four year old son is the type of child who is always getting bumped and bruised. When ngers are shut in the door or drawer, c r i c k e t b a l l s c o l l e c t e d o n t h e h e a d , stairs are fallen down, shins are bruised, a little Arnica quickly applied eases the pain and prevents a large bump and a bruise. Arnica Ointment is made from a fleshy yellow flower which is found growing wild, liigh up in the Alps. It has long been known for its help in treating bruises and any injuries where the skin is not broken.Marigold flower; Drawing by eighteen-year-old. Shock A l m o s t a s u s e f u l a r e A r n i c a D 6 t a b l e t s . These are for shock and internal bruising s o w e o f t e n t a k e o n e o r t w o b e f o r e a visit to the dentist! They alleviate the effects of injections and help particularly if a tooth has to be pulled out. A few weeks ago my small son broke his collar bone. When we realised more or less what the trouble was, we gave liim an Arnica pill and in about ten minutes the pain had obviously eased quite consider ably and he could move his arm quite a bit. At the hospital he had it strapped, and we were told to bring him back in a couple of days. We continued to give him Arnica three times a day and when we returned to the hospital the Sister was quite astonished. 'Which one's the sore shoulder' she asked. I told her the left, then she said 'Usually there is a huge b l a c k a n d b l u e m a r k a l l a r o u n d t h e collar-bone area.' Thank goodness for Arnica. There are so many remedies in our medicine shelf that I nd it hard to decide which are the most important to write about. Perhaps those which I keep both upstairs and downstairs in the h o u s e c o u l d b e c h o s e n a s t h e m o s t essential to keep handy.Combudoron Ointment is one of these. It is made from a special annual type of nettle. Combudoron, like Arnica, seems to be most effective when applied as soon as possible after injury. It is used forminor burns, and I nd I use it on myself quite often when 1 am cooking on our Aga. A little Combudoron applied imme diately to a burn means I can forget about it, but if 1 don't bother, it can go on bothering me for days. We also use this ointment for insect bites and other mild, itchy rashes, and for the relief of sunburn, althougli perhaps the Combu doron Lotion is better for this. For stage fright Lastly there is Melissa Comp. This is really a multi-purpose remedy which can be used for faintness, dizziness, tummy cramps and period pains as well as for stage-fright and travel-sickness! I like tohave a small bottle in my handbag when ever we travel anywhere. Ten or twelve drops in a little water works amazingly quickly and effectively. It can also be used externally on the pulse points torelieve neuralgia and headache pains. From a mother's point of view, the great benets of these remedies are their speed and efciency and the fact that they are not dangerous to have around the house. Of course, medicines shouldnot be left lying around, but if some pills are eaten by mistake there can be no hannful effects. And there are no dis agreeable side-effects either. So they can be used with condence in the home. They are effective and safe, and that's what any mother would wish for, isn't it? Brenda Hammond is the mother of three children attending Waldorf school in South Africa. Letter to the Editor Alberta, Canada. October 29th, 1980 Dear Mr. Bittleston, I am writing with regards to the article ' Tw o D o n s o f A l b e r t a m a k e Wa l d o r f History' published in the Summer/ Michaelmas 1980 edition of 'Child andMan'. I would like to update some of the information and correct the information that is in error. The Waldorf Program in Edmonton now has 130 students. There are two Kindergarten classes, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and a Class One, Two, Tliree and Four as of Septem ber 1980. Tliree of our teachers have studied Waldorf Education at either Emerson College in England or Mercy College in Detroit. The otlier two teachers have been studying Waldorf Education during the previous school year and over the summer. We are pleased with the growth of the program and are certain that it will continue to grow. The information that I would like to correct is regarding Don Vinge, whose surname is Vinge not Vinche. His position is not the Deputy Minister of Education, but the Assistant Superintendent in Charge of Curriculum in the Edmonton Public School Board. In the future we will be sending you articles informing you of our progress. Thank you for publishing an article about our school. Yours truly, Marcia Johnston Class II Teacher and Spokesperson for the Edmonton Waldorf Program. 34 35Art, Nature and the Personal Relationship A Look at Reality in Curative Education by SIEGFRIED RUDEL In this second part of the article written by Joan Rudel in a previous issue of Child & Man the attempt will be made to outline some of the essential ingredients, a s i t w e r e , o f a n a n t h r o p o s o p h i c a l approach to the education of maladjusted children. There are two things which must be said from the outset: one is that it is impossible in one single article to give an adequate and comprehensive picture of what an education inspired by Rudolf Steiner's ideas can do in helping disturbed children; it will be more a question oftouching on a number of aspects and elaborating more fully just one or two of them. The other point is that my personal experience of the twenty-six years that Peredur has now been at work is bound to play a certain part in what follows. It might be as well, therefore, if \u2014 before considering general principles \u2014 a brief historical account of Peredur is given. P r o b l e m c h i l d r e n Peredur Home School started in 1951. This was also the year in which theAssociation of Workers for MaladjustedChildren was founded, an inter-disciplin- ary association of the growing number of different professions and institutions which had come to be concerned with thewelfare of emotionally disturbed child ren. That event had been preceded by a good deal of discussion during which the need for such an association had become evident, a fact which has become even more obvious as the years have gone on. Similarly, within the educational move ment which is based on Rudolf Steiner's work, discussions had been held about maladjustment as a growing problem, particularly at a special Conference held at Easter 1948. Tliis had been called jointly for teachers at Waldorf Schools, which provide education for normally developing children from nursery school age to university entrance, as well as t e a c h e r s a n d c h i l d c a r e s t a f f f r o m t h e Homes for handicapped children. A third type of child was fest developing, it was said, too disturbed and disturbing to be c a r r i e d i n t h e c l a s s e s o f t h e W a l d o r f Schools and too 'normal' and intelligent to be rightly placed in a Home for the handicapped. A new type of setting would have to be created for them, at least for a time until they would perhaps become able once again to join their peers in ordinary schools; places which would need to provide what by one of the conference participants was called 'soul- convalescence'. With this in mind, we \u2014 group of four people - started Peredurjn 1951, at East Grinstead in Sussex, four miles from Michael Hall School, the rst and largest of Britain's twelve Waldorf Schools. They combed through their classes and we admitted some of their problem children to Peredur, along with others, of course, sent to us by the LEAs, Child Guidance Clinics and privately. Although we had not intended to grow beyond twenty children, this number was reached before the end of the rst year and exceeded by far ever since. Farm and craft Life may perhaps be looked upon as an admixture of individual plan and impulse on the one hand, and the needs of the vvoild to which one has to adjust one'sactions, on the other; serious imbalancein the one direction or the other does, infact, make for maladjustment! Althoughnumbers have grown, the school classesare small (never more than twelve), andso are the living units: three children'shouses with no more than eighteen ineach and resident staff. (Teachers andchild care staff are not strictly divided.) Since 1968 there are also two hostelsfor adolescents, and several training work shops. Peredur Farm and Craft Centre was in fact made into a separate non prot making company which is, like the School, registered as a charity. In 1954, much at the instigation of one of the older boys, we had started farming in a modest way and bought some of the neighbouring elds to enable wheat to be grown, too, so that a mill and bakery could be set up and supplied. In 1968, the adjoining farm \u2014 of medieval foundation \u2014 came up for sale, so that now a mixed farm of 230 acres provides wholemeal bread and milk and enables us to manufacture yoghurt and cheese, both for Peredur and outside sales. Thebreeding flock of Dorset Down and Jacob sheep supplies the wool for the dyeing and weaving workshop. Many of the children take a keen interest in helpingand some of the young people between sixteen and twenty years of age train on the farm. The latest project is a new place in Cornwall for over-twenty-year-olds who have gained some measure of indepen dence but still need a social anchorage. Into both the Hostel-Workshop scheme at East Grinstead and into the Cornish working community for young adults, we admit both those who have been at Peredur before, as well as newcomersfrom other Special Schools or Hospitals. Let it be said at the conclusion of this brief, more historical, description that our aim at all three levels is to draft children and young people back into ordinary life whenever this becomes possible. Hidden gifts What has just been said may give rise to an important question; what do we educate for? And even more specically; what do we aim at in educating maladjust ed children? There are two major altern atives: do we try to t the child, or the young person, into modem society? Or do we strive to bring it about, as Carlyle put it, that each should become all that he was created capable of being? In other words, are we to be guided by what the national needs at any given time may be, e.g. at present a greater number of sci entists and technicians; or do we study the nature of the growing child itself and w o r k i n a c c o r d a n c e w i t h t h a t s o t h a t what is often still hidden in the very young in the way of individual gifts and possibilities may be able to survive the onslaughts of an aggressive environment in the earliest years and then be allowed to develop actively during the school phase and adolescence? Rudolf Steiner Education comes down heavily on the side of the latter and the book Education towards Freedom gives a full exposition of this second alternative, both in general theory and by giving examples of practical method. 36 37Knowledge as experience What is the element then which builds a bridge between the happy kingdom of the little child at play and the daunting prospect \u2014 nay more \u2014 the daunting reality of work in adult life? For there is no doubt that in the lives of a great many people today work has become an oppress i v e b u r d e n . T h e e l e m e n t t h a t h a s o f t e n been lacking in the early years of these people is that of Art. Art as an all-pervad ing element must enter again in education and, generally speaking, into making a life for children. But it is not just a ques tion of a few art lessons interspersed in an otherwise mechanical and purely intell ectual process of information-gathering.Knowledge itself must - through the creative personality of the teacher \u2014 become an experience for the child. The teacher himself has to have absorbed the subject-matter sufciently so as to be able to reproduce it out of himself. That makes him into an artist. If such a con cept is taken seriously, then a number of things will drop away from the educa tional practice as not only irrelevant but as positively disruptive. One is the distur bance through constant changes in the child's school-life: quick succession in the timetable of short periods on diff erent and unrelated subjects; short-term changes of teachers; and frequent re grouping of class units on the basis of test results. Another irrelevance is the use of machines to 'aid' the learning process. Particularly where maladjusted children are concerned, the building-up of a working relationship between pcop/eis a therapeutic process, and this applies to the classroom situation as well as to the more casual domestic province. Also, the actual practice of Art must become part-and-parcel of children's lives again. It pervades all the lessons in Rudolf Steiner Schools, particularly for children up to fourteen years of age. Only from then on is Art taken as a separate subject in the curriculum.Making, growing What has been said about the child's life at school also applies in a modied form to life out of school. Music-making in the family has practically died out as a result of radio and television. And mass- produced household goods, big and small, appear to obviate the need for makingthings yourself for daily use, let alone enjoying to do it. And as far as the user is concerned, it is obvious that craft- made objects of a good standard appeal to the artistic sense; they can be loved and cared for, even treasured - a living person has put them into your hands, as it were. Such a moral effect can hardly be over-estimated where children are concerned. It can work, too, through the experience of a whole building if this is imaginatively designed and built with materials and colours which can speak to the child. There is another important factor in helping maladjusted children and young people to nd a healthy relationship with the world around them. That is the connexion with Nature. There can be no question of 'turning the clock back' and trying to revert to primitive forms of living; this is not at all what is meant. On the contrary, future crises may be met more adequately by people who, in their early years, have had more than just a nodding acquaintance with work on the land. To work with your own two hands - digging the soil, tending the plants or looking after animals \u2014 can be a startlingly new experience for city- bred maladjusted children. The actual skill of movement which has to be learnt is something from which especially the a u ti s ti c c h i l d b e n e ts . On th e o th e r hand, to experience the effort and the time that goes into food production is a healthy experience for the delinquent child. To observe and participate in the varying moods, weathers, landscapes and human activities through the course of the changing seasons can have a harmonising effect on all children. But that is not everything. The actual growing of healthy crops and their preparation for humanconsumption is a most important process to be involved in. And two facets of it stand out particularly: one is that no farmer or gardener - except perhaps the Robinson Crusoe type of self-sufciency fanatic \u2014 will grow things only for him self, they are always grown for a wider circle of people; in other words, thereis always an altruistic element in working on the land. And that is educational and therapeutic in itself. The other facet is quality. There are many different ways of growing and preparing food and the subsequent health of the consumers verylargely depends on them. To use organic methods of husbandry, or even bio- dynamic ones \u2014 which is going one step further still \u2014 ensures that what Nature provides is helped and furthered by man's activities rather than lessened in its nutritional potential. And that again provides a constructive motivation for children and young people at varying levels of age and intelligence. pisharmonies resolved Finally, something must be said over and above a description of practical methods and details, however incomplete even that had to be. It is the general outlook on the growing child which really makes all the difference to the educational possibilities of a person who makes Rudolf Steiner's ideas of the evolution of man and the world his own. It is true that heredity plays an important role, especially in the early years, and it is equally true that environment exerts a formative influence on the growing child. But what is it or, rather, who is it, whomthese two factors are influencing? Are we really satised with what we know of the individual himself? We need a science of the human soul and spirit as exact and as valid as that which has provided suchvaluable information on the facts andphenomena of the physical world. And such a science does, in fact, exist. Our frequent dilemma in understanding the enigmas of maladjusted children points to a realm where maladjustment is not seen merely as a state of being badly adjusted to an often rather inadequate environment. Maladjustment must also be seen as a disharmony between the inner spiritual being of the child and his own physical organisation. This is why medical treatment - not drug 'therapy' - plays an important role, particularly with children under fourteen. Such treat ment is homeopathically orientated andin line with the methods developed and practised in the Hospitals and Clinics in other European countries which are based on Rudolf Steiner's work. Each human being has his own individ ual destiny in life. Maladjusted children need more help than others to nd theirs. I would like to end with a motto taken from a recently re-published group of lectures Rudolf Steiner gave on Education as an Art, and which can also be a special motto for work with maladjusted child ren. Our highest endeavour must be to develop free human beings who, of them selves, are able to give purpose and direc tion to their lives.

A thorough analysis of our relationship with time includes the role of the temperaments \u2014 'the melancholic n d s i t d i f c u l t t o w r e s t h i m s e l f f r o m the past, while the choleric can barely wait for what is coming; the sanguine person dances with time without bend ing himself to the moment, while the phlegmatic, on the other hand, hangs on to it' \u2014 and concludes with much help ful, practical advice. I liked the quotation from Christian Morgenstem: 'Patience, immense word! Whoever experiencesyou, grasps you, experiences and grasps from then on how divinity creates, how divinity matures!' This pamphlet is one in a series unfortunately named - the word Hygiene simply does not soundthe right note in English \u2014 but very warmly recommended to all parents and teachers.

D.B.life to the land Guide Lines to Bio-Dynamic Husbandry By Katherine Castelliz Lanthorn Press 1980. 72pp. \u00a33.30. ISBN 0 905155 11 8 T h e a p p e a r a n c e o f M i s s K a t h e r i n e C a s t e l l i z ' s b o o k i s a m o s t w e l c o m e addition to the literature of bio-dynamic farming and gardening. While such a short book can hardly be claimed to present a step-by-step guide,the distillation of over thirty years' experience in, and devotion to, agriculture provides many insights and practical suggestions. For the more experienced bio-dynamic worker the chapter on the preparations and the sections on seedbaths and potatoes are of particular interest. Yet even the novice to the bio-dynamic method will nd value in Miss Castelliz's even-handed approach, which suggests that each garden and farm presents a unique situation. It is from this unique ness, and not any pre-conceived idea of 'the best' method of cultivation, rotation,manuring, etc., that the gardener or farmer must discover how best to care for his land and animals. Craig Cook FAIRY WORLDS AND WORKERS A natural history of fairyland by Marjorie Spock, Brush Drawings by Ingrid Gibb. St. George Publications, Spring Valley, NY. 10977. \u00a33.30 At rst glance one might perhaps thinkthis beautifully produced book slightly 'fey' or self-indulgently romantic, but such apprehensions are despatched by a moment's reading as effectively as morning mists by June sun. Marjorie Spock's prose sparkles with clarity: thisis written in a scientic spirit, gentlysuffused by the poetry of a creativeartist: 'We have been staring so hard atthe material world, intent on decipheringits composition, that we have lamed our p o w e r o f v i s i o n f o r t h e s o u l b e h i n d i t . ' Her exposition of the four elemental realms rings true throughout, and concludes with a remarkable range ofpractical advice To feel life: that is the key to acquaintance with the Little People ...' or 'to attune oneself to motion as expressive gesture ...'. A very calm, balanced introductory guide to 'the nearest realm beyond the sense world'. Bittleston NUTRITION/HEALTH/ ANTHROPOLOGY Class 7/8 (ages 13/14) 85p (+ postage 15p). Published by and available from Roy Wilkinson, Forester's Cottage, Highgate, FOREST ROW, Sussex, U.K. The author of 'these notes' has brought much together that was previously under different covers. He states that 'the purpose of education is twofold ... to give ... an understanding of the world; ... to develop ... faculties.' Should h a n d b o o k s o n e d u c a t i o n d o t h e s a m e ? The teaching matter is compactly presented, almost as many useful facts per page as in a diagram. But in addition t o w h a t , t h e Wa l d o r f t e a c h e r n e e d s guidance with when. More than once this is confused in this leaflet. And the how? Recognised by the author certainly: '. . . not the purpose to give information only . . but in such a way that life forces are stimulated.' A statement to make one's pedagogical mouth water. Yet little that one could call a meal follows, and the would-be healthy educator is left to get his nutri tion elsewhere.
