Luxury assisted living For those seeking upscale assisted living, Atlanta has a wealth of options to choose from. Many of these boutique communities come in high-rise packages with incomparable city views and contemporary fixtures. Sitting in some of Atlanta's most-desired neighborhoods, these chic assisted living residences resemble high-end hotels, from the exterior to the grand lobbies and tastefully decorated common areas. A selection of communities have resort-style amenities, such as swimming pools, putting greens, and state-of-the-art fitness centers. Many offer refined dining options that feature chef-prepared meals and international cuisines, which can be enjoyed from lavish dining rooms or from the privacy of your home. Georgian-style assisted living Atlanta also has many quaint, homey assisted living communities. Many of these communities pay homage to traditional Georgian architecture with grand entrances, pillared columns, and brick exteriors. While still within miles of Atlanta's thriving downtown scene, these communities provide serene retreats for seniors with outdoor patios, raised garden beds, and cheerful sunrooms. Rather than high-rise buildings, these communities are surrounded by lush landscaping and foliage with nostalgic, homelike furnishings inside. Many of these communities also plan engaging leisurely activities ranging from gardening and cooking clubs to games and group outings. Life plan communities Life plan communities \u2014 also called Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) \u2014 offer a continuum of care for seniors aged 62+. This type of community offers multiple levels of care on the same campus, which can range from independent living, assisted living, and memory care to skilled nursing. These communities are growing in popularity for seniors who want to age in place without worrying about their growing costs of care. Life plan communities typically charge a large care service fee upfront that essentially guarantees you'll have access to a variety of care services within that campus if and when the need arises. This means you will never have to move due to illness, and your care fees are paid for in advance \u2014 ensuring you'll be taken care of. Assisted living with memory care Assisted living communities that offer memory care are popular in the Atlanta metro. About 59% of partnered assisted living communities within 25 miles of downtown Atlanta are designed to accommodate residents with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. These communities typically have dedicated memory care wings or neighborhoods, secured with enhanced safety features, such as Wander Guard technologies, to provide oversight for residents with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. While memory care residents receive the same level of care as assisted living residents, these neighborhoods also provide caregivers that can accommodate different levels of memory loss. Memory care units give residents the opportunity to receive person-centered care from staff members specially [trained in dementia care](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/memory-care-staff-training). Assisted living facilities that provide memory care are also required to provide therapeutic activities that promote motor skills, socializing with peers, and sensory enrichment.
