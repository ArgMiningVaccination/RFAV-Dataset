Detox Pure SPECS - Ingredients: Acai berry, spirulina, kelp, chlorella, alfalfa - Dosage: 2 capsules daily (ongoing) - Form: Capsules Detox Pure is designed as an ongoing\u2014i.e., daily\u2014maintenance product which is great because detoxing requires constant upkeep and is not as simple as a magic, one-time-use formula. It contains antioxidant-rich acai berry to support the detoxification process, plus superfoods like kelp, spirulina, and chlorella that supply important minerals, fatty acids, and natural fiber to support digestive and immune health. And because it comes in the form of small capsules, it's easy and quick to take (unlike a detox smoothie or mixture you have to make every day). Best For - Athletes looking for a daily formula for ongoing support - Those wanting natural ingredients like algae superfoods for trace minerals, fatty acids, natural fiber, and detox benefits - Users who want a quick-and-easy detox Not Best For - Those on a budget as this can be an ongoing expense - Users who have difficulty swallowing capsules KOS Organic Acai Powder SPECS - Ingredients: Organic acai juice powder - Dosage: 1 scoop (3g) - Form: Powder An \"acai berry cleanse\" is another method of detoxifying the system you may run into when searching for a potential cleanse. Be wary, though, as there can be unregulated or less-than-ideal ingredients as part of this type of cleanse. Acai berry, on its own, is rich in vitamins A and C, making it a powerful antioxidant that can potentially help neutralize and clear harmful free radicals in the body.( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249911/)) Further, acai berries may also be able to help you maintain healthy cognitive function as you age.( [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24985004/)) However, before reaching for an acai juice, puree, or premade berry bowl, watch out for high amounts of added sugars.

The dose is two capsules daily, but you might consider starting with one capsule to see how it affects your body before taking the full recommended dosage. Best For - Those looking for a true \"system flush\" - Users who want a stimulant-free cleanse - Athletes needing a budget-friendly detox option Not Best For - Athletes who avoid proprietary blends that may not be third-party tested - Those not prepared for excess bathroom trips [BUY: Performix SST Support chlorella - Dosage: 4 capsules, up 2x daily - Form: Capsules ONNIT Spirulina & Chlorella is exactly what it says it is; 1,000 milligrams of organic spirulina and 1,000 milligrams of chlorella for detoxification support.

Glutathione is an antioxidant found in plants, animals, fungi, and some bacteria that has been shown to help support the immune system, detoxify the liver, and protect the body from cell damage by eliminating free radicals.( [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623026639?via%3Dihub)) Utzy Naturals is quality-tested for purity, potency, and efficacy and does not contain gluten, corn, yeast, or artificial flavors.

That and these methods aren't guaranteed to work well in the long term. An everyday preventative supplement, like Transparent Labs Prebiotic Greens, allows you to bypass an uncomfortable cleanse and treat your system to a nutrient-rich, prebiotic drink instead. Prebiotics have also been shown to help improve gut health and digestion.( [7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359644603027466)) This prebiotic powder is clinically dosed, 100% natural, and features ingredients like spirulina and chlorella to help lower inflammation and flush out harmful toxins for liver support.

A detox cleanse is a method to assist the body's detoxification organs and tissues in removing toxins. By boosting liver function (our main detoxifier), improving digestion, and supplying key nutrients essential for the process, a good detox cleanse can help open the detoxification pathways, supporting the removal of toxins. A cleanse can come in many forms, including juices and [teas](https://www.active.com/nutrition/articles/best-detox-tea), restrictive or fasting diets, and supplements that contain detoxifying ingredients like prebiotics or curcumin. Disclaimer: Exercise caution when taking supplements. Always make sure to consult with your doctor before trying a new supplement or pill. Weight-loss supplements are not a substitute for a balanced diet and regular exercise. Any supplements taken should be used in accordance with a healthy lifestyle. Any weight loss of more than a pound per week over a long period of time is unusual and should be monitored by a doctor. FAQs About Detox Cleanses How long does it take to fully cleanse your body? There is no magic number for a detox length. The amount of time it takes to detox depends on the number of toxins stored in your body and how well your body's detox pathways are functioning. Remember\u2014there is no such thing as a one- or two-day complete cleanse. Toxins accumulate over the years so it takes time to remove them safely. How often should you detox your body? Detox frequency is individually based on your diet and lifestyle. Rather than following strict guidelines, listen to your body and look for signals that it needs help, such as unnatural fatigue, frequent colds or illness, or new or worsening skin conditions. The best way to reduce your need to cleanse is by avoiding as many toxins as possible through better food choices, body products, home cleaning products, and other sources of possible toxin exposure. What foods should I avoid while detoxing? It is imperative to eat clean while detoxing. Above all, that means no processed foods. Instead, choose whole foods and organic, wild, or pasture-raised whenever possible. Be sure to include a full dose of healthy fats (think avocados, seeds, nuts, fatty fish like salmon, and olive oil) daily because fats are necessary for detoxing. It's also important to try to maintain healthy eating [post-detox](https://www.active.com/nutrition/articles/breaking-the-cleanse-what-to-do-after-you-detox) if you want to maintain a toxin-free body. Can I have coffee while detoxing? Coffee is a diuretic, meaning it pulls water out of the body. Unfortunately, this is exactly the opposite of what you want during a cleanse. So skip that cup of morning joe and spring for herbal tea which supports your detoxing goals while also giving you a nice caffeine-like boost.
