You are placed on a flat elevated massage table with a cutout for your face. The massage therapist will begin with long, firm brush-like strokes along your back and eventually over your shoulders, armss, then down to the lower back and legs. Massage therapists often use the flat palm or heel of their hand or fingertips to deliver pressure to tight areas to help loosen and lengthen muscles. Swedish massage is designed to enhance circulation and blood flow to larger muscle groups and can provide overall relaxation. The strokes of the massage relax individual muscles, while the overall experience eliminates mental stress and tension.

Therapists can target specific areas of pain such as a stiffened shoulder or used to manage chronic pain conditions such as arthritis.

The essential oils are extracted from the parts of herbs and plants and contain all the properties of the plants themselves. In choosing the oils for an aromatherapy massage, the therapist generally creates a synergistic blend of oils which are then added to a carrier oil/lotion. Once the oils are blended together the massage can begin that should be gentle, but firm. The oil is applied in long sweeping strokes which warm the skin and muscles and prepare the body for deeper pressure. During an aromatherapy massage, the skin is warmed and the blood drawn to the surface, increasing circulation and encouraging the elimaination of toxins from the body, which has the consequence of speeding up recovery time from illness or injury. The manipulation of the muscles continues the process, and at the same time releasing tense knotted muscles by dispersing the build up of lactic acid which often occurs after exercise.

The stones used are typically river rocks or other very smooth-surfaced stones. The heat from the stones helps your muscles to relax, allowing the massage therapist to manipulate your deep tissues more effectively. Overly tense muscles can hinder the massage procedure, so if your muscles are extremely tight or stiff, the heated stones may provide the extra relaxation you need for the massage to be beneficial in releasing tension and easing sore muscles. As the heat from the stones penetrates into your deeper body tissues, your blood vessels open, resulting in improved circulation. Poor circulation can lead to fatigue, which tenses the muscles, and a buildup of fluid and lactic acid in the muscles. Increased circulation delivers more oxygen to the muscles, which can help ease aches and pains.
