A naturopath teaches you how to use diet, exercise, lifestyle changes, pure water, clean air and cutting-edge natural therapies to achieve total body health. By finding and removing the barriers to this self-healing\u2014such as poor diet, unhealthy habits or other root causes\u2014naturopathic practitioners can nurture this process. A naturopath also addresses the whole person and understands that physical, mental, emotional, genetic, and environmental makeup can affect our health. Naturopaths have gained a great advantage with the recent availability of advanced technology and testing that helps them more closely determine nutritional needs, potential food allergies, and detoxification problems based upon an individual's genetics. While people who are new to the natural health approach may be skeptical, Tree of Life clients usually leave our naturopathic consultations amazed by the depth of our understanding and are thrilled to have a clear direction to help improve their health and well-being naturally.
