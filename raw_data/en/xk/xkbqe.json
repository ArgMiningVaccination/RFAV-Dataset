I decided to share a newsletter here on the blog that I sent out when I began our Chiropractic Adjustment + Reiki offering. What is Reiki? Reiki is pronounced \"ray\" as in ray of light, and \"key\" as in a key to unlock a door. We can even break the word into its syllables to learn about what Reiki is, and how it works. Rei can be defined as spirit, soul, universal intelligence or universal life force. Ki (or Qui or Chi) can be defined as energy, our own life force energy, or our innate intelligence. Reiki is a gift of love. It is an ancient Japanese healing art that works to connect our own life force energy with universal life force energy. It is a form of mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual healing that works through the balance of our seven main Chakra, or energy centers, in our bodies. Chakra translates to \"disc of light.\" These discs of energetic light are our direct connection to the universe. For more about the chakras, [click here.](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-91/The-7-Chakras-for-Beginners.html) Benefits of Reiki and Chiropractic Reiki allows us to address underactive, overactive, blocked, or stored energy in our systems and reduces stress. It allows us to feel balanced and grounded and in turn it creates an environment for the amazing potential of the human body to heal itself. (Sounds a lot like how adjustments remove interference from the nervous system, right?!) When our bodies are out of balance, we experience dis-ease in our body systems. When we receive chiropractic adjustments accompanied with reiki, we enhance this process. We become less stressed and more balanced, we have a greater sense of clarity, less anxiety, and our bodies can work from a place of ease. This encourages healing on all levels. The art of reiki and chiropractic care are linear and complement one another perfectly, creating the perfect environment for healing. (They are the two best friends that anyone could have!) Each works to bring your body and it's energetic systems back into balance in order for you to live at your optimal potential. Please let me know if you have any other questions about Reiki, I look forward to sharing this gift with you. As always, thank you so very much for being a part of our Chiropractic Community, Bacon, Heather and I are so "}
