Contact: CCKM@uwhealth.org Last Revised: 02/2023 Effective 2 Population/Problem: Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) is isolated from pooled human plasma and was originally developed as prophylaxis against infections for individuals with primary immunodeficiency disorders.1,2 IVIG is used to prevent and treat a growing number of indications. The expanded use of IVIG is supported by varying quality of evidence. Numerous published guidelines highlight the uses associated with this agent. UW Health monitors the use of IVIG because of its association with both adverse events and high cost. Consensus care guidelines tailored to UW Health serve to optimize use of this resource. The current revision is a regularly scheduled review of available evidence to keep this guideline timely. Definitions: 1. ABW: Actual Body Weight 2. Acute Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: Acute bleeding with platelet count < 20,000/mm3 3. GVHD: Graft Versus Host Disease 4. IBW: Ideal Body Weight 5.

All patients must have a current documented weight and height prior to ordering IVIG. (UW Health GRADE Very low quality evidence; strong recommendation) 2. Adult doses should be based on ideal body weight (IBW) unless dosing to a specific and measurable IgG level3,4 (UW Health GRADE Low quality evidence; strong recommendation) 2.1. If actual body weight (ABW) is less than IBW, dose according to ABW. 3. Pediatric doses should be based on ABW.5,6 (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) 4. Doses should be titrated to patient response. Aim for the minimum dose required to maintain optimal clinical response defined by the disease-specific monitoring parameters presented in the Appendix.5,6 (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) 5. Doses should not exceed a maximum of 2 g/kg or 140 grams per day. (UW Health GRADE Very low quality evidence; strong recommendation) 6. IVIG should be used according to the specified criteria for each indication listed in the Appendix. (UW Health GRADE quality of evidence varies; strength of recommendation varies) 7. IVIG may limit the effectiveness of live attenuated virus vaccines, including the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines. These vaccines should be administered 2 weeks prior to IVIG administration or delayed until 8 months after replacement of IVIG or 11 months following Kawasaki Disease treatment. (UW Health GRADE Moderate quality evidence; strong recommendation) 7.1. The following live vaccines are not affected by IVIG administration: influenza, oral typhoid, yellow fever, and rotavirus vaccines. Documentation 8. Documentation should clearly state the medical necessity for initiation and continued use of IVIG. (UW Health GRADE Very low quality evidence; strong recommendation) 9. Documentation should include: 9.1. History and physical 9.2. Test results, including written interpretation 9.3. Prior treatment therapies 9.4. When used for an appropriate indication, there should be evidence of a significant deficiency in IgG blood levels prior to initiation of treatment and impaired ability to make specific antibodies 9.5. History of severe and recurrent infections when appropriate 9.6. Treatment goals/expected response from IVIG initiation and subsequent treatment. 9.6.1. For immune deficiency disorders, the prescriber should provide an IgG target goal. 9.7. Evidence that IVIG therapy is effective when writing orders for continued therapy. Administration Filters 10. Gammagard Liquid\u00ae product requires no filtration. Gammagard S/D\u00ae low IgA requires filtration with a 15 micron filter. (UW Health GRADE Moderate quality evidence; strong recommendation) Premedications 11. Not all patients require premedication for successful administration, and it may be reasonable to consider foregoing it. However, premedication increases the tolerability of IVIG for many patients.7 Effective options are presented in the table below. They should be administered 30 minutes prior to the initiation the IVIG infusion.

The fluid status of the patient should be evaluated prior to administration. Overdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity.8 (UW Health GRADE Moderate quality evidence; strong recommendation) 12.1. Patients at risk of complications of fluid overload and hyperviscosity include elderly patients and those with cardiac or renal impairment. 12.2. Strategies to lower risk of fluid overload are to use a low sodium product. The IVIG products available on UW Health formulary are and Gammagard S/D\u00ae low IgA sodium). 12.3. Strategies to lower risk of hyperviscosity: 12.3.1. Do not exceed the recommended dose 12.3.2. Large doses may need to be infused over several days 12.3.3. Ensure adequate hydration 12.3.4. Infuse at the slowest practical rate 12.3.5. Use a low osmolar product (e.g., Gammagard\u00ae Liquid) 12.3.6. Encourage patients to limit immobility in the days immediately following the infusion. 13. Common adverse reactions (with frequency) include: 13.1. Headache: 30.6% 13.2. transfusion-related acute meningitis syndrome, and acute renal failure. 14.1. Certain patient populations may be predisposed to renal dysfunction when receiving IVIG products that contain sucrose. No UW Health formulary IVIG products contain sucrose.

Contact CCKM@uwhealth.org for previous versions 5 14.1.1. Patients over 65 years old 14.1.2. Patients with diabetes mellitus 14.1.3. Patients with renal impairment prior to treatment with IVIG 15. Infusion related reactions that occur with IVIG are typically due to an infusion rate that is too fast for patient tolerability. Infusion reactions are more common in patients receiving their first IVIG infusions or when changing to a different IVIG product. If there is an infusion reaction, stop or slow the rate of infusion and treat as presented in Table 2 below.7,9 (UW Health GRADE Moderate quality evidence; strong recommendation) 15.1. Restart the infusion at a slower rate once the reaction subsides.3,4 Decrease the infusion rate by one half the rate at which the reaction occurred. (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) 15.2. The rate can be titrated to a faster rate again as the patient tolerates.3,4 (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) 15.3. If the patient has a history of infusion reactions, the prescriber should indicate in the order Admin Instructions the maximum infusion rate desired (gram/hr). (UW Health GRADE Very low quality evidence; strong recommendation) 15.4. Consider switching to a different IVIG product in patients unable to tolerate a particular product9 (UW Health GRADE Low quality evidence; weak/conditional recommendation) 15.5. Consider checking for anti-IgA antibodies in patients with infusion reactions and consider product change to low IgA product (Gammagard S/D)10,11 (UW Health GRADE Low quality evidence; weak/conditional recommendation) Table 2. Treatment of Adverse Reactions Therapeutic Class Population Adults Pediatrics Antihistamine Diphenhydramine 25 - 50 mg intravenous once Diphenhydramine 0.5 - 1 mg/kg IV; maximum = 50 mg once Corticosteroid Dexamethasone 4 mg IV once Dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg IV once; maximum 4 mg Hydrocortisone sodium succinate 1 mg/kg IV once; maximum 100 mg Monitoring 16. All patients should be continually monitored for adverse effects related to the administration of IVIG and the infusion rate. (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) 16.1. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis, blood hyperviscosity, hemolysis, hemolytic anemia, and acute lung injury. (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) 17. The following vital signs can be monitored to assess the safety of the infusion: blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature. They can be measured before, during, and/or after the infusion OR if the patient experiences new or worsening symptoms of an infusion reaction. (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) 18. Periodic monitoring of renal function is recommended in patients that are judged to be at risk of acute renal failure. (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) Infusion Rates 19. Patient tolerability is always the first consideration for infusion rate. (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) 20. IVIG infusion rate calculations should use the patient's order weight (the same weight used to calculate the total IVIG dose) (UW Health GRADE Very low quality evidence; conditional recommendation) 20.1. For most adult patients, this will be IBW. If ABW is less than IBW, use ABW 20.2. For most pediatric patients, this will be ABW 20.3. If a patient has previously tolerated IVIG rates based on a different weight type, the use of a weight other than the order weight may be specified in the Admin Instructions of the IVIG order Copyright \u00a9 2023 University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics Authority.

Generally, infusion rates should be slower for the first two infusions or when IVIG products are changed. The infusion rate for the first two administrations is presented for adults and pediatric patients below in Table 3. If patients tolerate the initial infusions, an incrementally faster rate can be used for subsequent infusions.7 For all infusions, a gradual titration approach to the maximal infusion rate is recommended. (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) 22. Consider a slower infusion rate (e.g., maximum rate 2 mL/kg/hour) in patients with underlying renal disease or who are at risk for developing thrombotic events, including individuals with a history of thrombosis and those with cardiovascular risk factors. To decrease these risks, the patient should be optimally hydrated. A product with a lower osmolality should be considered.3,4 (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) 23. An infusion time longer than the maximum calculated infusion duration (8-12 hours) may be considered for inpatients to decrease the risk of adverse reactions. A prolonged infusion time in excess of the maximum calculated infusion duration may be considered when: 23.1. A dedicated line will be available for the full duration of the infusion and the administration of other medications will not be delayed 23.2. The patient's discharge time is not anticipated within 24 hours and will not be postponed to complete infusion. (UW Health GRADE Very low quality evidence; conditional recommendation) 24. Patients being treated for Kawasaki Disease or Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) receive a high dose of IVIG at a slower rate due to high oncotic/volume load. The minimum infusion time for these patients should not be less than 10 hours.127 (UW Health GRADE Moderate quality evidence; strong recommendation) Table 3.

The calculator will recommend how to program the IV pump. Pediatric IVIG Calculator Pediatric - Kawasaki or MIS-C Immune Globulin Administered by Subcutaneous Route 25. Administration by the subcutaneous route may be considered in patients who are treated for immunodeficiencies, including clinically significant hypogammaglobulinemia secondary to protein losses or chylous effusions. Subcutaneous administration is less likely to result in adverse effects and may achieve more sustained IgG levels. Traditional immune globulin products labeled for subcutaneous administration and available on the UW Health formulary include Gammagard Liquid\u00ae. HyQvia\u00ae, indicated for hyaluronidase facilitated subcutaneous administration in patients aged 12 years and older, is also available on the UW Health formulary on a restricted basis. The goal is to ultimately transition patients to self-administration (or administration by caregiver) in the home. However HyQvia\u00ae is approved for outpatient administration during the initial dose ramp-up in patients na\u00efve to immune globulin or those transitioning from intravenous administration. (UW Health GRADE High quality evidence; strong recommendation) 26. Subcutaneous immune globulins are often more concentrated (e.g., 20%) than product used for IVIG. Independent insurance screening is necessary for subcutaneous immune globulin products and administration. Previous insurance coverage of intravenous administration may not extend to subcutaneous administration, even when using the same product.

Expert opinion and clinical experience were also considered during discussions of the evidence. Methods Used to Formulate the Recommendations: The workgroup members agreed to adopt recommendations developed by external organizations and/or arrived at a consensus through discussion of the literature and expert experience. All recommendations endorsed or developed by the guideline workgroup were reviewed and approved by other stakeholders or committees (as appropriate). Methods Used to Assess the Quality of the Evidence/Strength of the Recommendations: Internally developed recommendations, or those adopted from external sources without an assigned evidence grade, were evaluated by the guideline workgroup using an algorithm adapted from the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. GRADE Methodology adapted by UW Health GRADE Ranking of Evidence High We are confident that the effect in the study reflects the actual effect. Moderate We are quite confident that the effect in the study is close to the true effect, but it is also possible it is substantially different. Low The true effect may differ significantly from the estimate. Very Low The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimated effect. GRADE Ratings for Recommendations for or Against Practice Strong (S) Generally, should be performed (i.e., the net benefit of the treatment is clear, patient values and circumstances are unlikely to affect the decision.) Conditional (C) May be reasonable to perform (i.e., may be conditional upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented.)
