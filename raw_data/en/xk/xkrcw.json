The Ancient Greeks, Romans and Egyptians all used crystals ceremoniously. In China, crystals have been used in acupuncture sessions for more than 5,000 years. In Japan, crystal spheres known as the \"heart of the dragon\" were used for scrying. Vedic texts from India refer to the origin and healing powers of various gemstones.1 Crystals are believed to heal physical, spiritual and emotional imbalances. There are references to crystal use documented in every world religion. Crystal therapy is commonly used today as a form of complementary / alternative medicine.1 In recent years, crystal therapy has been gaining momentum in the U.S. among acupuncturists, massage therapists, Reiki practitioners and other integrative health care professionals. Crystals are believed have the ability to shift and alter other frequencies that occupy the same space.2 Each crystal vibrates at a specific frequency that is used to balance the physical, emotional, spiritual or astral bodies (collectively referred to as the electromagnetic field surrounding one's body). These bodies are referred to in detail in esoteric acupuncture styles. When a crystal is placed in one's electromagnetic field, it simply creates a larger electromagnetic field that interacts with our own. Information from the crystal is transmitted into the nervous system and brain. Biochemical shifts are then created as a healing frequency that balances the body.3 In Japanese acupuncture styles, a touching needle or teishin can be used to stimulate acupoints.4 During a treatment, a crystal point may be used as a teishin. Crystal points may be used for entire treatments, such as pediatric non-insertive treatments; or as an adjunctive therapy to a traditional treatment. Certain types of crystals and crystal shapes may be beneficial for different uses. For example, smoky quartz is dispersive, fluorite is cooling, and selenite moves qi very quickly. Due to its iron content, hematite can be used to magnetically regulate blood flow and ease pain.5 Clear quartz may be used for any purpose, as it depends on the focused intention of the practitioner. Stones such as black tourmaline are useful at points such as KD 1 to center and ground patients. I have found that using crystals during acupuncture treatments is especially helpful with pediatric and needle-sensitive patients. When in doubt, have several crystals available for your patients and let them choose which one they would like to be used. The subconscious mind is a powerful tool and will automatically select the crystal with the appropriate vibration for the treatment. Remember to trust, have an open mind, and center yourself with the intention of achieving the greatest good for you and your patient. Happy healing! References - Ishaque S, et al.
