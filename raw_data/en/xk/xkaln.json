Dr. Julie George, ND Hi! I'm passionate at helping patients that are not receiving results from traditional medicine. I want you to know there are more solutions than your prescription drugs. I want to empower you with knowledge, testing, and natural treatments to make positive changes in your health. Does that sound like what you are looking for? Growing up in an area surrounded by chemical companies and farming, I became aware of the health implications at an early age. Natural Medicine was not emphasized in Texas, however my mom took me to a [naturopath](/naturopathicmedicinespokane). I didn't know what to expect since it was so different than my other doctors. My initial exposure peaked my interest for a new lifestyle. During medical school, I lost my brother to a brain tumor which created a fixation on studying [environmental medicine](/naturopath-treatments-spokane-valley). I focus my continuing education in the field of environmental medicine. Our environmental exposures play a role in autism, autoimmune diseases, cancer and chronic conditions. Prevention is key to staying healthy, sadly we often need more intervention than the basics (eating well, exercise, sleep, and water). My desire is to empower you with information so that you can make choices for your own health! Favorites The Inland Northwest has proven to be one of my favorite areas to go camping and kayaking with my family. The beautiful landscaping in Spokane yards is spectacular. I am always amazed by Manito Parks gardens and I can't believe it is free. Sandpoint is my favorite small town that feels so Americana with the best 4th of July celebration ever. I'm a foodie and I love Texas Fajitas. Did you know you really can't get them outside of TX? They are not the same at all. BBQ is another top contender on my list. I always took Texas BBQ for granted until I went to medical school in Arizona. I am like a big kid and I love going to Schlitterbahn in the summer and tubing the river. Big Bend has a special place in my heart and I love making late fall or winter trips out west. Education Dr. Julie George is a graduate of Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe, AZ.
