CSU Vaccination Requirement On July 27, 2021, [the California State University (CSU) system announced](https://www2.calstate.edu/csu-system/news/Pages/California-State-University-to-Implement-COVID-19-Vaccination-Requirement-for-Fall-2021-Term.aspx) that the COVID-19 vaccine will be required for students, faculty, and staff, including auxiliary employees in order to access campus this fall. As outlined by the CSU, this requirement is not contingent on the full U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, and therefore removes some of the earlier uncertainty regarding the policy's effective date. This is an update to the CSU's April 22 announcement. Additional information and guidance was shared in an all-campus message and can be [found here](https://pages.sdsu.edu/index.php/email/emailWebview?mkt_tok=MTI1LUJNUC0yMDMAAAF-iEa-BZfUoeH3OJ8KLk-lVTDjcZUsEhuGtZX6FiT-6vUM3n8K6iVh26dcvPT2TV01VbEFtRP4KilCCf0-jSq-OflN1aFScm5-2csOQ7ZrOQ&md_id=21283). COVID-19 Vaccination Program Faculty, staff and students have choices when getting vaccinated, and are encouraged to reach out to the following to secure an appointment: - Sign up for an appointment with one of the no-appointment [County of San Diego vaccination sites](https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/2019-nCoV/vaccines.html), where vaccines are available each day without an appointment, or the [Imperial County vaccination sites](https://www.icphd.org/). - Contact your primary care physician or other healthcare provider. - Vaccines are also available by appointment at clinics, pharmacies and certain stores, such as [Ralphs](https://www.ralphs.com/rx/covid-eligibility), [Albertsons/Vons/Pavilions](https://www.mhealthappointments.com/covidappt), [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine?mkt_tok=MTI1LUJNUC0yMDMAAAF86BXU7hjiNUeTU2wSxNGe_I46_7ntG1hNhTes8K1XT2qHgaSyZ1TapqkLNk-SSv-m2ve6at2mApbzlb8iGbHeW0S4Oqc4VSk8tfPBXXQIMQ), [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/findcare/vaccination/covid-19?mkt_tok=MTI1LUJNUC0yMDMAAAF86BXU7h96bsWhkchXnJCeTovnkCDRo0FFEbTgcIwNqXSiyik0-7rDM970VLleTUqa4RCM5hT11L-K9xinz1nSolVwN_jN0RKpAzd35UACdQ), and [Rite Aid](https://www.riteaid.com/covid-19?mkt_tok=MTI1LUJNUC0yMDMAAAF86BXU7u225rta2atYEf-2pZH5ojPGbotBrZVkAfaVkG0wmVjkLUL4Imay8_N3kdIjw947ElsdKCi5NHZlT77j-3UPGs2Xt7vL6yP86k-2Wg). - Use [VaccineFinder](https://vaccinefinder.org/search/)to locate a COVID vaccine near you. About the Current Vaccines, Why Get Vaccinated Safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 can help reduce the chances of contracting the disease. Current vaccines can help reduce the number of people infected and reduce the number of people who must seek medical attention. The vaccines may also reduce the long-term effects of COVID-19. This is what we know: - Currently, the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna mRNA and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are the only three COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States. These vaccines, which are being administered nationally and in other parts of the world, are proven to be 95 percent effective. - The vaccines now on the market and available nationwide are safe and have been proven effective through scientific research and clinical trials - Supporting the County of San Diego's efforts in vaccinating faculty, staff and students, SDSU is following county guidance on vaccine phases, which defines the order in which the population can receive vaccines. - Importantly, medical professionals and health officials, including those within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies, determine vaccination phases. Slow the Spread of COVID-19 Not everyone will be able to access vaccines immediately. Distributing the vaccine across the nation and throughout the state of California will take time and patience. It remains important to continue to maintain the everyday practices that [help protect yourself](/student-health-services/covid-19/general-prevention), your loved ones and the university and broader communities. Continue to do the following: - Wear a facial covering when required to protect yourself and others. - Wash your hands frequently. - Monitor your symptoms and get COVID-19 tested "}
