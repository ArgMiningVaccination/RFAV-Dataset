Shingles, or herpes zoster, is an infection caused by the chicken pox virus, Varicella zoster. Adults who had [chicken pox](/articles/239450.php) as children carry the dormant virus. The virus can reactivate to cause [shingles](/articles/154912.php) in later life, but the vaccine can prevent this. However, some people have concerns about potential dangers and whether shingles vaccines are effective. One vaccine currently has [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/shingrix) [Shingrix](/articles/326241)). Previously, a different zoster virus vaccine (Zostavax) was available. However, it has been discontinued. This article provides information about the Shingrix vaccine and its possible adverse effects. A shingles vaccination can significantly reduce the risk of developing shingles and related complications, including [postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)](/articles/160253.php), a common complication that involves [long-term](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/shingles) Other complications of shingles can include: - Eye complications.

The shingles virus can spread to the internal organs, resulting in [internal shingles](/articles/321217.php). People can also develop [pneumonia](/articles/151632.php)if the virus infects the lungs. - Encephalitis. If the shingles virus infects the brain, it can cause severe, life threatening [inflammation](/articles/248423.php). [Encephalitis](/articles/168997.php), or brain inflammation, can cause memory problems, loss of some motor functions, mood changes, [epilepsy](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8947.php), and even death. Pneumonia and encephalitis are rare complications of shingles. A shingles vaccine [may cause](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=0280849d-5c78-4a9d-8941-4eab429f6bd8) the following short-term side effects: - redness, swelling, or itching near the injection site [tiredness](/articles/248002.php)or fatigue [headache](/articles/73936.php) [muscle aches and pains](/articles/322869) - gastrointestinal symptoms [fever](/articles/168266)and shivering According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html#side-effects) In rare cases, a person may experience a severe allergic reaction \u2014 or [anaphylaxis](/articles/216062.php) \u2014 after a shingles vaccination. The CDC notes that only [one or two](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html#side-effects) Signs of a severe allergic reaction [include](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6156836/) - low [blood pressure](/articles/270644.php) - dizziness or lightheadedness [hives](/articles/157260.php) - stomach pain - vomiting [anxiety](/info/anxiety/) - breathing problems or [wheezing](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321736.php) - swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or uvula, which is a part of the throat If a person suspects that they or someone nearby is experiencing anaphylaxis, they should seek emergency medical aid.
