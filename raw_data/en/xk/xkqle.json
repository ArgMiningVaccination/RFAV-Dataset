Introduction ................................ Background ................................ ................................ 19 4 1. Introduction 1. This document assesses the impact of the national plan to help solve the problem of NO 2 exceeda nces in t he UK. It has not been possible to quantify the impacts of all the local and national level measures on emissions and ambient concentrations within the national Pollution Climate Mapping (PCM) model. The i mplementation of example measures has therefore been assessed using a simplified approach based on a streamlined version of the PCM model (the SL-PCM) . 2. The SL -PCM is used to assess the level of local fleet change and/or journey frequency that would be need ed to deliver compliance in those zones that are otherwise projected to still have exceedances in 2020 . The most straightforward approach to assess the possible impact of the plans was to model access controls within those zones . 3. This modelling indicates that it is possible to deliver the level of change required to reach compliance in all zones outside London by 2020. London has a particular set of issues due to the scale of its population and the level of challenge presented by current levels of NO 2 concentrations. However air quality will improve suffic iently to achieve compliance with the Directive in London before 2025 as a result of the implementation of these plans . 4. In reality, the most effective and efficient approach will depend on the local situation and therefore local authorities are best place d to design and implement the solutions in their areas. This requires local authorities to undertake a detailed assessment of their needs and select the combination of measures to deliver the local fleet and journey change necessary to reach compliance, wh ich may or may not include access controls . Actions such as individual road improvements, other infrastructure changes and improvements to vehicle emissions performance, e.g. retrofitting, could in combination also bring forward compliance. 5. There are howe ver practical limits on how quickly all measures could be introduced, e.g. due to capacity constraints such as supply of vehicles or equipment . Given this, there is not considered to be a combination of measures able to deliver compliance earlier than mode lled in all zones outside London. 5 2. Background 6. A cleaner, healthier environment benefits people and the economy. Clean air is vital for people's health and the environment, essential for making sure our cities are welcoming places for people to live and w ork now and in the future, and to our prosperity. Our ambition is to make the UK a country with some of the very best air quality in the world. 7. Over recent decades, air quality has improved significantly thanks to concerted action at all levels . Emissions of NO x alone have fallen by 62% since 1970. Even in our busiest cities we have seen falls in harmful emissions, for example a 15% reduction in average roadside concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) since 2010, but there is more we can do. 8. In 2013 the UK did not meet NO 2 limit values as set out in the EU Ambient Air Quality Directive (EU AQD). This legislation sets health -based limit values for the concentration of air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO 2). NO 2 is associated with a range of health impacts and causes damage to the natural environment. As a result t he European Commission commenced formal infraction proceedings in February 2014. 9. Recently, e vidence on the health impact of exposure to NO 2 has strengthened significantly. It is well estab lished that exposure to high concentrations of NO 2 causes inflammation of the airways, decreased lung function and causes respiratory symptoms. However more recently evidence has been released directly linking NO 2 exposure to mortality. Applying this evide nce to the exposure levels across the UK suggests that exposure to NO 2 is increasing mortality by the equivalent of 23,500 deaths per year, within the range of 9,500 to 38,000 deaths. 10. Controls on NO 2 are primarily delivered through controls on emissions of oxides of nitrogen ( NO x). NO x is used to describe the range of compounds of oxygen and nitrogen including NO 2, nitrogen monoxide (NO), and nitrous oxide ( N2O). This has a direct impact on NO 2 concentrations from primary emissions and second round impac t as other oxides of nitrogen reacts in the atmosphere to produce NO 2.1 11. Road transport accounts for around 80% of roadside emission s of NO X. Therefore t o deliver health improvements it is necessary to control emissions from this source . As set out in t he accompanying ' Draft UK Plans to Improve Air Quality in the UK' , transport emissions can be controlled through combinations of many different measures . These actions will deliver progress towards compliance with the legal obligations for NO 2 concentratio ns. 1 Emissions of different vehicle types are in main document: in 'Average NOx source apportionment on UK road links outside Lond on exceeding an annual mean NO 2 concentration of 40\u00b5g/m3 in 2013' figure 6 12. The UK national measures will be influenced by the consultation responses. A technical report on the modelling and assessment methodology used in the preparation of the final plan will also be prepared for publication by 31 December 2015 alongside t he plans . 13. This document will be reviewed and amended to summarise the final plan and take into consideration the outcome of the consultation and of the current Spending Review. 7 3. Clean air zones (CAZs) 14. A number of authorities are considering the use of access controls to tackle air pollution and several have already implemented them . Access controls can play a role both by directly reducing the number of polluting vehicles in an area and by encouraging the uptake of alternatives. 15. However, different ap proaches in different cities can lead to conflicting signals to consumers and businesses . Therefore a framework for the implementation of new Clean Air Zones (CA Z) by local authorities in England is proposed. CAZs are zon es that can be defined in the prio rity towns and cities where a variety of complementary action needs to be taken to achieve compliance . These are likely to include access controls. 16. The CAZ framework will set a standard for vehicles to meet prior to entering any zone to ensure a consisten t appro ach by local authorities , however it will be up to the local authority to decide what vehicle types are covered. Those not meeting the standard will be subject to a charge or other restriction appropriate to the type of vehicle. 17. The location and design of CAZs model led in this document has been targeted towards those areas where further action is needed to achieve air quality limit values for NO 2. 8 4. Design of the CAZs modelled 18. Eight zones have been identified which without further action are predicted to exceed the legal maximum annual average NO 2 concentration of 40 \u00b5g/m3 in 2020 , based on the methodology outlined in section 3 . Two of these zones (Eastern and South Wales) have been excluded from this modelling due to the specif ic location of the exceedances. For South Wales, it is expected that a targeted bus improvement scheme will bring this zone into compliance by 2020. The Eastern zone exceedences fall within Greater London CAZ and the effects from this will bring th e Eastern zone into compliance in 2020. The locations of the remaining six zones and their baseline maximum concentrations are provided in table 4.1 below. Table 4.1: Prioritised locations for investigation of model Clean Air Zones Zone/Agglomeration Max concentration \u00b5g/m3 2013 2020 Greater London Urban Area 126 71 West Midlands Urban Area 70 47 West Yorkshire Urban Area 74 47 East Midlands 64 43 Nottingham Urban Area 65 42 Southampton Urban Area 68 41 19. The difference in both the expected concentrations and the sources of the emissions in these different zones mean that different action may be required. Local authorities will decide whether all or a combination of the type of vehicles in these classes should be subject to control. For consistency f our classes of CAZ are defined according to the types of v ehicles included . Type A - Buses, coaches and taxis only Type B - Buses, coaches, taxis and heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) Type C - Buses, coaches, taxis, HGVs and light goods vehicles (LGVs) Type D - Buses, coaches, taxis, HGVs, LGVs and cars 20. In applying these restrictions standards will be set based on emissions level for each vehicle type. This is to ensure that only the cleanest vehicles are encouraged to enter the area , and where the option of retrofitting exists this can be effectively utilised . Box 4.1 provides further background on emission limits and the European vehicle emission standards (Euro standards) they are linked to . CAZs are not envisaged as absolute prohibitions , but it is expected that Local Authorities will set charges at levels which will hav e a deterrent effect. 21. CAZ perimeters for inclusion in the modelling have been estimated to include the majority of road links in the area in exceedance of the 40 ug/m3 limit, especially the most persistent problems , following realistic boundaries where s uch existed and were easily identifiable from mapping. Where such boundaries would be set in practice are at the discretion of the local authority in question, and would need to be decided upon through a full feasibility stud y. 9 Box 4.1: Emissions limits and European vehicle emission standards European vehicle emission standards set limits for exhaust emissions of vehicles sold in member states. Limits are set for the following pollutants: Oxides of nitrogen (NO x), Particulate matter (PM) Total hydrocarb on (THC), Non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), Carbon monoxide (CO) Limits are specific to vehicle types (e.g. cars, HGVs, LGVs). Compliance is tested based on a standardised test cycle and all new vehicles must comply with set standards in order to be sold within the EU. Euro standards year of first implementation12 Vehicle Type Euro 1/I Euro 2/II Euro 3/III Euro 4/IV Euro 5/V Euro 6/VI Car 1992 1996 2000 2005 2009 2014 Van 1994 1998 2000 2005 2009 2014 Bus and coach 1992 1996 2000 2005 2008 2013 HGV 1992 1996 2000 2005 2008 2013 1 Arabic numerals refer to cars and vans while roman numerals correspond to heavy duty vehicles. 2 The year from which new models have to compl y with the standard; existing models generally have a grace period before their sale must stop. The table below shows the NO x emissions limits from E uro standards (from Euro 3 to Euro 6) for LGVs and cars for both petrol and diesel. There are no petrol H eavy Duty Vehicles (buses and HGVs ). NO 2 is not directly regulated; manufacturers must simply ensure overall NO x limits are met. The proportion of NO to NO 2 within this limit is not restricted. Euro standards Passenger car/ small LGV type (g NOx /km* Duty Vehicles (g NOx/kWh ) Rigid 5.0 3.5 2.0 0.4 Articulated 5.0 3.5 2.0 0.4 Buses and coaches 5.0 3.5 2.0 0.4 * Euro standards before Euro 3 /III are not presented as by 2020 they are an insignificant proportion of the fleet. Source: NAEI 10 22. The proposed emission rates that vehicles are assumed to meet withi n CAZs, and corresponding Euro standard , for each ve hicle type are set out in Table 4.2. This design aligns the incentives for vehicle users to move towards cleaner vehicles at the lowest cost irrespective of their fuel type and supports the option of retr ofit. Table 4.2: Required e mission limits and Euro standard by vehicle type Vehicle type Emission rate Equivalent Euro standard Cars (g NO x/km) 0.08 Euro 6 diesel Euro 4 petrol Light Goods Vehicles (g NO x/km) 0.105 Euro 6 diesel Euro 4 petrol Heav y Duty Vehicles (g NO x/ kWh) 0.40 Euro VI 23. Combining the requirements in Table 4.2 with the 2020 compliance gaps set out in Table 4.1 results in the following designs of Clean Air Zones in order for each area excluding London listed to comply with EU NO 2 limit values by 20202. This assumes they a re using this measure alone .

Methodology 24. The assess ment has been made in line with agreed best practice as set out in the HM Treasury Green Book Guidance .3 In particular it follows: Valuing impacts on air quality: Supplementary Green Book Guidance (2013)4 Transport analysis guidance: WebTAG (2014)5 Valuation of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for appraisal (2014)6 25. The key development in this analysis is the recent evidence on the health impacts from exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2). This assessment reflect s an interim recommendation from a working group of the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP)7. More information on this approach is provided in interim Defra appraisal guidance8. 26. This document assesses the national impacts of measures, and as a result it has not been possible to consider a number of localised impacts in our modelling. In reality, CAZs may not be the most appropriate measure in all zones - the most effective and efficient approach will depend on the local situa tion and therefore local authorities are best placed to design and implement the solutions in their areas. 27. The remainder of this section provides an overview of this methodology. Figure 5.1 provides a f lowchart of the methodology. More detail on each step is then provided. 3 advisory commi ttee of the Department of Health which advises the government on the impact of air pollution Air quality appraisal methodology Step 0: Establish baseline concentrations and areas of exceedance where CAZs are required 28. The methodology employed for modelling the baseline concentrations a cross the UK is consistent with the UK's Ambient Air Quality Directive (AQD) annual compliance assessment9. It is based on NO X emission projections from the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI)10 mapped across the UK using geographical informatio n system ( GIS) methods . The mapped emissions are then coupled with meteorology and atmospheric chemistry within the Pollution Climate Mapping (PCM) model11 to derive ambient NO 2 concentrations . The baseline emissions and concentrations are estimated for 202 0. 29. The baseline projected concentrations of NO 2 for future years are based on 2013 data updated to reflect the latest emission factors.12 The modelled NO 2 concentrations for the base year are calibrated using NO 2 measurements from Defra's compliance monitoring network, the Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN)13. As far as possible , the impacts of measures implemented and planned since Defra last submitted plans in 2011 are included in the baseline projections. 9 http://uk -air.defra.gov.uk/news?view=184 10 http://naei.defra.gov.uk/ 11 http://uk -air.defra.gov.uk/research/air -quality -modelling?view=modelling 12 This 2013 data will diffe r from data submitted to the European Commission in September 2014, and Defra will resubmit the data in due course. 13 http://uk -air.defra.gov.uk/networks/network -info?view=aurn 13 Step 1: Estimate changes in ambient concentrations 30. For modelling purposes illustrative p erimeters were drawn for each of the CAZs . In practice, these will be established via loca l authority feasibility studies . The Streamlined PCM (SL-PCM) model has been used to estimate changes in ambient concentrations of NO 2 inside each of these CAZs . More information on the SL -PCM is provided in Box 5.1. 31. The introduction of controls on certain vehicles is likely to lead to change s in behavi our of owners of these vehicles. Th ese changes in the fleet composition and use are fed into the Streamlined PCM. In this modelling, assumptions on behavioural responses have been based on evidence from similar transport schemes. However in practice t he proportion of drivers making each of these choice s will depend on the design of the measure including level of charge, the penalty fees, enforcement regime and location. 32. Users of vehicles which do not meet the specified standards will broadly have the following options : Replace existing vehicle with a vehicle which meets the standards Redeploy existing fleet Pay charg e for entering restricted zone Shift mode of transport Divert, delay or alter journey Avoid journeys 14 Details of the PCM can be found here: http://uk -air.defra.gov.uk/assets/documents/reports/cat09/1312231525_AQD_DD4_2012mapsrepv0.pdf Box 5.1: The Streamlined PCM The SL -PCM model is a tool developed for Defra by Ricardo Energy and Environment that quantifies the effect of changes i n road traffic on emissions of o xides of nitrogen (NO x) and annual mean concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) across the United Kingdom. Changes in r oad traffic composition and flow are defined by the user, in terms of vehicle type (passenger cars, all types of light goods vehicles (LGVs), urban buses, articulated and rigid heavy goods vehicles , coaches, mopeds and motorcycles), fuel type (petrol or diesel), and Euro Standard. The model takes into account the age and composition of the fleet, the size of the vehicle, the emission standards the vehicles complied with when sold new, abatement technologies used to reduce emissions, the type of fuel used and trip characteristics. It can then calculate changes in emissions for 18,346 road links in 406 local authorities of the United Kingdom and NO 2 annual mean concentrations for all of the modelled links. The Streamlined PCM models the projections for NO x emissions (tonnes of NO x) and NO 2 concentrations in 2020 based on modelling the effect of changes i n fleet composition and vehicle flow. The baseline scenario in the SL -PCM was derived from a run of the full PCM model.14 14 33. The national modelling used in this assessment makes assumptions about the first three of these reactions based on evidence from similar transport measures, however there is a key uncertainty surrounding responses which is outlined in Table 6.7. It has not been possible to reflect the other reactions without an integrated transport model at a national level but is viable for a more localised assessment. 34. Where the existing fleet is redeployed emission reductio ns experienced within the zones result in emissions increases outside the zone. This is driven by the reallocati on of less polluting vehicles within the zones and more polluting vehicles being used outside the zones. Step 2 : Concentrations converted into relevant outcomes 35. To value the impacts of changes in air quality it is necessary to convert them into outcomes which can be valued. This is done by: Converting a mbient concentration s (estimated in step 1 ) to public exposure ; Public exposure is used to calculate health outcomes based on the advice from the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants ; Health outcomes are then valued.15 36. The impacts on health of both particulate m atter (PM) and NO x can be valued . Given the focus of this plan , only the impacts of changes in exposure to NO X have been quantified and valued . This is to avoid any risk of double coun ting the benefits associated with reductions in public exposure to NO 2 and PM . 37. Evidence on the link between NO 2 and health is rapidly developing. Therefore a sensitivity assessment has been undertaken in section 6. Step 3: Fleet adjustment costs incurr ed by existing vehicle owners 38. The majority of drivers entering the zones (over 90% according to the DfT National Transport Model fleet composition projections) would not be directly impacted by the introduction of CAZs . This is because either: they do not drive in an area where a CAZ has been modelled ; the restrictions in the CAZs they enter do not cover their vehicle type; or their vehicle already meets the emission standard required . However, those drivers operating restricted vehicles will have to change their behaviour , which will impose a social cost . 39. The different responses to the introduction of a CAZ are outlined in Step 1. Of these responses, we expect the most significant impact on welfare to be associated with consumers that choose to upgrade their current vehicle . Only a limited number of reactions could be modelled. This is not a major concern as t he other reactions are expected to have a smaller impact on consumers . This is reflected in the uncertainti es in Section 6. 15 https://www.gov.uk/guidance/air -quality -economic -analysis 15 40. The fleet adjustment cost is estimated assumi ng the value a consumer deriv es from owning or purchasing a vehicle is equal to the total value they derive from that vehicle over the market price (known as consumer surplus). For example, if an individual were to value their current car at \u00a35,000 and the market value was \u00a34,500 , the consumer surplus for the individual owning that vehicle would be \u00a3500. 41. In addition there are transaction costs associated with the inconvenience of searching for and procuring a new vehicle and risk around quality when buyin g a second hand vehicle. It is assumed the implementation of any restriction on vehicle usage will be announced with sufficient time for users to adjust within their usual replacement process . Therefore , these are not quantified in the analysis. 42. The estimate of consumer surplus is quantified based on three assumptions: Owners of restricted vehicles must value them above the market price (when also considering transaction costs) otherwise they would sell them or not purchase them, even without a CAZ . The maximum value placed on a vehicle is the value of a similar vehicle one Euro band above (as newer vehicles are generally more fuel efficient and often provide greater comfort ). Owners of vehicles can value them differently , depending for example on how much they drive them . It is assume d that the levels at which the vehicles are valued is equally distributed between the maximum (i .e. price of a newer vehicle) and minimum value (i .e. market price). (This is a practical assump tion because the distribution of consumers' valuations is not readily available ). 43. It should also be noted that there will be a shift in demand from vehicles which don't meet the emissions standards to those which do . This would increase the supply of the former vehicles in the market while demand for them will be reduced , leading to a decrease in the value of such vehicles, negatively impacting other owners of vehicles which don't meet the standards . It is not possible to forecast this change in the market price and therefore this impact is not valued for all vehicles, however the loss of value for the oldest vehicles is valued as in step 4. 44. Estimating adjustment costs is challenging therefore a second approach has also been applied. This approach is set o ut in section 5 and i n practise the calculations underpinning the two approaches are very similar. 16 Step 4: Loss of asset value 45. The introduction of CAZs will trigger fleet turnover across the UK, as the owners affected upgrade to vehicles which meet th e specified standards . 46. Owners of vehicles which do not meet the necessary standards who choose to upgrade can either p urchase a second hand vehicle or a new vehicle . As total fleet in operation is not expected to change, it is assumed that a number of the oldest, most polluting vehicles will exit the market and be scrapped, as demand for such vehicles falls to zero . It is assumed the number of these vehicles will equal the number of new vehicles being purchased as total vehicle numbers in the fleet will no t change . The lost value of these scrapped vehicles incurs a cost to society.16 47. This entrance of new cars into the nationwide car market, and subsequent knock -on effects on the rest of the vehicles in the market can be demonstrated in Figure 5.2 below. Fo r example, if car A is a E uro 5 diesel, owner 1 can sell this to owner 2, who does not travel frequently into the res tricted area and owns car B, a E uro 4 diesel. Owner 2 in turn will sell on car B to owner 3, and car C (a E uro 2 diesel) will be scrapped. Figure 5 .2: Fleet turnover process 48. However, if the CAZs had not been introduced, all car s in the market would have a value greater than zero, and would have remained in the market. The introduction mean s that this value is lost, and there is hence a cost to society. 16 It is also recognised that there will be a benefit to users of these vehicle who do not use them in the restricted areas as the price falls. This additional benefit is not assessed within this annex . 17 Step 5: Infrastructure costs to authorities 49. It is at the discretion of the Local Authority whether and how they implement any CAZs . If this measure is pursued, costs of setting up and enforcement of vehicle emission standards will be in curred. Such costs could include the following: General infrastructure costs (e.g. signage) Automatic Number Plate Recognition system (e.g. ANPR camera and installation costs, running costs, IT equipment) or other technological solution ; Ongoing communica tion, enforcement and staff costs 50. TfL have provided detailed data on the uptake of vehicles which reach the specified standards, and associated costs . To estimate the costs that will be incurred within the restricted areas considered here, the costs for Lo ndon were scaled up depending on the total population and perimeter lengths of these zones to obtain the costs for each zone under assessment. Step 6: Wider impacts 51. There are also other impacts from implementing CAZs . It is not possible to assess all the possible impacts but t he two most significant wider impacts are around : Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) - As consumers will be expected to move towards cleaner vehicles, the overall GHG emissions would be expected to fall as a result of this change in the fleet composition. To assess this impact, CO 2 emissions by E uro standard for the different vehicle types are obtained from the NAEI Road Transport Emission Projections for 2020. Changes in CO 2 emissions are calculated by reference to the expected fleet change oc curring as a result of implementing CAZs . Although there may be a rebound effect if these are more efficient cars and there is a cheaper marginal mileage cost , the distance travelled is assumed not to change over this period. The total change in CO 2 emissi ons in tonnes per year is then multiplied to obtain the lifetime emissions17. This figure is valued at the cost per tonne to get the monetised impact of the change in CO 2 emissions. Fuel savings - As the measure will lead to a shift from older vehicles to n ewer, more fuel efficient vehicles, consumers are likely to experience a fall in running costs due to savings on fuel purchases . The final value for savings is based on the resource cost of fuel, which excludes duty and VAT. Average fuel efficiency is obtained based on E uro standards. The total distance travelled is assumed to remain unchanged. The annual distance travelled is divided by the fuel efficiency for each vehicle type, to arrive at the annual litres of fuel consumed. The fuel consumed is multipli ed by the average residual life remaining for each vehicle type to get the total change. This is multiplied by the projected 2020 fuel (resource) price, in order to calculate the total savings. The figures are then adjusted to 2015 price base year. 52. Neithe r the CO 2 nor fuel costs reflect the impact of changes from HGVs or buses. This is primarily a result of the different way in which this data is collected and mean s that the benefits will be under estimated . 17https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/360316/2 0141001_2014_DECC_HMT_Supplementary_Appraisal _Guidance.pdf 18 Step 7 : Impacts converted into annual net presen t value ( NPV) 53. To facilitate the comparison of different impacts as far as possible all impacts have been quantified and valued in monetary terms. Where impacts are spread over time the values have been converted to present values based on the recommended Green Book discount rate (which is 3.5% per annum ). 54. For ongoing costs and benefits, a 10 year appraisal period is used from 2020 (when the policy is assumed to be fully implemented ) and upfront costs are assumed to be incurred in 2017 (when the infrastru cture is implemented). The present value of the differences between the streams of costs and benefits is calculated to provide the NPV discounted to 2015 prices . 55. This allows the present value of the costs to be compared to the estimated benefits to calcul ate the net present value and the benefit cost ratio. In this way it is possible both to assess the public value of the measure and for this to be compared with the impact of measures in other policy areas. Step 8: Qualitative Assessment, sensitivities an d uncertainties 56. While the modelling set out above provides a detailed assessment of the main impacts of implementing CAZs, it is not possible to quantitatively reflect all the potential impacts. Therefore these gaps have been supplemented with a qualitati ve description and where possible an indication of the potential significance. 57. Throughout the modelling a range of assumptions and models have been used. As with any modelling there are a range of uncertainties around the underpinning design. 58. The three main uncertainties are around the performance of vehicle emissions standards, health impacts of NO 2, and the valuation of fleet adjustment costs. The impact of these uncertainties is presented in section 6. 59. There remain a number of other uncertainties w here such an analysis is not possible or is not proportionate to undertake quantitatively. T hese uncertainties have been provided with a brief description of the potential significance in Table 6.7 at the end of this documen t. 19 6. Results 60. The results show the impact of impl ementing CAZs in areas otherwise projected to be in exceedance in 2020 . In reality, th e most effective and efficient approach will depend on the local situation and therefore l ocal authorities are best placed to design and implement the solutions in their areas , which may or may not include CAZs. 6.1. Impact on Concentrations 61. The model described in Section 4 is run for each of the identified CAZs individually, according to zone type and vehicles restricted, to calculate the concentration of NO X in each zone, both with and without the implementation of the restrictions. 62. Table 6.1 shows the original maximum concentration of NO x and the resulting concentration once the CAZ has been introduced. Table 6 .1: Change in c oncentration in priority areas in 2020 Zone/A gglomeration Original18 max concentration g /m3 Remaining max concentration g /m3 Greater London Urban Area 71 49 West Midlands Urban Area 47 37 West Yorkshire Urban Area 47 36 East Midlands 43 37 Nottingham Urban Area 42 37 Southampton Urban Ar ea 41 36 63. The road transport emissions modelled in this document are based on the latest evidence of vehicle NO x emissions. H owever , there ha ve been issue s with the European test cycles not accurately reflecting real world performance and emissions. This has resulted in NO x emissions of diesel cars in actual driving conditions being significantly higher than the European standards would otherwise suggest, as demonstrated in Figure 6.1. 18 Also in ' Summary of 2013 exceedance of NO2 limit values and projected dates of compliance ' table in main text where projection years are presented. 20 Figure 6.1: Car Euro Standard Compared to Real World Performance Source: COPERT 4v11 (2014) 64. While emerging data indicates that the European test cycle results are becoming closer to real world performance, there is still disparity. In order to reflect the current issues in road transport emission factors for Euro 6 diesel vehicles, an alternative scenario is modelled assuming that the actual emissions are higher than currently predicted. This is b ased on recent evidence from Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) data on Euro 6 diesel passenger cars . 65. The results of t his are presented in Table 6.2. This shows that should E uro 6 emissions standards not perform as modelled, it could result in up to 22 additional zones being non -compliant in 2020. Given this, it is clear that the performance of emissions standar ds going forward will have a significant impact on the efforts to reduce NO 2 concentrations.

Impact on Society 66. In addition to the assessment of the measures on compli ance with air quality limits, an assessment of the costs and benefits to society has been undertaken, comparing improvements in air quality against the associated costs of implementation . The results of this are presented in Table 6.3. 21 Table 6.3: Estimated impacts of CAZs (\u00a3m) 67. Table 6.3 suggests that the health benefits of introducing CAZs in the zones predicted to exceed limit values in 2020 would deliver a social benefit of \u00a32.7 billion. This action would also impose a cost on the users of those vehicles of around \u00a31.2 billion. 68. The NPV range for the modelled results c an vary significantly based on the assumptions applied. This is shown in Table 6.3 which demonstrates the effect in varying assumptio ns on the cost of fleet adjustment vehicles and the health impact of NO 2. There is a range o f other factors, detailed in Table 6.7, which are not reflected in the analysis here . 6.3. Direct costs and benefits to business 69. The enforcement of higher vehicle emission standards will lead to additional costs to businesses. Primarily, the key cost to busine sses is the cost of adjusting their fleet to meet the higher emission standards. 70. Some businesses may be able to meet the higher emission requirements by redeploying their existing fleet. However , where redeployment is not an option, the biggest impact on businesses will materialise through the need for businesses to replace vehicles which do not meet the standards with those which do. 71. The specific impact on individual businesses will depend on fleet composition , in terms of the age and type of vehicles. T he overall business costs h ave been assessed, based on replacing each vehicle type as follows: Cars: Company registered cars represent 8.6% of the total car fleet. It is therefore assumed that an equal proportion of the total fleet adjustment cost will fa ll on businesses , which is around \u00a386m . This is likely to be an overestimate, as businesses tend to own newer vehicles (54% of all car first Impact Central Low High Monetised impacts of NOx reduction inside zone 1,913 765 3,061 Monetised impacts of NOx reduction outside zone 582 215 1,019 Fuel 145 145 145 Carbon 38 38 38 Total Benefits (NPV) 2,678 1,163 4,263 Cost of fleet adjustment 1,005 1,453 1,005 Infrastructure costs 24 24 24 Loss of asset cost 194 194 194 Total Cost (NPV) 1,223 1,671 1,223 Net Pr esent Value 1,455 22 registrations were made by companies in 201419). They are therefore less likely to incur costs of upgrading . Busines ses are also likely to redeploy cars, which would lower the costs , however this has not been considered here . LGVs: DfT data shows LGV ownership is closely sp lit between privately owned (52% ) and company -registered vans (47% ). However, the data also show s that the majority of privately owned vans are chiefly used for business purposes20. Given this, it is assumed that the full fleet adjustment of non - compliant LGVs falls on businesses. However, this approach may lead to a slight overestimation of the costs to businesses. HGVs: It is assumed all HGVs are owned by businesses and the full fleet adjust ment cost of this category of vehicle is therefore included in the fleet adjustment cost for businesses. 72. The cost businesses are expected to incur as a result o f the assessed measure has been calculated and is presented in Table 6.4 below. The primary source of cost is LGVs (\u00a3397m). Overall, businesses are expected to incur approximately 56% (\u00a3565m) of the total fleet adjustment cost (\u00a31bn) - the remainder of th is cost will fall on households.

Uncertainties and sensitivi ties Mortality impact of NO 2 73. Evidenc e on the health impact s associated with ambient NO 2 concentrations has strengthened significantly over the past few years. While uncertainties remain , there is now stronger evidence of effects and that NO 2 plays a causal role. To reflect the current eviden ce, the analysis has been based on recent advice from COMEAP, which has provided interim guidance to Defra on how the latest NO 2 evidence should be reflected in policy analysis21. 74. Evidence on th e health impacts is still being assessed and it is subject to a number uncertainties. Three key uncertainties are: The figure assumes that there is no overlap in mortality impacts of PM and NO 2. This is unlikely to be the case; however, as the impacts of PM are not 19 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/ uploads/attachment_data/file/421337/vls -2014.pdf 20 http://www.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/van_report_aecom _100414.pdf 21 On 24 July 2015 a COMEAP working group on NO 2 wrote to Defra recommending that a coefficient of 1.025 per 10 \u00b5g/m3 exposure to NO 2 (within the range 1.01 - 1.04) should be used to assess the link between long term exposure to NO 2 and all -cause mortality. 23 valued in this assessment, the overall health impacts are likely to be an underestimate. Any potential threshold effect for impacts of NO 2 is not considered . There is no clear evidence for a threshold of effect at the population level, so no cut -off for quantification has been applied in the calculations. Importantly, because of the uncertainty in the extent to which the association between long -term average concentrations of NO 2 and mortality is causal, there is likely to be more uncertainty in applying the coefficient to assess the health benefit of measu res that are specific for a reduction in NO 2 compared to interventions that reduce the whole mixture of air pollutants. 75. To reflect the range of the current evidence, the central coefficient (2.5%) has been compared against the range of coefficients as re commended by COMEAP (1% and 4%). Table 6.5 shows the results of this comparison. Using COMEAP's lowest coefficient of 1%, the benefits of reducing NO 2 are 60% lower than the central estimate. The maximum coefficient leads to estimated benefits that a re 65% higher than the central estimate. Table 6 .5: NO 2 Impact Sensitivities Monetised health impact of NO 2 (\u00a3m) (1%) \u00a3980 Max ( 4%) \u00a34,080 Fleet adjustment costs 76. The alternative approach attempts to assess the impact on the owner's utility of upgrading from a vehicle that doesn't meet the standard to one that does. Under this approach, it is assumed that: the maximum cost to the owner is equal to the difference in the depreciation costs associated with owning a car which mee ts the standards ; owners do not benefit from any reduction in depreciation cost. This is on the basis that there are fuel savings and comfort benefits to owning a newer car which offset the difference22; and the costs to owners upgrading to a vehicle which meets the standards is evenly distributed between the maximum and minimum values . 77. The results of this met hodology are outl ined in Table 6 .6. This approach does not estimate the positive impact on owners who operate outside the CAZs. These owners will be able to purchase vehicles which do not meet zone standards at a lower price, and sell vehicles which do for a higher price to those drivers wh o do enter such zones. 22 These benefits can't more than outweigh the difference in depreciation costs or the owner would not choose a non -compliant vehicle in the absence of the restriction. 24 Table 6.6: Consumer Fleet Adjustment Cost Valuation Sensitivity Fleet adjustment cost (\u00a3m) Overall NPV Central \u00a31,004 \u00a31,455.9 Alternative Model \u00a31,454 \u00a31,006.9 78. Table 6.7 provides a brief overview of a range of relevant other uncertainties and sensitivi ties not covered above. Table 6.7: Summary of Assumptions and Associated Uncertainties Assumptio n Associated uncertainty The analysis assumes that Local Authorities choose to undertake CAZs. In practice Local Authorities will define the most effective and efficient approach to compliance, based upon their local need. The final costs and benefits of compliance depend upon the package of measures that Local Authorities choose to take forwards. A different package of measures will result in different costs and benefits of compliance. Vehicle numbers outside London are based on Traffic master data . This tracks a sample of around 160,000 vehicles travelling around the UK and identifies th ose entering multiple CAZs. This reduces double counting of vehicles entering different CA Zs. This dataset has been combined with data from the London LEZ . The sample of vehicles is not derived statistically, and may be biased towards newer vehicles, which usually drive longer distances. There is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the actual vehicle numbers entering the cities. However, this is the best available da ta set to identify vehicle numbers. The costs have been estimated based on the loss of utility to consumers of upgrading to a newer vehicle. Given limited data on maintenance and insurance costs, changes in these factors have not been considered in the calculations. However, these factors influence consumer fleet adjustment cost , and therefore may have an impact on economic costs. Wider costs to those within zones (e.g. those incurred by businesses due to redeployment or journey cancellations or adverse impacts on consumer welfare from making fewer and shorter trips) are not quantified in the analysis. They are assumed negligible . It is not necessarily the case that the wider costs would be negligible, however given particular local conditions they have not been assessed here. Such costs will be appropriately considered by local authorities during the feasibility assessment of the local package of measures. The modelling is based on the assumption that consumers are economically rational, that their ut ility from a vehicle is based on its economic cost and that vehicle owners always prefer newer vehicles. It is also assume d that consumers on average replace their vehicles every 4 years, and the introduction of CAZs is announced 4 years before implementat ion, therefore consumers will not experience any additional transaction costs. In reality this may not be the case, as there are a number of motivations for owning particular vehicles besides economic ( i.e. preference for a certain model, or particular veh icle). This may mean costs of upgrading may be greater than it is assumed that for such vehicle owners . The assumption also ignores the potential transaction cost impacts on consumers who replace their vehicles less frequently than every four years. In the model, it is assumed that the upgrade to higher E uro standards will lead to the most polluting 25% of vehicles being scrapped. This would lead to an upgrade in the UK fleet, as these vehicles also drive outside zones as well as inside. There is potent ial that the introduction of access controls would encourage drivers of the least polluting vehicles outside the zones to sell the se to frequent zone users, given the increased demand for such vehicles . This may encourage a rise in mileage of the more poll uting vehicles outside of zones. This is accounted for as it is assumed that 75% of the emissions inside zone s are diverted out. However, estimating how driving patterns would change and the roads affected is complex and dependent on a number of factors . Given it is expected that a significant proportion of the most polluting vehicles would be removed from the road, nationally, 25 emissions are likely to fall as has been have modelled. However some road links may experience an increase in concentrations. In s uch cases, other policies such as local transport schemes would be appropriate. The CAZ perimeters have been estimated to include all areas in exceedance of the 40 ug/m3 limit, and following realistic boundaries where such existed and were easily identif iable. However, where the access restriction boundaries fall is at the discretion of the local authority in question, and should be decided upon via full feasibility studies. This has not been undertaken for the purposes of this assessment ; Local Authori ties are best placed to determine where the perimeters should lie . This may mean the perimeters change significantly, which would have an impact on infrastructure costs, and also number of vehicles, and population affected. In the model, it is assumed that of the affected diesel owners who upgrade to a vehicle in line with emissions standards, the majority purchase a compliant petrol vehicle and the rest a Euro 6 diesel vehicle . Lack of robust studies on actual behavioural responses means this assumption is based on assessment of the number of vehicles available and expert judgement on responses . There are uncertainties surrounding the assumed behavioural responses of consumers to the policy. How consumers respond will depend on the exact design of the C AZs (e.g. level of fine, enforcement regime ) and what other policies are implemented simultaneously. These behavioural responses will be appropriately considered by local authorities during the feasibility assessment of the local package of measures depend ing on the specific design of the CAZs and accompanying policies . The second hand value of vehicles is estimated based upon estimated depreciation rates. There is uncertainty around the actual depreciation rates of vehicles, which generates uncertainty o n the cost of purchasing second hand vehicles. The analysis produced here is based on a new model produced to assess the costs and benefits of Clean Air Zones. There is uncertainty around the final cost and benefit results, as the model inputs and calcul ations are quality assured and refined these estimates may change. "}
