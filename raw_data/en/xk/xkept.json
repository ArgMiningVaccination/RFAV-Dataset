Some foods may be more supportive than others, but what are the best foods to clean arteries? Clogged arteries, also known as atherosclerosis, occurs when fatty deposits build up along the artery walls. This accumulation of fatty deposits causes the arteries to narrow, which negatively impacts blood circulation to the heart and other areas of the body. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of heart disease. In Western countries, clogged arteries are responsible for [more than half of all deaths](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507799/). Before the condition becomes fatal, clogged arteries can lead to all sorts of health conditions, including erectile dysfunction (ED), high blood pressure, and poor heart health. The good news is that clogged arteries are not only preventable, there are effective ways to unclog the arteries so that you can improve your cardiovascular health. Understanding How Arteries Become Clogged There is no single cause of clogged arteries. More often than not, people have several risk factors that increase their risk of developing the condition. Some of the most common risk factors include: - High blood pressure - Obesity - Poor diet - Sedentary lifestyle - Cigarette smoking [Diabetes](https://prestigemensmedical.com/blog/The-Impacts-of-Diabetes-on-Your-Sexual-Health-as-a-Man) - Genetics/family history If you have any of these risk factors, it's important to make the necessary changes to lessen your risk of clogged arteries. Eating [a healthy diet](https://prestigemensmedical.com/blog/4-Simple-Things-You-can-do-Throughout-the-Year-to-Remain-Healthy), quitting smoking, losing weight, and moving more throughout the day can all have a profound impact on your cardiovascular health. The Link Between Clogged Arteries and Erectile Dysfunction (ED) Men who have clogged arteries not only face an increased risk of poor heart health, but are also more likely to experience erectile dysfunction. In fact, there is a strong connection between [erectile dysfunction and heart disease](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15029-heart-disease--erectile-dysfunction). There is a growing amount of evidence that shows a connection between erectile dysfunction and a clogged or multiple clogged arteries in the penile arteries. A man achieves an erection when blood travels to the penile arteries. These arteries widen and allow blood to travel and stay in the penis. But a blockage in the penile arteries can lessen or completely restrict the ability for blood to move into the penis. This can lead to partial erections or the inability to get an erection at all. Clogged arteries in the penis may be a sign of undiagnosed heart disease. When the penile arteries are clogged, there's an increased chance that there are clogged arteries in other areas of the body. Remember, blood is pumped throughout the body from the heart through the arteries. When arteries are blocked by plaque or fatty deposits, the condition can make it impossible for blood to travel to the penis. This then leads to erectile dysfunction, also known as ED. For men, ED not only ruins their confidence, it's also a telltale sign that there's a serious underlying health condition. Ignoring clogged arteries not only impacts sexual function, it also greatly increases the risk of a fatal heart attack or stroke. Unclogging the penile and other arteries in the body requires some important lifestyle changes. If you're a smoker, recognize that [ED is more likely in men who smoke](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/161/4/346/92680) and work to quit. If you're overweight or obese, focus on losing weight. If you've been diagnosed with [high blood pressure](https://prestigemensmedical.com/blog/Does-High-Blood-Pressure-Cause-ED) or diabetes, ensure that these conditions are properly managed. Most importantly, take some time to clean up your diet. Improving your eating habits by limiting processed foods can have a huge impact on your heart health. Some foods may even unclog the arteries, which can resolve your ED once and for all.
