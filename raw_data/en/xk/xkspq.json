The rulemaking will allow the Division of Child Support Enforcement (DCSE) to increase the handling fee it charges a non-custodial parent for payments processed by the Division's Child Support Payment Clearinghouse. The rulemaking will increase the handling fee from $5.00 to $8.00. This change will generate revenue that will allow the DCSE to sustain base operation expenditure levels. The last handling fee increase was in 2010 when it was increased from $2.25 to $5.00. 1. Are the rules legal, consistent with legislative intent, and within the agency's statutory authority? Yes. The Department cites to both general and specific authority for these rules. 2. Do the rules establish a new fee or contain a fee increase? The rulemaking increases the monthly payment handling fee from $5.00 to $8.00. 3. Does the preamble disclose a reference to any study relevant to the rules that the agency reviewed and either did or did not rely upon? No. The Department did not review or rely on any study in conducting this rulemaking. 4. Summary of the agency's economic impact analysis: The rulemaking will allow the DCSE to increase the handling fee it charges a non-custodial parent for payments processed by the Division's Child Support Payment Clearinghouse. The rulemaking will increase the handling fee from $5.00 to $8.00. This change will generate revenue that will allow the DCSE to sustain base operation expenditure levels. The last handling fee increase was in 2010 when it was increased from $2.25 to $5.00. Increased state-generated revenue will maximize federal matching funding available for child support services under Title IV, Part D of the Social Security Act. The Department anticipates seeing an increased State Share of Retained Earnings (SSRE) revenue of approximately $760,000 per year, which in turn will allow the Department to draw down approximately $1,500,000 of additional dollars. Stakeholders include the Department and non-custodial parents. 5. Has the agency analyzed the costs and benefits of the rulemaking and determined that the rules impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated? The Department indicates there are no other methodologies applicable that would make the fee less burdensome or less costly to stakeholders. 6. What are the economic impacts on stakeholders? The economic impact is to non-custodial parents who pay the fee, there is no expected impact to political subdivisions, small businesses or public and private employment. The increase will allow the Department to cover and maintain expenditures accrued by base operations associated with collecting the Clearinghouse fee. According to the Department, Arizona families will receive continued support in the collection and disbursement of owed monies. The Department believes this improves the well-being of children and families and reduces the costs to the taxpayer. 7. Are the final rules a substantial change, considered as a whole, from the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? No. The Notice of Final Rulemaking has no substantive changes from the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 8. Does the agency adequately address the comments on the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? The Department indicates it did not receive any comments on this rulemaking. 9. Do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? Not applicable, the rules do not require a permit. 10. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? No. The rules are not more stringent than the applicable federal law, Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. 11. Conclusion As stated above, the Department seeks to amend R6-7-103 to increase the payment handling fee for child support enforcement from $5.00 to $8.00 under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-510. This change will generate revenue that will allow the DCSE to sustain base operation expenditure levels. Council staff finds the rules as amended are clear, concise, understandable, and consistent with legislative intent. The agency accepts the usual 60-day delayed effective date for this rulemaking. Council staff recommends approval of this rulemaking. D-2 DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY (R19-1007) Title 13, Chapter 1, Article 4, Applicant Fingerprint Processing Amend: R13-1-401, R13-1-402 GOVERNOR'S REGULATORY REVIEW COUNCIL ATTORNEY MEMORANDUM - REGULAR RULEMAKING MEETING DATE: November 5, 2019 TO: Members of the Governor's Regulatory Review Council (Council) FROM: Council Staff DATE: October 1, 2019 SUBJECT: DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY (R19-1007) Title 13, Chapter 1, Article 4, Applicant Fingerprint Processing Amend: R13-1-401, R13-1-402 _____________________________________________________________________________ Summary : This rulemaking from the Department of Public Safety (Department) seeks to amend two rules in Title 13, Chapter 1, Article 4 relating to applicant fingerprint processing. Specifically, the Department seeks to amend R13-1-401 (Non-criminal Justice Fingerprint Processing Charges) and R13-1-402 (Refusal of Service) to allow for electronic payment via credit card on a new web-based portal that is under development. This rulemaking is related to Executive Order 2015-01, Internal Review of Administrative Rules; Moratorium to Promote Job Creation and Customer-Service-Oriented Agencies . Consistent with that Executive Order, the Department provided a report to the Governor's Office that detailed where electronic reporting and payment are currently not implemented and a plan to implement those services. This rulemaking is also related to the Department's Five Year Review Report (5YRR) for Title 13, which the Council approved on August 7, 2018. In that report, the Department stated that it would pursue a rulemaking waiver to amend these rules within 180 days of approval of the report. The Department received an exemption from the rulemaking moratorium to conduct this rulemaking on October 31, 2018. 1. Are the rules legal, consistent with legislative intent, and within the agency's statutory authority? Yes. The Department cites to both general and specific authority for these rules. 2. Do the rules establish a new fee or contain a fee increase? No. This rulemaking does not establish a new fee or contain a fee increase. 3. Does the preamble disclose a reference to any study relevant to the rules that the agency reviewed and either did or did not rely upon? The Department did not review or rely on any study in conducting this rulemaking. 4. Summary of the agency's economic impact analysis: This rulemaking will allow the Department to process payments electronically through an online portal. The electronic payments will improve the Department's ability to process payments faster without incoming mail delays and more quickly deliver completed fingerprint criminal history backgrounds to employers. The Department currently does business with approximately 900 government agencies and non-profits and associated employees/applicants. The Department estimates there are approximately 135,000 transactions annually. Stakeholders include the Department, employees, new hires, and volunteers in: Government agencies; Nonprofit organizations; Volunteer organizations; and Security guard companies. 5. Has the agency analyzed the costs and benefits of the rulemaking and determined that the rules impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated? The Department is unable to identify any other less costly or less intrusive methods to allow for payment. The rulemaking retains the current methods of payment for the public and adds an additional method of payment via credit card and subsequent online processing. 6. What are the economic impacts on stakeholders? The Department's fee, set in 2005, remains at $5.00 and should have minimal economic impact to customers according to the Department. The fee is the amount necessary for the Department to self-fund its operation. The fee charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for the federal fingerprint-based background check is outside the control of the Department. The Department is self-funded for this purpose and therefore cannot recover the cost of the FBI fee solely with state funds. Thus, it needs to collect a fee from the applicant. The Department believes that the rulemaking will result in a net neutral impact to political subdivisions in the state. The Department does not believe small businesses will need to hire additional people or incur additional outside expenses to comply with the amended rules. The Department believes that private persons and consumers will benefit from the new electronic payment method. 7. Are the final rules a substantial change, considered as a whole, from the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? No. The Department did not make any changes to these rules between the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and the Notice of Final Rulemaking. 8. Does the agency adequately address the comments on the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? The Department did not receive any comments in conducting this rulemaking. 9. Do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? No. These rules do not require a permit. 10. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? Not applicable. There is no corresponding federal law. However, the Department states that it only collects a fee for the federal portion of the background check. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducts the federal background check. 11. Conclusion This rulemaking seeks to make these two rules more clear, concise, understandable, and effective. It also implements a proposed course of action in the Department's previous 5YRR for these rules. Amending the rules to allow for payment by credit card will also result in better customer service for the Department's customers. The Department accepts the usual 60-day delayed effective date for these rules. Council staff recommends approval of this rulemaking. NFRM - 1 NOTICE OF FINAL RULEMAKING TITLE 13.

With electronic paymen t through an online portal, customers will no longer have to drive to a bank or business to obtain a cashier's check or money order and will no longer have to drive to a post office to mail in the payment and documents or appear at the Department in person to deliver the documents and payment. Online, electronic payment will improve the Department's ability to more qui ckly process payments without incoming mail delays and more quickly deliv er completed fingerprint crim inal history backgrounds to employers; in turn, promoting employment within Arizona. 10. A description of any changes between the pr oposed rulemaking, to include supplemental notices, and the final rulemaking: There are no changes between the pr oposed rulemaking and final rulemaking. 11.

Economic, Small Business and Consumer Impact Statement Title 13. Public Safety Chapter 1. Department of Public Safety - Criminal Identification Section Article 4. Applicant Fingerprint Processing August 7, 2019 2PREAMBLE 1. An identification of the proposed ru lemaking, including all of the following: (a) The conduct and its frequency of occurrence that the rule is designed to change. The Department currently does business with approximately 900 government agencies and nonprofits and the associated employees/applicants. That business currently results in an annual approximate of 135,000 transactions. Those transactions are currently being conducted by cashier's checks, money orders or inter-government transfers. (b) The harm resulting from the conduct th e rule is designed to change and the likelihood it will continue to occur if the rule is not changed. Those paper payment transactions are inefficient for the customer through time delays and a burden for the customer to obtain the payment type from other sources; delaying employment. Internally for the Department, processing paper checks and transfers is a slower process than processing electronic payment which is more automated. Currently, the average time to process the criminal history background check is five to seven business days but through improved electronic processing the Department believes it can improve on that time helping to promote employment in Arizona. (c) The estimated change in frequency of the targeted conduct expected from the rule change. The Department is not able to quantify the improvement, but has seen gains in efficiency in other areas of the Department that have migrated to electronic payment and processing. The Department will continue to offer to its customers the existing forms of payment, but believes the majority of customers would prefer easier and faster response times through electronic payment. 2. A brief summary of the information included in the economic, small business and consumer impact statement. The Department expects significant positive economic impact to its customers through improved efficiency. With electronic payment through an online portal, customers will no longer have to drive to a bank or business to obtain a cashier's check or money order and will no longer have to drive to a post office to mail in the payment and documents or appear at the Department in person to deliver the documents and payment. Online, electronic payment will improve the Department's ability to more quickly process payments without incoming mail delays and more quickly deliver completed fingerprint criminal history backgrounds to employers; in turn, promoting employment within Arizona. 33. If the economic, small business and consumer impact summary accompanies a proposed rule or a proposed expedited rule, the name and address of agency employees who may be contacted to submit or request additional data on the information included in the economic, small business and consumer impact statement. Name: Ana Velarde, Administrative Manager, Licensing and Regulatory Bureau Address: Arizona Department of Public Safety PO Box 6638, of the proposed rulemaking. This rulemaking is related to Executive Order 2015-01, Internal Review of Administrative Rules; Moratorium to Promote Job Creation and Customer-Service-Oriented Agencies. Pursuant to the Executive Order, the Department provided a report to the Governor's Office outlining areas where electronic reporting and payment are not implemented and provided a plan on how the Department will implement those services. Additionally, this rulemaking is related to a five-year review report, pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1056, that outlined the intended amendments and was approved by the Governor's Regulatory Review Council in 2018. In an effort to provide more efficient and modern services to the public and meet the Governor's expectations of increased online services, the rules require amendment to update payment methods and systems; specifically including an allowance for electronic payment via credit card on the new web-based portal under development. R13-1-401 amends Paragraph B(1) and (2) to provide for the currently in-use name of the state action transfer and deposit form and adds an allowance for credit cards. R13-1-401 (B)(6) is a process internal to the Department and not required in rulemaking. R13-1-402 allows for credit card transaction. 2. An identification of the persons who will be directly affected by, bear the costs of or directly benefit from the proposed rulemaking. The following entities authorized to request fi ngerprint criminal history background checks on existing employees and new hires that are not required statutorily to have a fingerprint- based clearance card: Government agencies Nonprofit organizations Volunteer organizations Security guard companies The employees, new hires and volunteers of the above listed entities. 3. A cost benefit analysis of the following: The applicant processing section is self-f unded through fingerprint processing fees. The Department expects a neutral to minimal economic impact. The Department will continue to collect the same dollar amount of fees resulting in a neutral impact. The Department believes it may see a minimal positive impact on internal costs through increased efficiency resulting in reduced delays or backlogs and reduced overtime and a minimal negative impact to fund the electronic system on a yearly basis. The Department believes its customers will see a significant positive economic impact through the adoption of electronic payment. The ability to pay electronically online allows greater flexibility and reduced costs to the customer. 5The current paper methods require the customer to drive to a bank or other establishment and pay a fee to obtain a cashier's check or money order. Then the customer must drive to the post office and incur postage fees to mail the payment or drive to the Department to deliver in person. The online payment will relieve the customer of those costs associated with operating a vehicle, time, third-party fees, and time away from work or other activities to obtain and deliver payment. a. The probable costs and benefits to the implementing agency and other agencies directly affected by the implementation and enforcement of the proposed rulemaking. The probable costs to the implementing agency shall include the number of new full-time employees necessary to implement and enforce the proposed rule. The preparer of the economic, small business and consumer impact statement shall notify the joint legislative budget committee of the number of new full-time employees necessary to implement and enforce the rule before the rule is approved by the council. The Department does not require new full-time employees to implement the rules. The applicant processing section is self-f unded through fingerprint processing fees. The Department expects a neutral to minimal economic impact. The Department will continue to collect the same dollar amount of fees resulting in a neutral impact. The Department believes it may see a minimal positive impact on internal costs through increased efficiency resulting in reduced delays or backlogs and reduced overtime and a minimal negative impact to fund the electronic system on a yearly basis. b. The probable costs and benefits to a po litical subdivision of this state directly affected by the implementation and en forcement of the proposed rulemaking. The Department believes the rulemaking will result in a net neutral impact to political subdivisions in this state. The Department is maintaining existing payment methods including inter-governmental transfers resulting in no change. The Department's addition of credit card payment is available to government agencies in the same manner as all other customers; whether an agency decides to utilize the credit card payment option is left to the agency to decide. c. The probable costs and benefits to businesses directly affected by the proposed rulemaking, including any anticipated effect on the revenues or payroll expenditure of employers who are subject to the proposed rulemaking. The Department does not anticipate businesses will need to hire new employees to comply with these rules. As noted in Item 3 above, the Department believes customers and businesses will see reduced costs in opting out of the paper payment and delivery method in favor of the lower cost and more efficient credit card payment online. The more efficient electronic payment process associated with quicker results from the Department should result in a positive economic impact to employers by the employers being able to more quickly hire new job applicants and retain existing employees. 6However, the Department is not able to quantify a dollar amount of economic savings or revenue for these entities. This option for electronic payment is in line with systems that other governmental agencies use and which businesses and the public are familiar with. 4. A general description of the probable im pact on private and public employment in businesses, agencies and political subdivision s of this state directly affected by the proposed rulemaking. The Department believes the impact depends on the method of payment the customer selects. The Department is retaining paper checks and inter-agency transfers operating on existing paper processing methods. The timeframes for paper/manual methods is not expected to change. The Department will retain the paper check methods to account for customers that may not have access to a credit card. The Department believes for reasons already noted above that customers should see improved results response times from the Department with an ability to more quickly hire applicants and retain existing employees. The Department believes the impact of credit card payment to businesses that issue checks and money orders and postal delivery to be insignificant considering the benefits to the Department's customers. 5. A statement of the probable impact of th e proposed rulemaking on small businesses. The statement shall include: a. An identification of the small busine ss subject to the proposed rulemaking. The Department identified security guard companies where some may be classified as a small business. For reasons already outlined above, the Department has already identified the positive effects of the rulemaking for businesses and expects small businesses to receive the same positive effects. The Department believes there will be no negative impact on small business. Small businesses may also include those that issue money orders. Those businesses may see a reduction in the number of money orders they issue resulting in reduced profits; however, the Department believes the impact will be minimal and the benefit of switching to modern electronic payment systems, which is the trend of many other organizations, is greater. b. The administrative and other costs re quired for compliance with the proposed rulemaking. The Department does not believe small businesses will incur the need to hire additional people nor incur additional outside expenses to comply with the rules. c. A description of the methods prescribed in section 41 -1035 that the agency may use to reduce the impact on small businesses with reasons for the agency's decision to use or not to use each method. 7 The Department believes there is no other method to reduce the impact to small business as the rule change will have no negative impact on the small business. The rulemaking offers a new electronic payment method in addition to the existing payment methods. The small business has the choice on which payment method to use. d. The probable cost and benefit to private persons and consumers who are directly affected by the proposed rulemaking. As already mentioned above, the Department believes that private persons and consumers will see a positive benefit from the new electronic payment method. No longer will persons be required to transport themselves to a third-party business to purchase a cashier's check or money order, incur the cost of mailing the payment at the post office or delivering payment in person at the Department; and, will no longer incur the loss of time (personal or time away from work) to conduct the business. The electronic payment feature will allow people with access to electronic devices with internet access and a credit card to submit payment online at their own convenience. 6. A statement of the probable effect on state revenues. The Department will not see any additional revenue from allowing credit cards. The Department will see an increased, minimal business cost to maintain and operate the electronic online portal processing system. 7. A description of any less intrusive or less costly alternative methods of achieving the purpose of the proposed rulemaking, including the monetizing of the costs and benefits for each option and providing the rationale for not using nonselected alternatives. The Department is unable to identify any other less costly or less intrusive methods to allow for payment. The rulemaking retains the current methods of payment for the public and positively amends the rules for electronic payment via credit card and subsequent online processing versus traditional paper methods. The Department's fee set in 2005 at $5 remains a minimal impact to the customer and remains unchanged. The fee is in an amount necessary for the Department to self-fund its operation. The fee charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for the federal fingerprint-based background check is outside the control of the Department. The Department, being self-funded for this operation, cannot on its own cover the cost of the FBI fee with state-monies and must collect that fee from the applicant. 8. A description of any data on which a rule is based with a detailed explanation of how the data was obtained and why the data is acceptable data. An agency advocating that any data is acceptable data has the burden of proving that the data is acceptable. For the purposes of this paragraph, \"acceptable data\" means empirical, replicable and 8testable data as evidenced in supporting documentation, statistics, reports, studies or research. The Department did not rely on any data when making its determination to accept credit card payment.

Arizona Department of Public Safety Five Year Review Report AAC 131101 to 504, Exhibits A and B 5 By statute, criminal justice and law enforcem ent agencies are required to submit criminal history information to the Department for in clusion in the central state repository. This statutory requirement imposes a substantia l economic cost on the agencies. The procedures established by rule for submitting criminal history information impose a minimal cost on the agencies.

The Department complied with the re quest, which included twenty-two (22) CDs of photographs at $35.00 per CD. The reporter complained that this was an exorbitant cost for the records request. At the time, there was no ot her media authorized by the Department to convey Public Records Reque sts (PRR). The fee schedules for public records and department records, written in to rule in Title 13, R13-1-502 and R13-1-504, were instituted in 2003. A comprehensive review of the Public Records Unit fee schedules and media types available was conducted based on this complain t. A study of the records fees, and an operational analysis of the Public Records Un it (PRU) was borne out of this review. In February of 2017, a revision to the PRU schedule of fees, the types of media allowed, and the rules governing them was proposed. T hose changes to Title 13, R13-1-502 and R13- 1-504 were implemented in 2017, and have sin ce changed the cost to $10.00 per CD, as Arizona Department of Public Safety Five Year Review Report AAC 131101 to 504, Exhibits A and B 29 well as other costs associated with different media in-line with the costs of public records from other law enforcement agencies. 10. Previous Five-Year Review Process Course of Action The Department substantially amended this rule by final rulemaking in November 2017 and updated the fee schedule and payment method s identified in the previous report and in response to the criticism in Item #7. 14. Current Five-Year Review Process Course of Action The Department has no proposed amendments.

Objective The objective of this rule is to establish th e procedure by which an individual or entity may request a copy of an offense, arrest, or incident report fro m the Department. The Department determined that the rule is effective. 3. Effectiveness of the Rule in Achieving the Objective The rule requires modification to address other types of reports besides offense, arrest and incident the Department disseminates. The website address is no longer a valid address and needs to be updated to the curr ent address as well as phone numbers on the request form. 4. Whether the Rule is Consistent with Statutes and other Rules The Department determined that the rule is cons istent with state statutes and other rules. 6. Clarity, Conciseness, Unde rstandability of the Rule The rule is clear, conc ise and understandable. 10. Previous Five-Year Review Process Course of Action The previous report indicated the rule may n eed to be amended in Paragraph E to account for privacy redactions under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4434. However after further review, unlike Rule 501(E), Rule 503(E) uses the more encompassing language of \"...based on legal considerations.\" As a result, the change is no longer recommended. The Department conducts redaction as an internal process ba sed on statutory redactions of personally- identifiable information. The public has the ability to ask the De partment a question on why a certain item was redacted. The previous report indicated the rule may need to be amended in Paragraph B for instructing criminal justice agencies on the dissemination of crim inal history record information under A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1750 and 28 C.F.R. Part 20. Upon further review, this is an educational activity and not a required element to obtain a report and no rule amendment is required. The Department will internally create procedures to provide Arizona Department of Public Safety Five Year Review Report AAC 131101 to 504, Exhibits A and B 31 educational instructions to th e requesting government agency as part of the fulfillment of the request. 14. Current Five-Year Review Process Course of Action The Department intends to pursue a rulemaki ng waiver within 180 days of the council's approval of this report.

The Depart-/0 Title 9, Chapter 10, Articles 1-11, 13-15, and ATTORNEY MEMORANDUM - EXPEDITED RULEMAKING MEETING DATE: November 5, 2019 TO: Members of the Governor's Regulatory Review Council (Council) FROM: Council Staff DATE: October 1, 2019 SUBJECT: DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES (R19-1104) Title 9, Chapter 10, Articles 1-11, 13-15, and This expedited rulemaking from the Department of Health Services (Department) seeks to amend Title 9, Chapter 10, Articles 1-11, 13-15, and 19 to move codes and standards for construction, modification, and licensing of health care institutions, which are incorporated by reference, to a new section, R9-10-104.01. Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 36-405 requires the Department to adopt rules to establish minimum standards and requirements for the construction, modification, and licensing of health care institutions necessary to assure the public health, safety, and welfare. The Department has adopted these rules in R9-1-411 and R9-1-412. R9-1-411 establishes rules of construction and provides other information for persons using the codes and standards incorporated by reference in R9-1-412. R9-1-412 incorporates by reference physical plant health and safety codes and standards that the Department references in its different sets of healthcare institution licensing rules in 9 A.A.C. 10. The Department has updated many of the 2012 incorporations by reference to the current codes and standards from 2018. Since the codes and standards are used only in 9 A.A.C 10, the Department has also moved applicable requirements from R9-1-411 and R9-1-412 into a new section, R9-10-104.01 and updated cross-references throughout. 1. Do the rules satisfy the criteria for expedited rulemaking pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1027(A)? Yes. This rulemaking satisfies criteria for expedited rulemaking pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1027(A)(3) and (6) because it: (1) corrects typographical errors, makes address or name changes or clarifies language of a rule without changing its effect; and (2) amends or repeals rules that are outdated, redundant or otherwise no longer necessary for the operation of state government. 2. Are the rules legal, consistent with legislative intent, and within the agency's statutory authority? Yes. The Department cites to both general and specific statutory authority for these rules. 3. Do the rules establish a new fee or contain a fee increase? No. The rules do not establish a new fee or contain a fee increase. 4. Does the agency adequately address the comments on the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? The Department did not receive any comments on this rulemaking. 5. Are the final rules a substantial change, considered as a whole, from the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? No. The Department only made changes to correct typographical errors between the Notice of Proposed Expedited Rulemaking and the Notice of Final Expedited Rulemaking. 6. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? Not applicable. There is no corresponding federal law. 7. Do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? The rules that are being amended deal with the licensure of varying healthcare institutions, and therefore do require the issuance of a permit, license or agency authorization. Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037 if an agency proposes an amendment to an existing rule that requires the issuance of a regulatory permit, license or agency authorization, the agency shall use a general permit if the facilities, activities or practices in the class are substantially similar in nature. In this context, Council staff believes that the licenses issued pursuant to these rules qualify as \"general permits\" pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1011(11). Therefore, the Department is in compliance with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037. 8. Does the preamble disclose a reference to any study relevant to the rules that the agency reviewed and either did or did not rely upon? The Department did not review or rely on any study in conducting this rulemaking. 9. Conclusion The Department is conducting an expedited rulemaking pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1027(A) (3) and (6) to amend Articles 1-11, 13-15, and 19 and to create section R9-10-104.01. This rulemaking will result in rules that are more clear, concise, understandable, and effective. Council staff recommends approval of this rulemaking. NOTICE OF FINAL EXPEDITED RULEMAKING TITLE 9.

R9-1-412 incorporates by reference physical plant health and safety codes and standards that the Department references in its different sets of healthcare institution licensing rules in 9 A.A.C. 10. The Department has updated many of the incorporations by reference to the current codes and standards, from the 2012 versions to the 2018 versions. Since the codes and standards are used only in 9 A.A.C 10, the Department has also moved applicable requirements from A.A.C. R9-1-411 and R9-1-412 into a new Section being added to 9 A.A.C. 10, Article 1, and updated cross references throughout 9 A.A.C. 10 to the new Section. 7. A reference to any study relevant to the rule that the agency reviewed and proposes either to rely on or not to rely on in its evaluation of or justification for the rule, where the public may obtain or review each study, all data underlying each study, and any analysis of each study and other supporting material: The Department did not review or rely on any study for this rulemaking. 8.

Any agencies shall list other matters prescribed by statute applicalbe to the specific agency or to any specific rules or class of rules. Additionally, an agency subject to Council review under A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 41-1052 and 41-1055 shall respond to the following questions: There are no other matters prescribed by statute applicable specifically to the Department or this specific rulemaking. a. Whether the rule requires a permit, whether a general permit is used and if not, the reasons why a general permit is not used: The rule does not require a permit. b.

As explained below, this rulemaking qualifies for expedited rulemaking under A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1027(A)(7) because it implements a course of action proposed in a Five Year Review Report (5YRR). The Department received an exemption from the rulemaking moratorium to conduct this rulemaking on July 8, 2019. 1. Do the rules satisfy the criteria for expedited rulemaking pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1027(A)? Yes. expedited rulemaking under A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1027(A)(7) because it implements a course of action proposed in a 5YRR. The Council approved a 5YRR that covered these rules on April 2, 2019. In that 5YRR, the Department identified two rules, R9-10-1203 (Administration) and R9-10-1206 (Personnel) that could be amended to improve their clarity, conciseness, understandability, and effectiveness. In this expedited rulemaking, the Department seeks to clarify that \"medical social services\" are considered \"supportive services,\" clarify and update references, and add \"practical nurse\" as an approved professional who may provide respiratory care services to patients. 2. Are the rules legal, consistent with legislative intent, and within the agency's statutory authority? Yes. The Department cites to both general and specific authority for these rules. 3. Do the rules establish a new fee or contain a fee increase? No. This rulemaking does not establish a new fee or contain a fee increase. 4. Does the agency adequately address the comments on the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? Yes. The Department received one comment on this rulemaking. The commenter requested that licensed practical nurses (LPNs) be included in R9-10-1203(C)(6)(e) as personnel that may provide respiratory care services. The commenter stated that LPNs should be added because respiratory and ventilator care by LPNs is within the Arizona State Board of Nursing Scope of Services. The Department agreed and added LPNs to R9-10-1203(C)(6)(e). 5. Are the final rules a substantial change, considered as a whole, from the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? No. The Department did not make any substantial changes to the rules between the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and the Notice of Final Rulemaking. The Department notes that it made a technical correction to underline the word \"license\" in R9-10-1203(C)(6)(e). This change does not result in a rule that is \"substantially different\" from the proposed rule pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1025. 6. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? Not applicable. There is no corresponding federal law or federal regulation. 7. Do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? A home health agency is licensed as a health care institution. The Department notes that a health care institution is specific to the licensee, class, or subclass of health care institutions, facility location, and scope of services provided. Thus, a general permit is not applicable and is not used. 8. Does the preamble disclose a reference to any study relevant to the rules that the agency reviewed and either did or did not rely upon? The Department did not review or rely on a study in conducting this rulemaking. 9. Conclusion The Department is conducting this expedited rulemaking to implement a proposed course of action in its 5YRR that covered these rules.

An agency's justification and reason why a rule should be made, amended, repealed or renumbered, to include an explanation about the rulemak ing: The five -year-review report (Report) for 9 A.A.C. 10, Article 12 was approved by the Governor's Regulatory Review Council on April 2, 2019. The Report identified that the rules are mostly consistent, but c ould be more clear and understandable if the r ules clarified \"medical social services\" as a type of supportive services, clarified and updated references, and added \"practical nurse\" as an approved professional who may provide respiratory care services to patients. The Report also stated that the Ari zona Department of Health Services (Department) plans to a mend the rules as identified. The changes identified will not increase the cost of regulatory compliance, increase a fee, or reduce procedural rights of a regulated person. Amending the rules as id entified in the Report meets the criteria for expedited rulemaking and implements a course of action proposed in a five -year-review report. This rulemaking achieves the purpose prescribed in A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1027(A)(7) to implement a course of action proposed i n a five -year-review report. The Department believes a mending these rules will eliminate confusion and reduce regulatory burden. 7. A reference to any study relevant to the rule that the agency reviewed and proposes either to rely on or not to rely on in i ts evaluation of or justification for the rule, where the public may obtain or review each study, all data underlying each study, and any analysis of each study and other supporting material: The Department did not review or rely on any study for this rule making. 8. A showing of good cause why the rulemaking is necessary to promote a statewide interest if the rulemaking will diminish a previous grant of authority of a political subdivision of this state: This final expedited rulemaking does not diminish a previous grant of authority of a political subdivision of this state. 9. A summary of the economic, small business, and consumer impact: Under A.R.S. \u00a7 41 -1055(D)(2), t he Department is not required to pr ovide an economic , small business, and consumer impact statement . 10. A description of any changes between the proposed rulemaking, to include supplemental notices, and the final rulemaking: 3 No substantive change w as made to the rules between the proposed rulemaking and the final rulemaking. A m inor technical change to underline the word \"license\" was made in R9 -10- 1203(C)(6)(e). 11. An agency's summary of the public stakeholder comments made about the rulemaking and the a gency response to the comments: The Department received on e written comment. A commenter request ed that licensed practic e nurses (LPNs) be included in R9 -10-1203(C) (6)(e) that requires \" Respiratory care services [be] are provided by a respiratory therapist , respiratory therapy technician licensed according to A.R.S. Title 32, Chapter 35, or registered nurse .\" Commenter reasoned that LPNs should be added since r espiratory and ventilator care by LPN's is within the AZ State Board of Nursing scope of services . The Department agreed and amend ed the requirement in R9 -10-1203(C)(6)(e) to allow LPNs to provide respiratory care services. 12.

Additionally, an agency subject to Council review under A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 41 -1052 and 41 -1055 shall respond to the following questions: There are no other matters prescribed by statute applicable specifically to the Department o r this specific exp edited rulemaking. a.

A health care institution is specific to the licensee, class or subclass of health care institutions, facility location , and scope of services provided. A general permit is not applicable and is not used. b. Whether a federal law is applicable to the subject of the rule, whether the rule is more st ringent than federal law and if so, citation to the statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law: There are no federal rules applicable to the subject of the rule. c.

A.R.S. \u00a7 36-606 states that the Department \"shall develop and implement ... a system for reporting and preventing pesticide provoked illnesses.\" A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 36-1673 and 36-1675 require the Department to adopt rules for reporting blood test results showing significant levels of lead and other rules \"necessary and feasible to implement the purposes\" of A.R.S. Title 36, Chapter 13, Article 6. The Department has implemented these statutes in Arizona Administrative Code (A.A.C.) Title 9, Chapter 4, Articles 1 through 5. The Department has identified several issues with the current rules that cause the rules to impose an undue burden on some regulated entities and reduce their effectiveness. This rulemaking seeks to address these issues, including moving definitions used throughout Chapter 4 to Article 1; updating and clarifying definitions, cross-references, and formatting; making revisions to comply with statutory changes; and updating and clarifying reporting requirements and time-frames. 1. Are the rules legal, consistent with legislative intent, and within the agency's statutory authority? Yes. The Department cites to both general and specific authority for these rules. 2. Do the rules establish a new fee or contain a fee increase? No. This rulemaking does not establish a new fee or contain a fee increase. 3. Does the preamble disclose a reference to any study relevant to the rules that the agency reviewed and either did or did not rely upon? The Department did not review or rely on any study in conducting this rulemaking. 4. Summary of the agency's economic impact analysis: The Department believes that in general, the rulemaking reduces the burden on persons affected by the rules. The rulemaking moves definitions used throughout Chapter 4 to Article 1 to ensure consistency in definitions and make the rules more concise. The Department indicates that updating and clarifying definitions, cross-references, and formatting make the rules clearer and more understandable. They go on to state that revisions made to comply with statutory changes or to update and clarify reporting requirements and time-frames provide benefits but may also cause some persons to incur minimal to moderate additional costs. Stakeholders include: The Department The Arizona Department of Agriculture Hospitals Clinics Physicians, registered nurse practitioners, physician assistants Doctors of naturopathic medicine Dentists Poison control centers Clinical laboratories Pathology laboratories Prenatal diagnostic facilities High-risk perinatal practices Genetic testing facilities Clinics Individuals who have a pesticide illness, elevated blood lead levels, cancer, or a birth defect and their families Employers of individuals who have a pesticide illness, elevated blood levels, or cancer General public 5. Has the agency analyzed the costs and benefits of the rulemaking and determined that the rules impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated? The Department indicates that there are no less intrusive or less costly alternatives for achieving the purpose of the rule. 6. What are the economic impacts on stakeholders? The Department believes there may be minimal to moderate costs to update reporting requirements and forms for state and local governments, privately owned businesses, and consumers. Updating the rules should make them easier to understand and clarify reporting requirements. In general, the Department believes the changes may lead to improved reporting requirements and more accurate information that may provide a significant benefit to stakeholders. 7. Are the final rules a substantial change, considered as a whole, from the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? No. The Department made minor typographical corrections and removed abortion clinics from the definition of \"clinic\" found in R9-4-501(2) to avoid a statutory conflict. However, the final rules, considered as a whole, are not a substantial change from the proposed rules. 8. Does the agency adequately address the comments on the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? The Department indicates it did not receive any written comments during the public comment period. Furthermore, the Department indicates it held oral proceedings for the proposed rules on September 16, 2019, which no stakeholder/member of the public attended. 9. Do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? Not applicable. The rules do not require a permit, license, or agency authorization. 10. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? Not applicable. The Department indicates that there are no corresponding federal laws. 11. Conclusion The Department has identified several issues with the current rules that cause the rules to impose an undue burden on some regulated entities and reduce their effectiveness. In response, the Department is amending the rules in Title 9, Chapter 4, Articles 1-5 including moving definitions used throughout Chapter 4 to Article 1; updating and clarifying definitions, cross-references, and formatting; making revisions to comply with statutory changes; and updating and clarifying reporting requirements and time-frames. The Department is requesting an effective date of January 1, 2020, which is slightly earlier than the standard 60-day effective date pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1032(A) if this rulemaking were approved by the Council at the November 5, 2019 Council Meeting and the applicable certificate of approval was filed with the Secretary of State's office that same day. Specifically, the Department is requesting an earlier effective date on the basis of A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1032(A)(1) and (4) which allow a rule to be immediately effective \"to preserve the public peace, health or safety\" or \"to prove a benefit to the public and a penalty is not associated with a violation of the rule.\" The Department indicates that an effective date of January 1, 2020 would provide sufficient time for the Department and stakeholders to implement the new rules and enable the Department to begin collecting public health information about noncommunicable diseases under the new rules at the beginning of the calendar year to better ensure consistency in data that is aggregated by calendar year. Council staff finds the Department has provided sufficient justification for a slightly earlier effective date of January 1, 2020. Council staff recommend approval of this rulemaking. 1NOTICE OF FINAL RULEMAKING TITLE 9. HEALTH SERVICES CHAPTER 4. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES PREAMBLE 1.

A.R.S. \u00a7 36-606 states that the Department \"shall develop and implement ... a system for reporting and preventing 3pesticide provoked illnesses.\" A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 36-1673 and 36-1675 require the Department to adopt rules for reporting blood test results showing significant levels of lead and other rules \"necessary and feasible to implement the purposes\" of A.R.S. Title 36, Chapter 13, Article 6. The Department has implemented these statutes in Arizona Administrative Code (A.A.C.) Title 9, Chapter 4, Articles 1 through 5. The Department has identified several issues with the current rules that cause the rules to impose an undue burden on some regulated entities and reduce their effectiveness. After receiving an exception from the Governor's rulemaking moratorium established by Executive Order 2019-01, the Department has revised the rules in 9 A.A.C. 4, to address these issues, including moving definitions used throughout Chapter 4 to Article 1; updating and clarifying definitions, cross-references, and formatting; making revisions to comply with statutory changes; and updating and clarifying reporting requirements and time-frames. The changes conform to rulemaking format and style requirements of the Governor's Regulatory Review Council and the Office of the Secretary of State. 7. A reference to any study relevant to the rule that the agency reviewed and either rel ied on or did not rely on in its evaluation of or justification for the rule, where the public may obtain or review each study, all data underlying each study, and any analysis of each study and other supporting material: The Department did not review or rely on any study for this rulemaking. 8. A showing of good cause why the rulemaking is necessary to promote a statewide interest if the rulemaking will diminish a previous grant of authority of a political subdivision of this state: Not applicable 9. The summary of the economic, small business, and consumer impact: The Department anticipates that the rulemaking may affect the Department; the Arizona Department of Agriculture; hospitals; clinical laboratories; pathology naturopathic medicine; dentists; poison control centers; individuals who have a pesticide illness, elevated blood lead levels, cancer, or a birth defect and their parents or guardians; employers of individuals who have a pesticide illness, elevated blood lead levels, or cancer; and the general public. Annual costs/revenues changes are designated as minimal when more than $0 and $1,000 or less, moderate when between $1,000 and $10,000, and substantial when $10,000 or greater in additional costs or revenues. A cost is listed as significant when meaningful or important, but not readily subject to quantification.4Consolidating definitions, updating cross-references, and correcting grammar and formatting may provide a significant benefit to all affected persons. Clarifying requirements for reporting pesticide illness to match the current reporting forms and practice may provide a significant benefit to the Department, the Arizona Department of Agriculture, poison control centers, physicians, registered nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other health professionals. If a poison control center or health professional were not reporting according to current practice, the additions of requirements to report race and ethnicity, occupations not necessarily related to a pesticide exposure, symptoms reported by the individual, laboratory test information if applicable, and information about the person reporting the pesticide illness may cause these persons to incur minimal increased costs. If a poison control center were not reporting monthly, as required in the current rules, the change to quarterly reporting could impose a minimal increased burden, rather than a minimal decrease in costs that a poison control center reporting according to the current rules would experience. Similarly, clarifying requirements for reporting blood lead levels to match the current reporting forms and practice may provide a significant benefit to the Department, physicians, and clinical laboratories. However, the Department anticipates that a physician or clinical laboratory that was not reporting according to current practice may incur a minimal increased cost due to the changes. This is especially true for a physician performing a point-of-care test for blood lead, who may not have reported the results of a test resulting in a blood lead level under 10 \u00b5g of lead per dL of whole blood under the current rules, even though the physician would have been asked to report as a clinical laboratory under current practice. Since the current rules in Article 4 were adopted, many large physician group practices have formed due to savings on overhead over single-physician practices. The Department anticipates that revising the definition of \"clinic\" to include physician group cancer practices will provide a significant benefit to the Department and the general public through more complete and accurate reporting, but may cause up to a substantial increase in cost for a large physician group cancer practice that would be required to report as a clinic, rather than as a physician. The new rules update requirements for cancer case reports and for cancer follow-up reports to match current reporting practices, and may also provide a significant benefit to the Department and the general public through more complete and accurate reporting. The updated methods for assessing cancer data quality and completeness to match current practice may also provide a significant benefit to the Department and the general public. Reporting entities are already complying with the reporting, follow-up, and many of the quality assurance requirements in the new rules, so there are few, if any, new real costs being imposed by the changes. However, compared with 5requirements in the current rules, the new rules are adding reporting requirements for hospitals, physicians, doctors of naturopathic medicine, dentists, registered nurse practitioners, and clinics, which could result in minimal-to-moderate additional costs to an entity that was not reporting as is now standard practice. Under the current rules in Article 4, a pathology laboratory is required to allow the Department to review their records at least once every 90 days. Under the new rules, pathology laboratories will be required to electronically submit reports to the Department through active reporting. While a pathology laboratory may incur minimal-to-moderate costs to set up and implement such a reporting system, these costs may be offset by not incurring the minimal-to- moderate costs for the pathology laboratory to provide hard-copy or electronic records, space for the Department to review the records, and staff to assist the Department in reviewing and abstracting data from the records. In Article 5, the definition of \"clinic\" is also being revised to include other types of health care institution in which a birth defect many be detected; requirements for clinics are also being updated. Facilities now included in the definition of \"clinic\" that had not already been reporting may incur a minimal-to-moderate increase in costs associated with the rule change. However, the new rules are also potentially reducing the frequency of reporting for birth defects, from monthly to upon the request of the Department and no more often than once per month, with a concomitant reduction in costs. The Department anticipates that this change may result in a no-to- moderate reduction in costs to a reporting facility. Combining birth defect reporting requirements for a prenatal diagnostic facility, high-risk perinatal practice, or clinic may help reduce confusion as to which reporting requirements a facility should be following, and provide a significant benefit to the facility as well as the Department. The new rules also allow for more flexibility in when a genetic testing facility reports, providing a significant benefit to these facilities. Clarifying requirements for review of records and services related to birth defects may provide a significant benefit to the Department and all persons from which the Department may review records, as well as to a patient with a birth defect or the patient's parent or guardian. A patient with a birth defect or the patient's parent or guardian may also receive a significant benefit from the changes clarifying with whom the Department may discuss information. 10. A description of any changes between the proposed rulemaking, to include supplemental notices, and the final rulemaking: Changes made to the rules between the proposed rulemaking and the final rulemaking include removing abortion clinics from the definition of \"clinic\" to avoid a statutory conflict and the correction of typographical errors.611. An agency's summary of the public stakeholder comments made about the rulemaking and the agency response to the comments: No written comments were received about the rulemaking during the public comment period. The Department held an oral proceeding for the proposed rules on September 16, 2019, which no stakeholder/member of the public attended. 12. All agencies shall list other matters prescribed by statute applicable to the specific agency or to any specific rule or class of rules. Additionally, an agency subject to Council review under A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 41-1052 and 41-1055 shall respond to the following questions: a. Whether the rule requires a permit, whether a general permit is used and if not, the reasons why a general permit is not used: The rules do not require a permit. b. Whether a federal law is applicable to the subject of the rule, whether the rule is more stringent than federal law and if so, citation to the statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law: Not applicable c. Whether a person submitted an analysis to the agency that compares the rule's impact of the competitiveness of business in this state to the impact on business in other states: No business competitiveness analysis was received by the Department. 13. A list of any incorporated by reference material as specified in A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1028 and its location in the rules: Not applicable 14. Whether the rule was previously made, amended or repealed as an emergency rule. If so, cite the notice published in the Register as specified in R1-1-409(A). Also, the agency shall state where the text was changed between the emergency and the final rulemaking packages: Not applicable 15. The full text of the rules follows:7TITLE 9.

HEALTH SERVICES CHAPTER 4.NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES 1. An identification of the rulemaking Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) \u00a7 36-133 requires the Arizona Department of Health Services (Department) to develop a chronic disease surveillance system for the collection, management, and analysis of information on the incidence of chronic diseases in Arizona. A.R.S. \u00a7 36-606 states that the Department \"shall develop and implement ... a system for reporting and preventing pesticide provoked illnesses.\" A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 36-1673 and 36-1675 require the Department to adopt rules for reporting blood test results showing significant levels of lead and other rules \"necessary and feasible to implement the purposes\" of A.R.S. Title 36, Chapter 13, Article 6. The Department has implemented these statutes in Arizona Administrative Code (A.A.C.) Title 9, Chapter 4, Articles 1 through 5. The Department has identified several issues with the current rules that cause the rules to impose an undue burden on some regulated entities and reduce their effectiveness. After receiving an exception from the Governor's rulemaking moratorium established by Executive Order 2019-01, the Department is revising the rules in 9 A.A.C. 4, to address these issues, including moving definitions used throughout Chapter 4 to Article 1; updating and clarifying definitions, cross-references, and formatting; making revisions to comply with statutory changes; and updating and clarifying reporting requirements and time-frames. 2. Identification of the persons who will be directly affected by, bear the costs of, or directly benefit from the rules The Department The Arizona Department of Agriculture Hospitals Clinics Physicians, registered nurse practitioners, physician assistants Doctors of naturopathic medicine Dentists Poison control centers Clinical laboratories Pathology laboratories Prenatal diagnostic facilities3High-risk perinatal practices Genetic testing facilities Clinics Individuals who have a pesticide illness, elevated blood lead levels, cancer, or a birth defect and their families Employers of individuals who have a pesticide illness, elevated blood lead levels, or cancer General public 3. Cost/Benefit Analysis This analysis covers costs and benefits associated with the rule. No new FTEs will be required due to this rulemaking. This rulemaking is not associated with a fee. In general, this rulemaking reduces the burden on persons affected by the rules. Moving definitions used throughout Chapter 4 to Article 1 ensures consistency in definitions and make the rules more concise. Updating and clarifying definitions, cross-references, and formatting make the rules clearer and more understandable. Revisions made to comply with statutory changes or to update and clarify reporting requirements and time-frames provide benefits but may also cause some persons to incur additional costs. These effects are described below. Annual costs/revenues are designated as minimal when more than $0 and $1,000 or less, moderate when between $1,000 and $10,000, and substantial when $10,000 or greater in additional costs or revenues. A cost is listed as significant when meaningful or important, but not readily subject to quantification.

The Department anticipates receiving a significant benefit from these changes. The current rules in Articles 2, for Pesticide Illness, and Article 3, for Blood Lead Levels, have been in place since 2000 and do not reflect current practice for persons submitting reports to the Department. Although the Department has not received any reports about pesticide illness recently, the Department receives approximately 66,000 results of blood lead tests on children 6annually and approximately 7,800 blood lead tests for adults per year. Approximately 98% of these reports are being submitted electronically directly into Department-provided databases, rather than faxing hard copies of forms and laboratory reports. While the new rules for Articles 2 and 3 do not change the information currently being reported, some requirements in the new rules are changes from what is in the current rules. For example, the new rules contain requirements for including \"race\" and \"ethnicity\" when reporting for both pesticide illness and blood lead levels. For reporting pesticide illness, requirements in the new rules include reporting symptoms, reporting laboratory tests performed, stating how strongly the health care professional or medical director believes the individual has a pesticide illness, and better identifying the individual and entity making the report. For reporting blood lead levels, changes include a requirement for physicians to report the name of a child-patient's parent or guardian and the language predominantly spoken in the patient's home to assist with follow-up, and for clinical laboratories to report the date of test result, instead of the date the test result was received by the physician, and the name and telephone number of the clinical laboratory director. Under the new rules, a clinical laboratory would not be required to report the name of a child's parent. A clinical laboratory report would report an adult patient's occupation and the name, address, and telephone number of the patient's employer, as well as the source of payment for the test for blood lead, only if known. All of these changes are already included in the reporting forms currently being used by the Department, and the Department is already receiving this information from reporting persons; however, these requirements are not in rule. The Department anticipates receiving a significant benefit from these rule changes through a reduction of staff time spent explaining the discrepancies. In the 13 years since the rules in Article 4 were adopted, there have been many changes in the delivery of medical care, and great improvements have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer. The current rules do not reflect many of these changes. When the current rules were adopted, patients were mainly treated in hospitals or large clinics licensed as outpatient treatment centers. Physician private practices were generally small and controlled by a single physician or at most a few physicians, who referred patients with cancer to larger health care institutions like hospitals and clinics, as defined in the rules. Few patients were treated in private physician offices, and R9-4-404(E) was adopted to ensure that these physicians were not over- burdened with reporting. Today, very large physician group practices are the norm, with some specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. These cancer practices are not licensed under 9 A.A.C. 10 because they meet the criteria for exemption under A.R.S. \u00a7 36-402(A)(3) and are, therefore, 7not included under the current definition of \"clinic.\" Some of these practices treat hundreds of patients with cancer per year. However, because they use pathology reports as part of the diagnostic methodology, they are not required to report, only to respond to a letter from the Department or, less frequently, a hospital requesting information under R9-4-404(F) or (G). In the new rules, the definition of \"clinic\" is being revised to include these practices. The Department anticipates that this change will provide a moderate benefit to the Department from less staff time spent finding the correct practice, after reviewing a pathology report about a patient, and requesting necessary information about the patient. The change may also provide a significant benefit due to the Department's receiving more complete and timely case reports. Similarly, when the rules were adopted, it was the norm for documentation to be maintained in hard-copy, so the current rules require a pathology laboratory to allow the Department to review pathology reports to obtain the information required for a case report. Pathology reports are now maintained electronically, and it may be more effective and efficient, and less burdensome for all persons, to require active reporting by pathology laboratories through the submission of an electronic pathology report to the Department under the revised R9-4-404(H). The Department believes that this change may provide up to a moderate benefit to the Department as it will save time/effort/costs associated with traveling to pathology laboratories and some data entry. Since cancer diagnosis and treatment methodologies have changed since the current rules were adopted, the new rules in R9-4-403 update requirements for cancer case reports to include new methodologies and practices and to match current reporting practices. Changes in R9-4- 404(A)(2) and (3) update requirements for cancer follow-up reports to match current reporting practices, while changes in R9-4-405(A)(2) and (3) update methods for assessing cancer data quality and completeness to match current practice. The Department receives over 45,000 case reports per year from hospitals, clinics, providers of different sorts, and pathology laboratories. Because these changes make the rules consistent with current practice, they provide a significant benefit to the Department, and may also provide a minimal benefit through a reduction in staff time to explain discrepancies between current practice and rule requirements to those submitting case reports. The Department may incur up to minimal costs to answer questions about the rule changes. The Arizona Birth Defects Monitoring Program collects and maintains data on birth defects under Article 5, including reports from approximately 63 facilities, and reviews an average of 2,600 medical records per year. Depending on the diagnostic services provided by a facility/practice and the complexity of the patients receiving prenatal or birthing services, a 8facility/practice could meet the definition of prenatal diagnostic facility or high-risk perinatal practice or both. In the current rules, these reporting requirements are similar, but not identical, and could cause confusion on the part of the facility/practice as to which reporting requirements to follow. In the new rules, there is now a single consolidated list of reporting elements for these facilities. The Department anticipates that this change may make it easier for these types of facilities/practices to report and, thus, result in more complete, accurate, and timely reporting, providing a significant benefit to the Department, as well as requiring less staff time to answer questions from or provide technical assistance to these facilities. A birth center could be licensed under 9 A.A.C. 10 as more than one class of health care institution, depending on what other services are provided by the facility, or be the private practice of a physician or registered nurse practitioner and, thus, be exempt from licensing by the Department under A.R.S. \u00a7 36-402(A)(3). Depending on the complexity of the patients of the facility/practice receiving prenatal or birthing services, the facility/practice could also meet the definition of prenatal diagnostic facility or high-risk perinatal practice. Therefore, it may be difficult to determine if a facility providing birthing services should report as a clinic or other reporting group under the current rules. To avoid confusion, clarify requirements, and ensure more complete reporting, the Department is changing the definition of \"clinic,\" to include birth centers since they are another type of health care institution in which a birth defect many be detected. Clinics are also being required to report the same set of information as prenatal diagnostic facilities and high-risk perinatal practices. The Department anticipates that these changes may also result in more complete, accurate, and timely reporting, providing a significant benefit to the Department. In this rulemaking, the Department is also reducing the frequency of reporting for hospitals, prenatal diagnostic facilities, and high-risk perinatal practices from monthly to \"upon the request of the Department and no more often than once per month.\" This change will not only benefit the reporting entities, as described below, but also the Department in allowing the Department to schedule submission of reports from different types of reporting entities and for different categories of birth defects to times when the Department has resources available to analyze and act on the information being submitted. Similarly, genetic testing facilities are currently required to report monthly, but the new rules allow them to report either monthly or within 30 calendar days after the date of a test. These changes are expected to provide the Department with a significant benefit. The new rules also clarify that \"other individuals who clinically evaluated, diagnosed, or treated a patient or the patient's mother\" may include physical therapists, occupational therapists, 9podiatrists, and speech-language pathologists, and that the Department may also review reports from these health professionals as part of a medical record. In R9-4-504, the new rules also clarify that the Department may discuss information submitted to the Department as specified in R9-4-502 or collected as specified in R9-4-503(B)(2) with the Arizona Early Intervention Program and with the parent or guardian of a patient, as allowed by A.R.S. \u00a7 36-133, as amended by Laws 2008, Ch. 52. The Department anticipates that these changes may provide a significant benefit to the Department by clarifying current practice. Arizona Department of Agriculture Under A.R.S. Title 3, Chapter 2, Articles 5 and 6, the Arizona Department of Agriculture is responsible for the regulation of pesticides in Arizona and for pesticide control. The rules in 3 A.A.C. 3, Article 3 and 3 A.A.C. 8, Article 3 specify requirements for the use of pesticides, which are enforced by the Arizona Department of Agriculture. A.R.S. \u00a7 3-343(B)(2) allows the director of the Arizona Department of Agriculture to \"[d]etermine whether or not pesticides present an unreasonable risk to humans.\" Through the reports on pesticide illness made under R9-4-202, the Department is able to notify the Arizona Department of Agriculture of events that may indicate noncompliance with statute or rules regarding pesticides and allow the Arizona Department of Agriculture to investigate these events. By consolidating definitions, updating cross-references, and correcting grammar and formatting, the Department is making the rules easier to understand. By clarifying requirements for reporting pesticide illness to match the current reporting forms and practice, the Department is making the rules easier to comply with. This may lead to improved reporting and more accurate information, and may provide a significant benefit to the Arizona Department of Agriculture in ensuring the safe use of pesticides in Arizona. Hospitals Hospitals are the main source of information about cancer cases in Arizona, since almost all cases will be treated in a hospital at some point. The Department receives approximately 36,000 case reports from hospitals each year. Currently 51 hospitals with a licensed capacity of 50 or more inpatient beds actively submit case reports under R9-4-404(A), with a maximum of approximately 2,860 case reports being submitted by a single hospital. The average number of case reports submitted by larger hospitals is approximately 1,560 per hospital. There are currently 13 hospitals with a licensed capacity of less than 50 inpatient beds that report under R9-4-404(B). The smallest number of reports from these hospitals is five per year, with an average of 155 cases from smaller hospitals. The new rules update requirements for cancer case reports to match current reporting practices. These changes include requiring codes for new types of cancer treatment, such as 10hormone therapy, immunotherapy, hematologic transplant, or endocrine procedures. Other changes include, as applicable, requiring a code for the reason no radiation treatment was administered, the sequence of two treatments, the status of a patient's treatment, and a code related to the recurrence of cancer. Hospitals are already complying with the reporting requirements in the new rules, so there are few, if any, new real costs being imposed by the changes. However, compared with requirements in the current rules, the new rules are adding reporting requirements for hospitals, which could result in minimal-to-moderate additional costs to a hospital that was not reporting as is now standard practice. Additionally, having rules that are consistent with current practice may reduce confusion and make it easier for a hospital to comply with reporting requirements, providing a significant benefit to a hospital. It is standard practice for a hospital to submit electronic follow-up reports, as specified in R9- 4-404(A)(2), correcting information that had previously been submitted by the hospital. Similarly, changes in R9-4-405(A)(2) and (3) update methods for assessing cancer data quality and completeness to match current practice. Hospitals with a licensed capacity of fewer than 50 inpatient beds that do not report electronically, as specified in R9-4-404(A), routinely provide to the Department a patient's date of birth rather than age. Therefore, the changes in R9-4-404(A)(2) and (B)(1)(b)(ii) and R9-4-405(A)(2) and (3) make the rules consistent with current practice, and may provide a significant benefit to a hospital by reducing confusion, but could impose a minimal additional cost on a hospital that was not already complying. As mentioned above, the Department is reducing the frequency of reporting of birth defects for hospitals from monthly to \"upon the request of the Department and no more often than once per month.\" This change will likely reduce the number of reports that a hospital is required to report each year. The requirement for reporting the race and ethnicity of the patient or patient's mother is also being removed in the new rules. These changes may provide at least a minimal benefit to a hospital. Clinical laboratories, including pathology laboratories and genetic testing facilities Approximately 80% of the almost 74,000 results of blood lead tests received by the Department each year come from clinical laboratories. The new rules in Article 3 clarify requirements for clinical laboratories to report blood lead levels to match the current reporting forms and practice, and may, thus, provide a significant benefit to a clinical laboratory by reducing confusion about reporting requirements. As mentioned above, the new rules contain requirements for including \"race\" and \"ethnicity\" when reporting blood lead levels. Clinical laboratories will also be required under the new rules to the name and telephone number of the clinical laboratory director, which is already a regulatory requirement for clinical laboratories 11under CLIA (the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988, 42 C.F.R. 493, Laboratory Requirements), under which clinical laboratories are certified. Under the new rules, a clinical laboratory would report an adult patient's occupation and the name, address, and telephone number of the patient's employer, as well as the source of payment for the test for blood lead, only if known, and would not be required to report the name of a child's parent. All of these changes are already included in the reporting forms being used by the Department and should, therefore, cause no real increase in cost to a clinical laboratory reporting according to current practice. However, the Department believes that a clinical laboratory that was not reporting according to current practice could incur a minimal increase in cost to change the information being reported. In the current rules in Article 4, pathology laboratories are required in R9-4-404(H) to allow the Department to review pathology reports at least once every 90 calendar days, to obtain the information specified in R9-4-403. Under this rule, when it was first adopted, Department staff might visit a pathology laboratory and view pathology reports in hard-copy to obtain the information required for a case report. While Department staff members were on the premises, the pathology laboratory would incur costs associated with providing space for the Department's review, having someone from the pathology laboratory available to gather records and pathology reports, and making copies for the Department. Since pathology reports are now maintained electronically, it may be more cost effective for a pathology laboratory to submit a copy of a pathology report electronically to the Department. Two pathology laboratories are already submitting pathology reports electronically, with an average of 262 reports per year. An additional five pathology laboratories are submitting pathology reports on paper, with an average of 2,335 reports received per year from these pathology laboratories. Although the Department anticipates that most pathology laboratories will batch pathology reports, the new rules allow a pathology laboratory to determine whether to send these reports to the Department as they are produced and sent out to the ordering health care provider or to batch them and send them on a schedule determined by the pathology laboratory, as long as the pathology reports are provided at least once every 90 calendar days. Therefore, the Department anticipates that this change may provide up to a minimal-to-moderate ongoing benefit to a pathology laboratory, while causing at most a moderate cost for initial set-up of electronic reporting for those not already doing so. Some birth defects are routinely detected through genetic testing facilities, so these facilities are included as reporting sources in Article 5. The Department currently confirms approximately 160 patients with a chromosomal defect each year, all of which are potentially reportable by genetic testing facilities. Under the current rules, genetic testing facilities are required to prepare 12and submit to the Department a written report each month about applicable individuals. In the new rules, a genetic testing facility may report either monthly or within 30 calendar days after the date of a test. The Department believes that this flexibility may provide a significant benefit to a genetic testing facility. Prenatal diagnostic facilities and high-risk perinatal practices The Department estimates that there are approximately 20 prenatal diagnostic facilities and high-risk perinatal practices that could report birth defects under R9-4-402(B) or (D). Depending on the diagnostic services provided by a facility/practice and the complexity of the patients receiving prenatal or birthing services, a facility/practice could meet the definition of prenatal diagnostic facility or high-risk perinatal practice or both. In the current rules, these reporting requirements are similar, but not identical, and could cause confusion on the part of the facility/practice as to which reporting requirements to follow. In the new rules, there is now a single consolidated list of reporting elements. The Department anticipates that this change may make it easier for these types of facilities/practices to report and, thus, provide a significant benefit to a prenatal diagnostic facility or high-risk perinatal practice. The frequency with which a prenatal diagnostic facility or high-risk perinatal practice is required to report a birth defect is also being reduced in the new rules from monthly to \"upon the request of the Department and no more often than once per month,\" thus, likely reducing the number of reports each year. The Department estimates that this change may provide a minimal benefit to a prenatal diagnostic facility or high-risk perinatal practice. Clinics As mentioned above, in response to the changing landscape of medical practice, the Department is revising the definition of \"clinic\" in R9-4-401 to include private offices/medical practices in which 50 or more cancer patients are treated per year. Since over 120 physicians are currently reporting, the Department believes that at least this number of medical practices may be affected by the rule change. The Department believes that staff of practices that will be included in the revised definition of \"clinic,\" especially those that treat a large number of patients each year, may currently spend a large amount of time pulling records and gathering information together in response to a request from the Department, perhaps months after a diagnosis was made, for information about a patient for whom the Department received a report from a pathology laboratory. Under the new rules, such a practice would be required to report according to R9-4-404(C) or (D), depending on how many case reports the practice anticipates submitting to the Department per year. While this change may result in staff of the practice spending less time responding to requests from the Department for information of patients and result in at least a 13minimal benefit, the change may also result in the practice incurring minimal-to-moderate costs to establish and implement a system for submitting case reports. These practices, as well as facilities already reporting as \"clinics,\" may also be affected by requirements that update cancer case reports to match current reporting practices and to submit data quality assurance information as required in the new rules in R9-4-405(A)(2). The Department receives approximately 2,600 case reports per year from clinics. Over the past five years, the average number of case report from clinics was 62 per year, with the highest number being 358 case reports and the lowest being one case report per year. Facilities already reporting as clinics may not have any real changes in how reporting is done or what is reported, but they may receive a significant benefit from having rules that agree with practice, resulting in less confusion over requirements. However, the Department estimates that a clinic that was reporting according to requirements in the current rules, rather than as is the current reporting practice, could incur a minimal increase in costs due to the rule changes. Clinics may also incur minimal- to-moderate costs, depending on the number of cases being treated by the facility, from the added quality assurance report. To avoid confusion, clarify requirements, and ensure more complete reporting, the Department is also changing the definition of \"clinic\" in Article 5 to include birth centers, since they are another type of health care institution in which a birth defect may be detected. Clinics are also being required to report the same set of information as prenatal diagnostic facilities and high- risk perinatal practices. Some of these facilities may have already been reporting under requirements for prenatal diagnostic facilities or high-risk perinatal practices or responding to the Department's requests for information about birth defects detected in the facility. The Department anticipates that a birth center that has not been reporting or responding to a request from the Department for revision of a report about birth defects may incur a minimal-to-moderate cost to comply with these new requirements. Another category of facility under \"clinic\" may also incur a minimal-to-moderate cost to begin reporting or respond to a request for revision of a report about birth defects. However, the new rules also reduce and simplify the information required to be submitted, which may provide a minimal benefit to all facilities that meet the definition of \"clinic.\" Physicians, registered nurse practitioners, physician assistants, doctors of naturopathic medicine, and dentists Physicians, registered nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and any other individuals who are authorized by law to diagnose human illness are included in the definition of \"health care professional\" in R9-4-201. These individuals are required under current rules in Article 2 to 14submit reports of pesticide illness. The new rules clarify and simplify reporting requirements for pesticide illness to match the current reporting forms and practice. Therefore, they may provide a significant benefit to a physician, a registered nurse practitioner, a physician assistant, or any other individual who is authorized by law to diagnose human illness. The Department estimates that the small changes in the rules related to the information being reported to match the current reporting forms and practice (adding reporting of race and ethnicity, symptoms reported by the individual, and information about laboratory tests) may cause a health care provider that was not reporting according to current practice to incur at most minimal additional costs. Physicians are required by A.R.S. \u00a7 36-1673 to report elevated blood lead levels. The Department receives a few hundred such reports annually from physicians, with some registered nurse practitioners also submitting reports to the Department. These include reports from physicians of blood lead levels less than 10 \u00b5g/dL for a child. The Department anticipates that the clarity of the new rules in Article 3 and their being consistent with current practice may provide a significant benefit to those reporting blood lead levels. Adding information being reported to match the current reporting forms and practice (reporting of race and ethnicity and information to assist in follow-up of elevated blood lead levels, such as the name of the parent or guardian of a patient who is a child and the language spoken in the patient's home, if known) may cause a physician who was not reporting according to current practice to incur at most minimal additional costs. Since the rules in Article 3 were adopted, new point-of-care tests for blood lead have been developed that can be performed outside a clinical laboratory. Persons performing these tests must obtain a CLIA certificate of waiver. These point-of-care tests for blood lead are being performed routinely in many physician offices and clinics. Because physicians are performing the tests under a CLIA certificate, the Department had been requesting from these physicians reports of any test results, not just those with elevated blood lead levels, just a clinical laboratory reports all test results. Reports from point-of-care tests account for approximately 20% of the blood lead test results reported, with 29 provider offices currently reporting these test results. Receiving test results below 25 \u00b5g of lead per dL of whole blood for an adult or 10 \u00b5g of lead per dL of whole blood for a child allows the Department to determine the incidence of blood lead levels to evaluate whether the threshold for designating a blood lead level as elevated should be changed, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as to monitor the efficacy of treatment and strategies to reduce the blood lead levels in patients who had had an elevated blood lead level in previous tests. The new rules are being changed to reflect this practice, and the change should have no real effect on physicians who had been reporting 15according to current practice. However, the Department estimates that a physician who performs point-of-care tests for blood lead, but does not now reports the results of tests below 25 \u00b5g of lead per dL of whole blood for an adult or 10 \u00b5g of lead per dL of whole blood for a child, may incur as much as a minimal increased cost to report these results. These physicians may receive a significant benefit from follow-up provided through the Department for these cases of elevated blood lead levels. The Department receives over 3,500 case reports per year under Article 4 from physicians, doctors of naturopathic medicine, dentists, registered nurse practitioners, and the designees of clinics. Over the past five years, the average number of case report from these practitioners was 28 per year, with the highest number being 266 case reports and the lowest being one case report. As mentioned above, cancer diagnosis and treatment methodologies have changed greatly since the rules in Article 4 were adopted. Case reporting requirements for physicians, doctors of naturopathic medicine, dentists, registered nurse practitioners, and the designees of clinics in R9- 4-403(A) have been changed in the new rules to reflect the changes in cancer diagnosis and treatment and be consistent with current reporting practices. These changes include the reporting of biomarkers and clinical indicators of cancer in R9-4-403(A)(1)(q) and (r), respectively. The Department believes that the changes should have no real effect on those reporting according to current practice and may result in a significant benefit of having rules that agree with practice. However, the Department believes that a physician, doctor of naturopathic medicine, dentist, registered nurse practitioner, or the designee of a clinic who does not now reports as is current practice may incur as much as a minimal increased cost to do so. These persons may also be affected by requirements to submit data quality assurance information as required in the new rules in R9-4-405(A)(2). The Department estimates that this rule change may cause a minimal increase in costs to physician, doctor of naturopathic medicine, dentist, registered nurse practitioner, or the designee of a clinic. Poison control centers There are currently two poison control centers in Arizona, one associated with the University of Arizona in Tucson and one with Banner Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix. These facilities may receive a significant benefit from having reporting requirements for pesticide illness to match the current reporting forms. Under A.R.S. \u00a7 36-606 and the current rules in Article 2, the medical directors of these poison control centers are required to report pesticide illness within five working days from the date of diagnosis or identification, except in certain circumstances. In practice, poison control centers have been reporting annually. Under the new rules, a poison control center would be required to report at least once each month, unless the individual with 16pesticide illness was determined to be part of a cluster illness, and to provide information to match the current reporting forms and practice. The Department anticipates that a poison control center may receive a theoretical minimal benefit from the lengthening of the time-frame for reporting in rule from five working days to monthly, but may incur minimal costs from changing the practice of annual reporting to monthly reporting and from the changes in the information reported to be consistent with current reporting forms and practice. Individuals who have a pesticide illness, elevated blood lead levels, cancer, or a birth defect and their parents or guardians Each year approximately 90 children are identified with elevated blood lead levels, greater than or equal to 10 \u00b5g of lead per dL of whole blood, and 30 adults are identified with elevated blood lead levels greater than or equal to 25 \u00b5g of lead per dL of whole blood. Physicians and other practitioners follow up on the test results to try to decrease these levels. Because elevated blood lead levels have potentially more serious effects on children, the Department assists in follow-up for children with elevated blood lead levels. Due to confusion about current reporting requirements for pesticide illness, the Department is not sure how many individuals are diagnosed each year with pesticide illness. The Department receives over 45,000 case reports for cancer each year, with between 10 and 25% being duplicative with other reports for the same cases. An average of 34,542 new Arizona resident cases are diagnosed per year, with the total number being 37,054 new cases if non-residents are included. Approximately 800 patients who have a birth defect are detected and reported each year. The Department anticipates that clarifying requirements for reporting pesticide illness, blood lead levels, cancer, and birth defects to match the current reporting forms and practice may help those reporting to better understand reporting requirements and to submit more accurate and complete information. Having better information about these non-communicable diseases may allow policymakers, public health officials, health care practitioners, researchers, etc. to better address the effects that these non-communicable diseases have on individuals and, potentially, provide a significant benefit to these individuals. In addition, the changes in R9-4-504, related to the persons with whom the Department may discuss the information submitted to the Department about a birth defect, to include the parent or guardian of a patient may provide a significant benefit to the parent or guardian in connecting them with resources needed to address issues arising due to the birth defect. Employers of individuals who have a pesticide illness, elevated blood lead levels, or cancer The Department believes that clarifying requirements for reporting pesticide illness, blood lead levels, cancer, and birth defects to match the current reporting forms and practice may also provide a significant benefit to the employers of individuals who have a pesticide illness, elevated 17blood lead levels, or cancer, especially if the non-communicable disease may be related to the occupation of the individual. Better information may lead to better strategies to reduce the risk of exposure to conditions that could lead to other individuals developing the non-communicable disease and provide a healthier workforce in these industries. However, implementation of some of these strategies may cause an employer to incur up to a moderate increase in costs. General public Similarly, clarifying requirements for reporting pesticide illness, blood lead levels, cancer, and birth defects and improving data quality may provide a significant benefit to the general public. The general public may benefit from new discoveries arising from more accurate and complete data that reduce the incidence of or improve the prognosis for these non-communicable diseases. In addition, better data may result in measures that may be taken to improve strategies to prevent these diseases or lead to better and earlier interventions. 4. A general description of the probable impact on private and public employment in businesses, agencies, and political subdivisions of this state directly affected by the rulemaking Neither public employment nor private employment in the State of Arizona is expected to be affected due to the changes in the rule. 5. A statement of the probable impact of the rules on small business a. Identification of the small businesses subject to the rules Small businesses subject to the rules may include small hospitals; small clinical laboratories, pathology laboratories, and genetic testing facilities; small prenatal diagnostic facilities, high-risk perinatal practices, and clinics; and the practices of physicians, registered nurse practitioners, physician assistants, doctors of naturopathic medicine, and dentists. The two poison control centers in Arizona are part of much larger organizations, the University of Arizona and the Banner healthcare system, so the Department does not consider them to be small businesses. b. The administrative and other costs required for compliance with the rules Anticipated costs for complying with the rules are described under paragraph 3. c. A description of the methods that the agency may use to reduce the impact on small businesses The Department has already included methods to reduce the impact of the rules on small businesses, having more flexible reporting of cancer cases for small hospitals; requiring less information to be reported by physicians, doctors of naturopathic medicine, dentists, registered nurse practitioners, and clinics; and limiting the reports required of physicians, 18doctors of naturopathic medicine, dentists, registered nurse practitioners, and clinics to those cases not required to be reported by other entities. The Department is unaware of any measures that may be taken to reduce the impact on small businesses while still protecting the health and safety of the citizens of and visitors to Arizona. d. The probable costs and benefits to private persons and consumers who are directly affected by the rules The costs to private persons and consumers from the rulemaking are described in paragraph 3. 6. A statement of the probable effect on state revenues The rulemaking does not include any fees, so the Department does not expect the rules to affect state revenues. 7. A description of any less intrusive or less costly alternative methods of achieving the purpose of the proposed rulemaking There are no less intrusive or less costly alternatives for achieving the purpose of the rule. 8.

A registered food preparer shall renew the registration every three years and shall provide to the department updated registration information within thirty days after any change. 14. Prescribe an exclusion for fetal demise cases from the standardized survey known as \"the hospital consumer assessment of healthcare providers and systems\". J. The rules adopted under the authority conferred by this section shall be observed throughout the state and shall be enforced by each local board of health or public health services district, but this section does not limit the right of any local board of health or county board of supervisors to adopt ordinances and rules as authorized by law within its jurisdiction, provided that the ordinances and rules do not conflict with state law and are equal to or more restrictive than the rules of the director. K. The powers and duties prescribed by this section do not apply in instances in which regulatory powers and duties relating to public health are vested by the legislature in any other state board, commission, agency or instrumentality, except that with regard to the regulation of meat and meat products, the department of health services and the Arizona department of agriculture within the area delegated to each shall adopt rules that are not in conflict. L. The director, in establishing fees authorized by this section, shall comply with title 41, chapter 6. The department shall not set a fee at more than the department's cost of providing the service for which the fee is charged. State agencies are exempt from all fees imposed pursuant to this section. M. After consultation with the state superintendent of public instruction, the director shall prescribe the criteria the department shall use in deciding whether or not to notify a local school district that a pupil in the district has tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus antibody. The director shall prescribe the procedure by which the department shall notify a school district if, pursuant to these criteria, the department determines that notification is warranted in a particular situation. This procedure shall include a requirement that before notification the department shall determine to its satisfaction that the district has an appropriate policy relating to nondiscrimination of the infected pupil and confidentiality of test results and that proper educational counseling has been or will be provided to staff and pupils. N.

For R2-20-113 (Candidate Statement Pamphlet), the rule amendment adds language that clarifies that a candidate's statement submitted for the Commission's primary statement pamphlet will be used for the general election pamphlet unless the candidate directs otherwise. The Commission indicates that this is their current ad hoc accommodation for candidates who fail to submit a statement by the deadline but contact commission staff in time to use the primary statement when possible. This rulemaking codifies the Commission's current ad hoc accommodation. For R2-20-702 (Use of Campaign Funds), the Commission is amending this rule to conform to statutory changes to A.R.S. \u00a7 16-948 (Controls on participating candidates' campaign accounts) as a result of Proposition 306, which the voters approved in the 2018 general election. Specifically, this rulemaking amends the rule to remove a participating candidate's ability to make a payment from the candidate's campaign bank account to a person with tax exempt status under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. It also removes language from the rule that permitted a participating candidate to make advanced payments from campaign bank accounts to a political party. For R2-20-704 (Repayment), the Commission is amending this rule to remove language that says the Commission has to notify the candidate of any repayment determinations no later than one year after the day of the election. The Commission is amending this rule in order to conform with state law that says that statutes of limitations do not run against the state. 1. Are the rules legal, consistent with legislative intent, and within the agency's statutory authority? Yes. The Commission cites to both general and specific authority for these rules. 2. Do the rules establish a new fee or contain a fee increase? No. This rulemaking does not establish a new fee or contain a fee increase. 3. Does the preamble disclose a reference to any study relevant to the rules that the agency reviewed and either did or did not rely upon? The Commission did not review or rely on any study in conducting this rulemaking. 4. Summary of the agency's economic impact analysis: The Citizens Clean Elections Commission states that any economic impact from the changes to the rules is the consequence of the statute and not the rules themselves. Stakeholders include the Commission and participating and nonparticipating candidates in both the primary and general elections. 5. Has the agency analyzed the costs and benefits of the rulemaking and determined that the rules impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated? The Commission believes the amendments to the rules proposes the least intrusive way of achieving the objective of the statute(s). 6. What are the economic impacts on stakeholders? There is no economic impact on stakeholders other than any impact from the applicable statute(s). 7. Are the final rules a substantial change, considered as a whole, from the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? No. The Commission did not make any changes to the proposed rules between the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and the Notice of Final Rulemaking. 8. Does the agency adequately address the comments on the proposed rules and any supplemental proposals? The Commission did not receive any comments in conducting this rulemaking. 9. Do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? Not applicable. The rules do not require a permit or license. 10. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? Not applicable. There is no corresponding federal law. 11. Conclusion As amended by Proposition 306, the Commission's exemption from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) in A.R.S. \u00a7 16-965(C) was removed. Therefore, this rulemaking was submitted to GRRC for review and consideration pursuant to the APA. Proposition 306 did not remove other language from A.R.S. \u00a7 16-956(C) regarding the Commission's rulemaking procedures and processes. For example, the statute still retains language that requires the Commission to propose and adopt rules in public meetings, with at least 60 days allowed for interested parties to comment after the rules are proposed. While it appears A.R.S. \u00a7 16-956(C) outlines distinct rulemaking procedures for the Commission, it still requires that \"[a]ny rules given final approval in an open meeting shall be filed in the format prescribed in section 41-1022 with the secretary of state's office for publication in the Arizona administrative register.\" Pursuant to the APA, final approval for rulemakings comes from either GRRC or the Attorney General. See A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1024(H) (\"An agency shall not file a final rule with the secretary of state without prior approval from the council....\"). In addition to submitting this rulemaking package to Council staff, it is Council staff's understanding that copies of the draft Notices of Final Rulemaking were submitted to the Secretary of State's office for publication and were published in the August 23, 2019 edition of the Administrative Register with an effective date of July 29, 2019. Notwithstanding publication of these Notices, it is Council staff's opinion that the rules cannot be effective or enforced until they are given final approval by the Council pursuant to the APA. Therefore, Council staff encourages the Council to review the Commissions's rulemaking submissions to determine compliance with the APA and the requirements outlined in A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1052 (Council review and approval). Proposition 306 also did not remove language in A.R.S. \u00a7 16-956(D), which says that \"[r]ules adopted by the commission are not effective until January 1 in the year following adoption of the rule, except that rules adopted by unanimous vote of the commission may be made immediately effective and enforceable.\" The Commission voted unanimously to make these rule amendments immediately effective. It is Council staff's opinion that the rule amendments cannot be immediately effective and enforceable until they are given final approval by the Council. Council staff has no objection to an immediate effective date due to the language in A.R.S. 16-956(D), and recommends that the rulemaking be approved with an immediate effective date. The rule amendments would be effective on the day the Commission files the Certificate of Approval for this rulemaking with the Secretary of State's office after approval by the Council.

The rules cover the following: Article 1 - Administration Article 2 - Vital Records for Birth Article 3 - Vital Records for Death These rules were adopted by exempt rulemaking in 2016. This is the first 5YRR for these rules. Proposed Action The Department indicated some of the rules need to be amended to improve clarity, conciseness, understandability, effectiveness, enforcement and consistency with other rules and statutes. The Department plans to submit a rulemaking to amend the rules and address the issues identified in the report by July 2020. 1. Has the agency analyzed whether the rules are authorized by statute? Yes, the Department cites to both general and specific statutory authority for these rules. 2. Summary of the agency's economic impact comparison and identification of stakeholders: The Department believes the exempt rulemaking achieved its objectives of improving process efficiencies and reducing regulatory and monetary costs. Stakeholders include the Department, health care providers and practitioners, funeral establishments, state offices, local registrars, county partners, and the general public. 3. Has the agency analyzed the costs and benefits of the rulemaking and determined that the rules impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated? Yes, the Department believes that the rules impose the least burden and costs necessary to achieve the regulatory objective. 4. Has the agency received any written criticisms of the rules over the last five years? Yes, the Department indicates it received three written criticisms regarding the following rules over the last five years: R9-19-201(A)(1) (Information for a Birth Record); R9-19-204(F)(2) (Requests for Birth Registration from Persons Other than Hospitals or Health Care Providers); and R9-19-315 (Requesting a Certified Copy of a Certificate of Death Registration). As described in Item 7 of the 5YRR, the Department adequately responded to those written criticisms. 5. Has the agency analyzed the rules' clarity, conciseness, and understandability, consistency with other rules and statutes, and effectiveness? Yes. For the reasons stated in the report, the Department indicates that the following rules could be amended to improve their clarity, conciseness, understandability, and consistency with other rules and statutes: R9-19-101 (Definitions); R9-19-104 (Duties of Local Registrars); R9-19-201 (Information for a Birth Record); R9-19-202 (Requests from Hospitals for Birth Registration); R9-19-204 (Requests for Birth Registration from Persons other than Hospitals or Health Care Providers); R9-19-208 (Amending Information in a Registered Birth Record); R9-19-210 (Eligibility for a Certified Copy of a Certificate of Birth Registration); R9-19-212 (Requesting a Noncertified Copy of a Certificate of Birth Registration); R9-19-301 (Human Remains Release Form); R9-19-304 (Registration of a Death When a Medical Examiner is Notified According to A.R.S. \u00a7 11-593(B)); R9-19-305 (Fetal Death Registration); R9-19-306 (Registration of a Fetal Death When a Medical Examiner is Notified According to A.R.S. \u00a7 11-593(B)); R9-19-309 (Correcting Information in a Registered Death Record or a Registered Fetal Death Record); R9-19-311 (Transporting Human Remains into the State for Final Disposition); R9-19-314 (Eligibility for a Certified Copy of a Certificate of Death Registration); R9-19-315 (Requesting a Certified Copy of a Certificate of Death Registration); and R9-19-316 (Requesting a Noncertified Copy of a Certificate of Death Registration). 6. Has the agency analyzed the current enforcement status of the rules? Yes. The Department indicates that the following rules are not enforced as written: R9-19-212 (Requesting a Noncertified Copy of a Certificate of Birth Registration); and R9-19-316 (Requesting a Noncertified Copy of a Certificate of Death Registration). For R9-19-212, the Department states that subsection (B) is enforced according to the documentation from the Department's Human Subjects Review Board that states what information from a birth record a person conducting research is eligible to receive. For R9-19-316, the Department states that subsection (B) is enforced according to the documentation from the Department's Human Subjects Review Board that states what information from a death record a person conducting research is eligible to receive. 7. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? The Department shares certain information collected under these rules with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS); however, there is no corresponding federal law. 8. For rules adopted after July 29, 2010, do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? Not applicable. The Department indicates the rules do not require the issuance of a permit or license. 9. Conclusion As mentioned above, and for the reasons specified in the report, the Department proposes to amend its rules to improve clarity, conciseness, understandability, effectiveness, enforcement and consistency with other rules and statutes by July 2020. Council staff notes that the Department has not provided a justification or explanation for this timeline. While Council staff recommends approval of this report, staff encourages the Council to inquire as to the reasons for this timeline. 1Arizona Department of Health Services Five-Year-Review Report Title 9.

Are the rules effective in achieving their objectives? Yes _ X_ No __ If not, please identify the rule(s) that is not effective and provide an explanation for why the rule(s) is not effective. Rule Explanation MultipleThe rules are effective, but they would be more effective if the issues identified in paragraphs 4 and 6 were addressed. R9-19-101While the rule does not define the term \"custody,\" relying on the dictionary definition, changes to Arizona's domestic relations law in 2013 eliminated the word \"custody\" and now uses the term \"legal decision-making,\" as defined in A.R.S. \u00a7 25-401(3). The rule would be more effective if it contained a definition of \"custody\" that included the term \"legal decision- making.\" R9-19-208The rule would be more effective and less burdensome if subsection (J) were changed to allow the last name of an individual's father to be changed without requiring the father to obtain a court order. R9-19-301The rule would be more effective if the e-mail address of the health care provider expected to sign the medical certification of death were required on the human remains release form to facilitate communication between a funeral establishment and the medical certifier. R9-19-314 The rule would be more effective if subsection (B)(5) were not limited to powers of attorney 4established according to A.R.S. \u00a7 14-5104 or 14-5107, but also included powers of attorney for a person eligible according to subsection (B)(2), (3), or (4). 4. Are the rules consistent with other rules and statutes? Yes ___ No _ X_ If not, please identify the rule(s) that is not consistent. Also, provide an explanation and identify the provisions that are not consistent with the rule. Rule Explanation R9-19-104The cross-reference in subsection (A)(2) should be and (F)(3)(b) should \"subsection rather \"subsections (B) or R9-19-306The cross-reference in subsection (B)(2)(b) to \"R9-19-305(B)(1)(p) (v) and (2)(a) through (h)\" rather than to \"R9-19-305(B)(p) through (v) and (2)(a) through (h).\" R9-19-311The rule appears to be inconsistent with A.R.S. \u00a7 36-326(J) in that the statute requires the issuance of an Arizona disposition-transit permit upon receipt of a disposition-transit permit from another state, while the rule allows a person transporting a deceased individual's human remains into Arizona from outside of the state to submit either a disposition-transit permit or a registered death certificate from another state to obtain an Arizona disposition-transit permit. However, A.R.S. \u00a7 36-326(G) allows a disposition-transit permit to be issued if a funeral establishment or other responsible person provides information \"pursuant to this [C]hapter and rules adopted pursuant to this [C]hapter,\" which would be included in a registered death certificate from another state. R9-19-314, R9-19-315The rule is inconsistent with A.R.S. \u00a7 36-324(A), as amended by Laws 2019, Ch. 172, because the rule does not include the designee of a funeral director as being eligible to request or receive a certified copy of a deceased individual's certificate of death registration . 5. Are the rules enforced as written? Yes ___ No _ X_ If not, please identify the rule(s) that is not enforced as written and provide an explanation of the issues with enforcement. In addition, include the agency's proposal for resolving the issue. Rule Explanation R9-19-212Subsection (B) is enforced according to the documentation from the Department's Human Subjects Review Board that states what information from a birth record a person conducting research is eligible to receive . R9-19-316Subsection (B) is enforced according to the documentation from the Department's Human Subjects Review Board that states what information from a death record a person conducting research is eligible to receive. 6. Are the rules clear, concise, and understandable? Yes ___ No _ X_5If not, please identify the rule(s) that is not clear, concise, or understandable and provide an explanation as to how the agency plans to amend the rule(s) to improve clarity, conciseness, and understandability. Rule Explanation MultipleThe rules would be improved if it were clearer that, except as stated in R9-19-203(B)(2), \"day\" means a calendar day. R9-19-101The rule would be clearer if the definition of \"medical record\" indicated that the term defined in A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2291 is \"medical records.\" R9-19-201The rule typographical errors in subsections (A)(2), (A)(3)(e)(i), and (g), (A)(4), and (B)(2) were corrected. The rule would also be more understandable if the terms \"plurality\" in subsection (A)(3) and \"congenital anomalies\" in subsection (A)(4)(j) were defined or described. R9-19-202 The rule would be clearer if the typographical error in subsection (B)(2) were corrected. R9-19-204The rule would be clearer if \"including\" were replaced with \"such as\" in subsection (A)(6) and the cross-reference in was to R9-19-203 rather than to R9-19-203(A). R9-19-301The rule would be clearer if the phrase \"moved from\" were replaced with \"removed from\" in subsections (A) and (B). R9-19-305The rule would be more understandable if the terms \"plurality\" in subsections (B)(1)(h) and (i) and \"congenital anomalies\" in subsection (B)(2)(p) were defined or described. The rule would be clearer if the cross-reference in subsection (D) were to \"subsections (B)(1)(a) through (f) and (p) through (w) and (2)(a) through (e)\" rather than to \"R9-19-305(B)(1)(a) through (f) and (p) through (w) and (2)(a) through (e).\" R9-19-306Since not every fetal death would be pending investigation, the rule would be improved if the cross-reference in subsection (E) were clarified, rather than being to \"subsections (B), (C), and, if applicable (D).\" The rule would also be clearer if the cross-references in subsections (E)(2) and (3)(b) were revised, rather than being to \"subsection (B), (C), or, if applicable (D)\" in subsection (E)(2) and to in (E)(3)(b). R9-19-309Subsection (E)(1)(g) would be clearer if the subsection included a funeral director in the list of those who could submit a written statement attesting to the validity of the submitted correction. 7. Has the agency received written criticisms of the rules within the last five years? Yes _ X__ No __ If yes, please fill out the table below: Rule Explanation R9-19-201(A)(1), R9-19-204(F)(2)Criticism: The Department received a written criticism of the rule, asking that the city and state of birth of an individual's foreign-born parent be required in the individual's birth record to assist with genealogical research. Response: The Department registers over 81,000 births per year, with approximately 30% having a foreign country included in the birth record for either the individual whose birth is being registered or a parent. In addition, approximately 10% of death records include mention of either death in a foreign country or birth in a foreign country of the decedent. Considering the low frequency with which information in a birth record is requested under R9-19-212(C) for genealogical purposes (less than 5% of birth records) compared with the number of records registered, the Department believes that changing the rule to require inclusion of the city and state of birth for every foreign-born parent would be unduly burdensome to these individuals and to those entering the information into data 6systems. In addition, the Department's rules are compliant with requirements for submitting vital statistics to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), to which every state provides specific information about births and deaths occurring in the state. Making such a change in rule would require a corresponding change to the Department's data system and to the system that transfers data to NCHS and would be extremely costly. The Department does not plan to make the requested change to the rules because the benefit of the change does not outweigh the cost. R9-19-201(A)Criticism: The Department received a written criticism of the rule, stating that the medical and demographic information that a biological mother submits at the time of the birth of a child seems to be unavailable to either the biological mother or father and asking that the information be made available to either. Response: A.R.S. \u00a7 36-324(A) requires \"a local registrar, a deputy registrar, or the state registrar [to] issue a certified copy of a registered certificate, except the portion of the certificate that contains medical information, to any person determined to be eligible to receive\" it. The Department has adopted the recommendations listed in the NAPHSIS Model Law for the fields/data included on a certified copy of a certificate of birth registration. Any changes would require additional costs to the Department and make Arizona's certificate of birth registration inconsistent with national standards. The Department does not plan to change the fields listed on the certified copy of a certificate of birth registration this time. R9-19-315Criticism: The Department received a written criticism of the rule, asking that a person, whose name is in a deceased individual's registered death record as the deceased individual's spouse, only have to prove identity, not produce a marriage certificate, to obtain a certified copy of the deceased individual's certificate of death registration. Response: A spouse arranging a funeral for a deceased individual can receive certified copies of the deceased individual's certificate of death registration from the funeral establishment without producing a marriage certificate. If the same individual requests a copy from the State Registrar or a local registrar, the rules require the person to provide a copy of a marriage certificate. The Department does not believe that this requirement has a negative impact on requestors who cannot provide a marriage certificate because they can often meet eligibility under another category. The Department does not plan to make the requested change to the rules. 8. Economic, small business, and consumer impact comparison : In 2018, there were 81,826 births registered and 60,768 deaths registered. In 2017, there were 81,664 births registered and 57,261 deaths registered. In 2016, there were 84,404 births registered and 56,480 deaths registered. In 2015, there were 85,024 births registered and 54,152 deaths registered. A summary of certificates issues and corrections/amendment made in 2018 is shown below: Description of Services Provided in CY 2018 Counties State Certificates of Birth Registration - Non-certified 195 2,548 Certificates of Death Registration - Non-certified 503 3,816 Certificates of Fetal Death Registration - Non-certified 0 4 Certificates of Birth Registration - Certified 174,147 38,025 Certificates of Delayed Birth Registration - Certified 0 160 Certificates of Death Registration - Certified 129,051 4,096 Certificates of Delayed Birth Registration - Certified 1 3 Certificates of Fetal Death Registration - Certified 258 3 Certificates of Birth Resulting in Stillbirth - Certified 41 07Certificates of No Record 2 804 Amendment/Correction of a Birth Record 12,021 2,774 Amendment/Correction of a Death Record 921 57 Amendment/Correction of a Fetal Death Record 4 0 From funds collected through surcharges from the counties and from certificates issued by the Department in FY 2019, the Department, in compliance with A.R.S. \u00a7 341, deposited approximately $2,661,450 into the vital records electronic systems fund, established by A.R.S. \u00a7 36-341.01, and approximately $445,660 into the general fund. The Department was appropriated $3,637,400 from the vital records electronic systems fund in FY 2018 and $3,630,200 in FY 2019. Expenses for the Bureau of Vital Records from the vital records electronic systems fund were $3,500,157.86 in FY 2018 and, as of July 8, 2019, $2,541,529.44 in FY 2019. Before the exempt rulemaking in 2016 and the regular rulemaking for Article 3 in 2007, the rules in 9 A.A.C. 19 had not been revised since they were adopted in July 31, 1989 and were not consistent with and sometimes contradictory with current statutory language. In 2016, the Department made changes intended to promote administrative efficiency and repealed the antiquated rules, including rules that appeared to prohibit electronic submissions, pursuant to exempt rulemaking authority under Laws 2015, Ch. 197, \u00a7 2. The rulemaking made changes in accordance with the Model State Vital Statistics Act and Regulations, 2011 Revision, which was \"designed to improve the quality and uniformity of State data by establishing standard reporting requirements, definitions, and procedures for registering vital events.\" The Department also made changes in order to comply with the requirements in A.R.S. \u00a7 36-333.02, as amended by Laws 2015, Ch. 197 \u00a7 7, which requires the State Registrar to \"establish documentation requirements for Native Americans who were born before 1970 and who are requesting delayed birth certificates.\" In general, stakeholders for the 2016 rulemaking included the Department, health care providers, funeral establishments, state offices, county partners, Arizona residents and their families, and the general public. The 2016 exempt rulemaking reorganized requirements under Article 1, Administration, moving them under their corresponding category (either Article 2, Vital Records for Birth, or Article 3, Vital Records for Death). The \"Fee Schedule\" Section, R9-19-413, was also renumbered into Article 1. The Department revised and clarified R9-19-104 containing duties of local registrars and required a local registrar to use electronic data systems provided by the Department. Also within Article 1, the Department added Sections for \"Evidentiary Documents\" and \"Review Process,\" and in doing so added and clarified requirements for each. For evidentiary documents submitted in a language other than English, R9-19-102 added requirements for them to be accompanied by an English translation. In Article 2, the Department expanded requirements regarding information contained in an individual's birth record, including supplemental information regarding maternal and paternal demographics, consistent with the Model State Vital Statistics Act and Regulations. The Department added requirements for Native Americans who were born before 1970 and who are requesting a delayed birth certificate pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 36-333.02. Separate Sections were adopted to clarify requirements for a request to establish, correct, amend, or cancel a birth record. 8Requirements were added for amending an individual's registered birth record based on either the individual's adoption or the individual's biological father's voluntary acknowledgement of paternity pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 25- 812. The rulemaking also added requirements concerning a court order or certificate of adoption that names two persons of the same sex as the individual's parents, and for when an individual is requesting to amend their registered birth record based on a change in the individual's sex. The rulemaking also created specific Sections for how to request either a certified or noncertified copy of a certificate of birth registration and a Section regarding who is eligible to do so. Stakeholders under this Article include hospitals, physicians, registered nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, midwives, local registrars, parents and their families, and those eligible for certificates under this Article pursuant to A.A.C. R9-19-210. In Article 3, the Department also clarified the rules from the 2007 rulemaking concerning vital records for death. Requirements regarding information contained in an individual's death record were expanded consistent with the Model State Vital Statistics Act and Regulations. The rulemaking created separate Sections based on the type of registration of death, including a specific Section for when a medical examiner is notified. Requirements concerning disposition-transmit permits were clarified, and Sections for requesting to correct or amend a registered death record were revised. The rulemaking also renumbered and revised the Section concerning \"Disinterment-reinternment Permits,\" and included requirements concerning using a Department-provided format. The Department moved general requirements that had been in Article 4 into specific Sections for how to request either a certified or noncertified copy of a certificate of death registration and who is eligible to do so. Stakeholders under this Article include hospitals, nursing care institutions, hospice inpatient facilities, medical examiners, medical certifiers, funeral establishments, organ procurement organizations, responsible persons for a deceased individual, and those eligible for certificates under this Article pursuant to A.A.C. R9-19-314. The changes in the 2016 exempt rulemaking were intended to reduce regulatory and monetary costs, improve overall processes, promote administrative efficiency, make the rules clear and consistent with current statutes and practices, and reduce costs by allowing for electronic submissions. The Department believes that the rulemaking achieved these objectives. 9. Has the agency received any business competitiveness analyses of the rules ? Yes ___ No _ X_ 10. Has the agency completed the course of action indicated in the agency's previous five-year-review report? Please state what the previous course of action was and if the agency did not complete the action, please explain why not. This is the first five-year-review of the new rules adopted by exempt rulemaking in 2016. 11. A determination that the probable benefits of the rule outweigh within this state the probable costs of the rule, and the rule imposes the least burden and costs to regulated persons by the rule, including paperwork and other compliance costs, necessary to achieve the underlying regulatory objective : The changes in the 2016 exempt rulemaking were intended to reduce monetary and regulatory costs by repealing antiquated rules and making changes intended to allow for electronic submissions, improve processes, and 9enhance clarity and consistency. Except as noted, the Department believes that the rules impose the least burden and costs to persons regulated by the rule, including paperwork and other compliance costs, necessary to achieve the underlying regulatory objective. 12. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal laws? Yes ___ No _ X_ Please provide a citation for the federal law(s). And if the rule(s) is more stringent, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law(s)? Although the Department shares certain information collected under these rules with NCHS, federal laws are not applicable to the rules in 9 A.A.C. 19. 13. For rules adopted after July 29, 2010 that require the issuance of a regulatory permit, license, or agency authorization, whether the rules are in compliance with the general permit requirements of A.R.S. \u00a7 41- 1037 or explain why the agency believes an exception applies: The rules do not require the issuance of a regulatory permit, license, or agency authorization. 14. Proposed course of action If possible, please identify a month and year by which the agency plans to complete the course of action. The Department plans to amend the rules in 9 A.A.C. 19 to address issues identified in this five- year-review report by July 2020.Supplement to the Arizona Administrative Code The official compilation of Arizona Rules Replacement Check List For rules filed in the fourth quarter b etwee n October 1 - December 31 2017Supp. 17-4 Within the stated calenda r quarter, this Title contain s all rul es made, amended, repealed , renumbered, and recodified; or rules that have expired or were terminated due to an agency being eliminated un der sunset law.

The Office of the Secretary of State does not interpret or enforce rules in the Administrative Code. Questio ns about rules should be directed to the state a gency responsible for the prom ulgation of the rule. Scott Cancelosi, Director ADMINISTRATIVE RULES 41-1001(17) states: \"'R ule' means an of general applicability that implements, interprets, or prescr ibes law or policy, or describes the procedures or practice require- ments of an agency.\" THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Arizona Administrative Code is where the official rules of the state of Arizona are publishe d. The Code is the official co di- fication of rules that govern st ate agencies, boards, and commi s- sions. Virtually everything in your life is affected in some wa y by rules published in the Arizona Administrative Code, from the quality of air you breathe to th e licensing of your dentist. Th is chapter is one of more than 230 in the Code compiled in 21 Titl es. ADMINISTRATIVE CODE SUPPLEMENTS Rules filed by an agency to be published in the Administrative Code are updated quart erly. Supplement release dates are printe d on the footers of each chapter: First Quarter: January 1 - March 31 Second Quarter: April 1 - June 30 Third Quarter: July 1 - September 30 Fourth Quarter: October 1 - December 31 For example, the first supplemen t for the first quarter of 2017 is cited as Supp. 17-1. HOW TO USE THE CODE Rules may be in effect before a supplement is released by the Office. Therefore, the user shoul d refer to issues of the Arizo na Administrative Register for re cent updates to rule Sections. ARTICLES AND SECTIONS Rules in chapters are divided into Articles, then Sections. The \"R\" stands for \"rule\" with a seq uential numbering and lettering system separated into subsections. HISTORICAL NOTES AND EFFECTIVE DATES Historical notes inform the user when the last t ime a Section w as updated in the Administrative Code. Be aware, since the Office publishes each quarter by entire chapters, not all Sections are updated by an agency in a supplement release. Many times just one Section or a few Sections may be updated in the entire chapter. ARIZONA REVISED STATUTE REFERENCES The Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) are available online at the Legislature's website, www.azleg.gov . An agency's authority note to make rules is often included at the beginning of a chap ter. Other Arizona statutes may be referenced in rule under the A.R. S. acronym. SESSION LAW REFERENCES Arizona Session Law references in the introduction of a chapter can be found at the Secretary of State's website, www.azsos.gov/services /legislative-filings . EX EMPTIONS F ROM THE APA It is not uncommon for an agency to be exempt from the steps outlined in the rulemaking process as specified in the Arizona Administrative Procedures Act, a lso known as the APA (Arizona Revised Statutes, Title 41, Ch apter 6, Articles 1 through 10). Other agencies may be given an exemption to certain provisions of the Act. An agency's exemption is written in law by the Arizona State Legislature or under a referendum or initiative passed into law by Arizona voters. When an agency files an exempt rulemaking package with our Office it specifies the law exemption in what is called the pre - amble of rulemaking. The preambl e is published in the Arizona Administrative Register online at www.azsos.gov/rules , click on the Administrative Register link. In the Administrative Code the Office includes editor's notes a t the beginning of a chapter indi cating that certain rulemaking Sections were made by exempt r ulemaking. Exempt rulemaking notes are also included in the historical note at the end of a rulemaking Section. The Office makes a distinction to certain exemptions because some rules are made without rec eiving input from stakeholders o r the public. Other exemptions may require an agency to propose exempt rules at a public hearing. EXEMPTIONS AND PAPER COLOR If you are researching rules and come across rescinded chapters on a different paper color, this is because the agency filed a Notice of Exempt Rulemaking. At one time the office published exempt rules on either blue or green paper. Blue meant the au-thority of the exemption was given by the Legislature; green meant the authority was determ ined by a court order. In 2001 th e Office discontinued publishing rule s using these paper colors. PERSONAL USE/COMMERCIAL USE This chapter is posted as a public courtesy online, and is for private use only.

The previous 5YRR in 2014 stated a plan to amend the rules in Chapter 4 by December 2016 to address identified issues, anticipating that the rulemaking moratorium in place at that time would be lifted. A rulemaking moratorium remains in place and due to competing priorities, the Department did not seek an exception until earlier this year. The Department received an exception from the rulemaking moratorium on April 22, 2019 and has begun a rulemaking to address the identified issues with these rules. That rulemaking is also part of the materials provided to the council. Proposed Action The Department has begun a rulemaking to address the issues identified in this report. The Department has submitted a Notice of Final Rulemaking that is currently before the council. If approved, the rulemaking will have an immediate effective date. 1. Has the agency analyzed whether the rules are authorized by statute? Yes. The Department cites to both general and specific statutory authority for these rules. 2. Summary of the agency's economic impact comparison and identification of stakeholders: The Department indicates that the rules in Chapter 4 cover the reporting of pesticide illnesses, blood lead levels, cancer, and birth defects to the Department. In addition, the Department states that each year, it receives approximately 66,000 results of blood level tests on children. The Arizona Cancer Registry within the Department collects and maintains data on the incidence and characteristics of cancer in Arizona. For the last five years, the Department has received an average of approximately 36,000 reports per year from hospitals, approximately 2,600 per year from clinics, approximately 3,540 per year from physicians and other practitioners, and approximately 3,500 per year from pathology laboratories. The Arizona Birth Defects Monitoring Program within the Department collects and maintains data on birth defects, including reports from approximately 60 facilities, and reviews an average of 2,500 medical records per year. Approximately 800 patients who have a birth defect are detected and reported each year. The Department estimates that: The economic impact of Article 2 and Article 3 is consistent with the economic, small business, and consumer impact statements (EIS) prepared in connection with rulemakings for those Articles in 2000; The economic impact of Article 1 and Article 4 is consistent with the EIS prepared in connection with rulemakings for those Articles in 2006; The economic impact of Article 4 is consistent with the EIS prepared in connection with the rulemaking for that Article in 2006; and The economic impact of Article 5 is consistent with the EIS prepared in connection with the rulemaking for that Article in 2007. Stakeholders include the Department, hospitals, clinics, high-risk perinatal practices, genetic testing facilities, clinical laboratories, genetic testing facilities, prenatal diagnostic facilities, physicians, dentists, midwives, registered nurse practitioners, physician assistants, medical examiners, pathology laboratories, cancer clinics, outpatient radiation treatment centers, and the community at large. 3. Has the agency analyzed the costs and benefits of the rulemaking and determined that the rules impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated? Yes, the Department believes that the substantive content of the rules are the minimum necessary to protect health and safety. The Department states that the current rules may impose burdens and costs on regulated communities due to record keeping and reporting requirements. The Department has already submitted a Notice of Final Rulemaking to the Council that addresses these issues. 4. Has the agency received any written criticisms of the rules over the last five years? No. The Department indicates it did not receive any written criticisms on these rules within the last five years. 5. Has the agency analyzed the rules' clarity, conciseness, and understandability, consistency with other rules and statutes, and effectiveness? Yes. For the reasons specified in the report, the Department indicates that the following rules could be amended to improve their clarity, conciseness, and understandability: R9-4-101 (Case Reports); R9-4-404 (Requirements Case Reports and Allowing Review of Hospital Records); R9-4-405 (Data Quality Assurance); of Records; Information Collected); and R9-4-504 (Data Quality Assurance). 6. Has the agency analyzed the current enforcement status of the rules? Yes. For the reason specified in the report, the Department indicates that the following rules are not enforced as written: R9-4-202 (Pesticide Illness Reporting Requirements); R9-4-302 R9-4-403 Sources; Information Submitted to the Department); and R9-4-504 (Data Quality Assurance). 7. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? No. The rules are based on state statutes. There is no corresponding federal law or regulation. 8. For rules adopted after July 29, 2010, do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? Not applicable, as the rules were adopted before July 29, 2010 and do not require the issuance of a regulatory permit, license, or agency authorization. 9. Conclusion The Department has submitted a Notice of Final Rulemaking that is currently before the Council. This rulemaking addresses the issues identified in the 5YRR. These amendments will result in rules that are more clear, concise, understandable, and effective. Council staff recommends approval of this report. E-3 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES (F19-1104) Title 9, Chapter 6, Article 4, AIDS Drug Assistance Program GOVERNOR'S REGULATORY REVIEW COUNCIL ATTORNEY MEMORANDUM - FIVE-YEAR REVIEW REPORT MEETING DATE: November 5, 2019 TO: Members of the Governor's Regulatory Review Council (Council) FROM: Council Staff DATE: September 26, 2019 SUBJECT: DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES (F19-1104) Title 9, Chapter 6, Article 4, AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) ______________________________________________________________________________ Summary : This Five Year Review Report (5YRR) from the Department of Health Services (Department) relates to rules in Title 9, Chapter 6, Article 4 regarding the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP). As the Department states, ADAP is a federally-funded program under the federal Ryan White CARE Act, through which the Department provides or assists eligible HIV- positive Arizona residents with obtaining prescription drugs to prevent the occurrence of, or to alleviate, disabilities from HIV-related diseases, including AIDS. In the previous 5YRR for these rules in 2014, the Department stated that it planned to amend at least two of the rules, R9-6-401 and R9-6-404, by December 31, 2016. The Department states it did not complete this course of action because of competing priorities and uncertainties about the effects of the federal Affordable Care Act on ADAP. Proposed Action: In this report, the Department indicates a number of issues with these rules that need to be addressed. To that end, the Department has already filed a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and anticipates submitting a Notice of Final Rulemaking to the Council by December 2019. 1. Has the agency analyzed whether the rules are authorized by statute? Yes. The Agency cites to applicable general and specific statutory authority for these rules. 2. Summary of the agency's economic impact comparison and identification of stakeholders: In fiscal year 2018, the Department received $10,212,613 in federal funds and $750,000 in state funds for ADAP. The Department provided HIV-related prescription drugs for approximately 2,700 individuals with these funds. The Department determined that the economic impact of Article 4 does differ moderately from what was originally determined by the economic, small business and consumer impact statement (EIS) from the most recent rulemaking in 2007. The following changes described below may have an economic impact on regulated persons: 1. The Department determined that the rules would be more effective if it used \"annual household income\" rather than \"annual family income\" in describing eligibility. 2. The Department believes the rules would be more effective if individuals enrolled in ADAP could be diagnosed with HIV by a physician outside of Arizona. The current rules require that individuals be diagnosed only by Arizona-licensed physicians. 3. The Department believes that the rules would be more effective if a Department-wide consolidated application form were adopted, thus reducing the administrative burden on applicants. 4. The adoption of the federal Affordable Care Act had a direct effect on many HIV-positive residents of Arizona. The premiums and copayments were unaffordable which caused many to remain uninsured. Consequently, ADAP began using funds to assist eligible applicants for ADAP to pay premiums, deductibles, and copayments, which allowed individuals to obtain the necessary HIV-related drugs through pharmacies, paid for through health insurance prescription benefits. Drugs not on the formulary of the health insurance plan but on the ADAP formulary were also covered through ADAP. This process is not part of the current rules. The rules would be more effective if they were revised to include this process. The stakeholders include the Department, primary health care service providers, pharmacies, health insurance providers, HIV-positive individuals, and the public. 3. Has the agency analyzed the costs and benefits of the rulemaking and determined that the rules impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated? The Department believes that the substantive content of the rules is the minimum necessary to protect public health and safety. However, the current rules may impose burdens and costs on regulated persons due to the issues identified in the section above. The Department has begun a rulemaking to address the issues identified in this report, and anticipates filing a Notice of Final Rulemaking by December 2019. 4. Has the agency received any written criticisms of the rules over the last five years? No. The Department has not received any written criticisms of the rules over the last five years. 5. Has the agency analyzed the rules' clarity, conciseness, and understandability, consistency with other rules and statutes, and effectiveness? Yes. The Department indicates that a number of the rules are not clear, concise, understandable, and/or effective. The Department states how the rules could be improved, and as discussed above, has already filed a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to address these rules. It expects to submit a Notice of Final Rulemaking to the Council by December 2019. 6. Has the agency analyzed the current enforcement status of the rules? Yes. The Department indicates that the following rules are not enforced as written, as detailed in Items 3 and 5 of the report: R9-6-403 (Eligibility Requirements); Services); and R9-6-409 (Drug Prescription and Distribution Requirements). 7. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? ADAP is funded through federal funds under the Ryan White CARE Act, Pub.L. 101-381, 104 Stat. 579, enacted August 18, 1990 and follows the requirements of the federal funding agency. The rules also impose the same requirements as the applicable provisions of Medicare Part D for acquiring prescription drugs through Medicare. However, the rules in Article 4 are based on state law. 8. For rules adopted after July 29, 2010, do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? Not applicable. The rules were adopted prior to July 29, 2010. 9. Conclusion The Department has analyzed the rules in Title 9, Chapter 6, Article 4 and identified issues with the rules that need to be addressed. As discussed above, the Department has already initiated the rulemaking process to amend these rules. As amended, the rules would be clear, concise, understandable, and effective. Council staff recommends approval of this report. 1 Arizona Department of Health Services Five-Year -Review Report Title 9. Health Services Chapter 6. Department of Health Services Communicable Diseases and Infestations Article 4. AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) August 2019 1. Authorization of the rule by existing statutes General Statutory Authority: A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 36-136(I)(1) 2. The objective of each rule: The purpose of the rules is to establish requirements related to the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), a primarily federally -funded program under the Ryan White CARE Act , through which the Department provides or assists eligible HIV-infected residents of Arizona to obtain prescription drugs to prevent the occurrence of, or to alleviat e, disability from HIV -related diseases, including AIDS. Rule Objective R9-6-401 To define terms used in the Article so that a reader can consistently interpret requirements. R9-6-402 To inform the public that ADAP is not an entitlement program and that ADAP ceases to provide drugs when ADAP funding is exhausted or terminated. R9-6-403 To establish the eligibility requirements for ADAP participation . R9-6-404 To establish what an individual is required to submit to the Department when applying for participation in ADAP and what information the primary care provider of an applicant is required to provide. R9-6-405 To establish the process by which the Department will approve or deny ADAP participation to an applicant and under what circumstances an applicant may be granted provisional enrollment. R9-6-406 To establish requirements for notifying the Department of a change in an enrolled individual's primary care provider or of circumstances that may affect the enrolled individual's eligibility to continue participation in ADAP. To specify the requirements for notifying the pharmacy dispensing a drug regarding a change in a prescribed drug. R9-6-407 To establish requirements for an enrolled individual to con tinue participation in ADAP . To specify the Department's processes for determining eligibility for continuing enrollment in ADAP and for notifying an individual of the Department's decision . R9-6-408 To establish the circumstances under which the Department may terminate an individual's participation in ADAP or approval of a restricted drug for the individual, and the process by which the Department will notify the individual of termination. R9-6-409 To establish the process by which an individual enrolled in ADAP may receive drugs, 2 including restricted drugs, through ADAP. R9-6-410 To specify that the Department will comply with all applicable federal and state laws relating to protecting confidential information obtained by the Department while administering ADAP . 3. Are the rules effective in achieving their objectives? Yes _ __ No _ X_ If not, please identify the rule(s) that is not effective and provide an explanation for why the rule (s) is not effective. Rule Explanation R9-6-401 The rule define s \"annual family inc ome,\" and this term is used in rules for determining eligibility. The Arizona Department of Economic Security (DES) no longer uses the concept of annual family income when determining eligibility for assistance, instead using \"mod ified adjusted gross income\" as reported in income tax filings to the IRS . The rules would be more effective if the term \"annual household income\" were defined to include adjusted gross income, as reported in income tax filings, adjusted to meet the Depart ment's and ADAP's needs . The rule also specif ies that a physician, physician, or registered nurse practitioner be licensed under A.R.S. Title 32. However, some individuals enrolled in ADAP may have been diagnosed with HIV infection by a physician, registered nurse practitioner, or physician assistant outside of Arizona or live in areas of the State in which it is more efficient to obtain health services from a primary care provider in a neighboring state. The rule would be more effective if th ese discrepanc ies were addressed. R9-6-403 The rule would be more effective if it used \"annual household income\" rather than \"annual family income\" in describing eligibility and included that an individual with an annual household income less than or equal to 400% of the poverty level is eligible to enroll in ADAP. The rule would also be more effective if other conditions were included as grounds for eligibility , such as unaffordable h ealth insurance. The effectiveness of the rule would also be increased if it acknowledged that health care may be obtained t hrough a clinic operated by a sovereign tribal nation , as well as through the Indian Health Service. R9-6-404 To reduce the administrative burden for applicants, the Depart ment and the administrators of other Ryan White programs have developed a single application form that allows an individual to be assessed for eligibility for any Ryan White HIV-related services, including ADAP. The rule would be more effective if it included the elements in this consol idated application form and specified that the application be in a \"Department -provided format \" to allow for electronic submission. In this consolidated application form, an applicant would provide other mechanisms for the Department or a vendor pharmacy t o communicate with the applicant and would include information specific to any health insurance coverage the applicant may have or be eligible for , such as health insurance under a spouse's health coverage, a domestic partnership agreement, COBRA, the Affo rdable Care Act, or other mechanism . The rule would also be more effective if the rule included information related to annual household income rather than annual family income and required documentation of eligibility or ineligibility for coverage based on the applicant's annual household income . Rather than requiring a health care provider to state the dates and result of laboratory tests, the rule should require a copy of the laboratory report. R9-6-405 Upon the adoption of the Affordable Care Act, more individuals became eligible for health insurance coverage through which they could obtain drugs to treat HIV or HIV -related infections. However, for many HIV -infected residents of Arizona, the premiums and copayments were unaffordable, and they remained uninsured. To leverage scarce ADAP resources and enable as many HIV -infected residents of Arizona as possible to obtain necessary HIV -related drugs, ADAP, with the encouragement of the federal -funding 3 agency , began using some ADAP funds to assist eligible applicants for ADAP to pay health insurance premiums, deductibles, or copayments, allowing the individual to obtain necessary HIV -related drugs through pharmacies, paid for through health insurance prescript ion benefits. Drugs not on the formulary of the health insurance plan but on the ADAP formulary were also covered through ADAP . This process is not part of the current rule, which would be more effective if revised to include it. R9-6-406 The rule would b e more effective if it contained requirements for notifying the Department that an enrolled individual obtained health insurance coverage other than through AHCCCS, the Indian Health Service, or the Veterans Health Administration . The rule would be just as effective and less burdensome if requirements for notifying the Department of a change in primary care provider were removed. R9-6-407 Federal requirements related to funding for ADAP now require annual renewal during the birth month of an enrolled indiv idual, rather than a 24 -month re-enrollment process tied to the date of initial enrollment. The rule would be more effective if the rule reflected this schedule and process, which is currently being used by ADAP . The rule would also be just as effective and less burdensome if requirements related to a change of address were simplified and if requirements for primary care providers were removed. The rule would be more effective if it included requirements related to an enrolled individual becoming eligible for other health insurance coverage. R9-6-408 The rule would be more effective if it reflected that an enrolled individual may also be obtaining HIV-related drugs through a pharmacy other than the vendor pharmacy and may obtain through ADAP a drug not on the formulary of the enrolled individual's health plan. R9-6-409 The rule would be more effective if it included the process by which an eligible individual may obtain HIV -related drugs through a pharmacy other t han the vendor pharmacy and reflected that the prescription orders of primary care providers in neighboring states who are not licensed under A.R.S. Title 32 are honored when providing drugs in the ADAP formulary for their patients. The rule would also be more effective if it more accurately included methods by which an enrolled individual may obtain a drug not on the formulary of the enrolled individual's health plan or a drug not on the ADAP formulary. 4. Are the rules consistent with other rules and s tatutes? Yes _ X_ No __ If not, please identify the rule(s) that is not consistent. Also, provide an explanation and identify the provisions that are not consistent with the rule. Rule Explanation 5. Are the rules enforced as written? Yes __ No _ X_ If not, please identify the rule(s) that is not enforced as written and provide an explanation of the issues with enforcement. In addition, include the agency's proposal for resolving the issue. Rule Explanation R9-6-403 The rule is enforced consistent with the use of annual household income and with an assessment of the adequacy and affordability of health insurance coverage. R9-6-404 The rule is enforced consistent with the use of the consolidated application form and with the submission of documentation of eligibility or ineligibility for coverage, as described 4 under paragraph 3. In addition, ADAP accepts documentation of HIV infectio n and prescription orders from primary care providers licensed in other states when providing drugs in the ADAP formulary for their patients. R9-6-405 The rule is enforced as described under paragraph 3 . R9-6-406 The rule is enforced as described under paragraph 3 . R9-6-407 The rule is enforced as described under paragraph 3 . R9-6-408 The rule is enforced as described under paragraph 3 . R9-6-409 The rule is enforced as described under paragraph 3. 6. Are the rules clear, concise, and understandable? Yes ___ No _ X_ If not, please identify the rule(s) that is not clear, concise, or understandable and provide an explanation as to how the agency plans to amend the rule(s) to improve clarity, conciseness, and understandability. Rule Explanation R9-6-401 The rules would be more concise if unnecessary definitions were removed. For example, \"confirmatory test ,\" \"diagnosis ,\" \"guardian ,\" \"treatment\" are defined in R9 -6-101, which contains definitions applicable to the Chapter , including Article 4. The term \"business day\" is defined in the rule but has the same meaning as , and could be replaced with, \"working day\" as defined in R9 -6-101. In the definition of \"support services,\" the defined term should not be used as part of the definition in subsection (60)(d). The terms \"physician,\" \"physician assistant,\" while also defined in R9 -6-101, need to remain in the rule but have their meanings clarified. The Department also accepts a diagnosis of H IV infection, as well as accepting a prescription order, from a physician, registered nurse practitioner, or physician assistant licensed in a state other than Arizona. In addition, the definition of \"physician\" in R9 -6-101 includes individuals licensed un der A.R.S. Title 32, Chapters 14 or 29, wh o would not be included in the definition of \"physician\" as the term is used in the Article. Because of a change made in how eligibility is determined, the term \"annual family income\" is no longer needed and should be replaced with a definition of \" annual household income.\" Other definitions, such as \"case management services,\" \"community service organization,\" and definitions only used in terms that are no longer needed, should also be removed. In additi on, medical services to a person living with HIV may be provided by a specialist in HI V-related care, so the term \"primary care provider\" may be confusing. The rule would be clearer if the term were replaced with another term that would better include spec ialists in if it used \"annual household income\" rather than \"annual family income.\" R9-6-403 The rule would be clearer if it described a \"veteran\" as an individual who has served in the United States Armed Forces , rather than defining the term. R9-6-404 The rule would be clearer if it recognized that a person other than a community service organization may agree to receive written communications for an applicant . The rule would be more concise if subsection (A)(1)(l) and (3) were removed as unnecessary and if requirements in subsection (A)(9) were consolidated . R9-6-405 The clarity of the rule would be improved if the word \"the\" were placed after the phrase \"as required in subsection (F) to the Department before\" in subsection (G). The rule would be improved if the rule used the term \"working day,\" as defined in R9-6- 101, rather than \"business day\" for the same period of time . R9-6-406 The rule would be improved if the word \"deletes\" were replaced with the word \"removes\" in subsection (A)(2). R9-6-407 The rule would be clearer if it included provisions similar to those in R9 -6-405(D) for applicable enrolled individuals completing the continuing enrollment process. R9-6-408 The rule would be clearer if the term \"enrolled individual' were used in subsection s (A) and (C) rather than \"individual.\" R9-6-409 The rule would be clearer if subsection (A)(1)(a) read \"For each drug on the ADAP formulary.\" The rule would also be more concise if subsections (A)(3), (B), and (C) were removed as unnecessary. 7. Has the agency received written criticisms of the rules with in the last five years? Yes ___ No _ X_ If yes, please fill out the table below: Rule Explanation 8. Economic, small business, and consumer impact comparison : A.R.S. \u00a7 36 -136(I)(1) requires the Department to make rules defining and prescribing \"reasonably necessary measures for detecting, reporting, preventing, and controlling communicable and preventable diseases\" and prescribing measures \"reasonably required to prevent the occ urrence of, or to seek early detection and alleviation of, disability, insofar as possible, from communicable or preventable diseases.\" The rules in 9 A.A.C. 6, Article 4, implement A.R.S. \u00a7 36 -136(I)(1) by establishing requirements related to ADAP. ADAP is a primarily federally -funded program , under the Ryan White CARE Act, through which the Department provides or assists eligible persons living with HIV, who are residents of Arizona , to obtain prescription drugs to prevent the occurrence of, or to alleviate disability and death from HIV -related diseases, including AIDS . The Department received $9,862,981 in federal funds for ADAP in federal fiscal year 2017 and $10,213,613 in federal funds for ADAP in federal fiscal year 2018. For each of these years, the Department received $750,000 from the state budget for ADAP. With these funds, the Department provided HIV -related prescription drugs for approximately 2,600 individuals during 2017 a nd 2,700 individuals during 2018. The ADAP rules in Article 4 were last revised in a rulemaking that was effective in November 2007, in which all but one Section were substantially revised. The economic impact of the unrevised Section, R9 -6-402, is at most minimal because the objective of the Section is to notify the public that ADAP ceases to provide drugs when ADAP funding is exhausted or terminated. The 2007 rulem aking included changes to address the ability of eligible elderly and disabled individuals to obtain prescription drugs under Medicare Part D through prescription drug plans under contract to Medicare. Those who qualify for a full low -income subsidy throu gh Medicare did not pay for Medicare Part D drug coverage and were excluded from ADAP participation. Changes were also 6 made to address the Department's using a vendor /contract pharmacy for drug distribution and to allow individuals eligible for, but choos ing not to use, Veterans Health Administration benefits for prescription drugs to enroll in ADAP. Lastly, the rulemaking added definitions, clarified the application process and notification requirements, and defined the requirements for distribution of p rescription drugs, including those prescription drugs that are available through ADAP only on a case -by-case basis. An Economic, Small Business, and Consumer Impact Statement (EIS) was submitted with the 2007 rulemaking, and designated annual costs/revenue s as minimal when less than $1,000, moderate when between $1,000 and $10,000, and substantial when greater than $10,000. The 2007 EIS stated that the rules may impose a minimal burden on primary care providers when requesting a restricted drug for an indiv idual enrolled in ADAP and for notifying the vendor pharmacy when discontinuing a drug for an individual enrolled in ADAP. The 2007 EIS also stated that the rules may impose a minimal cost on community service organizations and case managers for providing documentation for individuals applying for or enrolled in ADAP, for assisting individuals to apply for ADAP or to continue enrollment, and for notifying the Department of a change that may affect the eligibility of an individual enrolled in ADAP. The 200 7 EIS further stated that the Department may bear a minimal cost for providing education about and enforcing the rules, and that HIV -infected individuals applying for participation in ADAP may incur a minimal cost from the requirement that the applicant su bmit residency information and information about eligibility for the Medicare low -income subsidy. The 2007 EIS stated that the rules may provide minimal benefits to the Department, primary care providers, community service organizations and case managers, HIV-infected individuals applying for participation in ADAP, and society in general. The Department believes that the economic impact of these changes to the rules in Article 4 remains unchanged from the 2007 estimates. Since the rules were adopted, howev er, there have been many changes in the mechanism s by which an individual may obtain coverage for prescription drugs. With the advent of the Affordable Care Act, individuals may also obtain third -party insurance coverage at little or no cost, which may cover prescription drugs. Conversely, an individual may be eligible for third -party insurance coverage , but the insurance coverage may be unaffordable or not cover drugs prescribed for the individual but available on the ADAP formulary. These changes, as well as other changes described in paragraphs 3, 5, and 6, were not applicable when the rules were adopted, were not included in the 2007 EIS, and may have an economic effect on persons affected by the rul es. 9. Has the agency received any business competitiveness analyses of the rules ? Yes ___ No _ X_ 10. Has the agency completed the course of action indicated in the agency's previous five -year -review report? Please state what the previous course of action was and if the agency did not complete the action, please explain why not. The 201 4 five-year-review report stated a plan to amend at least two of the rules, R9 -6-401 and R9 -6-404, by December 31, 2016. While this plan was not completed by that date due t o competing priorities and uncertainties about the effects of the Affordable Care Act on ADAP, the Department has begun a rulemaking to address the identified issues with these rules . 7 11. A determination that the probable benefits of the rule outweigh wit hin this state the probable costs of the rule, and the rule imposes the least burden and costs to regulated persons by the rule, including paperwork and other compliance costs, necessary to achieve the underlying regulatory objective : The Department believes that the substantive content of the rules are th e minimum necessary to protect health and safety . However, the current rules may impose burdens and costs on the regulated communities due to the issues identified in the paragraphs above. 12. Are t he rules more stringent than corresponding federal laws? Yes ___ No _ X_ Please provide a citation for the federal law (s). And if the rule (s) is more stringent, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law (s)? ADAP is mostly funded through federal funds under the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act (Ryan White CARE Act), Pub.L. 101 -381, 104 Stat. 576, enacted August 18, 1990, and follows requirements of the federal funding agency. The rules als o impose the same requirements on participants as the applicable provisions of Medicare Part D ( e.g. 20 CFR Part 418, Subpart D) for acquiring prescription drugs through plans under contract to Medicare. However , the rules in Article 4 are based on a state statute, rather than federal regulation . 13. For rules adopted after July 29, 2010 that require the issuance of a regulatory permit, license, or agency authorization, whether the rules are in compliance with the general permit requirements of A.R.S. \u00a7 41- 1037 or explain why the agency believes an exception applies: Not applicable, as the rules were adopted before July 29, 2010 . 14. Proposed course of action If possible, please identify a month and year by which the agency plans to complete the course of action. The Department has begun a rulemaking to address the issues identified in this report and has filed a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking , which will be published in September 2019 . The Department anticipates filing a Notice of Final Rulemaking by December 2019. 1 TITLE 9. HEALTH SERVICES CHAPTER 6. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND INFESTATIONS ARTICLE 4. AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (ADAP) ECONOMIC, SMALL BUSINESS, AND CONSUMER IMPACT STATEMENT 2 ECONOMIC, SMALL BUSINESS, AND CONSUMER IM PACT STATEMENT Arizona Department of Health Services Chapter 6. Communicable Diseases and Infestations Article 4. AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) A.A.C. R9 -6-401 through rulemaking. A.R.S. \u00a7 36 -136(H)(1) requires the Arizona Department of Health Services (Department) to make rules defining and prescribing \"reasonably necessary measures for detecting, reporting, preventing, and controlling communicable and preventable diseases\" and prescribing measures \"reasonably required to prevent the occurrence of, or to seek early detection and alleviation of, disability, insofar as possible, from communicable or preventable diseases.\" Arizona Administrative Code Title 9, Chapter 6, Article 4 implements A.R.S. \u00a7 36 -136(H)(1) b y establishing rules related to the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), a primarily federally -funded program, through which the Department provides prescription drugs to HIV -infected residents of Arizona to prevent the occurrence of or to seek alleviation of disability from HIV -related diseases, including AIDS. Beginning in January 2006, elderly and disabled individuals who are eligible for enrollment in Medicare are able to obtain prescription drugs under Medicare Part D through prescription drug plans un der contract to Medicare. Those who qualify for a full low -income subsidy through Medicare do not pay for Medicare Part D drug coverage. Since ADAP is the payor of last resort for HIV -related prescription drugs for those enrolled in ADAP, the current rul es are being amended to require those eligible for Medicare to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan and apply for a low -income subsidy for prescription drugs. The new rules exclude those eligible to receive a full Medicare low -income subsidy for pr escription drugs from enrolling in ADAP. The changes also add definitions, clarify the application process and notification requirements, and define the requirements for distribution of prescription drugs, including those prescription drugs that are avail able through ADAP only on a case -by-case basis. Many of the changes in this rulemaking reflect changes that have already been made in the operation of the program due to the implementation of Medicare Part D and the use of a vendor pharmacy for drug distribution or to address issues described in the Five -Year -Review Report approved by the Governor's Regulatory Review Council in October 2004 . All changes conform to current rulemaking format and style requirements of the Governor's Regulatory Review Council and the Office of the Secretary of State. 2.

The purpose of the program is to help assure that HIV - infected individuals have access to prescription drugs that can slow the progression of HIV infection and prevent or treat HIV -related diseases. During 2006, the ADAP p rogram served an average of 800 HIV-infected individuals per month. Each month the Department receives approximately 40 applications for initial enrollment in ADAP and conducts a review of approximately 125 individuals for continuing enrollment. Since the current rules were adopted, several changes have occurred that have caused the operation of the ADAP program to become inconsistent with the current rules. For instance, the current rules specify that to be eligible for ADAP an individual must be ineligi ble for benefits available through the Veterans Health Administration. However, current federal ADAP requirements allow an individual enrolled in ADAP to be eligible for, but choose not to use, Veterans Health Administration benefits to receive prescripti on drugs. In January 2006, the federal government implemented Medicare Part D, which adds a prescription drug benefit to Medicare coverage. Therefore, elderly and disabled individuals who are eligible for enrollment in Medicare prescription drug plans ar e able to obtain prescription drugs through Medicare. During 2006, approximately 400 individuals enrolled in ADAP became eligible to enroll in a Medicare drug plan, and approximately 200 were eligible for a full low -income subsidy. Since ADAP is a payor -of-last-resort for HIV -related prescription drugs for those enrolled in ADAP, the program does not provide prescription drugs to an individual who can obtain these prescription drugs for a minimal co -pay through Medicare with a low -income subsidy, and thes e 200 individuals became ineligible for ADAP. The current rules do not include eligibility for a Medicare low -income subsidy as a factor in determining eligibility for ADAP. In April 2006, the Department began using a vendor pharmacy for the distribution of prescription drugs. Until then, the Department had purchased HIV -related prescription drugs through a drug wholesaler, stored the inventory of prescription drugs, and distributed the prescription drugs to individuals enrolled in ADAP. Approximately 43 ,500 prescription orders for 100 drugs were filled each year. The Department's decision to use a vendor pharmacy was based on the increasing complexity in the logistics of drug storage and distribution, a desire to improve consumer access to the drugs by increasing the number of options an enrolled individual has to fill a prescription, and to enable an enrolled individual to talk with a pharmacist about a drug when filling a prescription. The changes in the operation of the ADAP program resulting from cha nges in federal requirements for ADAP, the implementation of Medicare Part D, and the Department's use of a vendor pharmacy are 7 reflected in this rulemaking. Since the Department is already carrying out the provisions specified in the rulemaking, the Depa rtment anticipates that the Department will bear a minimal cost associated with enforcing and providing education on the new rules. The Department also expects to benefit to a minimal degree from having the rules agree with how the program is operating be cause less staff time will be spent explaining why they do not agree. The Department also anticipates a significant benefit from the clarity of the rules, especially in the requirements for applying for enrollment, the distribution of drugs, and the denia l or termination of enrollment, because less time will be spent by the Department's staff reviewing incomplete or inadequate applications, answering calls from enrolled individuals or their representatives asking about when they will receive their prescrip tion drugs, investigating and documenting instances of possible fraud, and other such activities. Small businesses Small businesses affected by the rule changes include the practices of physicians, registered nurse practitioners, and physician assistants; the pharmacy under contract with the Department to distribute prescription drugs to individuals enrolled in ADAP; and community service organizations. Vendor Pharmacy - The current rules specify the requirements for the Department's distribution of drugs a nd are in conflict with the Department's current use of a pharmacy under contract with the Department to distribute prescription drugs to individuals enrolled in ADAP. The requirements for the vendor pharmacy are specified in a contract between the Depart ment and the vendor pharmacy, but those contract provisions that affect physicians, registered nurse practitioners, physician assistants providers, or individuals applying for or enrolled in ADAP are also specified in this rulemaking. The vendor pharmacy is required to maintain a supply of prescription drugs available for distribution, receive prescription orders from primary care providers, verify the enrollment status of an individual for which a prescription drug is requested and the address to which th e prescription drug is to be sent, distribute a prescription drug within three business days, and notify the Department if the vendor pharmacy receives a request for a prescription drug for an individual not enrolled in ADAP. The vendor pharmacy maintains a formulary of approximately 160 prescription drugs. In the past 12 months, the vendor pharmacy has filled approximately 50,000 prescriptions for approximately 1,350 unduplicated enrolled individuals, serving approximately 800 enrolled individuals per mo nth. Most of the prescriptions are mailed to the enrolled individual. When the vendor pharmacy has a prescription for an individual actively enrolled in ADAP and has had contact with the enrolled individual or the enrolled individual's representative, th e enrolled individual's prescription is generally mailed within 48 hours. The requirements for the vendor pharmacy in this rulemaking provide a minimal benefit to the vendor pharmacy because they clarify for the affected persons what the vendor pharmacy i s required by 8 contract to do, so the expectations of affected persons will be more realistic and staff of the vendor pharmacy will spend less time explaining the requirements. Primary Care Providers - Primary care providers are the physicians, registered n urse practitioners, and physician assistants who treat individuals for HIV infection. Under the current rules, primary care providers are required to complete a portion of the application for initial or continuing enrollment of an individual in ADAP, info rm the Department within 30 days of changes that may affect an individual's enrollment in ADAP, notify the Department when an enrolled individual changes to another primary care provider, and write prescription orders for the quantity of a drug supplied by a manufacturer. Under this rulemaking, a primary care provider is still required to complete a portion of the application for initial or continuing enrollment of an individual in ADAP, but is also required to acknowledge the requirement to notify the Dep artment upon learning that an enrolled individual has changed to a different primary care provider or has died. The Department estimates that it may take a primary care provider an extra few minutes to read the acknowledgement. The new rules also clarify that, when an individual enrolled in ADAP changes to a new primary care provider, the new primary care provider is required to complete a portion of a Department -provided form to identify the primary care provider, update laboratory test results and prescr ibed drugs ordered by the new primary care provider, and make clear the primary care provider's requirement to notify the Department upon learning that an enrolled individual has changed to a different primary care provider or has died. The Department est imates that it may take a new primary care provider approximately 15 to 20 minutes to complete the form. Fewer than 40 individuals enrolled in ADAP change to a different primary care provider each year, primarily because there are a limited number of prim ary care providers with specialized knowledge on treating HIV -infected individuals, and most of these primary care providers practice at a Ryan White -funded clinic. The Department anticipates that the requirement for the new primary care provider to compl ete a portion of the Department -provided form will impose a minimal cost on a primary care provider. The current rules not only require a primary care provider to notify the Department in writing each time the primary care provider learns that an enrolled individual has died or there is a change in primary care provider but to provide a release signed by the enrolled individual authorizing the Department to contact and exchange information with the new primary care provider. The new rules allow a primary c are provider to notify the Department in writing or by telephone and do not require a signed release form, saving the primary care provider at least 15 to 20 minutes each time either of these events occur. The new rules also require notification for eithe r event to be made within 14 days of the primary care provider learning of them, rather than within 30 days for a death and 7 days for a change in primary care provider as under the current rules, further simplifying the notification process. Under the ne w rules, a 9 primary care provider will also no longer be required to notify the Department of other changes that may affect an individual's eligibility for ADAP, such as when the enrolled individual's income increases above 300% of the federal poverty level or the enrolled individual becomes enrolled in AHCCCS or has another third -party payor. Approximately 25 enrolled individuals die each year, and the Department is notified of these deaths by a variety of persons, including primary care providers or clinic s, case managers or community service organizations, friends or relatives of the enrolled individual, and the vendor pharmacy. During 2006, fewer than five primary care providers notified the Department of a change in primary care providers or of a death of an individual enrolled in ADAP. Over 90% of these notifications were by telephone, rather than in writing. Only one primary care provider notified the Department of any other changes. The Department has no record of ever receiving a signed release fo rm from a primary care provider. Therefore, the Department anticipates that the Departmental notification requirements in the new rules will provide a minimal benefit to a primary care provider. The Department's use of a vendor pharmacy for the distributi on of prescription drugs to individuals enrolled in ADAP also provides a benefit to primary care providers. The current rules were developed to accommodate prescription drugs being distributed by the Department to an individual enrolled in ADAP. The rule s require a primary care provider to write a prescription order for the quantity of a drug packaged in the original container by the manufacturer because the Department is not a pharmacy and cannot split the manufacturer's packaged drugs into smaller porti ons. The Department is also unable to accept a prescription order by telephone. The new rules allow a primary care provider to issue written or oral prescription orders to the vendor pharmacy for ADAP -supplied drugs, just as they would issue prescription orders to any pharmacy for drugs supplied through other sources, simplifying the process for primary care providers. Thus, these changes to the rules may provide a minimal benefit to a primary care provider. The new rules require a primary care provider to notify the vendor pharmacy when discontinuing a drug for an individual enrolled in ADAP. Once a primary care provider establishes a drug regimen that is appropriate for an HIV -infected individual, the drug regimen may not be changed for several years. The Department anticipates that, in the infrequent circumstance when a primary care provider changes a drug regimen, the primary care provider may satisfy this requirement by telling the vendor pharmacy while ordering a new drug that the new drug is repla cing the discontinued drug. The Department estimates that this new notification requirement will add little time to that being spent by a primary care provider and impose minimal costs to the primary care provider. The Department currently has a process t hrough which primary care providers may request certain very expensive drugs for an ADAP -enrolled individual through ADAP. These restricted drugs are now 10 approved on a case -by-case basis for individuals enrolled in ADAP. Although the process is not speci fied in the current rules , the process has been in place for several years and is specified in this rulemaking. The Department estimates that it takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes to fill out the restricted drug -request form, gather supporting documents , and send the form and documents to the Department. In the past two years, 15 requests for a restricted drug have been received by the Department, and the Department has approved 14 of them. The Department anticipates that this requirement in the new r ules may impose a minimal time cost on a primary care provider who requests approval of a restricted drug for an individual enrolled in ADAP. Community Service Organizations and Case Managers - There are only approximately 10 community service organization s in Arizona that interact on a regular basis with ADAP, although these community service organizations have established linkages with hundreds of other organizations that may provide some of the services required by individuals served by a community servi ce organization. Of these 10 community service organizations, eight receive funding through the Department under the Ryan White CARE Act. The other two receive Ryan White funding through the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, which receives Rya n White funding directly from the federal government. While community service organizations and case managers employed by community service organizations are not mentioned in the current rules, they play an important role in assisting and supporting the in dividuals who apply for or are enrolled in ADAP. Their roles in the services provided to HIV -infected individuals are specified in the federal Ryan White CARE Act, through which the ADAP program is funded. The new rules specify which ADAP -related activit ies that community service organizations are already performing, such as receiving written communications for an HIV - infected individual or issuing a statement to verify an individual's Arizona residency, may be used by the HIV -infected individual to suppo rt eligibility for ADAP. The new rules also specify that a case manager is required to notify the Department of changes that may affect an individual's eligibility for ADAP. Case managers are in a unique position to know of these changes because they ass ist 80% of the individuals who apply for ADAP with filling out forms and getting the services the individuals need. The Department interacts on a regular basis with approximately 20 case managers. During 2006, the Department received over 10,000 notifica tions from case managers. An HIV -infected individual's case manager may also issue a statement to verify an individual's Arizona residency and, when assisting the individual to complete a form to establish that the individual has no steady source of incom e, is required to attest that information on the form is correct to the best of the case manager's knowledge. During 2006, the Department received approximately 600 such forms from individuals applying for enrollment in ADAP, all signed by case managers. The Department estimates that each case manager may complete approximately 30 of these forms per year. The Department anticipates that fulfilling these 11 requirements may take a community service organization or case manager approximately 15 to 20 minutes each time the community service organization or case manager issues a statement to verify an individual's Arizona residency, notifies the Department of a change in an enrolled individual's status, or assists in completing a form to establish that the indiv idual has no steady source of income. The Department estimates that these requirements will impose a minimal time cost on a community service organization or case manager. The Department also anticipates that the new rules will provide a minimal benefit to a community service organization or case manager minimal since they clarify requirements and provide additional documentation options for individuals applying for enrollment or continuing enrollment in ADAP, which may result in a case manager being able to complete application forms with the applicants or enrolled individuals in a more efficient manner. HIV -infected Individuals The current rules specify the eligibility requirements for individuals to enroll in ADAP, the information an individual must sub mit to the Department to enroll in ADAP and to continue enrollment in ADAP, the notification requirements for changes that may affect an individual's eligibility, and how the Department is required to distribute drugs for enrolled individuals. The current rules also specify that an individual is required to give the Department permission to contact AHCCCS regarding the individual's eligibility for AHCCCS. Several things have happened in the past year that affect those individuals who may apply for enrollm ent in ADAP. These include the Department's initiating the use of a vendor pharmacy for drug distribution and changes to the Medicare program to allow individuals eligible for Medicare to obtain drugs through Medicare drug plans. The new rules clarify the eligibility requirements for ADAP, delineating what constitutes \"inadequate health insurance\" and make the ADAP eligibility requirements specified in rule conform to the federal ADAP requirements. They allow an individual to enroll in ADAP even if the in dividual is eligible to receive HIV -related drugs through the Veteran's Administration but chooses not to. This change affects approximately 2 individuals per year who apply for enrollment in ADAP but are eligible to receive benefits through the Veteran's Administration. Because of the changes in Medicare, the new rules require an individual applying for ADAP to enroll in a Medicare drug plan and be ineligible for a full low-income subsidy through Medicare, submitting documentation to verify Medicare drug plan enrollment and ineligibility for a full low -income subsidy. Since individuals eligible for a full low - income subsidy are able to get HIV -related drugs for a minimal co -pay through Medicare, this change allows ADAP funds to be better used for individ uals who do not have access to HIV -related drugs. The average individual enrolled in ADAP receives approximately $1,000 of HIV -related drugs per month. By disenrolling 200 individuals who were eligible for a full low -income subsidy through Medicare, 12 ADAP saved approximately $2.4 million and was able to enroll 200 other HIV -infected Arizona residents who had no other drug coverage. The new rules do not change the process that an individual applying for enrollment or continuing enrollment in ADAP is current ly following but do require additional information and documentation, not required in the current rules, to be submitted as part of the application process. For instance, t he new rules specify documents that an individual may use to establish that the ind ividual is a resident of Arizona. Under the current rules, there are no specific requirements to show proof of Arizona residency. The Department estimates that selecting and enrolling in a Medicare drug plan; applying for a low -income subsidy; reading an d filling out a few more pieces of information on the application form; and gathering together the additional required documentation to establish Arizona residency, enrollment in a Medicare drug plan, and ineligibility for a low -income subsidy may take an applicant approximately 3.5 hours to complete. Thus, the new rules may impose a minimal cost on an individual applying for or enrolled in ADAP. Another change specified in the new rules is related to the new eligibility requirements. As part of the appli cation form, an individual applying for ADAP is required to give the Department permission to contact not only AHCCCS, as specified in the current rules, but also Medicare and the Social Security Administration to discuss the individual's eligibility for a low-income subsidy and enrollment in a Medicare drug plan. Under the new rules, an individual applying for ADAP is also required to give the Department permission to talk with the vendor pharmacy and the individual's primary care provider about the infor mation provided to the Department by the individual. Thus, when an individual submits an application for initial or continuing enrollment, the individual is giving the Department a release to contact and exchange information with the individual's primary care provider, rather than having to fill out a separate release when changing to a new primary care provider. The Department anticipates that these requirements will impose no cost on the individual and may provide a minimal benefit to the individual thr ough more efficient and timely resolution of issues that may arise. The documentation requirements to establish proof of family income from periodic monetary payments are unchanged from the current rules, but the new rules delineate a process, which is cur rently used by the Department but not specified in the current rules, by which an individual who has no regular source of income may document this situation. Over 1,000 individuals have used this process to document family income when enrolling in ADAP. The process by which the Department reviews the documents submitted to the Department is unchanged from the process currently followed by the Department. Due to improvements in the Department's data system, however, the Department is able to review and approve or disapprove an application for enrollment or continuing enrollment within five business days, which is substantially shorter than the time specified in the current rules. Both the additional process to 13 document family income and the reduction in t he time required for the review/approval process may provide a minimal benefit to an individual applying for or enrolled in ADAP. The new rules specify that forms may be completed by the representative of an individual applying for or enrolled in ADAP. Th ey also provide an opportunity for the individual to list the names of other individuals with whom the Department may leave a message or discuss an issue that arises related to ADAP enrollment. Currently, ADAP staff of the Department must leave a cryptic message with anyone other than the individual who answers a telephone call, asking for the individual to return the telephone call. This has caused delays in resolving issues or providing timely prescription drugs to individuals applying for or enrolled i n ADAP, and has occasionally caused personal problems for individuals with a jealous significant other. The Department anticipates that these changes may provide a minimal benefit to an individual applying for or enrolled in ADAP. The Department's use of a vendor pharmacy, as specified in the new rules, will provide a significant benefit to an individual enrolled in ADAP. The new rules clarify how an individual can request a refill of a prescription and allow the individual to specify where the prescripti on drugs are to be sent, including to an out -of-state address, if the individual is on vacation, or to one of the physical locations at which the vendor pharmacy has a facility for dispensing the prescription drugs. The Department's use of a vendor pharma cy also enables an enrolled individual or the individual's representative to talk directly with a pharmacist about a prescribed drug, ask questions on the use of a drug or side -effects, and discuss contraindications or drug interactions. The new rules also specify the process by which an enrolled individual's primary care provider may request a restricted drug for the enrolled individual. The ability of an individual to receive a restricted drug and to appeal a denial of a request for a restricted drug may provide a minimal benefit to an individual enrolled in ADAP. A clarification of the requirements for enrollment in ADAP, the types of documents that may be used in support of an application, the requirements for the distribution of prescription drugs by the vendor pharmacy, and the circumstances under which the Department may terminate an individual's enrollment in ADAP or approval of a restricted drug may also provide a minimal benefit to an individual applying for or enrolled in ADAP by decreasing the a mount of time the individual requires to apply for ADAP enrollment, allowing the individual to have realistic expectations and options for drug distribution, and giving the individual notice of what behaviors may result in termination of ADAP services. Com munity at Large HIV-infected individuals, their families, and the public may receive a significant benefit from the new rules. The improved clarity of the rules and specification of the types of documents that may be submitted to support an application fo r ADAP may encourage HIV -infected individuals not currently 14 applying for or enrolled in ADAP to apply. The education provided by the Department about the new rules may also increase awareness of the ADAP program. If an HIV -infected individual is able to obtain drugs through the individual's insurance, ADAP, a Medicare drug plan, or AHCCCS, the progression of the HIV -infected individual's disease may slow, and the drugs may prevent the occurrence of or to alleviate disability from HIV -related diseases, inc luding AIDS. A slower disease progression may add years to an HIV -infected individual's working life and decrease the work time lost by HIV -infected individuals or the families of HIV -infected individuals. These factors may provide a significant benefit to the community at large. The Department has determined that the benefits related to public health outweigh any potential costs associated with this rulemaking. 5. A general description of the probable impact on private and public employment in business, agencies and political subdivisions of this state directly affected by the rulemaking. Public and private employment in Arizona are not expected to be affected due to any of the changes in this rulemaking. 6. A statement of the probable impact of the rule making on small businesses. The statement shall include: a. An identification of the small business subject to the rulemaking. Small businesses affected by the rules changes include the practices of physicians, registered nurse practitioners, and physicia n assistants; the pharmacy under contract with the Department to distribute prescription drugs to individuals enrolled in ADAP; and community service organizations. A summary of the effects of the rule changes on small businesses is given in the cost/bene fit analysis in paragraph (4). b. The administrative and other costs required for compliance with the rulemaking. A summary of the administrative effects of the rulemaking is given in the cost/benefit analysis in paragraph (4). c. A description of the meth ods that the agency may use to reduce the impact on small business. Although there are many categories of small businesses affected by the rulemaking, the impact of the rulemaking on these small businesses is expected to be minimal, as is discussed in the cost/benefit analysis in paragraph (4). d. The probable cost and benefit to private persons and consumers who are directly affected by the rulemaking. 15 The probable costs to private persons and consumers are minimal and are contained in the cost/benefit ana lysis in paragraph (4). The probable benefits to private persons and consumers are minimal -to-significant and are contained in the cost/benefit analysis in paragraph (4). 7. A statement of the probable effect on state revenues. Not applicable 8. A descrip tion of any less intrusive or less costly alternative methods of achieving the purpose of the rulemaking. There are no alternative methods for those changes specified in this rulemaking that are the result of new federal ADAP requirements or the implementa tion of Medicare Part D. All other changes either benefit small businesses or are offset by accompanying benefits to small businesses. The Department believes that the changes specified in the rulemaking are the least intrusive and least costly methods t o meet the requirements of the ADAP program .

E-4 DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION (F19-1107) Title 2, Chapter 15, Article 3, Materials Management GOVERNOR'S REGULATORY REVIEW COUNCIL ATTORNEY MEMORANDUM - FIVE-YEAR REVIEW REPORT MEETING DATE: November 5, 2019 TO: Members of the Governor's Regulatory Review Council (Council) FROM: Council Staff DATE: September 20, 2019 SUBJECT: DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION (F19-1107) Title 2, Chapter 15, Article 3, Materials Management ______________________________________________________________________________ This Five Year Review Report (5YRR) from the Department of Administration relates to rules in Title 2, Chapter 15, Article 3, regarding Materials Management. These rules were adopted pursuant to state statutes to create policies and procedures for the State Surplus Administrator in all matters relating to the disposition of excess and surplus materials. The Department stated that no course of action was necessary in the last 5YRR for these rules in 2014. Proposed Action The Department states that it is not considering amending the rules at this time. However, the Department may conduct a rulemaking to remove moot language in R2-15-303(B) (Disposition). If the Department decides to conduct a rulemaking, it plans to submit a rulemaking to the Council by January 30, 2020. 1. Has the agency analyzed whether the rules are authorized by statute? Yes, the Department cites to both general and specific statutory authority for these rules. 2. Summary of the agency's economic impact comparison and identification of stakeholders: The Department states that the economic impact of Article 3 does not differ from what was originally determined in the economic, small business, and consumer impact statement (EIS) prepared in connection with a 2004 amendment to these rules. There has been no impact on small businesses or consumers in the state. In FY2014, the Program grossed over $3.4 million in revenue as a result of the effectiveness of these rules. Stakeholders include: the Department, the Surplus Property Administrator, the General Services Administration, and the public. 3. Has the agency analyzed the costs and benefits of the rulemaking and determined that the rules impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated? The Department states that the rules impose the least burden and costs to individuals, as well as to regulated public and private entities. 4. Has the agency received any written criticisms of the rules over the last five years? No, the Department indicates it did not receive any written criticisms of these rules over the last five years. 5. Has the agency analyzed the rules' clarity, conciseness, and understandability, consistency with other rules and statutes, and effectiveness? Yes. The Department identified one rule, R2-15-303(B) (Disposition) that could be amended to improve its clarity, conciseness, understandability, and effectiveness. This rule states in paragraph (A) that \"[t]he Surplus Property Administrator shall act on behalf of the state in all matters pertaining to the disposition of excess and surplus materials.\" Paragraph (B) exempts certain state agencies from this requirement, including the Department of Mines and Mineral Resources under A.R.S. \u00a7 27-105(6). This statute has been repealed; thus, the language regarding the Department of Mines and Mineral Resources in R2-15-303(B) is moot. The Department states that it is not considering a course of action to amend this rule at this time. However, it states that it may conduct a rulemaking to amend R2-15-303(B), and if it decides to proceed, the Department will submit a Notice of Final Rulemaking to the Council by January 30, 2020. Council staff notes that this potential rulemaking meets the criteria for an expedited rulemaking under A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1027(A)(6) and could be completed promptly. Amending this rule would make it more clear, concise, understandable, and effective. The general public would also benefit from a rule that is more accurate. 6. Has the agency analyzed the current enforcement status of the rules? Yes, the Department indicates the rules are enforced as written. 7. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? Not applicable. There is no corresponding federal law. 8. For rules adopted after July 29, 2010, do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? Not applicable. The rules do not require the issuance of a permit or license. 9. Conclusion The rules under review are mostly clear, concise, understandable, and effective. Council staff recommends approval of this report. As the Department indicates, R2-15-303(B) could be amended to remove moot language contained therein due to the repeal of A.R.S. \u00a7 27-105(6). While the Department states that it has no plans to amend this rule at this time, it could do so in the future. If it decides to proceed, it plans to submit a rulemaking to the Council by January 30, 2020. Council staff notes that this is a reasonable timeline to make this rule amendment. However, given that the rulemaking would qualify for expedited rulemaking under A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1027(A)(6), and would result in a rule that is more clear, concise, understandable, and effective, Council staff encourages the Council to inquire as to why the Department has not yet finalized its plans to amend this rule.

E-5 WATER QUALITY APPEALS BOARD (F19-0905) Title 2, Chapter 17, Article 1, Water Quality Appeals Board GOVERNOR'S REGULATORY REVIEW COUNCIL ATTORNEY MEMORANDUM - FIVE-YEAR REVIEW REPORT MEETING DATE: November 5, 2019 TO: Members of the Governor's Regulatory Review Council (Council) FROM: Council Staff DATE: October 15, 2019 SUBJECT: WATER QUALITY APPEALS BOARD Title 2, Chapter 17, Article 1, Water Quality Appeals Board ______________________________________________________________________________ Summary This five-year review report (5YRR) from the Water Quality Appeals Board (\"Board\") relates to all Articles in Title 2, Chapter 17 related to the procedures for appealing actions of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality regarding water quality control, aquifer protection permits, or pesticide contamination. Any person adversely affected by an action may file an appeal and any interested person may intervene in the appeal. Pursuant to the procedures outlined in these rules, the Board reviews evidence, hears arguments, and issues decisions within a specified time frame. In its previous 5YRR approved by the Council in November 2013, the Board indicated that it was in the process of reviewing its rules. The Board indicated that once this review was completed and, if the Board deemed it necessary, the Board would open a docket within 18 months of approval of the report. However, after further consideration, the Board made the determination that no action needed to be taken to amend R2-17-101 through R2-17-128 as they have been functioning as intended since they were originally adopted. Proposed Action In this report, the Board has identified four areas of rule amendments for Article 1. First, the Board intends to amend rules in which the references are no longer correct. For example, R2-17-102 references A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1001, which governs Article 6 hearings, which is incorrect since the Board hearings are held under Article 10, A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1092. The Board proposes striking reference to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1001 in R2-17-102. Second, the Board intends to amend rules which may create conflict between the Board's procedures and the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) statutes or rules. For example, the Board's rule refers to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1092.07, but (G) of that statute addresses the burden of persuasion in OAH hearings. The burden of proof (or persuasion) for WQAB appeals differs from the standards for most OAH hearings. Under A.R.S. \u00a7 \"unless, considering the entire record before the board, it concludes that the director's decision is arbitrary, unreasonable, unlawful or based upon a technical judgment that is clearly invalid.\" By contrast, in OAH hearings, \"the party asserting a claim, right or entitlement has the burden of proof\" and \"a party asserting an affirmative defense has the burden of establishing the affirmative defense.\" A.A.C. R2-19-119(B); A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1092.07(G). The Board is proposing to amend the reference to \u00a7 41-1092.07 to ensure there is no ambiguity or conflict with the WQAB statute that governs the standard of review, A.R.S. \u00a749-324(C). Also, A.A.C. R2-17-125(A)(2), regarding the Board's options once it receives an administrative law judge decision for review, is not entirely consistent with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1092.08, as amended in 2017. Third, the Board intends to amend rules to further clarify the appeals and hearing process or avoid redundancies. For example, R2-17-112(A)-(D) defines the procedures and time frames for filing motions. OAH Rule 106 is similar, but not identical in that the Board permits Replies, but OAH does not. Additionally, OAH requires motions to be filed at least 15 days before a hearing, but the Board does not impose a similar time limit. The Board is proposing to amend this rule to conform with the OAH rule. Fourth, the Board intends to amend rules to clarify the Board's appeal and hearing procedures. For example, R2-17-104(B) defines the contact information a party needs to include on pleadings. Phone numbers must be included, but not email addresses. Although not required by the OAH rule, the current practice of the Board, OAH, and in Superior Court, is for parties and counsel to provide email addresses. The Board is proposing to amend the rule to include email addresses in a party's contact information. A detailed list of all rules the Board intends to amend is included in the supplement attached to the Board's 5YRR. The Board is proposing an expedited rulemaking to address the four areas of concern identified above upon the Council's approval of the report. The Board anticipates initiating the expedited rulemaking by April 2020. 1. Has the agency analyzed whether the rules are authorized by statute? Yes. The Board cites to specific statutory authority for the rules. 2. Summary of the agency's economic impact comparison and identification of stakeholders: The Board has determined that the economic impact of the Chapter 17 does not differ significantly from what was originally determined by the Economic Impact Statement. The stakeholders include the Board and the general public. 3. Has the agency analyzed the costs and benefits of the rulemaking and determined that the rules impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated? The Board has determined that the rules provide the least intrusive and least costly method of achieving the regulatory objective. The Board states that the benefits of having effective and understandable rules outweigh the costs. 4. Has the agency received any written criticisms of the rules over the last five years? The Board indicates it has not received any written criticism of the rules within the last five years. 5. Has the agency analyzed the rules' clarity, conciseness, and understandability, consistency with other rules and statutes, and effectiveness? The Board indicates that the rules are generally clear, concise, and understandable. However, as outlined above, the Board indicates that some rules should be amended to conform to recent changes in laws governing the administrative hearing process under Title 41, Chapter 6, Article 10, which applies to WQAB appeals. As such, while the rules are currently internally consistent, they are not consistent with state statutes and other OAH rules. The Board indicates most of the rules are effective in achieving their objectives, but is proposing to update some rules to improve effectiveness as outlined in the attachment to their 5YRR. 6. Has the agency analyzed the current enforcement status of the rules? The Board indicates that it enforces all the rules. 7. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? The Board indicates there are no corresponding federal laws. 8. For rules adopted after July 29, 2010, do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? The Board indicates that A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037 does not apply because none of the rules were adopted after July 29, 2010. 9. Conclusion The rules are generally clear, concise, and understandable. However, the rules are currently inconsistent with statute statutes and OAH rules. The Board proposes to amend its rules to update outdated references, resolve inconsistencies between the Board's procedures and the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) statutes or rules, and clarify the appeals and hearing process. The Board indicates it is in the process of drafting amendments to the rules and proposes to initiate an expedited rulemaking to address these issues by April 2020. Council staff recommends approval of this report. Douglas A.

These rules were originally adopted effective January 8, 1998 and include Chapter 17 consisting of Article 1, Sections R2 -17-101 through R2 -17-128, inclusive. The Board conducted a five year review of these rul es that was approved by Governor's Regulatory Review Council (\"GRRC\") on November 14, 2013. The five -year review report approved by GRRC at that t ime indicated a possibility that the Council would amend or repeal sections of R2 -17-101 through R2- 17-128. After further consideration, the Board made the determination that no action was necessary as the rules have been functioning as intended since they were originally adopted. Except as otherwise noted, the information is identical, consistent and effective for all of the rules in the R2-17-101 through R2- 11-128. 2 1.

The rules cover the following: Article 1 - General Provisions Article 2 - Licensing Article 3 - Continuing Education Article 4 - Regulatory Provisions In the previous 5YRR for these rules, approved by the Council on January 5, 2010, the Board indicated it would amend R4-15-102 and R4-15-203. The Board amended both rules as part of a rulemaking that amended all rules in Articles 1 through 3 in 2014. As a result, pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1056(H), the Board rescheduled the 5YRR for Articles 1 through 3, originally due in 2014. Article 4 was not eligible for rescheduling and was reviewed in a 5YRR approved by the Council on February 3, 2015. In that report, the Board concluded no action was necessary regarding R4-15-401. The current report was originally on the agenda for discussion at the September 24, 2019 Study Session and October 1, 2019 Council Meeting. After initial review of the report, the Council raised several questions/concerns regarding the rules under review, including: 1. Was an analysis done regarding whether the burden on the ability of Arizona citizens to work as massage therapists is the least intrusive and costly method of achieving the purpose of licensure in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of massage therapy clients? See A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1059(A)(9). 2. What is the justification for waiting until the end of 2020 to conduct a rulemaking, as stated in the original proposed course of action for the Board's 5YRR, when some of the rules are currently not being enforced as written? 3. Why are the prior economic impact statements not available for review and what efforts have been made to analyze the economic impact of the rules in the last 15 years? 4. The Board indicated about a quarter of all complaints were for allegations of sexual assault and half of the complaints were for unlicensed conduct. Are the rules narrowly tailored to address conduct giving rise to the majority of the complaints or do they unnecessarily restrict the ability of someone to work while not addressing the real threat to public health, safety, and welfare? 5. The Board indicated that \"[m]ost of the costs and burdens of licensure result from statute rather than rule\" because it \"is statute that requires an individual to be licensed to practice massage therapy (A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 32-4221(A) and 32-4255(A)); to submit an application to the Board (A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 32-4223 and 32-4224); to renew a license pay fees for a license and participate in continuing education (A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4225).\" These are minimum requirements. What analysis and justification does the massage board have for the rule requirements above the minimum statutory requirements, such as rules regarding the exact fees charged by the Board, the content of applications, and standards for recognizing massage therapy schools and accepting continuing education? What is the analysis behind the required number of classroom hours, or the English proficiency test, for example? In response to inquiries by the Council at the October 1, 2019 Council Meeting, the Board assembled a ten-member task force to assist Board members and staff with additional review of the rules and statutes to adequately respond to the issues raised by the Council. As a result of that additional review, the Board submitted the present revised 5YRR. Proposed Action In its prior submission, the Board proposed to complete a rulemaking that addresses the issues identified in the report by the end of 2020. In response to the Council's inquiries at the October 1, 2019 Council Meeting, the Board now intends to request an exemption from the rulemaking moratorium no later than January 2020 in order to proceed with a rulemaking to address the issues identified in this report. It will initiate a rulemaking as soon as it receives approval to do so. 1. Has the agency analyzed whether the rules are authorized by statute? Yes. The Board cites to both general and specific statutory authority for these rules. 2. Summary of the agency's economic impact comparison and identification of stakeholders: The Board currently licenses 10,327 individuals. During FY2019, the Board received new applications from 1,124 individuals and received 78 complaints. The Board office employs five FTE individuals. During FY2019, the office collected $535,142 in fees and was appropriated $460,900 Subsequent to the October 1, 2019 Council Meeting, the Board was able to identify and review two prior economic impact statements (EIS) related to the last rulemaking activity for Articles 1-4. The Board indicates that the economic impact of the rules in Articles 1-3 has not varied from the impact anticipated in the 2014 EIS prepared in connection with the 2014 rulemaking related to those Articles. The Board indicates that the costs that resulted from the 2006 amendments to Article 4 are consistent with the costs projected in the EIS associated with that rulemaking. In the EIS associated with that rulemaking the Board estimated the costs to the Board or a licensee to be minimal and less than $1,000. Since the promulgation of the rule, the Board indicates costs have been minimal. For more detailed analysis of the EIS comparisons, please see Section 8 of the Board's 5YRR. The stakeholders include the Board, licensees, massage service related businesses, and the public. 3. Has the agency analyzed the costs and benefits of the rulemaking and determined that the rules impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated? In response to the Council's questions at the October 1, 2019 Council Meeting, the Board indicates that the benefits of these rules are that they protect the health and welfare of the public. The Board states massage therapists are increasingly part of the organized delivery of health care in hospitals, doctor's offices, addiction treatment, and pain management centers. As such, the Board states these rules are beneficial in that they ensure that massage therapists have the necessary training, knowledge, and experience to practice massage therapy without injury to their clients. The Board states these rules also provide for necessary background checks of massage therapists to ensure that the Board does not license individuals that could pose a threat to clients, particularly when clients may be in vulnerable situations The Board indicates that a quarter of complaints received involved allegations of sexual assault. The Board reviews all of the complaints received, opens cases for further investigation at a rate of approximately 25 each year, and takes disciplinary action pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4253. The Board indicates the rules provide for background checks to prevent individuals with a significant history of sexual crimes from obtaining a massage therapy license. However, the Board does not specify what constitutes \"significant history or sexual crimes\" and what threshold is in place for withholding a license on those grounds. Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4222(A)(7), within five years preceding the date of application, an applicant shall not have been convicted of a class 1, 2, or 3 felony; a class 4, 5 or 6 felony offense involving moral turpitude that has a reasonable relationship to the practice of massage therapy; or \"misdemeanor involving prostitution or solicitation or other similar offense involving moral turpitude that has a reasonable relationship to the practice of massage therapy.\" The Board states the rules also allow the Board to investigate such allegations of a licensee and take necessary steps to either discipline licensees or revoke licenses. Since 2014, the Board indicates it has conducted 49 disciplinary hearings and disciplined 41 licensees. The Board indicates it has also revoked 17 licenses and placed 18 licensees on probation and only 2 individuals submitted a motion for rehearing or review. The Board states the rules are narrowly tailored to address conduct giving rise to the majority of the complaints and have been effective in addressing those complaints. However, the Board does not indicate how other costs and burdens imposed by the licensing process, such as continuing education requirements and required classroom hours are relevant and tailored to addressing allegations of sexual assault or other unlicensed conduct, which appear to give rise to the majority of complaints related to public health, safety, and welfare. The Board indicates that it reviewed information regarding fees in the various rules for other boards to compare to the Board's own fees in an effort to analyze the costs the rules impose on massage therapists. However, determining whether the fees charged by other boards are comparable does not determine that the Board's fees impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated while still achieving their regulatory objectives. Council staff recommends the Council follow up on its prior inquiry as to whether the exact fees charged by the Board impose the least burden and costs on licensees necessary to achieve the underlying regulatory objective. The Board also indicates that A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4222(C) authorizes the Board to increase the minimum number of classroom hours of supervised instruction at a Board-recognized school that an applicant must complete successfully in order to ensure that massage therapists have the necessary knowledge and experience to practice massage therapy safely. The Board indicates national and state associations such as the American Massage Therapy Association and the Arizona Council of Massage Therapy Educators recommended the Board increase the classroom and supervised clinical hours. Upon further analysis, the Board increased the classroom and supervised clinical hours to 700 which they indicate follows the nationwide trend of increasing to at least this number or more to ensure massage therapists have the necessary training to practice safely. However, the Board did not indicate what \"further analysis\" was performed to determine 700 hours of supervised instruction is the least burdensome requirement that still ensures massage therapists have the necessary training to practice safely, when statute only requires 500 hours. Other than recommendations of national and state associations, the Board has not indicated what benefits are gained from an additional 200 hours of supervised instruction or how those benefits would outweigh the costs to licensees. Furthermore, with regards to the English proficiency requirement, the Board states A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4222(E) requires the Board to establish rules that provide communication proficiency requirements in order to ensure the safety of massage therapy clients and massage therapists. The Board indicates the proficiency scores listed in this rule need to apply to every applicant and can be lowered to reduce the burden on regulated persons. The Board states it believes that scores of 18 for all sections of the TOEFL and 125 for all sections of the TOEIC would ensure that every applicant has a basic understanding of English such that the applicant would be able to effectively communicate with clients for the purpose of providing massage therapy services safely. Council staff would also recommend the Council inquire with the Board regarding the continuing education requirements. Specifically, what analysis was done by the Board to determine that 24 hours of continuing education is necessary for license renewal pursuant to R4-15-301? Has the Board analyzed whether 24 hours of continuing education during the two-year period immediately preceding license expiration imposes the least burden and costs on licensees necessary to achieve the underlying regulatory objectives? Ultimately, the Board determined in their report that the rules under review provide the least intrusive and least costly method of achieving their regulatory objectives. The Board indicates state regulation through the Board and its administrative rules simplified regulatory requirements in the massage industry, thus reducing the burden of regulation while increasing the benefits to public health and safety. However, Council staff recommends the Council seek clarification from the Board regarding the various issues outlined above in order to more fully flesh out the analysis required pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1056(A)(9). 4. Has the agency received any written criticisms of the rules over the last five years? The Board indicates that it did not receive any written criticisms of the rules in the last five years. 5. Has the agency analyzed the rules' clarity, conciseness, and understandability, consistency with other rules and statutes, and effectiveness? Yes. For the reasons specified in the report, the Department indicates that the following rules could be amended to improve their clarity, conciseness, understandability, effectiveness, and consistency with other rules and statutes: (Fees); R4-15-201(A)(1) (Qualifications; Application for (Approval of Continuing Education); R4-15-201(B)(1)(p) ; R4-15-203(1)(c) (Application for a License by Reciprocity); R4-15-203 ; and R4-15-204 (Board-recognized School). 6. Has the agency analyzed the current enforcement status of the rules? Yes. For the reasons specified in the report, the Board indicates the following rules are not enforced as written: R4-15-102(1) (Fees); R4-15-201(B)(1)(p) (Qualifications; Application for a for a License by Reciprocity); and R4-15-201(B)(1)(b) . 7. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? Not applicable. There is no corresponding federal law. 8. For rules adopted after July 29, 2010, do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? These rules require the issuance of licenses. Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037(A), if an agency proposes an amendment to an existing rule that requires the issuance of a license, the agency shall use a general permit. However, an agency may use an alternative type of license if specifically authorized by state statute. See A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037(A)(2). The Board indicates that the licenses issued are individualized licenses rather than general permits, but are specifically authorized by A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4221 and 32-4255. Therefore, the Board is in compliance with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037. 9. Conclusion The Board is proposing to amend its rules to improve their clarity, conciseness, understandability and effectiveness. The Board intends to seek an exemption from the rulemaking moratorium no later than January 2020 in order to conduct a rulemaking to address the issues identified in this report. It will initiate a rulemaking as soon as it receives approval to do so. Council finds that this is an acceptable timeline for a proposed course of action. Based on the Board's responses to the Council's inquiries and Council staff's concerns outlined in Section 3, Council staff recommends the Council engage in additional discussion regarding the Boards analysis pursuant to A.R.S. 41-1056(A)(9) at the upcoming Study Session.

(I have provided copies to the members of the Arizona Massage Board, and our task force members as well). Thank you for the opportunity to update and recalibrate the submission. Following the Board's last appearance before the Council on October 1, we assembled a ten-member task force to assist Board members and staff with additional review of Board rules and statutes and the creation of an updated Economic Impact Statement comparison. Working with two outside Arizona rules consultants, a former Executive Director of the Massage Board, the current Board chair, and the original (and current) industry legal counsel involved with drafting the Board's authorizing statutes, a review was undertaken to determine more details of Board rules promulgation. The result, we believe, is this updated report which better reflects the process just undertaken here to prepare a more detailed Five-Year Review Report and cross-check Board rules with state statutory construct, as well as respond to the five questions the Board received from GRRC staff on September 25, 2019. Based on the questions the Board received from GRRC staff, this updated report includes more analysis of item 11, an updated proposed course of action, a comparison to the previous Economic Impact Statements for the rules, and further explanation of how the Board's rules effectively address complaints. This updated report also provides further explanation on how the rules are consistent with statute and do not exceed statutory authority, but rather adhere to the maximums and minimums that the legislature has required the Board to follow. As additional background, the Board was able to locate some of the licensing fees of other boards. Although the Board cannot speak as to how the other 50+ boards in Arizona implement their fees, the Board found the following information in the various rules for some of the other boards as examples: the Barber Board charges $175 for a license by reciprocity, the Chiropractic Board charges $250 for a renewal license, the Acupuncture Board charges $150 for an application and $275 for an initial license. Upon GRRC staff review of the updated report, please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns about the Board's rules and whether the Council might have any additional questions or concerns for the Board based on the updated information the Board has provided. It's been a pleasure working with you and I look forward to speaking with you about this updated report. Best regards. To ensure compliance with the Open Meeting Law , recipients of this message should not forward it to other board members. Board members may reply to this message, but they should not send a copy of the reply to other board members, which would include a reply to all. 10/22/2019 State of Arizona Mail - Arizona Massage Board Five-Y ear Regulatory Review Revised Sincerely , Tom Arizona State Board of Massage Therapy 1740 W .

Board of Massage Therapy Articles 1-4 Submitted for September 2019 1. Authorization of the rule by existing statutes General Statutory Authority: (B) and \u00a7 41-1092.09 2. The objective of each rule: Rule Objective R4-15-101. Definitions The objective of the rule is to define terms used in the rules in a manner that is not explained adequately by a dictionary definition. R4-15-102. Fees The objective of the rule is to specify the fees the Board charges for its licensing activities. R4-15-103. Ethical The objective of the rule is to protect the public by establishing ethical 2Standards standards with which a licensee must conform. R4-15-201. Qualifications; Application for a Regular LicenseThe objective of the rule is to specify the content of an application for a license including information required to be submitted directly to the Board by third parties. R4-15-203. Application for a License by ReciprocityThe objective of the rule is to specify the requirements for obtaining a license by reciprocity. R4-15-204. Board- recognized SchoolThe objective of the rule is to identify schools the Board recognizes and specify procedures for other schools to obtain recognition. R4-15-205. Application for Renewal of LicenseThe objective of this rule is to specify the requirements for renewal of a license. R4-15-207. Licensing Time-framesThe objective of the rule is to specify the time frames within which the Board will act on a license application. Table 1. Licensing Time-frames (in Days)The objective of the rule is to specify in table form the time frames within which the Board will act on a license application. R4-15-301. Required Continuing Education HoursThe objective of the rule is to specify the number of hours of continuing education required for license renewal and the manner in which the hours must be obtained. R4-15-302. Approval of Continuing EducationThe objective of the rule is to specify continuing education activities that are approved by the Board. R4-15-303. Documentation of Completion of Continuing EducationThe objective of the rule is to provide notice to licensees that the Board will audit compliance with the continuing education requirement. R4-15-401. Rehearing or Review of Board's DecisionThe objective of the rule is to specify the procedures and standards for requesting a rehearing or review of a Board decision. This enables a licensee to know how to exhaust the licensee's administrative remedies before making application for judicial review under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-901. 3. Are the rules effective in achieving objectives? Mostly yes 3Rule Explanation R4-15-201(C) A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4222(E) requires the Board to establish rules that provide communication proficiency requirements in order to ensure the safety of massage therapy clients and massage therapists. The proficiency scores listed in this rule need to apply to every applicant and can be lowered to reduce the burden on regulated persons. The Board believes that scores of 18 for all sections of the TOEFL and 125 for all sections of the TOEIC would ensure that every applicant has a basic understanding of English such that the applicant would be able to effectively communicate with clients for the purpose of providing massage therapy services safely. R4-15-302(1) As soon as the FSMTB (Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards) begins to offer or approve continuing education, the Board intends to add it as an accepted provider of continuing education. 4. Are the rules consistent with other rules and statutes? Mostly yes Rule Explanation R4-15- 201(B)(1)(p) and R4-15-203(1)(c)These subsections require the signature on an application to be notarized. However, A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4224(A) requires the application to be filed under oath or affirmation, which is different from notarization. These subsections need to be amended in order to remove the notarization requirements and provide that the application shall be submitted to the Board under oath or affirmation. R4-15-203 This Section refers to A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4223 for reciprocity requirements. However, that statute does not take into account the recently enacted A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4302 regarding reciprocity for spouses of active duty members of the armed forces accompanying the member to this state. The Board needs to amend this rule in order to ensure that reciprocity requirements for spouses of active duty members of the armed forces accompanying the member to this state are consistent with A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4302. R4-15-204 This rule is consistent with A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4228 which indicates which massage therapy schools the Board must recognize. However, this rule does not provide for schools located in a Canadian province or schools that are accredited to offer massage therapy education by an agency that is recognized by the secretary of the U.S. Department of Education. The Board needs to amend this rule in order to 4recognize such schools. Specifically, the Board needs to amend subsections (B)(1) and (B)(2) to clarify that the applicant or school must show that the school is approved by an agency similar to the Board for Private Postsecondary Education or accredited by an agency approved by the U.S. Department of Education. 5. Are the rules enforced as written? Mostly yes Rule Explanation R4-15- 201(B)(1)(p) and R4-15-203(1)(c)As mentioned above, these subsections require the signature on an application to be notarized. This is inconsistent with Board practice. The Board has not required notarization since May 2018 and needs to amend this rule to be more consistent with statute. R4-12- 201(B)(1)(b)A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4224 allows the Board to establish rules requiring information on a license application. However, as of 2014, the Board requires a passport style photo of every applicant, so this subsection is no longer necessary or enforced. The Board does not ask an applicant for information regarding the applicant's weight, height, eye color, or race. The Board needs to amend this rule to remove these requirements. 6. Are the rules clear, concise, and understandable? Mostly yes Rule Explanation R4-15-102(1) A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4227 identifies maximum fees that the Board may charge for various licenses and the Board has not exceeded these maximum fees because this subsection indicates that the Board only charges $195 for a license application and the license application fee includes issuance of the initial license if the application is approved. Moreover, the Board waives application fees for applicants who show they qualify for a waiver pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1080.01. Nevertheless, this subsection does not clarify that the Board also collects the fee that is required by the Department of Public Safety (DPS) pursuant to R13-1-401 to process fingerprints for federal background checks pursuant to R4-15-201 and R4-15-203 and authorized under A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4222(A)(10). The Board needs to amend this 5rule to clarify that it collects the fee for DPS to process fingerprint cards. R4-15-201(A)(1) This subsection requires applicants who submit an application before January 1, 2008 to complete 500 hours of education and supervised clinical instruction. However, this section is no longer necessary and the Board needs to remove this subsection in order to make the rule clearer and more concise. 7. Has the agency received written criticisms of the rules within the last five years? No Rule Explanation R4-15-201(A)(2) The Board has received verbal comments from potential applicants indicating that the 700 classroom and clinical hours of supervised instruction are not in statute. The Board responds that A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4222(C) authorizes the Board to increase the minimum number of classroom hours of supervised instruction at a Board- recognized school that an applicant must complete successfully in order to ensure that massage therapists have the necessary knowledge and experience to practice massage therapy safely. National and state associations such as the American Massage Therapy Association and the Arizona Council of Massage Therapy Educators recommended the Board increase the classroom and supervised clinical hours. Upon further analysis, the Board increased the classroom and supervised clinical hours to 700 which follows the nationwide trend of increasing to at least this number or more to ensure massage therapists have the necessary training to practice safely. R4-15-301(B) The Board has received verbal comments from licensees suggesting a licensee should be able to obtain all rather than only half the required continuing education from distance learning. The Board responds that A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4225(E) specifies that the licensee must complete at least 24 hours of continuing education in the practice of massage therapy as approved by the Board. In light of an increasingly mobile workforce and advances in technology, the Board allows an applicant to complete 12 hours of continuing education from a long-distance format. However, due to the hands-on nature of massage therapy, the Board believes it is important to require at least 12 hours of continuing education through physical, in- person interaction in order to ensure that massage therapists maintain the necessary hands-on skills and knowledge to practice massage therapy safely. 68. Economic, small business, and consumer impact comparison : Currently, the Board licenses approximately 10,327 individuals. During FY2019, the Board received new applications from 1,124 individuals, of whom, 42 were applicants by reciprocity, resulting in $535,142 collected in fees. All the rules in Articles 1 through 3 were amended or made in a rulemaking that went into effect on August 5, 2014 (20 A.A.R. 2246). The 2014 rulemaking was completed to make the rules consistent with 2013 legislation as well as Board statutes and practice. The most significant changes included adding ethical standards with which a licensee must comply, including amending the definition of \"good moral character,\" and establishing English communication proficiency standards, In the EIS associated with the 2014 rulemaking, the Board determined that the changes regarding \"good moral character\" and English proficiency could have potential costs for applicants because it is possible that both changes could prevent an individual from qualifying for licensure. However, as discussed above, state law requires the Board to establish English proficiency requirements and ethical standards (A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4203(A)(6)), so the Board determined both changes were necessary to comply with state laws to protect the health and safety of consumers of massage therapy services. The 2014 EIS also indicated that the changes regarding continuing education and examinations may produce cost savings for licensees and applicants by reducing the burden of becoming licensed and maintaining a license. Ultimately, the Board anticipated that the costs of the rulemaking would be minimal as the amendments simply made the rules consistent with legislative changes. On average, only 7 applicants per year are unable to meet the qualifications for licensure. Thus, the economic impact of these rules has not varied from the impact anticipated in the 2014 EIS. The one rule in Article 4, Rehearing or Review of Board's Decision, was made in 2006 and reviewed in a five-year review report approved by the Governor's Regulatory Review Council in 2014. The rulemaking reduced the Board's fee for a regular license (R4-15-102(A)(1)), established standards for continuing education (Article 3), added requirements for license renewal (R4-15-205), added a fee for a renewal license (R4-15-102(A)(4), and added a fee for delinquent license renewal (R4-15-102(A)(5)). The Board receives approximately 22 delinquent license renewal fees each month. The costs that resulted from this rulemaking are consistent with the costs projected in the EIS associated with that rulemaking. In the EIS associated with that rulemaking the Board estimated the costs to the Board or a licensee to be minimal and less than $1,000. Since the promulgation of the rule, the costs have been minimal. Since 2014, the Board has received 3 motions for rehearing. A quarter of the complaints involved allegations of sexual assault. The Board reviews all of the complaints received, opens cases for 7further investigation at a rate of approximately 25 each year, and takes disciplinary action pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4253. The rules provide for background checks to prevent individuals with a significant history of sexual crimes from obtaining a massage therapy license. The rules also allow the Board to investigate such allegations of a licensee and take necessary steps to either discipline licensees or revoke licenses. Since 2014, the Board has conducted 49 disciplinary hearings and disciplined 41 licensees. The Board has also revoked 17 licenses and placed 18 licensees on probation and only 2 individuals submitted a motion for rehearing or review. Thus, the rules are narrowly tailored to address conduct giving rise to the majority of the complaints and have been effective in addressing those complaints. 9. Has the agency received any business competitiveness analyses of the rules ? No 10. Has the agency completed the course of action indicated in the agency's previous 5YRR ?Yes In a 5YRR approved by Council on January 5, 2010, the Board indicated it intended to amend R4-15- 102 and R4-15-203. The Board amended both rules as part of a rulemaking that amended all rules in Articles 1 through 3 in 2014 (See 20 A.A.R. 2246). This rulemaking enabled the Board to have a 2014 5YRR of the amended rules rescheduled. The Board was not able to reschedule the 5YRR of R4-15-401. That rule was reviewed in a report approved by Council on February 3, 2015. In that report, the Board concluded no action was needed regarding R4-15-401. 11. A determination that the probable benefits of the rule outweigh within this state the probable costs of the rule, and the rule imposes the least burden and costs to regulated persons by the rule, including paperwork and other compliance costs, necessary to achieve the underlying regulatory objective : These rules are necessary to protect the health and welfare of the public. Massage therapists increasingly are part of the organized delivery of health care in hospitals, doctor's offices, addiction treatment, and pain management centers. As such, these rules are necessary to ensure that massage therapists have the necessary training, knowledge, and experience to practice massage therapy without injury to their clients. These rules also provide for necessary background checks of massage therapists to ensure that the Board does not license individuals that could pose a threat to clients, particularly when clients may be in vulnerable situations. Moreover, these rules simply enforce statutory requirements that the Board has been charged with administering. It is statute that requires an individual to be licensed to practice massage therapy (A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 32-4221(A) and 32-4255(A)); to submit an application to the Board (A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 32-4223 and 32-4224); to renew a license pay fees for a license and participate in continuing education (A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4225). Statute requires 8massage therapy schools to obtain recognition from the Board (A.R.S. \u00a7 32-4228). Additionally, prior to state regulation of massage therapists, massage therapists faced a significant burden of paying multiple fees to obtain licensure in multiple municipalities with significantly varying licensing requirements. State regulation through the Board and its administrative rules simplified regulatory requirements in the massage industry, thereby reducing the burden of regulation while increasing the benefits to public health and safety. Thus, with the exception of the proposed amendments identified in this report, these rules impose the least burden on regulated persons while still achieving the underlying regulatory objective. The rules establish the exact fees charged by the Board, the content of applications, and standards for recognizing massage therapy schools and accepting continuing education. 12. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal laws? No There is no federal law uniquely applicable to the reviewed rules. 13. For rules adopted after July 29, 2010 that require the issuance of a regulatory permit, license, or agency authorization, whether the rules are in compliance with the general permit requirements of A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037 or explain why the agency believes an exception applies: The Board's statutes (See A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 32-4221 and 32-4255), require individualized licenses be issued so a general permit is not applicable. 14. Proposed course of action : The Board intends to request approval from the Governor's Office to proceed with rulemaking no later than January 2020 and intends to complete a rulemaking that addresses the issues identified in this report as soon as it receives approval to do so.

Specifically, these rules relate to licensing requirements for foster home licensing agencies and foster parents as well as the licensing process for foster parents. This is the first 5YRR for these rules since they were made by final exempt rulemaking which became effective January 24, 2016. Proposed Action The Department does not propose to take any action for these rules. 1. Has the agency analyzed whether the rules are authorized by statute? Yes. The Department cites to both general and specific statutory authority for the rules. 2. Summary of the agency's economic impact comparison and identification of stakeholders: The Department of Child Safety Office of Licensing and Regulation (OLR) oversees the licensing and regulation of foster homes and the foster home licensing agencies. The Department indicates that foster home licensing agencies are private organizations generally contracted with the Department to oversee the licensing of foster care providers. The Department adopted the rules in 2016 as part of exempt rulemaking, so there is no economic, small business, or consumer impact statement available The stakeholders include: businesses that contract with the Department, business that contract with other entities to provide aid for children in out-of-home care, the general public, children in out-of-home care, parents of children in out-of-home care, and the Department. 3. Has the agency analyzed the costs and benefits of the rulemaking and determined that the rules impose the least burden and costs to those who are regulated? The Department has reviewed the current rules and determined that they provide the minimum burden on business and the general public. Although foster home licensees are reimbursed for the services they provide via federal and state funds, the Department believes that any costs are offset by ensuring the safety and protection of Arizona's children. The Department does not propose any additional rulemaking activity for these rules at this time. 4. Has the agency received any written criticisms of the rules over the last five years? The Department indicates that it has not received any written criticisms of the rules in the last five years since they were finalized under exempt rulemaking which became effective on January 24, 2016. The Department indicates that during the rulemaking process, public comments were received through public meetings and an on-line survey. Comments received related to concern with out-of-state travel, number of children a home could be licensed for, bedroom arrangements, licensing, training update, amendments, investigation timeframes, and requirements for the certification of specialized services. The Department reviewed and incorporated public comments during the rulemaking process into the final rule package in 2015. 5. Has the agency analyzed the rules' clarity, conciseness, and understandability, consistency with other rules and statutes, and effectiveness? The Department indicates the rules are generally clear, concise, and understandable. However, the Department notes that R21-6-410(B)(7) incorrectly states the foster parent shall work with the licensing agency to modify a license when an adopted child is born. This should be corrected to say \"...the birth of a child or adoption of a child.\" Additionally, the Department states the Section heading of R21-6-308 reads \"Positive Discipline\" however, the rules in this Section are addressing discipline and behavior management. The Department indicates that the rules are consistent with other rules and statutes and are effective in achieving their objectives. 6. Has the agency analyzed the current enforcement status of the rules? Yes. The Department indicates the rules are currently enforced as written. 7. Are the rules more stringent than corresponding federal law and, if so, is there statutory authority to exceed the requirements of federal law? The Department indicates that the rules are not more stringent than corresponding federal law. The corresponding federal laws include: 42 U.S.C. 622, 45 U.S.C. 623, 45 U.S.C. 671, 45 U.S.C. 45 U.S.C. 675, U.S.C. 5113, and 45 CFR 1356.30. 8. For rules adopted after July 29, 2010, do the rules require a permit or license and, if so, does the agency comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037? An individual license is required to operate a foster home. However, foster home licenses are exempt from the requirements under A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1037 pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8-503 and 8-505. As such, a general permit, license, or agency authorization is not required. 9. Conclusion The rules are generally clear, concise, and understandable. The rules are consistent with other rules and statutes and are effective in achieving their regulatory objective. The Department does not propose to take any action regarding these rules. Council staff recommends approval of this report. 1 ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SAFETY Five-Year -Review Report Title 21.

The Department reviewed and incorporated comments where applicable in the final rule package in 2015. 8. Economic, small business, and consumer impact comparison : The Department adopted the rules in Title 21, Chapter 6 under its own title (Title 21. Child Safety) on January 24, 2016 . There were no economic, small business and consumer impact statements prepared as part of the exempt rulemaking. The DCS Office of Licensing and Regulation (OLR) oversees the licensing and regulation of foster homes and the foster home licensing agencies. Foster home licensing agencies are private organizations generally contracted with the Department to oversee the licensi ng of foster care providers. The Foster Home Licensing U nit within OLR is responsible for the following functions : Support and provi de technical assistance to foster home licensing agencies, foster parents, and foster home license applicants as needed or requested . Complete an Administrative Review of application packets received within timeframes set in Chapter 6 and Arizona statute . Types of application packets include initial, renewal, and amendment applications for family foster home li censing or in -home respite licensing . Ensure application packets comply with the rules in Chapter 6 and Arizona statute . Request ad ditional information as necessary. Complete a Substantive Review of the application and application packet within timeframes set in Chapter 6 and Arizona statute . A substantive review consists of a review of the information provided and determin ation whether to issue a n initial, renewal, or amended foster home license (as applicable) for applications for family foster home licensing or in -home respite licensing .

Review requests to increase the number of foster children a foster parent could provide care to beyond the licensing parameters, also known as overcapacity requests. OLR provides this support in order to preserve sibling connections to children placed in out -of-home care by placing siblings together in a licensed foster home or in order to place children with a foster family with whom they have a prior relationship . Maintain the electronic database established for housing all foster home licensing applications , in-home respite licensing applications, and related information. Population affected The cost bearers and beneficiaries of the rules in this Chapter are : businesses that contract with D CS, businesses contracting with other entities to provide aid in the placement of children that cannot remain in their natural home, general public who may wish to apply for a foster home license, children in out -of-home care, parents of children in out -of-home care, and DCS. The cost bearers and beneficiaries benefit from these rules as the rules provide foster home licensing agencies, applicants, foster parents, and in -home respite providers information about what is expec ted of them and the licensing process. Foster home licensing agencies are not charged a fee for contracting with DCS. Foster home applicants are not charged a fee for applying, renewing or amending their license. The Department has contracted 27 Foster Home Licensing Agencies . On June 30, 2018, there were 4,377 licensed foster homes . Foster care providers are expected to comply with the articles in this Chapter as well as the rules in Chapter 8 of this Title.

One (1) of these units is the Foster Home Licensing un it, which enforces and monitors the rules in Chapter 6. The Foster Home Licensing Unit consists of 11 staff. This unit is comprised of one (1) Manager, three (3) Team Leads, and seven (7) Foster Home Licensing Liaisons. Funding The following funding information applies to OLR as a whole and is not specific to the functions of the Fost er Home Licensing unit. In FY 19, DCS budgeted $3.2M to OLR operations. This included 34 FTE , supplies, fingerprinting, overhead, etc. The funding source is both state General Fund and Federal funds. 13 The Department also incurred $6.4M of expenses relat ed to completing licenses from the DCS provider network. This is budgeted within the Foster Home Recruitment, Study and Supervision legislative line item: $32,756, 000. Funding sources are both state General Fund and Federal funds. 9. Has the agency received any business competitiveness analyses of the rules ? Yes ___ No _ X_ 10. Has the agency completed the course of action indicated in the agency's previous five -year -review report? This is the first review of the rules in Title 21, Chapter 6, Articles 1 through 4. The rules in this Chapter were made by final exempt rulemaking at 21 A.A.R. 3479 , December 25, 2015 and became effective January 24, 2016 . 11. A determination that the probable benefits of the rule outweigh within this state the probable costs of the rule, and the rule imposes the least burden and costs to regulated persons by the rule, including paperwork and other compliance costs, necessary to achieve the underlying r egulatory objective : The Department believes that current rules pose the minimum cost and burden on business, the regulated public and on the general public. Any costs related to the implementation of these rules are associated with monitoring licensees a nd ensuring that they are abiding by these rules as described in the economic, small business, and consumer impact statement . Additionally, foster home license applicants are not charged a fee to operate a licensed fos ter home. In fact, those who are gra nted a license are reimbursed for the services they provide via feder al and state funds.
