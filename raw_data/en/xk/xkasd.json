Summary The underlying immunological mechanisms of the rare severe allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines are poorly understood and need to be clarified.

It is important that these patients are evaluated by an allergologist to obtain specific diagnoses and advice concerning future vaccinations. This article aims to facilitate evaluation of suspected serious allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines, including a thorough medical history and skin testing, with standard steps and guidelines. The most severe allergic reaction to vaccines is anaphylaxis and different diagnostic criteria have been suggested. The widely used NIAID/FAAN criteria were published in 2006 [[2]] and has been updated by the World Allergy Organization (WAO) [[3,4]] for use in anaphylaxis of all causes. The Brighton Collaboration specifically developed guidelines, published in 2007, for adverse events after vaccinations. This guideline for anaphylaxis has three levels using a combination of symptoms to determine levels of diagnostic certainty rather than severity [[5]]. This is different from NIAID/FAAN and WAO's description, where the severity and the grading of the severity are determined. While the Brighton Collaboration system has now been widely adopted worldwide in the assessment of reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines, information on sensitivity and specificity of this approach is lacking. [ ](javascript:void(0)) HISTORY OF VACCINATION AGAINST CORONAVIRUS INFECTION Various coronaviruses cause symptomatic infections in domestic species such as dogs, cats, calves, pigs and chicken. Live and inactivated animal vaccines against coronaviruses have long been used in veterinary medicine, proving the feasibility of vaccination [[6]]. In humans, four different pathogenic human coronaviruses were identified in archived nasopharyngeal aspirates before 2002. The patients were typically reported to exhibit the mild respiratory symptoms known as the seasonal common cold. The viral strains are named HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 [[7,8]]. Successful human vaccines against these viruses have not been developed due to common mutations in these viral strains [[9]]. In 2002, a novel coronavirus, later named SARS-CoV, was reported from China in patients with atypical pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This virus had high mortality and spread worldwide, but the disease was contained with public health measures only. A number of vaccine companies started research and development programmes against SARS, but these were generally terminated when SARS was eradicated from the human population in 2004 [[9]]. Immunological studies in SARS survivors have shown lasting T-cell immunity after 17 years [[10]]. In 2012, another pathogenic novel coronavirus appeared in the Middle East region. This virus - known as MERS-CoV, it is linked to high mortality due to atypical pneumonia, ARDS and renal failure. It is still circulating locally, but human-to-human transmission is limited. SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the COVID-19 infection and is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans and Chinese investigators released the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolates on 10 January 2020. As some research groups had already established MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV as prototype pathogens to optimize vaccine design, delivery mechanisms and correlates of protection work on a vaccine was initiated almost immediately. In this way, the first human clinical trials on mRNA-vaccine formulated in lipid nanoparticles started as early as 16 March 2020 [[11]]. In the following months, clinical trials commenced with replication-incompetent adenovirus vector vaccine candidates and inactivated virus vaccines, and in May 2020 a recombinant spike-protein-based vaccine candidate was evaluated in clinical trials [[9]] ( [Table 1](#T1)).

SERIOUS ADVERSE AND ANAPHYLAXIS EVENTS IN MASS VACCINATION PROGRAMMES After UK emergency approval of the mRNA vaccine produced by Pfizer/BioNTech, BNT16262, BioNTechManufacturing GmbH ( [Table 1](#T1)), mass vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs) and high-risk patients against COVID-19 started on 8 December 2020. The next day two cases of anaphylaxis were reported among two female HCW. On 11 December, emergency use authorization was issued in the United States for Comirnaty, and six further cases were reported in the following week ( [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-19/05-COVID-Clark-508.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-19/05-COVID-Clark-508.pdf); [[12,13]]). Before the start of the mass vaccine programmes against COVID-19, serious allergic reactions and anaphylaxis in connection with vaccines were regarded as extremely rare adverse events, with an overall risk estimate of 1.31 per million doses and with rather narrow 95% confidence intervals of 0.9-1.8, defined by Brighton level 1 and 2. Reactions occurred most often in women with 80% being women [[14,15]]. Increased rates of severe reactions in women were also observed for the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines [[12]]. The severe hypersensitivity symptoms mostly started within 10-30 min of exposure. The most common symptoms were urticaria, itching, flushing, general discomfort, angioedema, breathlessness, burning sensation and fainting [[12]]. Studies have confirmed initial suspicions and suggested that the incidence of anaphylaxis after mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 is somewhat higher than previously expected, but with very low mortality. The initial Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (United States) estimate for Comirnaty using the international standard case definition from Brighton Collaboration [[5]] is 4.7 cases per 1 million vaccine doses [[12]]. Initial safety signals were based on spontaneous reports influenced by awareness of a potential safety concern for the vaccines, potential underestimation of the denominator but also increased focus on this first vaccine. Even for a more recently licensed mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 produced by Moderna, the incidence of anaphylaxis immediately postvaccination appears higher than expected, at 2.5 per million doses [[16,17]]. As of end of March 2021, the United Kingdom had vaccinated 10.9 million people with Pfizer's vaccine and had administered 13.7 million doses of AstraZeneca's (AstraZeneca, AZD1222, AstraZeneca AB, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, Sweden) chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine, DNA coding for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Vaxzevria). For 9 December 2020 to 8 April 2021, no evident significant differences existed in the reporting rate for anaphylaxis (spontaneous reports); 259 reports for the Pfizer vaccine (24 per million doses) and 455 reports for the AstraZeneca's vaccine (23 per million doses) [[18]]. Information of side effects of the vaccines have been given by healthcare professionals. The Russian adenovirus vector vaccine, Sputnik V, is based on a similar platform to the AstraZeneca vaccine (using two human adenoviral vectors, Ad5 and Ad26), and is currently being used for mass vaccination in Serbia and Hungary. Both countries have also used an inactivated whole virus vaccine, Sinopharm, BBIBP-CorV. The two latter vaccines have been used consistently for many months in mass vaccination programmes in Russia, Middle East and China, but hitherto no vaccine-specific data on serious adverse events and anaphylaxis post vaccination has been presented. A recently licensed single-dose adenovirus vector (Ad26) vaccine from Janssen Vaccine will be used in European mass vaccination programs from April 2021. The vaccine is reported to be less reactogenic than the two mRNA vaccines used in the United States, and no reports of anaphylaxis have emerged from the clinical phase 2/phase 3 studies. However, no such reactions were reported in the phase 2/phase 3 trials for the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Of note, in the phases 1-3 clinical trials of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, anyone with a history of allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine was excluded, as were those with a history of severe allergy associated with any vaccine [[19,20]]. Similar exclusion criteria were used in the Janssen and Astra Zeneca phase 3 trials ( [https://www.jnj.com/coronavirus/ensemble-1-study-protocol](https://www.jnj.com/coronavirus/ensemble-1-study-protocol); [https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1/attachment/87a97e27-03d4-40c9-8498-7e513e08d265/mmc2.pdf](https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1/attachment/87a97e27-03d4-40c9-8498-7e513e08d265/mmc2.pdf)). EXCIPENTS IN THE VACCINES POTENTIALLY CAUSING ANAPHYLAXIS Allergic reactions to vaccines are usually caused by an inactive ingredient or excipient [[21]]. It is still unclear whether excipients caused the anaphylactic reactions observed after administration of the COVID-19 vaccines [[1]]. However, polyethylene glycol (PEG, in mRNA vaccines) and its derivatives including polysorbate 80 (in viral vector vaccines) have been suggested as potential culprit allergens ( [Table 1](#T1)), possibly leading to more frequent anaphylactic reactions than to vaccines against other infectious diseases [[22,23]]. Recently, a group from the United Kingdom demonstrated PEG allergy in one of the first cases developing anaphylaxis to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom [[24]]. The patient had a previous history of anaphylaxis to other medication and milder reactions on exposure to other products suggestive of an undiagnosed PEG allergy. While PEG has not been used in vaccines before, many widely used vaccines contain polysorbate 80 [[25]]. Two of the seven vaccines presented in [Table 1](#T1) are mRNA vaccines and contain PEG 2000 (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna). Other components are less likely to be allergenic [[26]]. Polysorbate 80 is used in most other COVID vaccines in the market, that is, AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria, Janssen's vaccine, Sputnik V and the Novavax Novavax Inc, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA) [[1,25]]. Polysorbates show cross-reactivity with PEG and structurally related polymers due to shared moieties [[27]]. However, Sinopharm, a Chinese inactivated virus vaccine, contains neither PEG nor PEG derivatives [[25]]. Polyethylene glycols and other excipients that might cause anaphylaxis PEGs are polymers of ethylene oxide and have varying molecular weights, between 200 and 35 000 g/mol. PEGs have many names, such as Macrogol and Laureth-9, and are found in a multitude of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. In cosmetics, the number refers to its number of ethylene oxide units whereas molecular weight is referred to in pharmaceuticals. PEG 3350 is currently contained in more than 1000 FDA-approved medications and can be found in many tablets, topical gels, laxatives and parenteral steroids [[27]]. PEGylation is the conjugation of PEGs to drugs, leading to prolonged half-life in plasma and less immunogenicity without compromising clinical efficacy [[28,29]]. Polysorbate 80 is contained in nearly 7000 FDA-approved medications and is more commonly found in vaccines, parenteral steroids, immunoglobulin replacement and tablets [[30]]. The formulation of PEG in the mRNA vaccines is different from the PEG used most commonly in other healthcare products, both in molecular weight and due to its coformulation as a stabilizing portion of a liposome [[31-33]]. Severe reports of allergies to PEG have been published [[27,33,34,35,36,37,38]]. A review from 2016 reports 37 cases of anaphylaxis, describing the allergen as 'hidden' and overlooked, that is, people have had allergic reactions with severe symptoms to several unrelated products but connection to a seemingly inert excipient is not made. The main products containing PEG that cause anaphylaxis have been oral medications, such as analgesic tablets, antibiotic tablets, antacids and laxatives, followed by injections of depot steroids. Patients with drug allergy do not normally have an adrenaline autoinjector, however, for patients with PEG allergy there is a risk of re-exposure and severe reactions, as it is not easy to avoid PEG. The patient should therefore get a written emergency plan and be issued with an adrenaline autoinjector [[35,36]]. Due to low awareness of PEG allergy, patients reacting to healthcare, cosmetic or hygiene products or with severe reactions to, for example, antibiotics or laxatives have been misdiagnosed with idiopathic anaphylaxis or drug allergy to specific products [[35,36,37,38]]. Before being diagnosed with PEG allergy, 76-80% of the patients had experienced one or more episodes of anaphylaxis requiring adrenalin treatment [[27,35]]. The vaccine from Moderna also contains tromethamine, an organic amine widely used in several medications for topical, enteral or parenteral administration. It is also used in cosmetics as an emulsifier. One case of anaphylaxis to tromethamine in a gadolinium-based agent was reported in a 23-year-old woman; IgE-mediated trometamol allergy was detected in the patient [[39]]. Moreover, chlorhexidine, used to sterilize vaccine injection sites, may elicit allergic reactions. Specific IgE for chlorhexidine and skin testing may be used to establish a diagnosis [[40-42]]. Allergic reactions to polyethylene glycol with low and high molecular weight Allergenicity to PEG seems to increase with increasing molecular weight and higher concentration [[27,31,35,36,43,44,45,46]]. Patients diagnosed with PEG allergy find it challenging to avoid products containing PEG as PEG is very widely used. Establishing PEG molecular weight thresholds would be valuable, but presently there is not enough knowledge to provide general advice on this and patients should be warned against PEGs of all molecular weights unless they have tolerated exposure to lower molecular weights [[35,46]]. An IgE-mediated mechanism for PEG allergy has been suggested [[47]]. Standardized tests to determine circulating IgE to PEGs are not commercially available, although detection of serum IgE to PEG 10 000 in patients with documented PEG-associated anaphylaxis was recently reported using a cytometric bead assay. PEG was linked to the beads with mouse anti-PEG IgG mAbs and IgE to PEG was not detected in healthy controls [[43]]. Positive basophil activation tests or histamine release tests have also been reported in a few patients with documented anaphylaxis reactions to products containing PEG with varying results [[35,46,48-50]]. However, standardized methods are lacking. Whereas an alternative mechanism underlying reactivity to PEG has also been proposed, that is, complement activation-related pseudo-allergy [[51]], evidence of complement activation as a mechanism for acute allergic reactions to PEG in humans is inconclusive [[25,27,33]]. Direct non-IgE-mediated activation and granulation of mast cells, via binding of the lipid nanoparticles to for example Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 receptors, have also been proposed as potential mechanisms that require further investigation [[52]]. Investigation of patients suspected of an undiagnosed polyethylene glycol allergy or patients with severe allergic reactions to first dose of a COVID-19 vaccination In case of immediate type reactions to the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine a blood sample taken 1.5-2 h after the reaction should be analysed for serum tryptase. Comparison with a baseline sample taken more than 24 h after resolution of symptoms should be performed. An elevation of serum tryptase more than (baseline \u00d7 1.2) + 2 supports an IgE-mediated mechanism [[53]]. There are no data specifically addressing the use of serum tryptase in vaccination reactions, but it is used in other parts of allergology, for example, when investigating insect venom, food allergy and perioperative allergy. PEG and PEG derivatives such as polysorbate are testable components of the mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines. Published data shows skin testing to be the investigation of choice to determine IgE-mediated allergy to these agents ( [[35,36,46]]; [https://www.allergyandasthmacare.com/2021/04/updated-guidance-on-risk-of-allergic-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccines.html](https://www.allergyandasthmacare.com/2021/04/updated-guidance-on-risk-of-allergic-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccines.html)). Although skin prick tests and intradermal tests have been used [[27,36]], due to the very low prevalence of PEG allergy their predictive value is still undefined, and standardized protocols are lacking. Severe allergic reactions have been described after intradermal testing with compounds containing PEG [[36]], and currently intradermal testing is not recommended [[27]]. Systemic reactions such as generalized urticaria, facial flushing and coughing, and rarely anaphylaxis, have been described during skin prick testing, especially with higher molecular weights [[24,27,35,36,46]]. Skin testing with undiluted vaccines might be another method of evaluating the patients, but its predictive value is unknown. Hesselbach et al. [[54]] showed proportionality between molecular weight and skin prick test (SPT) reactivity. Other groups [[27,46,47,55]] indicate a need for testing several molecular weight PEGs. Moreover, SPT with lower molecular weight PEGs may require greater test concentrations to elicit a response [[27,46,56]]. Due to the risk of systemic allergic reactions on skin prick testing several groups recommend using a stepwise method, with gradually increasing molecular weights and concentrations of PEG; however, the data behind these recommendations originate from only few patients [[27,36,37,46]]. Wenande and Garvey [[27]] published a proposed algorithm for skin testing in 2016 which was very recently updated based on repeated skin testing over time in ten patients with verified PEG allergy [[46]]. This new algorithm is based on stepwise testing with increasing molecular weight PEGs starting with PEG 300 and stopping testing when a positive test is found. If testing on lower molecular weight PEGs is negative, increasing to using dilute solutions of PEG 20 000 has been shown to increase sensitivity of testing [[46]]. The study showed that skin test reactivity declines over time, so that the lower molecular weight PEGs may test negative, but higher molecular weight PEGs in increasing concentrations can be used to make the diagnosis. To asses crossreactivity to PEG derivatives skin prick testing with polysorbate 80 and poloxamer 407 is also recommended [[46]]. Intradermal tests should only be performed in SPT-negative patients and using diluted solutions [[46]]. Patients with a positive SPT against PEG or PEG derivatives are advised to avoid mRNA vaccines. The positive predictive values of SPT with PEGs and PEG derivatives is not known ( [https://www.allergyandasthmacare.com/2021/04/updated-guidance-on-risk-of-allergic-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccines.html](https://www.allergyandasthmacare.com/2021/04/updated-guidance-on-risk-of-allergic-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccines.html)), but suspected to be high based on a high number of negative controls (>350) from one centre [[46]]. Based on the limited evidence available in the literature, an approach to cases of probable PEG hypersensitivity suggested by the authors is described in [Table 2](#T2) and for the patients who reacted to the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in [Table 3](#T3).

CONCLUSION COVID-19 vaccines have become available just a year after COVID-19 was first described, providing hope that vaccination can combat this pandemic. Although not yet proven, some rare adverse anaphylaxis events after vaccination may attributed to PEG and PEG derivatives. Vaccines without PEG and polysorbate, for example, Sinopharm, are already being used for mass vaccination within the European Union and could be used for those with positive skin test to PEG or its derivatives if the adverse event profile is acceptable. In the light of increased exposure to PEGs and polysorbates in our environment and increased awareness of this rare allergy, a greater incidence of PEG hypersensitivity could be expected in the next years. It is important to investigate patients with severe allergic reactions of unknown cause to identify the rare patients with PEG allergy. Impact on daily life was shown to be better after diagnosis. As COVID-19 can cause such severe symptoms and vaccination against COVID-19 is a key global intervention, as many people as possible need to be safely vaccinated. The underlying immunological mechanisms of severe allergic reactions to the vaccines are poorly understood and urgently need clarification. Acknowledgements None.
