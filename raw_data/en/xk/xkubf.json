In 1904, the term fibrositis was coined to describe pain associated with fibrous or connective tissue.Fibromyalgia 4Current Paradigms for Diagnosing and Treating Chronic Pain are Obsolete Multiple non-psychological neurobiological factors can increase or decrease sensitivity to pain - Operative in many chronic pain states We must modify our diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms to better identify and treat the CNS contributions to chronic pain 5Mechanistic Characterization of Pain Peripheral (nociceptive) Primarily due to inflammation or mechanical damage in periphery NSAID, opioid responsive Responds to procedures Behavioral factors minor Examples Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Cancer painNeuropathic Damage or entrapment of peripheral nerves Responds to both peripheral and central pharmacological therapyCentral (non-nociceptive) Primarily due to a central disturbance in pain processing Tricyclic, neuroactive compounds most effective Behavioral factors more prominent Examples Fibromyalgia Irritable bowel syndrome Tension headache Idiopathic low back pain 6Related Symptoms and Syndromes Interstitial c ystitis, vulvodynia Tension/migraine headache disorders TMD syndrome Chronic fatigue Sleep disturbances Idiopathic LBP Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Nondermatomal paresthesiasCognitive Concerns Vasomotor complaints Neurally mediated hypotension, mitral valve prolapse Aaron LA, et al.

In population-based studies: - 30 - 40% of individuals who have grade 3/4 K/L radiographic OA have no symptoms - 10% of individuals with severe pain have normal radiographs Psychological factors explain very little of the variance between symptoms and structure2 Therapies are inadequate - NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and even opioids have small effect sizes - Arthroplasty does not predictably relieve pain, especially long-term (1) Creamer P, et. al.

For every two months on guaifenesin it reverses one year of fibromyalgia This only works if the patient avoids all salicylates No side effects except rarely transient nausea Do not use liquid guaifenesin since it contains sugar and many patients with fibromyalgia are hypoglycemic and then later insulin resistant. As insulin increases, more phosphate is released into the cells. Suggest having it made by compounding pharmacy so there is no dyes Do not use in pregnancyTreatment (Cont.) 65Guaifenesin (cont.) Dose: 300 mg BID The patient should feel worse at first if the guaifenesin is working. If the patient does not feel bad during the first week then double the dose. There should be an increase in symptoms in 10- 14 days. If this does not occur, then increase the dose to 1800 mg qd. If the patient does not feel worse in one month then increase the dose to 1200 mg BID. In 95% of the patients you will not have to go higher than 1200 mg BID.Treatment (Cont.) 66 Guaifenesin (cont.) - How long does the patient take guaifenesin\u2014 forever. It only works while they are taking it. The genetic defect that caused the problem to begin with is not fixed so the symptoms will reoccur if the guaifenesin is discontinued.
