VFC Providers must have a data logger in each public vaccine storage unit and transport cooler. Data Loggers must: Be continuous recording devices that take readings at least every 30 minutes Read temperatures from a buffered probe Display the current, minimum, and maximum temperatures on the outside of the storage unit (exceptions for centralized monitoring systems) Generate data that is reviewable, archivable (3 years) , and able to be sent to the Immunization Program for review Alarm to indicate temperatures outside p roper vaccine storage temperatures Have a current certificate of calibration testing performed within the last two years . Organization -wide monitoring systems (e.g., TempTrak, Aeroscout) and data loggers built -in to storage units can be used as long as they meet all the requirements listed "}
