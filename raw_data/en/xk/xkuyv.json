Apply effective strategies to prevent personal burnout from the effects of vicarious trauma. Explain how core values of Trauma Informed Care affect systems of care.Trauma Informed Paradigm \"What happened to this person?\" \"What's strong with you?\" Historical trauma informed: \"What tribal traumatic events happened over time?\" \"What kind of school did you and family members attend ?\"Standard Paradigm \"What's wrong with this person ?\" \"What's wrong with you?\"NOT asking about collective tribal history NOT asking about boarding school history or other tribal -specific experiences and cultureHistorical Trauma Historical Trauma and Unresolved Grief Historical trauma -Cumulative emotional and psychological wounding from massive group trauma across generations, including lifespan Historical trauma response (HTR) is a constellation of features in reaction to massive group trauma, includes historical unresolved grief (similar to Child of Survivors Complex re: Jewish Holocaust survivors and descendants, Japanese American internment camp survivors and descendants), depression, PTSD (Brave Heart, 1998, 1999, 2000) traumaWhat Is Trauma? \"trauma results from an event , series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual's functioning and physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well- being \" (SAMHSA, 2012, p. 2)Types of Trauma Single event E.g. being in a car crash, natural disaster, sexual assault Multiple events, over time E.g. incest, war, racism, micro -aggressions Can lead to Complex Trauma Vicarious or secondary trauma Multigenerational including historical trauma Complex traumaCaveats What is traumatic to 1 person may not be to another Trauma affects a person's neurobiology in ways that are long lasting or permanent Trauma can lead to adverse health outcomes PTSD Not everyone who has experienced trauma develops PTSD or adverse health outcomes Cumulative trauma has cumulative effects There are effective treatments for traumaImpact of Trauma on American Indian and Alaska Native Communities AI/AN between 2 -3 times more likely to meet PTSD criteria compared to US adult population 2.5 times greater risk than the national average of experiencing physical , emotional , and/or sexual abuse AI/AN youth have the highest rates of emotional or physical neglect across all populations Up to 74% of AI/AN youth have experienced at least one traumatic event during childhood 12-16% of AI/AN homes experience alcohol and/or drug abuse (national average is 4-6%) Unresolved grief and historical trauma can become ingrained in the identity of individuals and communities Slide courtesy of Christopher Morris Gone & Trimble, 2012; DS Bigfoot, 2008; Brave Heart & DeBruyn, 1998; Copeland et al., Center for Children in Poverty, 2007; Beals et.al., 2013Culture and Trauma Culture determines acceptable responses to trauma and shapes the expression of distress Culture affects what qualifies as a legitimate health concern and which symptoms warrant help Culture can provide a source of strength, unique coping strategies, and specific resources.

Trauma Informed Care is an organizational structure and treatment framework that involves understanding, recognizing, and responding to the effects of all types of trauma. Trauma Informed Care also emphasizes physical, psychological and emotional safety for both consumers and providers, and helps survivors rebuild a sense of control and empowerment.Trauma Informed Care \"Trauma -informed organizations, programs, and services are based on an understanding of the vulnerabilities or triggers of trauma survivors that traditional service delivery approaches may exacerbate, so that these services and programs can be more supportive and avoid re -traumatization.\" Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC)Standard Human Services Paradigm Primary goal of services are stability and the absence of symptoms or social problems, not patient wellness Services crisis driven Focused on acute problem(s) Time limits of visits, services driven by financial and administrative needs (not patient needs) Medical model Problems attributed to the individual, limited focus on social context Problems treated in separate service systems, not integrated Community Connections -Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC)Standard Trauma- Informed Community Connections Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC)Hierarchical Trust is assumed Safety is assumed Patient is passive recipient of services (or chooses from a menu)Collaborative Trust is developed over time Steps are taken to ensure safety Patient is encouraged/skills developed to express choiceWhat is Historical Trauma Informed Care? Understanding the importance of cross generational and ancestral ties in tribal communities and families Addressing cultural norms for addressing trauma and healing, traditional bereavement Examining the collective traumatic tribal history as well as traditional cultural wisdom and resilience Why Institute Trauma Informed Care?

Do providers work in areas outside the office? (patients' homes, etc.) How safe are they in these settings? Is the clinic/office/service unit physically safe? Assistance if needed Adequate space to see patients M difi d f C ti C lt f T I f d C (CCTIC) C it C tiCreating a Safe Context -Emotional Safety Do providers feel comfortable bringing their concerns to team meetings, supervision, their supervisor? Does the program look at emotional safety needs of providers, and support staff? Is spiritual safety considered? Modified from CCTIC Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC) -Community ConnectionsTrustworthiness Do managers/supervisors understand the work of direct care providers? Is self care encouraged/supported? How are dual relationships handled? How are boundaries protected? Is there conflict with your agency and tribal leadership on decision making and care plans? Are expectations clear and consistent? Modified from CCTIC Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC) -Community ConnectionsChoice Is there a balance of autonomy and clear guidelines? Are providers allowed to give input into factors affecting their work? Caseload Working hours Vacation/leave Trainings offered Approaches to clinical care Location and d\u00e9cor of office/clinic Modified from CCTIC Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC) -Community ConnectionsCollaboration Is provider life experience and history respected? Awareness of strengths and skills? Are providers' opinions valued by management? Is feedback welcomed? Are changed in system/workload etc. done collaboratively? Modified from Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC) -Community ConnectionsEncouragement Are individuals' strengths and skills utilized maximally? Do providers do work that is consistent with their values? Are there adequate and relevant training opportunities? Do providers receive training on trauma, historical trauma, trauma informed care? Do directors/supervisors have a positive, affirming attitude? Is feedback constructive rather than critical? Modified from Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC) -Community ConnectionsStaff Training Does the program train non native staff about culture? Do staff feel comfortable talking about culture? Blind spots? Does the program train on the concept of internalized depression? Does the program train on trauma, including the impact of workplace stressors? Do staff feel spiritually safe? Is there opportunity for spiritual cleansing?Steps to Creating a Trauma Informed System Culture shift Not just new information or services New way of thinking and acting Involves everyone: administrators, supervisors, line staff, clinicians, patients, families Begin with small steps Use the same principles we use with patients Safety, trustworthiness, choice, collaboration, encouragement Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC)Culture Shift Incorporate knowledge about trauma and HT into all aspects of services Not just for patients or providers we know have experienced trauma Minimize re -victimization of patients and providers Do no harm/ non maleficence Awareness that the service system (IHS, medical, dental) has been re-traumatizing to patients and to providers Modified from Creating Cultures of Trauma Informed Care (CCTIC)Upcoming Webinars and Case Consultations for Healthcare Providers Part I: ACES and Why They Matter in Healthcare 9/26 Part II : Trauma , Attachment & DSM 5 Diagnoses 10/17 Part III: Vicarious Trauma & Burnout in Healthcare Providers & How a Trauma Informed System Can Help 11/15 Monthly case consultations 10:00- 11:00 MST Sept 20, Oct 18,.
