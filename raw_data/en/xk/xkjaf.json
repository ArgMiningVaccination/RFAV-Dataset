Safety and security Political situation The political situation is volatile in Nicaragua. The country has experienced periods of political unrest since April 2018, resulting in hundreds of deaths and detentions. Since the 2021 Presidential elections, Nicaraguan government officials and law enforcement have severely repressed those critical or opposed to government policies. According to UN reports, Nicaraguan authorities: - undertake arbitrary arrests and detentions - censure media - prevent certain individuals from departing Nicaragua by air or land for political reasons - arbitrarily seize and search private property, including personal phones and computers for anti-government content - arbitrarily charge individuals with terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime offenses for political reasons If you are in Nicaragua: - refrain from discussing the political situation in public or online - avoid all political activities - avoid posting information on social media The ability of the Embassy of Canada to Nicaragua to provide consular assistance may be limited in some circumstances. Crime Petty crime Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Crime against property, such as house and car burglaries also occur frequently. - in the poor neighbourhoods of the following cities: - Bluefields - Ciudad Sandino Le\u00f3n - Managua - Masaya - Matagalpa - Tipitapa - in remote areas such as beach communities on the Pacific coast - in the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region In Managua, the following neighbourhoods face very high levels of assault and robbery incidents: - Mercado oriental - Reparto Shick - - Am\u00e9ricas 1 y Am\u00e9ricas 2 - Barrio Camilo Ortega In these areas, thefts from cars have occurred while drivers were waiting at red lights with open windows. Thefts also commonly occur in: - popular tourist areas - bus terminals, train stations and airports - hotel lobbies - restaurants, including patios Border areas also often see higher criminal activity and violence. Criminal gangs are more active in the border areas with Costa Rica and Honduras. Generally, the police are understaffed and lack resources. While travelling: - ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times - don't keep your passport and other types of ID in the same place and carry a photocopy rather than the original, including the Nicaraguan entry stamp - be aware of your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas - avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery - avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables - avoid deserted areas - avoid walking alone at night - choose well-secured accommodation While driving: - avoid picking up hitchhikers - keep your windows closed and doors locked at all times - keep your belongings out of reach - never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk - use secure parking facilities, especially overnight - don't stop to change a flat tire in an isolated area - be aware of strangers offering their help - use the official border crossings only Violent crime Violent crime, including murders, armed robberies and sexual assaults, occurs although difficult to assess and likely under reported. Most violent incidents are organized crime-related or politically motivated. Paramilitary forces and para-police, which are armed civilians in plain clothes, have committed exactions against citizens. Assaults mostly take place in major cities but sometimes also in rural areas. Foreigners are rarely targeted but you could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Express kidnappings Express kidnappings, where kidnappers demand small immediate ransoms, have occurred. Kidnappers usually take the victim to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal. The victim is sometimes held overnight for a second withdrawal the next day. Criminal taxi drivers sometimes use this ploy. - Only use reputable taxi companies - Avoid hailing a taxi on the street - If you are threatened, do not resist Demonstrations and civil unrest Demonstrations and civil unrest may occur. Nicaraguan law prohibits political activity by foreigners. Participating in demonstrations or promoting dissent, including on social media, may result in you being detained or deported. Even peaceful demonstrations, although infrequent, can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. - Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place - Follow the instructions of local authorities - Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations [Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings) Fraud Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards: - cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN - pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others - avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature - use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business - check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements Women's safety Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Local authorities may not regard harassment as unlawful unless physical contact or explicit threats are made. Water activities Coastal waters can be dangerous, especially on the Pacific Coast. Riptides are common. Rescue services may not be consistent with international standards. Warning signs, lifeguards and rescue equipment are often limited. Drownings occur regularly. - Never swim alone, after hours or outside marked areas - Consult residents and tour operators for information on possible hazards and safe swimming areas - Only undertake scuba diving and other water activities with a well-established company - Monitor weather warnings - Follow the instructions of local authorities Adventure tourism Outdoor activities, such as white-water rafting, scuba diving, surfing, canopy touring, hiking other adventure activities can be dangerous if unprepared. Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even during summer. If you intend to practice adventure tourism: - never do so alone, and do not part with your expedition companions - obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be before setting out - buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation - ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity - avoid venturing off marked trails - avoid camping or sleeping overnight on beaches - ensure that you're adequately equipped and bring sufficient water - stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard - know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal - inform a family member or friend of your itinerary - refrain from using facilities or equipment if you have doubts on their safety Road travel Road conditions Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Except on the Pan-American Highway, driving conditions may be hazardous due to: - potholes - inadequate lighting - narrow or unpaved roads - lack of guardrails - lack of traffic signs - unnamed streets - roaming livestock Road safety Drivers don't always respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds. They may be aggressive and reckless. Drinking and driving is prevalent. Vehicles are poorly maintained. Roadside assistance is not available.

Vehicles are generally in poor condition. Buses Pickpockets often target tourists on public buses. Travellers have also been assaulted when getting off a bus. - Don't reveal your intended destination - Don't share a cab with strangers at the end of a bus ride - Be cautious of any advice that could convince you to get off a bus earlier than planned to take a shortcut Taxis Many taxis are in poor condition and lack safety features such as seat belts. Express kidnappings have occurred in unauthorized taxis. It's common practice for taxi drivers to pick up other passengers en route. If using taxi services while in Nicaragua: - use only Pink taxis booked ahead of time or a trusted ride-sharing app - agree on a fare with the driver for a private ride before departure - avoid sharing taxis with strangers - note driver's name and plate number - avoid boarding taxis at taxi stands or flagging taxis in the street Air travel We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.

Routine vaccines Be sure that your [routine vaccinations](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/canadian-immunization-guide-part-3-vaccination-specific-populations.html), as per your [province or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/provincial-territorial-immunization-information.html), are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination. Some of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others. Pre-travel vaccines and medications You may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary. Yellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements [Yellow fever](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/yellow-fever.html) is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito. Travellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection. Risk - There is no risk of yellow fever in this country. Country Entry Requirement* - Proof of vaccination is required if you are coming from a country [where yellow fever occurs.](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission-and-countries-requiring-yellow-fever-vaccination-(november-2022)) Recommendation - Vaccination is not recommended. - Discuss travel plans, activities, and destinations with a health care professional. - Contact a designated [Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre)well in advance of your trip to arrange for vaccination. [Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/travel-health/yellow-fever.html#select-centre ) * It is important to note that [country entry requirements](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/vaccination-requirements-and-recommendations-for-international-travellers-and-malaria-situation-per-country-2022-edition) may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest [diplomatic or consular office](http://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/reps.aspx?view=d) of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements. Hepatitis A [Hepatitis A](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/hepatitis-a) is a disease of the liver spread through contaminated food and water or contact with an infected person. All those travelling to regions with a risk of hepatitis A infection should get vaccinated. Measles [Measles](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/measles.html) is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air. Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles. Hepatitis B [Hepatitis B](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-b.html) is a disease of the liver spread through blood or other bodily fluids. Travellers who may be exposed (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) should get vaccinated. COVID-19 [Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) ](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html)is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air. It is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally. Before travelling, verify your destination's COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19. Influenza Seasonal [influenza](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/flu-influenza.html) occurs worldwide. The flu season usually runs from November to April in the northern hemisphere, between April and October in the southern hemisphere and year round in the tropics.

For more travel recommendations, see the travel health notice: [Zika disease)](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/chagas) is a risk in this country. It is caused by a parasite spread by infected triatomine bugs. The infection can be inactive for decades, but humans can eventually develop complications causing disability and even death. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from triatomine bugs, which are active at night, by using mosquito nets if staying in poorly-constructed housing. There is no vaccine available for Chagas disease. Animal precautions Some infections, such as [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves. Travellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.

Transfer to a Canadian prison Canada and Nicaragua accede the Inter-American Convention on Serving Criminal Sentences abroad. This enables a Canadian imprisoned in Nicaragua to request a transfer to a Canadian prison to complete a sentence. The transfer requires the agreement of both Canadian and Nicaraguan authorities. This process can take a long time, and there is no guarantee that the transfer will be approved by either or both sides. The legal system is generally cumbersome and not always transparent. If you are arrested in Nicaragua, even for a minor incident, you should expect long delays to resolve your case and you may not be allowed to leave the country. The ability of the Embassy of Canada to Nicaragua to provide consular assistance may be limited in some circumstances. Drugs Penalties for possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe. Convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences or heavy fines. - Pack your own luggage and monitor it closely at all times - Never transport other people's packages, bags or suitcases Useful links 2SLGBTQI+ travellers Nicaraguan law does not prohibit sexual acts between individuals of the same sex.

If you are a Canadian citizen, but also a citizen of Nicaragua, our ability to offer you consular services may be limited while you're there. You may also be subject to different [entry/exit requirements](#entryexit). [Travellers with dual citizenship](http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/dual-citizenship) International Child Abduction The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international treaty. It can help parents with the return of children who have been removed to or retained in certain countries in violation of custody rights. It does not apply between Canada and Nicaragua. If your child was wrongfully taken to, or is being held in Nicaragua by an abducting parent: - act as quickly as you can - consult a lawyer in Canada and in Nicaragua to explore all the legal options for the return of your child - report the situation to the nearest Canadian government office abroad or to the Vulnerable Children's Consular Unit at Global Affairs Canada by calling the Emergency Watch and Response Centre. If your child was removed from a country other than Canada, consult a lawyer to determine if The Hague Convention applies. Be aware that Canadian consular officials cannot interfere in private legal matters or in another country's judicial affairs.
