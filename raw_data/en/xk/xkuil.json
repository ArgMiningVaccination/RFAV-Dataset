You might experience more severe side effects that last for weeks and months and negatively impact your life. Furthermore, you might have experienced more stress during the pandemic, such as a job loss, challenges in all your relationships, stress with masks, and other restrictions. I will also help you clear these traumatic events. I'm looking forward to assisting you in clearing the root causes of these side effects energetically and harmonizing your overall body/mind/spirit system. Clearing vaccine side effects in two ways: - 1-step clearing approach: Clearing vaccine side effects after you got the vaccine - 2-step clearing approach: Preparing your vaccine appointment to avoid side effects in the first place and re-establishing the integrity of your energy field after you received the vaccine Both options also include [auric clearing work](https://energyfieldmastery.com/advanced-auric-clearing/) and specific protocols that are designed to help clear the side effects of these vaccines.

Feedback from clients: \"I felt so much better with the vaccine clearing compared to the other two vaccines I got. Not even my arm felt heavy or hurt me in any way after I got the vaccine. I was back at work right after the clearing. Fantastic!\" -Michael, a few hours after the session \"My arm already feels much better, my neck is also relaxing, and my nausea is going away as we speak. I feel so much lighter!\" \u2014 Ramona, right after the session, three days after the vaccine \"I just wanted to let you know that all the pain is gone and I feel so much lighter.
