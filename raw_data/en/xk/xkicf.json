On the first anniversary of Sputnik V registration official data from leading countries confirms the vaccine's high safety and efficacy profile. The safety and efficacy of Sputnik V and Sputnik Light was confirmed by numerous publications in the leading international scientific journals including The Lancet and Vaccines. The use of adenovirus vector technology for vector vaccines has been gaining momentum since the 1980s, and is safe and effective, which has been proven in multiple studies. The Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology is the world's leading research institution founded in 1891. The center runs one of the unique \"virus libraries\" in the world and has its own vaccine production facility. Gamaleya Research Center has recently received an international patent for Ebola vaccine using adenovirus vector. The vaccine has received a registration certificate from the Russian Ministry of Health and under emergency rules adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic can be used to vaccinate the population in Russia. Sputnik V is one of the three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90%. Sputnik V's efficacy was validated by internationally peer reviewed data published in The Lancet. Russia is open to international cooperation in combating the global threat of the COVID-19 pandemic and other future epidemics. We are actively cooperating with more than 14 countries producing our vaccine abroad, including India, China, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Iran, Italy, South Korea, Argentina, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Belarus, Serbia, Turkey, Vietnam, etc. We are looking forward to new partners willing to join this initiative and help us save lives. Marie-Paule Kieny Director of Research at INSERM ...the research publications of the Gamaleya Institute support the data of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) on the efficacy of Sputnik V against the coronavirus infection. Hugo Pizzi Infectious Disease Specialist, Epidemiologist, Master in Public Health, and Professor at the National University of C\u00f3rdoba So, having 2 different types of viral vectors allows of immunizing people more strongly. Now, the world started working to see if one could combine the second dose of one brand with the first one of another brand but, in general, I am convinced that we should respect the creators. Gaeqa Saeed Al-Saleh Bahrain's Health Minister Our data has confirmed the high efficacy and safety of Sputnik V during its use in Bahrain. This vaccine is one of a number of approved vaccines made available free of charge to citizens and residents in the Kingdom. Mohammed Ahmed Al-Jaber UAE Ambassador to Russia The final phase of research and clinical trials showed that the Sputnik V vaccine's effectiveness stands at 91.4%, while the vaccine prevents 100% of severe cases. From the first days of the pandemic, Russia and the UAE have emphasized the importance of joint efforts to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. Guly\u00e1s Gergely Member of the National Assembly of Hungary The results of all the tests will be announced. However, according to the data available today, the vaccination results (in case of some vaccines \u2014 in the amount of over half a million doses, and in case of others \u2014 in the amount of one million doses) show that the Sinopharm vaccine is better than Pfizer, but Sputnik is the best of all. Peter Altmaier Minister of Economics Both Germany and Russia, with Biontech and Sputnik V, are among the pioneers in the development of vaccines against corona. Naturally, Sputnik V must be approved in the European Union. Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez President of Argentina We are very excited about the possibility of producing Sputnik V in Argentina, a vaccine with which we are already protecting a large part of our population with excellent results. It will be a great opportunity to advance in the fight against the pandemic not only in Argentina, but also in Latin America. Dr Naor Bar-Zeev International Vaccine Access Center, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, USADr. Tom InglesbyDirector of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health The two studies by Logunov and colleagues have several strengths. First, adenoviruses are ubiquitous, so humans might not be immunologically naive. A second strength is the threshold for neutralisation used in the two studies. A third strength is that the vaccine, similar to other before it, induced broad immune responses. Although not specifically discussed, the results imply a T-helper1-cell-weighted response that might be important for vaccine safety, potentially reducing the risk of antibodydependent enhanced disease. A fourth strength was development of two vaccine formulations, frozen and lyophilised. A lyophilised formulation could mean stability within the existing global vaccine refrigerated cold chain that is needed to maintain vaccine efficacy from factory to recipient, a hurdle other vaccines are yet to address. Although more costly to produce at scale, product stability will maximise reach in remote terrain, a must if universal and equitable coverage is to be achieved. Prof Nadey Hakim Vice President of the British Red Cross, Vice President of the International Medical Sciences Academy The results of clinical trials of the Russian vaccine Sputnik V have demonstrated impressive results, which have now been recognized by the international medical community. The vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective with no serious side effects identified and uses a proven platform based on human adenoviral vectors, which is currently the safest mechanism for introducing the genetic code of the virus spike into the human body. This approach has been thoroughly studied not only in Russia but also internationally. Russia has a long and successful track record developing vaccines and remains a global leader in this field. We hope that the vaccine will soon become available across the world to help stop the devastating pandemic and enable people to return to normal life. Dr Muhammad Munir Lecturer in Molecular Virology at the Lancaster University There are features that make Sputnik V a promising candidate. The idea of using two different adenoviruses as vector is superior over many vaccines in the frontline. Generally, the immune system perceive the vector proteins as antigen similar to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, so it elicit immune response against those proteins as well. If people are reimmunized (as second dose or repeated vaccine), the pre-existing immunity can compromise the efficacy of second vaccine dose. Using a vector of different nature, as is the in Sputnik V, will avoid this problem. Prof Brendan Wren Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine The data on the Russian vaccine studies reported in the Lancet are encouraging - demonstrating the safety and immunogenicity of the adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccines. Polina Stepensky Chair of the Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy Department at Hadassah hospital, Israel First I should say to Russian scientists and Russian health professionals is 'Bravo!'. This technology and scientific approach we perfectly understand and absolutely approve. You have made a real breakthrough in science and in medicine. We are really grateful that you have done a wonderful job. It is remarkable that stable humoral as well as cell-mediated immune response is generated. This is achieved through the use of two different vectors delivering the drug and, at the same time, solving the problem of a possible neutralizing effect on the second injection. The very high efficiency of two selected adenoviruses has been proven. Thus, the platform used by the Gamaleya Institute is the correct platform. The work done inspires great respect, and the vaccine itself is worthy of study and use. The Jerusalem Post 21.08.2020 Dr. Stephane Gayet Professor at Strasbourg University, doctor at Strasbourg University Hospital This is a valuable and effective vaccine that I personally look forward to. I am very interested in the work that Russian researchers have done. I realized that one of the most advanced methods was being used - the adenoviral vector method. Dr. Fabio Vilas-Boas Pinto Health Secretary of the State of Bahia The Government of the State of Bahia, in Brazil, is very pleased with the agreement signed with the Sovereign Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, which will guarantee access to the Sputnik V vaccine for the Brazilian people, as soon as it is approved by the Brazilian national regulatory authorities. As it is a vaccine built using human adenovirus, which is one of the safest and most effective vaccine development platforms in the world, we believe that the results of the ongoing phase 3 clinical trials will confirm the data observed in phases 1 and 2. G V Prasad Co-Chairman and Managing Director of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories We are pleased to partner with RDIF to bring the vaccine to India. The Phase I and II results have shown promise, and we will be conducting Phase-III trials in India to meet the requirements of the Indian regulators. Sputnik V vaccine could provide a credible option in our fight against COVID 19 in India. Shavkat Ismailov Chairman of LAXISAM Group of Companies Cooperation on the Sputnik V vaccine with RDIF plays an important role. The vaccine was created by Russian scientists based on advanced scientific and clinical research. Zhong Nanshan Director of the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases, China I am highly appraised the vaccine against COVID-19, developed by the Gamaleya Center. Let me congratulate your country on the completion of the state registration procedure. Russian adenoviral vaccine is safe and should successfully complete of its clinical trials. RIA Novosti 20.08.2020 Hildegund Ertl Professor, Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, USA From what I've seen out there, they are probably the most promising platform. C&EN 12.05.2020 Ian Jones Virology professor at Reading University, United Kingdom There is enough general background data on recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines to assume the vaccine itself will be safe at the usual doses. BusinessDay Ashwani Mahajan National co-convener of Swadeshi Jagran Manch, India Once the efficacy issue is resolved, then the cost would be an important issue. My feeling is that on both these accounts, the Russian vaccine would pass the test. Sputnik Denis Logunov Deputy Research Director of the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology The efficacy of Sputnik V vaccine against the Delta variant exceeds 90% since Sputnik V demonstrates a smaller decrease in efficacy against Delta than any other vaccine that has published its results with respect to the Delta variant. Interfax 29.06.2021 Kirill Dmitriev CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund Sputnik V became the first vaccine in the world that proved how well \"cocktail\" vaccines worked. Sputnik V in itself is a well-mixed \"cocktail\" of two components - Ad5 and Ad26 RBC 04.06.2021 Aleksandr Gintsburg Director of the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation The antibodies that are formed by using Sputnik V protect from all strains known today - from the British one to the Delta variant, the Indian one. Gazeta.ru 20.06.2021 Kirill Dmitriev CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund \"It's a Sputnik moment... Americans were surprised when they heard Sputnik's beeping. It's the same with this vaccine. Russia will have got there first,\" said Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, which is financing Russian vaccine production, referring to the successful 1957 launch of the world's first satellite by the Soviet Union. CNN 29.07.2020 Alexander Gintsburg Director of the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation Our technology is patented, unique and with parameters which, I feel confident to claim, exceed the capabilities of analogous products being developed in the West <...> most probably, if there is any borrowing, it will be our immunization scheme to be borrowed, and we will be happy to share our hacks with the colleagues, should they need. Sputnik 17.07.2020 Alexander Gintsburg Director of the National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology Several vaccines will not overlap each other at all. According to general considerations, vaccinations should have a certain time gap; two-three weeks are quire sufficient,\" the expert said. \"Our immune system is very smart and this time will be enough for it to understand how to behave properly in respect of new antigens introduced as the vaccine. TASS 19.07.2020 The particles that we use for vaccination are made on the basis of the adenovirus. They are not live ones. The term 'live' applies to particles that can reproduce themselves. Those in question are unable to breed, so there should be no fear they might cause some harm to our body. There are no factors for this. 05.08.2020 I don't conquer markets \u2014 I develop treatments. And I need my treatment to be good and effective. Who will move it and how is important, but it's secondary. You can't be a microbiologist or virologist right now and stay out of this. Meduza 23.07.2020 It is time to stop the never-ending debates about the most effective means to combat the coronavirus. They are jeopardizing lives, as well as the world economy. Countries around the globe must jointly put in place best practice\u2014including mandatory mask wearing, maintaining social distancing, and sharing readily available solutions\u2014before it is too late. Our fund is cooperating with many nations in this field. We believe that only through a fully cooperative, global approach can this and future pandemics be successfully combated. Newsweek 14.07.2020 It would be wrong to say that we've managed to create a vaccine from scratch in a short time. Four decades have passed since adenoviral vector technology was introduced into practice. Over these four decades, a technological platform was created that has been tested on tens of thousands of people, both on the basis of the 5th and the 26th serotype vector. Since 2015, more than 3,000 people have been vaccinated with adenoviral vector-based vaccines developed at the Gamaleya Centre. Therefore, it was not a 5-month effort in any way, but work over several decades. 17.08.2020 Felix Ershov Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences The creation of an effective coronavirus vaccine is a landmark event not only for Russian science and industry, but also for the entire world. The safety of the vaccine is guaranteed, since it employs a cold virus that is harmless to humans and does not contain the coronavirus itself, while only a part of its genetic code is present, thereby ruling out the possibility of infection. We have obtained an effective tool which is capable of winning the war against the pandemic! Felix Ershov 11.08.2020 "}
