This is bad news because hypertension is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular events like strokes and heart attacks. Luckily, there are many highly effective approaches for treating elevated blood pressure (diet, life-style, medication, etc.), and the drug management of hypertension has improved over the last few decades. But unfortunately all anti-hypertensive drugs have side-effects and some patients look towards so-called alternative medicine ( [SCAM](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SCAM-So-Called-Alternative-Medicine-Societas/dp/1845409701/ref=pd_rhf_dp_p_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=449PJJDXNTY60Y418S5J)) to normalise their blood pressure. Therefore, we have to ask: are SCAMs effective treatments for hypertension? Because of the prevalence of hypertension, this is a question of great importance for public health. In 2005, I addressed the issue by publishing a [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16392435/) entitled 'Complementary/alternative medicine for hypertension: a mini-review'. Here is its abstract: Many hypertensive patients try complementary/alternative medicine for blood pressure control. Based on extensive electronic literature searches, the evidence from clinical trials is summarised. Numerous herbal remedies, non-herbal remedies and other approaches have been tested and some seem to have antihypertensive effects. The effect size is usually modest, and independent replications are frequently missing. The most encouraging data pertain to garlic, autogenic training, biofeedback and yoga. More research is required before firm recommendations can be offered. Since the publication of this paper, more systematic reviews have become available. In order to get an overview of this evidence, I conducted a few simple Medline searches for systematic reviews (SRs) of SCAM published between 2005 and today. I included only SRs that were focussed on just one specific therapy as a treatment of just one specific condition, namely hypertension (omitting SRs with titles such as 'Alternative treatments for cardiovascular conditions'). Reviews on prevention were also excluded. Here is what I found (the conclusions of each SR is quoted verbatim): [A 2020 SR of auricular acupressure including 18 RCTs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32655667/): The results demonstrated a favorable effect of auricular acupressure to reduce blood pressure and improve sleep in patients with hypertension and insomnia.

ALMOST 100 NEW SRs! To be honest, if I had known the volume of the material, I would probably not have tackled this task. Since the publication of my mini-review in 2005, there has been an explosion of similar papers: - 1 in 2005 - 2 in 2006 - 3 in 2007 - 2 in 2008 - 1 in 2009 - 4 in 2010 - 2 in 2011 - 8 in 2012 - 8 in 2013 - 12 in 2014 - 12 in 2015 - 6 in 2016 - 9 in 2017 - 7 in 2018 - 12 in 2019 As this is based on very simple Medline searches, the list is certainly not complete. Despite this fact, several conclusions seem to emerge: - There is no shortage of SCAMs that have been tested for hypertension. - Most seem to have positive effects; in many cases, they seem too good to be true. - Many of the SRs are of poor methodological quality, based on poor quality primary studies, published in less than reputable journals. Some SRs, for instance, include studies without a control group which is likely to lead to false-positive overall conclusions about the effectiveness of the SCAM in question. - In recent years, there are more and more SRs by Chinese authors focussed on Chinese herbal mixtures that are unknown and unobtainable outside China. These SRs are invariably based on studies published in Chinese language in journals that are inaccessible. This means it is almost impossible for the reader, reviewer or editor to check their accuracy. The reliability of the conclusions of these SRs must therefore be doubted. - Most of the primary studies included in the SRs lack long-term data. Thus the usefulness of the SCAM in question is questionable. - With several of the SCAMs, the dose of the treatment and treatment schedule is less than clear. For instance, one might ask how frequently a patient should have acupuncture to control her hypertension. - Some of the SCAMs assessed in these SRs seem of doubtful practicality. For instance, it might not be feasible nor economical for patients to receive regular acupuncture to manage their blood pressure. - Several contradictions emerge from some of the SRs of the same modality. This is particularly confusing because [SRs are supposed to be the most reliable type of evidence](https://edzardernst.com/2012/11/what-is-and-what-isnt-clinical-evidence-and-why-is-the-distinction-important/). In most instances, however, the explanation can easily be found by looking at the quality of the SRs. If SRs are based on uncontrolled studies, or if they fail to critically evaluate the reliability of the included primary trials, they are likely to arrive at conclusions that are too positive. Examples for such confusion are the multiple SRs of co-enzyme Q10 or the three yoga SRs of 2014. - Because of this confusion, SCAM advocates are able to select false-positive SRs to support their opinion that SCAM is effective. - Despite a substantial amount of positive evidence, none of the SCAMs have become part of the routine in the management of hypertension. A 2013 statement by the American Heart Association entitled [Beyond medications and diet: alternative approaches to lowering blood pressure: a scientific statement from the american heart association](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23608661/)concluded that it is reasonable for all individuals with blood pressure levels >120/80 mm Hg to consider trials of alternative approaches as adjuvant methods to help lower blood pressure when clinically appropriate. A suggested management algorithm is provided, along with recommendations for prioritizing the use of the individual approaches in clinical practice based on their level of evidence for blood pressure lowering, risk-to-benefit ratio, potential ancillary health benefits, and practicality in a real-world setting. What lessons might this brief overview of SRs teach us? I think the following points are worth considering: - Systematic reviews are the best type of evidence we have for estimating the effectiveness of treatments. But it is essential that they include a strong element of CRITICAL evaluation of the primary studies. Without it, a SR is incomplete and potentially counter-productive. - The primary studies of SCAM are far too often of poor quality. This means that researchers should thrive to improve the rigour of their investigations. - Both poor-quality primary studies and uncritically conducted SRs are prone to yielding findings that are too good to be true. - Editors and reviewers have a responsibility to prevent the publication of trials and SRs that are of poor quality and thus likely to mislead us. - Those SCAMs that have shown promising effects on hypertension (for instance Tai chi) should now be submitted to further independent scrutiny to find out whether their efficacy and usefulness can be confirmed, for instance, by 24-h ambulatory and daily home blood pressure monitoring and studies testing their acceptability in real life settings. Subsequently, we ought to determine whether the SCAM in question can be reasonably integrated in routine blood pressure management. - The adjunctive use of a SCAM that has been proven to be effective and practical seems a reasonable approach. Yet, it requires proper scientific scrutiny. - There is a paucity of cost-effectiveness studies and investigations of the risks of SCAM which needs to be addressed before any SCAM is considered for routine care.
