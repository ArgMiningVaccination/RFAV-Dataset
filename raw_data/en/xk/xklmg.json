The Department owns a large anddiverse range of land equipment worth around \u00a35.6 billion and there are over15,000 different repairable items in the inventory. Each year, the Departmentspends some \u00a3290 million on a wide range of repair and overhaul work. A mixture of private sector providers and in-house agencies, principally theArmy Base Repair Organisation (ABRO), conduct the repairs on theDepartment's behalf. 2 The Department's 1998 Strategic Defence Review outlined the need for major savings in order to fund force restructuring and future equipment programmes.The Department therefore is seeking to reduce the cost of major repair andoverhaul. In doing so, the Department is keeping in view the need to retainrepair capacity for strategically vital equipment, to \"surge\" repair provision priorto hostilities, and to ensure value for money in a highly monopolistic sector. At present, the Department allocates rather than competes much of its repair work. 3 This Report examines the effectiveness of the Department's management of the major repair and overhaul of land equipment. In addition to documentaryreview and interviews with Departmental staff, our methodology (detailed in Appendix 1) centred on a survey of land Integrated Project Teams (IPTs)within the Defence Logistics Organisation and detailed examination of asample of 14 equipments and sub-assemblies. We also visited a number ofindustrial repair providers. 4 We found that the Department has done much to improve the management of major repair and overhaul and recognises that there is more to do, includingthe need to address the future role and shape of ABRO. It has reorganised itssupply organisation and is introducing many business improvements, includingnew information technology to support better logistics management. Industry istaking a wider role in the support of equipment and there are a number ofinnovative projects underway as part of this. The Department has incompleteinformation on equipment usage, repair activities and costs, and somemanagement practices could be improved. The Department also needs toaddress the future role and shape of its in-house provider, ABRO. Withoutresolving key issues - relating to the unclear military case for retaining ABRO,questions over the extent to which truly competitive procurement of repair andoverhaul can be achieved, and uncertainty over the longer-term ownership ofABRO - there are wider risks, for example, that IPTs may not act in a fully co-ordinated way and that the Department's major repair and overhaul businesswill not be cost-effective.

Using the existing performance measures, it appears that theDepartment's performance is good on the whole. But these performancemeasures are not comprehensive and the Department needs to continue toimprove its performance measures - for example, demand fulfilment is not yetmeasured and there is only limited measurement of equipment reliability. Andthere appears to be scope for major repair and overhaul to be more cost-effective. For example, repair loop times are very long and compareunfavourably with some sectors of industry. Consequently, for some repairlines, the Department holds excessive stocks of repairables - the Departmentrecently identified stock worth over \u00a3300 million for disposal. The Department has made important changes to its supply organisation and to the way it conductsbusiness 6 The Defence Logistics Organisation was launched in April 2000, creating a new unified logistics provider for the Armed Forces. It has a clear high level missionand vision for the Department's logistics activities, including for land equipmentsupport. The Defence Logistics Organisation also has a key strategic goal toreduce output costs by 20 per cent by 2005 while maintaining or improving thequality of its outputs. The introduction of IPTs has created a single supplierwithin the Department for the support of each equipment in a cost-effective way. 7 The introduction of resource based accounting and whole life costing is focusing managers' attention on the costs of unserviceable equipments, spares and otherassets and of the equipment support process generally. More specifically, theBeacon Initiative is designed to provide selected IPTs with consultancy supportto help them to pursue innovative changes and to apply best practices while, fora number of equipments including AS90 and the Warrior Fighting Vehicle, theDepartment is reducing the amount of base overhaul work carried out in favourof more cost-effective approaches to scheduled repair.3executive summaryMINISTRY OF DEFENCE: MAJOR REPAIR AND OVERHAUL OF LAND EQUIPMENT 8 Within the land environment, the Department has difficulty in predicting equipment usage. There are problems translating equipment usage intorequired repair activity and stock levels. In addition: IPTs do not yet have fullvisibility of repair costs; automatically generated demand figures in the Army'sstores system can be inaccurate; there is no visibility of spares consumption atthe point of delivery; failure reporting by users is inaccurate and incomplete;and repair providers cannot plan with any precision their repair and productionschedules as the Department is not able fully to asset track equipments.Management practices could also be improved since repair turnaround timesare not always monitored and repair providers' performance is rarely queried.Limitations in IT systems mean that many management processes are paper-based and are resource intensive. 9 The Department is using and developing new tools and major IT solutions to enhance its current information. For example, the Department is nowdeveloping a software tool to help to identify the resources required forpeacetime training. And it expects that many of the above deficiencies shouldbe rectified by the likely introduction of the Defence Stores ManagementSolution (DSMS), which is intended to replace the Army's current stores system,and of the Delivering the Requirement for Unit Materiel Management (DRUMM)project which will provide visibility of holdings of spares and repairables. Industry is set to get a wider role in major repair and overhaul 10 The through life approach to equipment support, called Integrated Logistics Support, is driving the further involvement of industry for future equipments.The support solutions currently being developed for future land projects involvea high degree of contractor provision. For example, Public Private Partnershipand Private Finance Initiative deals are proposed for the Heavy EquipmentTransporter project and Field Electrical Power Supplies programmerespectively. And other future land projects, such as those for fuel and watertankers and the Multi-Role Armoured Vehicle, are likely to involve at least some long-term contractor logistics support. Despite potential increases in operational risk, there are clear benefits to contracting with industry in suchways that may not be achievable through the use of in-house providers. These include: 4execuitve summaryMINISTRY OF DEFENCE: MAJOR REPAIR AND OVERHAUL OF LAND EQUIPMENT a reduced whole life costs through design improvements incorporated from the outset; b the introduction of gainsharing arrangements relating to benefits from improved equipment reliability and capability due to subsequent designmodifications proposed by industry; and c the retention of industrial capabilities during gaps between main production contracts. 11 The Department lags behind best industrial practice in such areas as supply chain performance, inventory management and asset tracking. The Departmentis seeking to take advantage of industry's capabilities in such fields by operatingdirect exchange schemes for repairable spares in the support of the Rapier FieldStandard B short range air defence system and the Phoenix target acquisitionand surveillance system. And a cost saving modification proposed by industryis to be introduced into the repair programme to enhance the reliability of the TN-54 gearboxes used by the Challenger 2 main battle tank. 12 Despite trends towards contractor logistics support, however, parts of industry acknowledge that they do not have well developed repair and overhaulcapabilities. Some manufacturers are therefore looking to ABRO to provide thisexpertise and capability. In addition, Alvis Vehicles Limited and Vickers Defence Systems both entered into partnering arrangements withABRO in 2001. And ABRO intends to work more closely with other potentialindustrial partners on future equipment programmes. ABRO is moving to Trading Fund status but important issues are unresolved 13 The Department is establishing ABRO as a Trading Fund on 1 April 2002. The Department's case for retaining ABRO in-house is not that it has a strategic rolein a military sense, but that it is beneficial to the defence mission and to theeffective management of logistics support. It is unclear, however, how the lackof a strong military strategic case for retaining ABRO in-house reconciles withthe existing policy of retaining in-house repair and overhaul facilities for keyoperational equipments. The Department has not fully defined the need foreither surge and flexibility or for dual sourcing and so it cannot be certain whatlevel of ABRO capacity is needed. And we found that IPTs' views on thestrategic importance of ABRO varied. The Department has still to determinewhat minimum in-house logistics capability is required to support militaryoperations, including in-house repair and overhaul. And, while it has decidedto keep ABRO in-house for the present time, it has still not decided the longer-term future ownership of ABRO. 14 To date, the Department has achieved very little competition in the major repair and overhaul of land equipment - around 20 per cent of repair lines includedin our sample cases. And in cases of dual sourcing, the Department had notconducted full competitions but had allocated work on the basis of repairers'costings for a single item. The Department has now set a target for competing30 per cent of ABRO's workload, by value, within three years of moving toTrading Fund. This is a significant reduction from the 80 per cent target that theDepartment initially intended to set because of constraints on IPTs to competemany of the repair programmes quickly. To be effective, competition must beon a level playing field, in terms of the competitive process, and equivalentpricing conditions and risks placed on bidders. It has not always been easy todemonstrate that these conditions applied in the past but this is now improving. 5executive summaryMINISTRY OF DEFENCE: MAJOR REPAIR AND OVERHAUL OF LAND EQUIPMENT 15 One significant constraint on increased competition is the ownership of intellectual property rights. Most intellectual property is owned by the originalequipment manufacturer. A large proportion of repair work requires the use ofintellectual property and is allocated non-competitively for this reason. This constraint could be overcome by negotiating additional rights for theDepartment, but it is likely to be costly. 16 While there are a number of clear benefits from ABRO's move to Trading Fund status, including efficiency gains and better information on the costs of repairby ABRO, there are also risks. The lack of clarity about strategic militaryrequirements for ABRO, and the extent of dual sourcing and surge required fromit, is a barrier to reaching a clear and optimal balance between industry and in-house repair and overhaul. Although IPTs have to pursue objectives that areconsistent with the wider corporate frameworks within which they are locatedand although there is planned guidance, there is a risk that they may makeindividual decisions on repair sourcing that will erode ABRO's capabilities orcapacity to provide effective competition - a situation that may not satisfy IPTs'ultimate customer, the Army. ABRO may also take decisions that constrain theDepartment's future options, although the Department has put in placearrangements to mitigate this risk. Finally, industry may continue to haveconcerns about the conduct of future competitions. Recommendations 17 The Department should: !move ahead with innovative repair arrangements involving industry, ensuring that any successes are identified and promoted widely; !ensure that lessons learned, particularly those relating to supply chainimprovements and management practices, are captured consistently and disseminated; !press ahead with initiatives to improve the management information and IT support available to IPTs; !take stock of how sensible competition for repair and overhaul work can beenhanced, particularly as regards ensuring that project teams have suitablespecifications on which to base competition, have the resources to conductthe competitions and that there is a level playing field between industry andthe in-house provider - ABRO; !more clearly define how much flexibility (the ability to switch resourcesbetween different repair programmes), surge capacity and dual sourcing itneeds because this would better inform the allocation of repair andoverhaul work; !think through the implications of such definition for the size, shape andownership arrangements of its in-house repairer (ABRO) and establish clearpolicy guidelines for informing decisions on whether repairs should be conducted in-house or be outsourced; and !review whether it needs to negotiate additional intellectual property rightsin order to enable greater competition and to allow greater flexibility whendetermining the future role and "}
