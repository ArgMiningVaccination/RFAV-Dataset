This Act amends a number of provisions in Chapter 196A, providing for the establishment of the Iowa Egg Council and assessment of an excise tax upon eggs used to support market development of eggs or egg by-products, including spent poultry and spent poultry products. The Act amends a number of definitions. It changes the word \"tax\" to \"assessment,\" which is consistent with the definition of the tax imposed by other commodity organizations. It changes the definition of ''producern to increase from 500 to 30,000 the number of layer-type chickens that must be owned or controlled by a person qualifying as a producer and subject to the assessment. The Act eliminates definitions relating to districts and hatchery operators. Previously, the Iowa Egg Council was comprised of four egg producers, each representing a different district, two egg processors, and one hatchery operator. The Act provides that the council is composed of seven producers who represent large, medium and small producers. The Act reduces the number of producers required to call a referendum to establish or terminate a council and assessment from 50 to 20 producers. The Act reduces the terms of council members from four to three years, and limits the number of consecutive terms that a member may serve from three to two terms. The Act amends provisions prohibiting the council from engaging in cenain activities.

AGRICULTURE 5 The Act repeals a number of sections. With one exception, these provisions have been rewritten in other sections of the Act. The Act eliminates a provision which provides that a producer who has paid a nonrefundable promotion import tax in another state on eggs produced in Iowa may, by application to the council, secure a refund. Finally, the Act requests that the Code Editor consider transferring the provisions of Chapter !96A to or near Chapter 184, and renumbering its sections to enhance readability. This would place the provisions of Chapter 196A with chapters governing other promotion boards. The Act takes effect March 14, 1995. HOUSE FILE 198 -Custom Cattle Feedlot Liens BY GREIG. This Act relates to liens upon cattle by a custom cattle feedlot where cattle owned by a person are subject to care and feeding performed by another person. The Act provides that a custom cattle feedlot operator shall have a lien upon the cattle and the identifiable cash proceeds from the sale of the cattle for the amount of the contract price for the feed and care of the livestock at the custom cattle feedlot agreed upon by the custom cattle feedlot operator and the person who owns the cattle. The lien is created at the time the cattle arrive at the custom cattle feedlot and continues for one year after the cattle have left the custom cattle feedlot. In order to preserve the Hen, the custom cattle feedlot operator must, within 20 days after the cattle arrive at the custom cattle feedlot, file in the office of the Secretary of State, a lien statement on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State. Except for veterinarian liens, a lien created under the Act is superior to and has priority over a conflicting lien or security interest in the cattle, including a lien that was perfected prior to the creation of the lien. While the cattle are located at the custom cattle feedlot, the custom cattle feedlot operator may foreclose a lien in the manner provided for the foreclosure of secured transactions as provided in the Uniform Commercial Code (Chapter 554 of the Iowa Code). After the cattle have left the custom cattle feedlot, the custom cattle feedlot operator may enforce the lien by commencing an action at law for the amount of the lien against either the holder of the identifiable cash proceeds from the sale of the cattle, or the processor who has purchased the cattle within three days after the cattle have left the custom cattle feedlot. HOUSE FILE 456 -Credit-Sale Contracts for Grain Transactions BY COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE.

Producers who sell grain by credit-sale contract do not receive financial protection under the Grain Depositors and Sellers Indemnity Fund. Currently, a credit-sale contract is defined to mean a contract for the sale of grain if the sale price is to be paid more than 30 days after the delivery of the grain to the buyer, and includes instruments commonly referred to as deferred payment contracts, deferred pricing contracts, and price-later contracts. This Act provides that a credit-sale contract also means a contract which is titled as a credit-sale contract. HOUSE FILE S19 -Animal Feeding Operations BY COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE. This Act relates to animal feeding operations and their regulation. According to the Act, an animal feeding operation is an area in which animals are confined and fed and maintained for 45 days or more in any 12-month period, and all structures used for the storage of manure from animals in the operation. The Act specifically regulates confinement feeding operations in which animals are confined to totally roofed areas. The Act regulates operations based on their capacity by calculating the size of certain species and alternatively by calculating animal weight of all species. The size of an animal species is represented in animal units. Each species of animal is measured by assigning that species an animal unit factor. In addition, the Act regulates operations by the total amount of animal weight capacity that may be confined in the operation. The Act exempts small animal feeding operations from many of its provisions. A small animal feeding operation is an animal feeding operation that has an animal weight capacity of 200,000 pounds or less for animals other than bovine, or 400,000 pounds or less for bovine. 6 AGRICULTURE The Act establishes a Manure Storage Indemnity Fund administered by the Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. Moneys in tho fund are for tho purposes of indemnifying a county for expenses related to cleaning up a site acquired by the county following nonpayment of property taxes. The fund is composed of fees paid before a construction permit is issued by the Department of Narural Resources for a confinement feeding operation. The amount of the fee increases based on the animal weight capacity of the operation. The Act authorizes a county to clean up a site and seek reimbursement for the costs. The Act provides that after August 31, 1995, a community college is prohibited from entering into an agreement with a confinement feeding operation for new job training under Chapter 260E. This provision was eliminated in H.F. 583 (See Appropriations). The Act provides that the Department of Natural Resources is prohibited frorn initiating an enforcement action in response to a violation by an animal feeding operation unless the Environmental Protection Commission approves the action. The requirement does not apply to an action in which the department enforces a civil penalty of $3,000 or less, or to an order to abate an emergency. The Act establishes a number of separation requirements. The Act provides that the Department of Agriculrure and Land Stewardship must regulate the disposal of manure in close proximity to a known sinkhole, or a cistern, abandoned well, unplugged agriculrural drainage well, agriculrural drainage well surface inlet, drinking water well, or a lake, or a farm pond or privately owned lake. The Act provides that a person is prohibited from disposing of manure on cropland within 200 feet from one of these water source$, unless the manure is applied by injection or incorporation within 24 hours following tho application or an area of permanent vegetation cover exists for 50 feet surrounding the area where ~e water source exists. The Act provides that an animal feeding operation structure must be located at least 500 feet away from the surface intake of an agricultural drainage well or known sinkhole and at least 200 feet away from a lake, river, or stream located within the territorial limits of the state, or marginal river areas adjacent to the state. However, no distance separation is required between a location or object and a farm pond or privately owned lake. The Act provides a number of distance requirements applicable to animal feeding operation structures, including anaerobic lagoons, earthen manure storage basins, formed manure storage structures, confinement buildings, and egg washwater storage structures. The distance requirements are jmposed between such structures and residences, churches, schools, and businesses. The Act imposes special separation distances between animal feeding operation structures and a public use area or a residence, church, school, or business located within the corporate limits of a city. The distance requirements are based on the animal weight capacity of the operation and the type of strucrure containing the manure. The distance requirements range from 750 feet to 2,500 feet. An animal feeding operation that does not comply with the distance requirements of the Act on the effective date of this Act, May 31, 1995, rnay continue to operate regardless of those separation distances. The existing animal feeding operation may be expanded on or after May 31, 1995, regardless of those separation distances, if located no closer than the object or location benefiting from the distance requirement and the animal weight capacity of the operation is not more than twice its capacity on May 31, 1995, with an absolute limit based on animal weight capacity. The Act also provides that qualified confinement feeding operations must use structures which employ an aeration process. A qualified confinement feeding operation has an animal weight capacity of 2,000,000 or more pounds for animals other than swine kept in a farrow-to-finish operation or bovine kept in a confinement feeding operation; swine kept in a farrow-to-finish operation having an animal weight capacity of 2,500,000 or more pounds; or a confinement feeding operation having an animal weight capacity of 6,000,000 or more pounds for bovine. The Act provides exceptions for separation distance requirements~ including confinement feeding operation structures that provide for tho storage of manure exclusively in a dry form; a confinement feeding operation strucrure, other than an earthen manure storage basin, if the structure is part of an operation that qualifies as a small animal feeding operation; an animal feeding operation structure which is constructed after a person benefiting from the distance separation requirement executes a written waiver; an animal feeding operation constructed or expanded AGRICULTURE 7 within the corporate limits of a city, if the city approves a waiver; or in cases where an animal feeding operation was established prior to the establishment of a residence, church, school, or business operation, or the expansion of the boundaries of a city or public use area. The Act provides that the Department of Natural. Resources may adopt rules relating to the construction or operation of animal feeding operations. The rules must include, but are not limited to, minimum manure control requirements, requirements for obtaining permits, and departmental evaluations of animal feeding operations_ The department is required to collect an indemnity fee prior to the issuance of a construction penni!, and to deposit the fee in the Manure Storage Indemnity Fund. The department is prohibited from requiring a permit for the construction of an animal feeding operation structure if the structure is part of a small animal feeding operation. A person who constructs three or more animal feeding operation structures must file a statement certifying that the construction of the structures will not impede drainage. The Act prohibits an applicant from beginning construction of an animal feeding operation structure until the department grants the person a permit for the construction of the structure. Generally, the department must approve or deny a permit within 60 days from the date that the department receives a completed application for a permit. The department cannot issue a permit to a person for five years after the date of the last violation committed by a person or confinement feeding operation in which the person holds a controlling interest during which the person or operation was classified as a habitual violator. The department must conduct an annual review of each confinement feeding operation in which a habitual violator holds a controlling interest.

The rebuttable presumption also applies to persons who are not required to obtain a permit pursuant to Chapter 455B for an animal feeding operation. The rebuttable presumption does not apply if the injury to a person or damage to property is proximately caused by a failure to comply with a federal statute or regulation or a state statute or rule that applies to the animal feeding operation. The rebuttable presumption may be overcome by clear and convincing evidence of both of the following: First, the animal feeding operation unreasonably and continuously interferes with another person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or property. Second, the injury or damage is proximately caused by the negligent operation of the animal feeding operation.

MENTAL HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES COMMUNITY SERVICES -COMMUNITY SERVICES FUND. The actual amount of the appropriation to the fund is reduced by $13 million from the original appropriation in the previous fiscal year.

The appropriation for field operations is increased to provide for the employment of up to an additional 8.5 full\u00b7time equivalent positions to increase special needs adoption placement services. The appropriation for general administration is an increase over the previous fiscal year appropriation due in part to postage rate increases, the updating of essential information systems, computer and networking suppon, the salary of a permanent mental health access plan manager, and the inclusion of the Prevention of Disabilities Policy Council. The appropriation for development and coordination of volunteer services is maintained at the current level of funding in comparison with the previous fiscal year_ The appropriation for the X-PERT computer-based eligibility determination system is a decrease in the appropriation over the previous fiscal year due to reduced development expenditures as the system nears implementation.

The Act authorizes the board, at the request of a long distance telephone company, to classify the company as a competitive long distance company if more than half of the company's revenues from its Iowa intrastate telecommunications services and facilities are received from services and facilities that the board has determined to be subject to effective competition. Upon such classification, the Depanment of Revenue is to assess the property of the competitive long distance telephone company which is first assessed for taxation on or afrer January I, 1996, in the same manner as other commercial property. The Act includes findings by the General Assembly that communications services should be available throughout the state at reasonable and affordable rates, and that regulatory flexibility is appropriate when competition will provide consumers with competitive choices in the variety, quality, and pricing of such services. The Act establishes two basic price regulation options in new Section 476.30B applicable to rate-regulated local exchange carriers. The first option, included in subsections I through 10 of the Act, would be applicable to all three rate-regulated local exchange carriers. A second option is provided for in subsection 11 as an alternative for the two rate-regulated local exchange caniers with fewer than 500,000 access lines in Iowa. Pursuant to the first option, a rate-regulated local exchange carrier may submit a plan for price regulation to the board. The board, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may approve, modify or reject the plan. The carrier has 10 days to accept or reject any modifications to the plan. A plan under this option, at a minimum, must include provisions for establishing and changing prices, terms and conditions for basic communications services; establishing and changing prices, terms and conditions for nonbasic communications services; reporting new service offerings to the board; reflecting any changes in revenues, expenses and investment due to exogenous factors 54 BUSINESS BANKING & INSURANCE beyond the control of the local exchange carrier in the rates to be charged by the carrier; and providing notice to customers, the board and the Consumer Advocate of any changes in prices, terms or conditions. Additionally, the board is to determine the duration of any plan under this option. Pursuant to the second option, a rate-regulated local ex:change carrier is to provide written notice to the board of such election no less than 30 days prior to the date price regulation is to commence. The rate-regulated local exchange carrier is not required to file a plan with the board in the manner provided under the first option. Pursuant to the Act, the rate-regulated local exchange carrier is not subject to ratcmof-return regulation while operating under price regulation, all regulated services are to be provided pursuant to board-approved tariffs, all new regulated service offerings are to be reported to the board, and rates may be adjusted by the board to reflect any changes in revenues~ expenses and investment due to exogenous factors beyond the control of the local exchange canier. The Act provides the manner in which prices may be changed and requires that the rate-regulated local exchange carrier notify customers of a rate change under this subsection at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the rate change. The board is authorized to review a local exchange carrier's operation under this option four years after the carrier's election to be price-regulated. The local exchange carrier, Consumer Advocate, or any other person may propose for the board's approval, a reasonable modification to the price regulation requirements in the option. The Act provides that under either option, the board maintains regulatory authority over the level, extent and tinting of the unbundling of essential facilities offered by a local exchange carrier, and authority to ensure against cross~subsidization between nonbasic and basic communications services; the Consumer Advocate rnay represent consumers before the board concerning any rule, order or proceeding pertaining to price regulation; in implementing price regulation, the board is to consider competitively neutral methods to assist lower-income Iowans to secure and retain telephone services; and the board, in determining whether to file a written complaint or prior to reviewing the carrier's operation, rnay request that the carrier provide any information that the board deems necessary to make the determination or conduct the review. The Act directs the Consumer Advocate to calculate every two years an estimate of the return of a local exchange carrier operating under price regulation as if the carrier were subject to rate-of-return regulation. A written report is to be filed with the General Assembly concerning the calculation. The Act provides that a certificate of public convenience and necessity to provide local telephone service, which is issued by the board, is not to be interpreted as conveying a monopoly or franchise. The Act establishes the framework for competition within a local exchange. The local exchange carrier is to provide equal access to, and interconnection with, the carrier's facilities so that its network is fully interoperable with the telecommunications services and information services of other providers, and to offer unbundled essential facilities. Prior to September I, 1995, the board is to initiate a rule-making proceeding to adopt rules to provide for the unbundling of essential facilities, to establish reciprocal cost-based compensation for termination of telecommunications services between local exchange carriers and competitive local exchange service providers, to provide for provider number portability, and to develop cost methodology appropriate for a competitive telecommunications environment. The Act also directs the board to initiate a proceeding and establish policies to preserve universal service so that it is maintained in a competitively neutral manner. The board is also directed to submit a report to the General Assembly no later than January 15, 1999, concerning the implementation of price regulation for local exchange carriers furnishing communications services. HOUSE FILE 520 -Electronic Transfer of Funds BY COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE AND REGULATION. This Act amends provisions relating to the regulation of electronic funds ttansfers and the processing of transactions initiated through the use of electronic funds transfer transaction cards or access devices.

ClllLDREN AND YOUTH 59 CHILDREN AND YOUTH SENATE FILE 150 -Miscellaneous Prcwisions Concerning Children BY COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RESOURCES. This Act includes various provisions involving children, including foster care, termination of parental rights, adoption proceedings and services, children affected by drugs, employee training, child abuse information, child custody proceedings and mediation, and consideration of a history of domestic abuse in certain proceedings. See S.F. 208 for additional child abuse provisions. The Act aruends a standard for termination of parental rights in Section 232.116. Under prior Jaw establishing the standard; the court was required to find that the child meets the definition of a 11Child in need of assistance\" based on physical or sexual abuse or neglect as a result of the acts or omissions of (me or both of the child's parents and that despite the receipt of services; there is clear and convincing evidence that the circumstances suuounding the abuse constitute an imminent danger to the child. The Act changes the basis so that in addition to meeting the definition of child in need of assistance, the court must also find that either the receipt or offer of services would not correct the conditions which led to the abuse or neglect within a reasonable period of time, and that the abuse or neglect constitutes a significant risk to the life of the child, rather than the prior requirement that the circumstances constitute an imminent danger to the child. This aruendment was proposed by the Child Protection Task Force, a 1994 legislative study committee, and other groups following an Iowa Court of Appeals ruling. The Act also amends Section 235A.J5, relating to access to child abuse information, by providing access to child protection agencies in other states which are investigating or treating a person named as having abused a child and by providing access to out-of,state public or licensed child-placing agencies for foster care evaluations and placements and adoptive or foster care preplacement evaluations. The Act establishes additional grounds for termination of parental rights. Under Chapter 232, termination is authorized in certain circumstances when the child's parent has been convicted of child endangerment. Under Chapter 600A, termination is authorized if the parent is a chronic substance abuser, has committed a second or subsequent domestic abuse assault, and has improperly removed the child from the person entitled to custody without the person's consent or has otherwise improperly retained the child after a visit with the child. The Act includes a number of provisions addressing children who are placed in foster care. The Department of Human Services or other agency which develops a child's case permanency plan must include the child's parent, guardian, or custodian in the plan's development. In addition, the case permanency plan is to include the actions expected of the child's parent, guardian, or custodian in order for a recommendation that the court terminate the child's out-of-home placement. The Act requires that persons providing foster care placements are to be notified of any hearings under the child in need of assistance (CINA) statutes and provides that the person may petition the court to be made a party to the proceedings. Under current law, a CINA may be placed in foster care for a period of 12 months after which time the court may continue the placement for an additional six months. If a continuance of the placement is ordered, the Act requires the court to enumerate the basis for the determination that the need for removal from the child's home will not e;xist at the end of the six-month period. Statutes involving the presence of an illegal drug in a child's body are amended. The C!NA provisions are aruended to require that the presence of an illegal drug in the child's body is not the sole grounds for a CINA determination and applies a reasonable and prudent person standard to determinations of whether the caretaker should have known their acts or omissions would lead to the presence of the drug. In addition, the law providing for a \"medically relevant test\"' to determine the presence of an illegal drug is aruended. The Act requires the Iowa Department of Public Health, in consultation with other agencies, to adopt rules specifying minimum standards for the results of such tests and to maintain a list of laboratories approved to perform the tests. A parent who is ordered to have a drug test as part of a CINA proceeding may select from aruong the laboratories on the list. The provision concerning drug tests of a parent takes effect May !9, 1995, and applies to tests performed on or after that date. 60 CIULDREN AND YOUTH The statutory provisions for the Department of Human Services' adoption information exchange are amended. The exchange is a means of providing information to facilitate the adoption of children for whom parental rights have been terminated. The amendments authorize deferring listing the child on the exchange based upon the child's age, treatment status, and placement status. The Act requires the Department of Human Services and the Judicial Department to make additional efforts to improve the system for educating their employees concerning reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for placement of a child outside the child's home. Area education agencies arc to include in the in-service training for school employees, regular training concerning mental or emotional disorders that may afflict children and the impact of the disorders upon families. Similar training is required for judges and other court employees who handle cases involving children or family law. The provisions in Chapter 598 concerning marriage dissolution and child custody proceedings arc amended to address situations when a history of domestic abuse exists as indicated by court or police actions. The Act provides that if a history of domestic abuse exists, there is a rebuttable presumption against awarding joint custody. In addition, if a history of domestic abuse exists, the court is precluded from requiring mediation in establishing or modifying marriage dissolution, child visitation, or child custody orders. If a history of domestic violence exists, the Act requires the court to provide security in the courtroom during dissolution proceedings at the request of either party. SENATE FILE 208 . Child Abuse and Tcnnination of Parental Rights BY COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RESOURCES. This Act relates to child abuse and termination of parental rights provisions. Many of the Act's provisions were addressed in the final report of the Child Protection Task Force, a 1994 legislative interim study established to review child abuse issues. New Section 135.43 creates an Iowa Child Death Review Team as an independent agency of state government. Administrative and staffing support for the team is to be provided by the Iowa Department of Public Health. The team is to review information concerning the death of children ages six and younger and is to establish a committee to review child abuse investigations involving the death of a child. The review team is to include various professionals involved in areas applicable to child death and is to be assisted by liaisons designated by representatives of various state agencies. The review team is authorized to appoint subcommittees to which its responsibilities may be delegated. Section 232.71 is amended to prohibit the Department of Human Services from revealing the identity of a reporter of child abuse during a child abuse investigation. New Section 232.71A directs the Department of Human Services to establish child abuse assessment pilot projects in up to five areas of the state. Beginning January 15, 1996, the child abuse assessment approach would be used in the pilot project areas instead of the various provisions under current law for investigating a child abuse report and for maintaining information concerning certain investigations in the Central Child Abuse Information Registry. Legislative intent is stated to implement the assessment-based approach statewide beginning in FY 1996-1997. The primary purpose of assessment is to ensure the safety of a child named in a report and the secondary purpose is to engage the child's family in services to enhance family strengths and address weaknesses identified in the assessment. Various provisions of Section 232.71, which specify requirements and responsibilities during a child abuse investigation, apply to an assessment. However, under the assessment-based pilot projects, only jnfonnation from serious cases of child abuse is placed in the Central Child Abuse Information Registry, including cases referred to the comt or for which medical or mental health treatment was provided or should have been provided. Otherwise, assessments are not public records and are to remain confidentiaL The Act authorizes the Department of Human Services to implement a special protocol in the pilot project area. The special protocol would pennit an abbreviated assessment when there are three or more reports concerning the same alleged perpetrator or family member and previous assessments have not identified protective concerns. CillLDREN AND YOUTH 61 The Attorney General is requested to establish a multidisciplinary committee to review and make recommendations concerning establishment of regional multidisciplinary teams to focus upon child abuse prosecution and intervention needs. If a committee is established, a report is to be submitted by the Attorney General to the Governor and the General As.embly prior to the 1996 Legislative Session. Section 9 of 1994 Iowa Acts, Chapter 1130, would have amended current law on July I, 1995, so that child abuse information, which a Department of Human Services' investigation determines to be unfounded, would be expunged six months after it is determined to be unfounded. During that six-month period, the information would be sealed and accessible only through a court order. Section 9 was enacted with a delayed effective date of July I, 1995. Effective May 3, 1995, this Act, S.F. 208, repeals both the substantive amendment relating to cxpungement and the delayed effective date. Repealing the two provisions maintains current law, which requires that unfounded child abuse information be expunged when it is determined to be unfounded. SENATE FILE 352 -Family Jnvestment and Related Human Ser'f'ices Programs -Additional Requirements BY COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RESOURCES. This Act relates to the Family Investment Program (formerly known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children and now referred to as FIP) and related human services programs by requiring the Department of Human Services to apply for certain federal waivers. The Act lists a particular welfare reform policy goal, directed to FIP participants, followed by the specific provision designed to achieve that goal. Implementation of the requirements is subject to issuance of a federal waiver. The first goal is directed to minor parents and recipient parents who arc 18 or 19 years of age to promote responsibility and strengthen family values. The Act requires minor parents to live with their parent or legal guardian unless the parent or guardian is deceased, missing, or living in another state; the minor parent's health or safety would be jeopardized; the minor parent is in foster care; the minor parent is participating in the Job Corps Solo Parent Program or Independent Living Program; or there is another good cause listed in administrative rules. If a minor parent is exempt from the requirement of living with their parent or guardian, the minor parent must participate in a family development program. All minor parents and recipient parents who are 18 or 19 years of age must attend parenting classes. The second goal is also directed to minor parents and requires that a minor parent must either have graduated from high school or have received a high school equivalency diploma, or must be engaged full-time in doing so. Implementation of this provision is subject to the availability of child day care for the minor parent's children. The third goal is directed to minor parents and recipient parents who arc 18 or 19 years of age and is designed to develop a strong work ethic. If a parent subject to this provision is participating, full-time, in fulfilling the high school or high school equivalency requirements, the department must disregard any income earned by the participant. The fourth goal addresses welfare fraud by requiring the department to strengthen sanctions to disqualify recipients who commit welfare fraud. In strengthening sanctions, the department is to establish the same or similar penalties for both FIP and the Food Stamp program. The fifth goal is directed to recipients with young children with the stated intention of making expectations of recipients consistent with private sector practices. An exemption from the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) Program participation for parents with children who are less than six months of age is narrowed to apply to parents with children who are less than three months of age. The sixth goal is intended to remove incentives for out-of-state applicants for public assistance to move to Iowa. The provision applies to applicants for assistance who received assistance in another state within one year of applying for assistance in this state. The applicant's eligibility is to be determined using this state's requirements, but if the other state's grant amount would be less than this state's, during the initial participation period of six months the applicant's grant amount is the lesser amount. A similar provision was included in Iowa's initial welfare reform legislation, 1993 Iowa Acts, Chapter 97, but was not approved by the federal government. 62 CHILDREN AND YOUTH The seventh goal is designed to encourage responsible family planning decision making. The department is required to discuss with participants orally and in writing the financial implications of additional children and available family planning resources. In addition, the department is to include family planning counseling as an optional component of the JOBS Program and is to include the participant's family planning objectives in the participant's family investment agreement. A family investment agreement is a written document outlining a PIP participant's activities to achieve self-sufficiency. The Act authorizes the department to transfer moneys appropriated for a waiver provision if the waiver provision is denied by the federal government. The department is directed to adopt rules to implement the approved provisions and to apply additional requirements and procedures necessary to conform with the federal approval of the provisions. The effective date of the provisions is to be set by rule but cannot be before July 1, !996. If the federal government amends federal law to authorize implementation of any part of the Act without a waiver. the same effective date applies. SENATE FILE 433 l!amily Investment and Related Human Services Programs -Limited Benefit Plans BY COMMITTEE ON HOMAN RESOURCES. This Act relates to the Family Investment Program (PIP, formerly the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program) by requiring the Department of Human Services to apply for a federal waiver to revise the limited benefit plan provisions of the program. The Act codifies the limited benefit plan provisions which were previously only addressed in administrative rules. As implemented under administrative rule requirements, FIP requires the majority of adult participants and some minor participants to enter into a family investment agreement. A family investment agreement is a written document delineating a participant's plan for becoming self-sufficient. A participant may choose, or through noncompliance with a family investment agreement would be considered to have chosen, a lintited benefit plan. A limited benefit plan may be applied to the participant alone or to the entire eligible group or family to which the participant belongs. A limited benefit plan limits both the amount of cash assistance and the period of eligibility for PIP benefits. Previously, under the administrative rules, a limited benefit plan applied for a period of 12 months. During the 12-month period, benefits were limited during the fourth through sixth months and a period of ineligibility applied during the seventh through twelfth months. Under the Act, provisions applicable to an initial limited benefit plan differ from those applicable to subsequent limited benefit plans. The Act provides that under the initial limited benefit plan, benefits are reduced for the first three months and denied for the succeeding six months. For a second or subsequent limited benefit plan, benefits are denied for six months. The Act directs the department to apply the limited benefit plan provlSions to certain paruC!pants who are responsible for developing a family investment agreement, specifies the members of the eligible group to which the limited benefit plan applies, outlines the provisions of initial and subsequent limited benefit plan periods, lists actions which constitute choosing a limited benefit plan; provides options and limitations for reconsidering the choice of a limited benefit plan, provides for one or more visits or inquiries by a social services professional into the well-being of a family on a limited benefit plan, limits appeals of a limited benefit plan except in cases of error, provides for transition to the new provisions from the previous provisions, and authorizes the department to make changes in the rules regarding the Food Stamp Program. The Act authorizes the department to submit waiver requests to make corresponding changes in the federal Food Stamp Program and the Medical Assistance (Medicald) Program with implementation of changes in these programs subject to enactment of legislation approving of the changes. The Act directs the department to apply the waiver provisions statewide as approved by the federal government. If implementing the waiver provisions would be in conflict with state law for the Family Investment Program under Chapter 239 or the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) Program under Chapter 249C, those statutes in conflict are suspended for the purposes of the Act. The department is directed to propose, in accordance with the legislative prefiling hills statute for state agencies, an amendment to the statutes in conflict in order to place the provisions before the public in law. ClllLDREN AND YOUTH 63 The Act authorizes the department to adopt administrative rules under emergency provisions which eliminate the public comment period and review by the Administrative Rules Review Committee. However, the rules must then also be adopted under the regular procedure for adopting rules. The Act includes a contingent effective date. The provisions of the Act take effect on October I, !995, or at the beginning of the second month following the month in which the federal government approves the waiver, whichever date is later. SENATE FILE 438 -Juvenile Delinquency Notices- Marriage Solemnization by Associate Juvenile Judges BY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY- This Act provides that notice of adjudication hearings or hearings regarding the modification of a dispositional order in juvenile delinquency cases need not be given by publication. The Act also waives the requirement that a person, who was originally notified of a delinquency adjudication hearing but who failed to appear, be given notice of a hearing regarding modification or termination of the dispositional order. In addition, the Act authorizes associate juvenile judges to perform marriage ceremonies. flOUSE FILE 528 -Criminal and Juvenile Justice BY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. This Act changes proviSions of the juvenile code and other chapters regarding juveniles and adults. The Act requires a peace officer who takes a juvenile into custody for a drug or alcohol offense to notify a juvenile court officer. The juvenile court officer is then required to make a reasonable effort to notify the school which the juvenile attends, if any, of the taking into custody. The Act provides that a person who has been convicted of a crime under Section 124.401, subsection 2, or Section 124.406, and who is awaiting sentencing or is appealing the conviction, shall not be eligible for release on bail unless the court finds the person will not pose a threat to the safety of another person or persons and will appear for future court proceedings. The Act excludes from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court a juvenile age !6 or older who commits a drug offense involving a frrearm or offensive weapon, who violates a provision of Chapter 724 regarding weapons that is punishable as a felony, who engages in certain gang activity, or who commits a forcible felony_ The juvenile may be transferred to the juvenile court under new Section 803.6 if the district court finds that it would have been inappropriate to waive the juvenile to adult court if the offense was originally within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. A juvenile not transferred to the juvenile court shall be tried and punished as an adult. The Act authorizes the juvenile court to enter a dispositional order placing a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent in secure custody in a juvenile detention facility for a specified period of time. The juvenile may be placed in any facility, other than a jail, in which a juvenile who is taken into custody for an alleged delinquent act could be detained_ The Act provides that the juvenile court, a juvenile court officer, or a Jaw enforcement agency may release the name of a child alleged to have committed a delinquent act, which would be an aggravated misdemeanor or felony if committed by an adult, once a complaint has been filed. Section 232.45A is amended to provide that a juvenile who has been waived to adult court for the alleged commission of a felony shall have all other felony proceedings commence in district court. The Act requires school officials to establish procedures for reporting to a local law enforcement agency when a dangerous weapon is possessed on school premises, to expel a student who possesses a firearm at school, and to provide for the reintegration of the student into school after expulsion. The Act also permits school districts to adopt a dress code policy that prohibits students from wearing gang-related or other specific apparel. The Act adds information concerning the taking of a juvenile into custody and the adjudication of a juvenile as a delinquent for an act that would be an aggravated misdemeanor or felony if committed by an adult, to the criminal history and intelligence data collected under Chapter 692. This information, except fingerprint cards, is to be deleted from the data storage system if the juvenile does not commit a serious or aggravated misdemeanor or felony 64 CHILDREN AND YOUTII between 18 and 21 years of age. Fingerprint cards will be retained in the automated fingerprint identification system. Section 709A.6 is amended to make the penalty for using~ or conspiring to usc~ a juvenile in criminal activity a class \"C\" felony instead of a class \"D\" felony, Chapter 723A, regarding gang activities, is amended to add violations of Chapter 724, regarding weapons, to the definition of \"criminal acts;' and to add a class 11C'' felony for recruiting, entjcing or intimidating a juvenile into joining a criminal street gang, and a class 11D11 felony for conspiring to do the same. A new section is also added to Chapter 724 making it a class \"D\" felonyJor going armed with, carrying, or transporting a firearm on the grounds of a public or nonpublic school unless the person fits within a designated exemption. The Act eliminates the requirement that students be provided at least 24-hours' notice before an inspection by school officials of all the students' lockers. School officials may inspect all or a randomly selected number of school lockers without notice if the school has provided prior written notice of its intent to inspect lockers and if the student is present when the locker is inspected. The Act also establishes a task force to develop a plan for shared jurisdiction between the juvenile justice system and the adult justice system. The task force will be composed of legislators, the Attorney General, the Director of the Department of Human Services, judges, corrections officials, the State Public Defender, a college or university faculty member, and a county attorney, and be convened by the Division of Criminal and Juvenile Justice Planning of the Department of Human Rights. The task force will report to the Governor and General Assembly by October 1, 1995.

HOUSE FILE 303 -Pipelines and Underground Hazardous Liquid Storage BY COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE AND REGULATION. This Act creates a new Chapter 479B to regulate hazardous liquid pipelines, and amends Chapter 479 regulating pipelines and underground gas storage and Chapter 479A regulating interstate natural gas pipelines. The creation of the new chapter is prompted by a United States Eighth Circuit Court opinion, Kinley Corporation v. Iowa Utilities Board, 999 F.2d 354 (8th Circuit 1993), which held that the state was unable to regulate hazardous liquid pipelines because Chapter 479 was invalid as it pertained to hazardous liquid pipelines. The purpose of Chapter 479B is to grant the Iowa Utilities Board the authority to implement certain controls over hazardous liquid pipelines to protect landowners and tenants from environmental or economic damages that may result from the construction, operation or maintenance of a hazardous liquid pipeline or underground storage facility within the state; to supervise the location and route of hazardous liquid pipelines and underground storage facilities; and to grant eminent domain rights when necessary. A pipeline company is prohibited from constructing, maintaining or operating a pipeline or underground storage facility without a permit issued by the board. The company is required to hold informational meetings in each county wh~-re property rights will be affected at least 30 days before filing a petition for a new pipeline. Chapters 479 and 479A are also amended to provide that informational hearings must be held at least 30 days prior to filing a petition for a new pipeline and to simplify the process for obtaining an extension of the original permit. After the company files a petition, the board sets a date for a hearing. A person whose rights may be affected by the permit may file written objections with the board. During the hearing the board considers the petition, the 106 ENERGY AND PUBLIC UTILITIES objections, and any other relevant testimony. The applicant must pay all the costs of the meetings, hearing and investigative work and the costs of inspections conducted by the board. The Act provides that if the board enters into an agreement with the United States Department of Transportation, a pipeline company must pay an annual fee of 50 cents per mile of pipeline or fraction thereof for each inch of diameter of the pipeline located in the state. The inspection fees are to be paid to the board between January I and February I of each year. A pipeline company which fails to pay the fees may be subject to civil penalties or the revocation of the permit. The Act requires that before a permit may be granted, the applicant must satisfy the board that the applicant is in good financial condition or provide a bond. Permits are limited to 25 years and may be sold or transferred by the permittee under certain conditions. After receipt of a permit, a pipeline company has the right to survey and examine the proposed construction area. A pipeline company issued a pipeline permit has the right of eminent domain to the extent necessary and as approved by the board, but not to exceed 75 feet in width for right-of-way and not to exceed one acre in any one location in addition to right-of-way for the location of pumps, pressure apparatus, or other stations or equipment necessary to the operation of the pipeline. In addition to adding these provisions to Chapter 479B, the Act amends Chapters 479 and 479A to provide that the board may grant additional eminent domain rights where the pipeline company has presented sufficient evidence to adequately demonstrate that a greater area is required for the proper construction, operation and maintenance of the pipeline or for the location of pumps~ pressure apparatus, or other stations or equipment necessary to the proper operation of its pipeline. A pipeline company granted a permit for underground storage of hazardous liquid is vested with the right of eminent domain over any subsurface stratum or formation in any land the board finds to be suitable for the location of an underground storage facility. A pipeline company is granted reasonable access to the area for the purposes of constructing, operating, maintaining, or locating pipes, pumps; pressure apparatus, or other stations, wells, devices, or equipment and is responsible for payment of damages caused by the pipeline or storage facility. The board has the ability to adopt land restoration standards to protect underground improvements during the construction of a pipeline or underground storage facility, soil conserva6on practices and drainage structures, and for the restoration of agricultural lands. The Act provides that rules adopted may apply within the boundaries of a city if the land is used for agricultural purposes. The county board of supervisors inspects the site to ensure compliance with the standards. In Chapter 479B, the Act provides that if an agreement for damages cannot be reached 90 days after completion of the installation, a landowner or pipeline company may flle a request with the board of supervisors of the county that a compensation commission be appointed to determine the damages arising from the installation of the pipeline. Chapters 479 and 479A are also amended to provide that either the landowner or the pipeline company may request the establishment of the compensation commission and to change the time period in which the petition may be filed from between 75 and 100 days from installation to not less than 90 days from installation of the pipeline. The Act provides that the additional costs of new tile construction caused by an existing pipeline must be paid by the pipeline company. For Chapters 479 and 479A, the Act changes the way compensation may be obtained for these damages. The Act allows the landowner to enter into an agreement as to costs wjth the pipeljne company during the planning of the tiling project. The Act contains other provisions regarding cancellation of the easement~ arbitration agreements~ and further damage provisions. The Act provides exemption from liability for the owner of farmland for damage occurring to an underground facility under Chapter 480, if the damage occurred in the normal course of the farming operation. The Act provides that any person who violates a provision of Chapter 479B is subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation.

The amendment authorizes a county to require a diagnosis to determine if a person has mental retardation or an evaluation of a person's mental retardation service needs prior to approving the payment of the e<penses. In addition, following the initial approval for payment of expenses, the county may require an evaluation to be performed at reasonable time periods. If a person is without legal settlement or the settlement is unknown, the state may apply the same diagnosis and evaluation provisions. The cost of an evaluation is to be paid by the county of legal settlement or the state. The Act also requires that a diagnosis of mental retardation be made only when the onset of the person's condition is prior to age 18 and is to be based on an assessment of the person's intellectual functioning and level of adaptive skills. The individual performing the diagnosis must be a psychologist or psychiatrist who is professionally trained to administer the tests and evaluate adaptive skills. In addition, the diagnosis must be made in accordance with the criteria provided in the Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, published by the American Psychiatric Association (commonly referred to as the DSM-IV). The Act specifies that a diagnosis or an evaluation may be performed as part of a county's single entry point process under Section 331.440, provided that a diagnosis is performed by an individual qualified as provided in the Act. The single entry point process under Section 331.440 authorizes a clinical assessment to be performed using a qualified mental retardation professional. The Aet includes a provision requiring counties to report any increased costs associated with changes to administrative rules made by the Department of Human Services to the definition of \"persons with mental retardation\" which result in increased costs to counties in the period beginning July L 199J. and ending June 30, 1995.

LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT 137 LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT SENA 'J'E FILE ISS \" Unemployment Compensation- Overpayment and Wage Credit Liability Transfer Provisions BY COMMITIEE ON BUSINESS AND LABOR RELATIONS. This Act eliminates the wage credit liability transfer provisions of the unemployment compensation law. Previously, when an employer hired a worker who quit another job, the employer inherited the wage credits the worker earned at the employee's previous job. Then, if a person filed an unemployment compensation claim, the employer was charged for the benefits earned with the previous employer. This Act provides that the employer is charged only for the benefits earned in their employ. This Act allows both contributory and reimbursable employers to be credited on the appropriate employer's account when unemployment compensation benefit overpayments are made. This Act also allows benefits for wage credits to be transferred to the Unemployment Compensation Fund in cases where an individual quit employment for another or better job and actually worked for the new employer. The Act requires the Unemployment Compensation Fund, rather than a specific employer's account, to be charged for benefits when a person quits a job voluntarily without good cause attributable to the employer, refuses suitable work, or when a person was discharged for misconduct. The Act deletes language that provided whether the former employer's or the succeeding employer's would be charged for benefit' paid and provides that this Act applies to all decisions concerning claims for benefits made on or after July 2, 1995.

This Act relates to tax provisions involving state income tax, certain county mental heaith and developmental disabilities service expenditures and property tax levies for the expenditures, the county property tax limitation, and property tax on industrial machinery, equipment and computers, and includes appropriations for property tax relief. pjyision I -Pension Income and Dependent Tax Credit -Study This Division allows a disabled person, a person who is 55 or older, and a surviving spouse to deduct pension income in computing income for state income tax purposes. The amount of the deduction is $3,000 for singles and $6,000 for marrieds. Pension income includes income from defined benefit or defined contribution plans, annuities, IRAs, plans maintained or contributed to by an employer or by a self-employed person as an employer, and deferred compensation plans, The Division also increases the dependent tax credit from $15 to $40 for individual income tax purposes. The Division requests the Legislative Council to establish a taxation study during the 1995 Interim to address the taxation of businesses, tax incentives and disincentives for economic development, and long-term objectives of business taxation, and requests $100,000 be available for consultants. The Division applies retroactively to January 1, 1995, for tax years beginning on or after that date. Division II ~ County Levy Authority In Division II, Section 331.424, subsection 1, providing supplemental levy authority for general county services, is amended to remove authority to levy under the supplemental levy for mental health, mental retardation, and developmental disabilities (MHIMR/DD) services. Conforming amendments are made to various sections of the Code. New Section 331.424A creates a county MHIMR/DD Services Fund. County authority to levy for MHIMR/DD services is provided for under this section and all county revenues and expenditures for such services are to be paid from this fund. The levy authority is limited to a base year amount and is subject to further reductions for property tax relief paid by the state. This Division takes effect January I, !996, for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1996. Division III~ Property Tax Relief Section 222.60 requires counties to pay for services for persons with mental retardation. This Division amends this section by making the payment requirement subject to the county management plan provisions codified by this Act in Section 331.439. Section 331.438 relates to state payment to counties for the costs. of MHIMR/DD services. Under prior law, FY 1993-1994 was established as a base year for net county expenditures for MHIMR/DD services. Beginning with FY 1996-1997, the state was to provide annual funding to eligible counties for 50 percent of the increase in the prior fiscal year over tho amount of the base year expenditures. This Division changes the state funding requirement for system growth to 100 percent of an inflation factor adjustment established by the General Assembly. The inflation factor adjustment is to be calculated by applying the factor to the county's MHIMR/DD expenditures in the previous fiscal year. Section 331.439 provides the eligibility requirements for a county to receive the state payment under Section 331.438. This section was stricken and rewritten. The changes from prior law include changing the dates by which a county must submit for approval and implement a managed care system for mental health services from submitting by March 1, 1995, and implementing in FY 1995-1996 to submitting by April 1, 1996, and 168 TAXATION implementing July 1, 1996; revising provisions involving managed care for mental retardation services by authorizing a county to implement managed care for mental retardation and developmental disabilities under a range of options and setting a specific date of January I, !997, for the initial implementation; authorizing a county to provide services to populations which are not included in the service management provisions if funding is available; requiring county MHIMRIDD service expenditures to operate under a fixed budget beginning with FY 1996-1997; requiring the county management plan to incorporate the single entry pojnt and clinical assessment provisions required under current law; providing the elements comprising the basis for determining whether a system for managed mental health care proposed by a county is comparable to the state-approved managed care contractor; requiring the county plan to address the county's criteria for serving persons with chronic mental illness; requiring implementation of the county management plan by budgeting for 99 percent of the anticipated funding; and, as under prior law, providing that the Director of Human Services' approval of a county management plan does not constitute cenification of the county's budget. Section 331.440 provides requirements for counties to implement a \"single entry point process\" for the delivery of MHIMR/DD services paid for in whole or pan by county funds. This section is amended to require the process to incorporate a management information system. New Section 426B.l creates a Propeny Tax Relief Fund under the authority of the Dcpanment of Revenue and Finance and makes standing limited appropriations to the fund. New Section 426B.2 outlines requirements for making payments from the Propeny Tax Relief Fund. A three-pan distribution mechanism is incorporated in the permanent statute for the Propeny Tax Relief Fund. The first $61 million is to be distributed to counties for propeny tax relief based upon a county's share according to the formula described below. (However, for FY !995\u00b71996, the amount of the distribution is $54.4 million.) Next, remaining moneys are distributed for the state payment under Sections 331.438 and 331.439. The third pan of the mechanism requires any other remaining moneys to be distributed for propeny tax relief for MHIMR/DD expenditures until the relief is equal to 50 percent of the total of county base year expenditures. When this point is reached, moneys are to be transferred to the Homestead Credit Fund. The amount of propcny tax relief moneys received by a county is determined by a three-factor formula based upon the county's proponion of the state's population, proponion of the taxable propeny valuation, and the proportion of spending for MHIMR/DD services in the base year according to Section 331.438. New Section 426B.3 requires the Director of Revenue and Finance to notify counties of the amount the counties will receive from the fund for propeny tax relief in the next fiscal year. The county auditor is required to reduce the property tax dollars requested for the county's certified budget for the county's MHIMR/DD Services Fund in the succeeding fiscal year by the amount the county will receive for propeny tax relief. In addition, the county auditor is to compute the reduction in propeny taxes for each parcel as a result of the state funding and note the reduction amount on the tax statement. New Section 426B.4 authorizes the Council on Human Services, in consultation with the State-County Management Committee and Djrector of Revenue and Finance~ to adopt administrative rules to implement the codified provisions in this Division. This Division provides that propeny tax relief received by a county for FY 1995-1996 is to be reduced from the county's cenified budget for that fiscal year and requires reporting to the Department of Management. This provision takes effect May 2, 1995. Included in 1994 Iowa Acts, Chapter 1163, which provided an extension in the propeny tax limitations on counties for FY 1995-1996 and FY 1996-1997, were contingent repeal provisions of the extension in the event the state does not enact appropriations to fulfill statutoty funding obligations included in that Act to be enacted by cenain dates in 1995 and 1996. The required 1995 Legislative Session enactment was enacted in 1995 Iowa Acts, H.F. 132 (See Appropriations). However, for !996, this Act specifies that, if enacted, the appropriations in the Act fulfill the statutory funding obligations required by no later than April 1, 1996, and the contingent repeal which would take effect on that date does not apply, so the propeny tax limitations would continue for FY 1996-1997. TAXATION \\69 The State-County Management Committee, a policy review group established by statute to consider MHIMRJDD issucst is required to review the effect of various provisions of the Act and to report recommendations by December 1, 1995. The Act also requires the County Finance Committee to work with four legislators in studying the ramifications of consolidating county property tax levies. The study report is to be submitted to the Governor and the General Assembly in January 1996. THE GOVERNOR ITEM VETOED THE FOLLOWING: 1. Procedures for establishing the amount of the inflation factor related to the state funding requirement for system growth. 2. Provisions describing an inflation factor adjustment for the fixed budget. The vetoed provisions would have authorized the State-County Management Committee to recommend the inflation factor adjustment to the Council on Human Services for inclusion in the Governor's proposed budget, and required that the Governor's recommendation be used for county budgets if the General Assembly did not enact an adjustment amount by the time county budgets must be certified. 3. A provision that would have limited a county's flnancialliability for MH/MR/DD services to the tlxed budget amount. 4. A provision requiring that a county not receive less for property tax relief than was received by the county in the previous fiscal year. Division IV -Property Tax Limitation Division IV extends the county property tax limitation for an additional year through FY 1997-1998 and provides for a reduction of the amount of property tax which may be levied under the limitation to reflect property tax relief received by a county from the Property Tax Relief Fund. Division V -Tndusnial Machinery Equipment and Computers Proucrtv Tax Exemption and Re.placement This Division eliminates the property tax on industrial machinery, equipment and computers (generally referred to as the machinery and equipment tax) by exempting from property. taxation certain machinery and equipment and by phasing out the existing property tax on other machinery and equipment. The Division also provides for state reimbursement, and other guarantees, to local governments for revenue lost from the elimination of the property tax on machinery and equipment. The Division provides that machinery and equipment first assessed for taxation in this state on or after January 1, 1995, is exempt from property tax. The property tax on remaining machinery and equipment acquired or leased on or after January 1, 1982, is phased out over four years as follows: For the assessment year beginning January 1, 1999, such machinery and equipment shall be valued at 22 percent of net acquisition cost. For the assessment year beginning January 1, ~WOO, at 14 percent of the net acquisition cost. For the assessment year beginning January 1, 2001, at 6 percent of the net acquisition cost. For subsequent assessment years, at 0 peJ;\"cent of the net acquisition cost. Machinery and equipment located in an urban renewal area designated in an urban renewal plan under which indebtedness, to be repaid with tax increment financing revenues, was incurred between January 1, 1982, and June 30, 1995, shall continue to be assessed at 30 percent of net acquisition cost until the indebtedness is retired or refinanced. This provision also applies to property taxes on machinery and equipment used to finance a new jobs training project undertaken between January 1, 1982, and June 30, 1995. Beginning with FY 1996-1997 through FY 2005-2006, local governments shall receive reimbursement from the state to replace revenue lost from the elimination of the property tax on machinery and equipment. The replacement 170 TAXATION claims arc computed based on the difference between the assessed value for that fiscal year and the assessed value as of the 1994 assessment year_ This amount is multiplied by the tax rate for each taxing district for that fiscal year. Beginning with FY 2001-2002, in computing replacement claims, the amount of increase in the assessed value of commercial and industrial property over the assessed value of such property in the J 994 assessment year shall be subtracted from the amount of loss in machinery and equipment valuations. The Division establishes the Industrial Machinery, Equipment and Computers Property Tax Replacement Fund from which the replacement claims will be paid by the state. The Division provides for a guarantee of replacement funds. Local governments are allowed to make up any deficiency in replacement claim payments by increasing the assessment on machinery and equipment in the taxing district in order to collect an amount equal to the amount of the deficiency. This amount is not allowed when computing the amount of property tax dollars a county may certify under the property tax limitation. The Division does not apply to machinery and equipment assessed by the Department of Revenue and Finance. The Division also does not apply to machinery and equipment used in an electric power generating plant which operated at a net capacity factor of more than 20 percent during the preceding assessment year_ SENATE FILE 181 -Sales Tax Exemption for Aircraft BY KIBBlE- This Act provides a sales and usc tax exemption for the gross receipts from the sale or rental of aircraft; the sale or rental of tangible personal property permanently attached as a component part of the aircraft; and the gross receipts of all services used for aircraft repair, remodeling and maintenance.

The Act is retroactive to July I, 1988, and allows for refunds of taxes, interest or penalties arising from claims occurring between July I, 1988, and June 30, 1995, but requires that claims be filed by October I, !995, and limits claims to $25,000 in the aggregate. The Department of Revenue and Finance is authorized to prorate the $25,000 among all clajmants in relation to the amount of the claimants' claims. The Act takes effect May 1, l 995, and is retroactive to July I, !988. SENATE FILE 189 -Real Estate Transfer Tax Exemptions- Purchase Money Mortgage Liens BY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY.

The Act also provides that a purchase money mortgage lien has priority over preexisting judgments against the purchaser or any other right, title, interest, or lien against the property which arises through the purchaser_ \u00b7 SENATE FILE 201 -Internal Revenue Code References and Income Tax provisions BY COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS_ This Act updates the references to the Internal Revenue Code to make the federal income tax changes enacted by Congress in !994 and through April 15, 1995, applicable for Iowa income tax purposes. The Act updates the Iowa Code references for the state research credits for individuals and corporations to include changes in the federal research activities credits.

The Act takes effect May 4, 1995, and applies retroactively to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 1994. SENATE FILE 472 -Local Option Salos and Services Tax BY COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS. This Act changes the local option sales and services tax law in Chapter 422B in three ways as follows: TAXATION 171 1. The Act allows cities, counties or other political subdivisions of the state to issue bonds in anticipation of the collection of the local option sales and services tax. The Act provides powers to issue bonds payable from local option sales and services tax revenues comparable to current law with respect to hotel and motel tax bonds. In order for a political subdivision other than a city or county to i.sue bonds, the political subdivision will be required to enter into a Chapter 28E agreement with a city or county to receive part of the local sales and services tax revenues that the city or county receives. The political subdivision would issue bonds in one of two ways. One way would be to issue the bonds as revenue bonds which are to be paid off only from the sales and services tax revenues and not from property tax revenues. This approach does not require an election. The alternative procedure involves bonds payable from sales and services tax revenues backed by a property tax levy_ This procedure allows the residents to petition to have an election held on the question of issuing the bonds. If such an election is held, the vote in favor of issuing the bonds must equal at least 60 percent before the bonds may be issued. 2. The Act authorizes a city, which is located in two counties but all of its residents are located in one county, to impose a city local sales and services tax in the county where none of its residents live. Present law only allows counties to impose the local sales and services tax and only in incorporated areas that have voted for the imposition. Therefore, the area of the city located in the county where no residents live could not under present law have the tax apply in its area. The Act contains certain conditions and restrictions on the city.imposed tax. These include imposing the tax only if the county has imposed the tax in the city area where all its residents live, agreeing to split the revenues equally with the county where 'no residents of the city live, the rate of tax and its effective date being the same as for the county-imposed tax, and any rate reduction, increase or repeal for the county also being done for the city tax. The Act provides that a city cannot impose such a city local sales and services tax after Januacy 1, 1998, but if one is imposed on or before that date, it may continue until such time as it is repealed. 3. Present law requires all areas in the county in which a county local option sales and services tax has been imposed to have an election to vote on the change in the use of the revenues from such tax even if only one area wants to change its use of the revenues. The Act makes it possible for each area, upon the request of the governing body for that area, to have its own election to vote on its proposed change in use. The Act takes effect May 22, 1995, and applies retroactively to local option sales and services taxes approved on or afterJuly 1, 1994. SENA'l'E FILE 473 -Refund of Erroneously Pald Property Taxes BY COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS. This Act allows the board of supervisors in a county having a population of more than 25,000 but less than 26,000 to refund propeny taxes erroneously paid by a taxpayer if the erroneous payment resulted from an overassessment of the taxpayer's propeny. The Act takes effect May 4, !995, and applies retroactively to property taxes payable in the fiscal period beginning July 1, 1986, and ending June 30, 1993.

Prior law allowed an exemption for the sale or lease of only replacement parts for repair or reconstructions of self-propelled and non-self-propelled farm machinery and equipment. HOUSE FILE 159 -Sales Tax Exemption- Plant Production BY COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS.

The Iowa Supreme Court in Phillips Petroleum Company v. Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance, 511 N.W. 2d 608 (Iowa 1993) held that capital gains resulting from transactions not in the regular course of a taxpayer's trade or business were nonbusiness income, even if the capital assets generated business income when they were used in the taxpayer's trade or business. The Act amends the definition of \"business income\" to overturn that decision. This amendment creates a separate functional test for business income. This amendment treats as business income any gain or loss resulting from property which, while owned by the taxpayer, was operationally related to the taxpayer's trade or business carried on in Iowa or resulting from stock in a corporation which was operationally related to the taxpayer's trade or business carried on in Iowa. The amendment expresses the General Assembly's intent that apportionable business income is all income that may be treated as apportionable under the United States Constitution. This Act also provides that if a taxpayer treated income covered by the amendment as business income or as nonbusiness income consistent with the Phillips Petroleum Company decision on a filed Iowa tax return for tax periods beginning prior to January 1, 1995, the Director of Revenue and Finance must accept such treatment. The amendment does not allow or require the filing of an Iowa income tax return on a combined reporting basis. The Act takes effect May I, 1995, and applies retroactively to January I, 1995, for tax years beginning on or after that date.

The Act provides that a person who files an incorrect refund claim shall be subject to a 10 percent penalty for the amount by which the amount claimed and refunded exceeds the amount due. If a person files a fraudulent refund claim, the penalty is 75 percent of the amount by which the amount claimed and refunded exceeds the amount due.

Sl!NA TE FILE 446 -Operating While Intoxicated and Related Provisions BY COMMITTEE ON nJDICIARY. This Act makes a variety of changes relating to the use or possession of alcohol and the operation of motor vehicles. The Act moves language prohibiting the possession of open receptacles containing alcoholic beverages in a motor vehicle from Chapter 123, which regulates alcoholic beverages, to Chapter 321, which governs motor vehicles, and provides that violations are punishable by a scheduled fine of $50. The Act contains language that establishes periods of \"hard\" revocation (no driving privileges), which is one of the prerequisites for the receipt of federal funds through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for enhancement of drunk driving prevention programs. Minimum revocation periods of 30 days are established if the person submits to and fails a chemical test which results in an indication of an alcohol concentration of .I 0 or more, 90 days if the person refuses to submit to a chemical test, and one year for a person who has had one or more previous revocations under Chapter 321J within the previous six years. The Act further provides for a reduction of the effective date of revocation from 20 to 10 days after notice of revocation, and requires that a request for hearing must be completed and returned to the State Department of Transportation within 10 days (currently 30) upon receipt of the notice of revocation.

Once the period of revocation ends, the individual is not subject to the motor vehicle financial responsibility provisions, but if the person drives while the person's license is revoked, criminal penalties will apply. A person whose license or operating privilege is revoked under the new provisions is required to pay the civil penalty to regain the person's license or privilege. The implied consent provisions and the two\" hour limitation on chemical test results apply to the requests for chemical testing under the .02 standard. Under the Act, persons whose licenses arc revoked for being over the .02 level arc not eligible to receive temporary restricted licenses during the period of revocation. Provision is made for the destruction of records relating to the administrative revocation after the revocation is 12 years old. The Act also provides, upon the conviction of a person for operating while intoxicated and being a second or subsequent offender (OWl 2nd or OWl 3rd), that the court may order the impoundment or immobilization of motor vehicles used by the person to commit the offense. The person or agency responsible for carrying out the order will determine whether the vehicle is to be impounded or immobilized. The term \"immobilized\" is defined to include the installation of a device that completely prevents a motor vehicle from being operated, or the installation of an ignition interlock device in the motor vehicle. If a motor vehicle is impounded or immobilized, the period of impoundment or immobilization is to be for 180 days or the period during which the person's license is to be suspended, whichever period is longer. The person convicted is prohibited from purchasing another vehicle or selling or transferring title to an impounded or immobilized vehicle during the period of impoundment or immobilization. Violation of the prohibition is a serious misdemeanor. Unless the person convicted is not in lawful possession of the motor vehicle, owners of motor vehicles which are the subject of orders for impoundment or immobilization are to pay a fee of $100 plus expenses to cover the cost of impoundment or immobilization before the owner can obtain the retum of the motor vehicle. However, if the owner of the motor vehicle is not the person who is convicted of the offense or the owner of the motor vehicle is a rental or leasing company, the owner may submit a claim for return of the vehicle within 24 hours of receipt of the order for impoundment or immobilization. The owner must, however, prove to the satisfaction of the court that the person did not know or should not have known, and, in the case of a rental or leasing company, that the person did not consent to, the operation of the motor vehicle in the commission of an operating while intoxicated offense. Holders of security interests may seek and gain return of motor vehicles which arc subject to orders for impoundment or immobilization, without payment of any fees or surcharges, unless the value of the vehicle exceeds the value of the security interest held by the creditor. Joint owners of motor vehicles, who are not members of the convicted person's immediate family, may make application for permission to operate a motor vehicle which has been impounded or immobilized if the joint owner1S license is not also under suspension or revocation, or the joint owner has not otherwise been denied a license, if an ignition interlock device is installed in the vehicle. A member of a convicted person's immediate family may also make application for permission to operate an impounded or immobilized motor vehicle, subject to installation of an ignition interlock device, if the family member can demonstrate that the vehicle is the only vehicle possessed by the fantily. Motor vehicles that are impounded or immobilized shall be forfeited to the state if the owner fails to claim the vehicle within 30 days of expiration of the period of impoundment or immobilization. Motor vehicles subject to an order for impoundment or immobilization, which arc operated on a street or highway in the state during the period of impoundment or immobilization, are to be seized and forfeited to the state. If the value of a motor vehicle which is the subject of an order for impoundment or immobilization is less than the costs of impounding or immobilizing the vehicle and the owner of the vehicle docs not prepay the co$t$ of impoundment or immobilization, the state may treat the vehicle as abandoned. Loss of use of a vehicle due to impoundment or immobilization does not constitute loss of use of the motor vehicle for purposes of a contract for insurance. The Act also provides that the statutory provision which would relieve a political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified does not apply to the Act. However, the Act also specifies that it is the intent of the General Assembly that the fees and funds generated by the Act are to be used to cover the costs associated with the additional duties imposed. TRANSPORTATION 185 HOUSE FILE 115 -Rest Areas BY BODDICKER. This Act provides that nonprofit organizations can serve free refreshments to motorists at rest areas during the Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends and the Fourth of July period pursuant to rules adopted by the State Department of Transportation. The Act also requires the Department of Economic Development, in consultation with the State Department of Transportation and the Department for the Blind, to develop a program to promote Iowa agricultural products at rest areas. The Act defines 11free refreshments'' as bejng limited to water, coffee, cookies, any nonintoxicating, noncarbonated beverage not already bottled or canned, doughnuts, or baked dessert goods. Nonprofit organizations arc permitted to accept, without active solicitation, voluntary donations from motorists. The State Department of Transportation shall approve or disapprove applications by nonprofit organizations to serve free refreshments at rest areas at least 60 days prior to the holiday period. HOUSE FILE 340 -Snowmobile and All-Terrain Vehicle Operation on Pnblic Land BY O'BRIEN. This Act defines \"public land,\" for the purposes of the chapter governing the operation of snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles, as land owned by government and land acquired for public recreation pursuant to an appropriation from the special conservation fund, which receives moneys acquired from snowmobile and aU-terrain vehicle fees. HOUSE FILE 393 -Exemptions From Motor Carrier Safety Requirements BY COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION. This Act concerns exemptions from federal motor carrier safety regulations relating to driver qualifications, hours of service and recordkeeping requirements. Previously, private carriers who were not for hire, who were engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce, and who operated not more than 100 miles from the driver's work reporting location, were exempt from the federal requirements. This Act changes the exemption to provide that the driver of a commercial vehicle engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce is exempt if the vehicle's gross vehicle weight rating is 26,000 pounds or less, unless the vehicle is used to transport hazardous materials or is used to transport more than IS passengers. The Act exempts certain farm-related drivers from rules adopted under Section 321.449 and allows a driver-salesperson for a private carrier, who is not for hire and who is engaged exclusively in intrastate commerce, to operate for specified periods of time. HOUSE FILE 460 -Condemnation Damages- Right-of-Way Notices- Scenic Highway ~dvertisiog BY COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION. This Act provides for a market-based interest rate for condemnation damages, provides for right-of-way notice filings, and deals with advertising control laws on scenic highways. This Act amends Section 6B-24 to provide for a market-based interest rate for condemnation damages rather than the current rate of 10 percent. In addition, it provides that interest on an award which has been determined on appeal to be greater than the amount set by the Compensation Commission should be accrued from the date of condemnation rather than from the date of the commencement of the action as provided in Section 535.3. The State Department of Transportation may notify a county or city that a road under the department's jurisdiction will be established, improved, relocated, or maintained and that the department may need to acquire additional right-of-way. The notice is valid for three years from the date of notification and can be refilcd by the department for an additional three-year period. The Act amends Section 306.19 to provide that the department can refile this notice every t:hree years. This Act also gives the State Department of Transportation authority to adopt rules controlling the erection of new advertising devices on a scenic highway or byway in order to comply with federal requirements concerning scenic byways. HOUSE FILE 504 -Liability of Motor Vehicle Owners BY COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION. This Act defines the term \"owner\" for purposes of determining liability for damages caused by the driver of a motor vehicle. Section 321.493 formerly provided that where damage was done by a motor vehicle due to the negligence of the driver and the motor vehicle was driven with the consent of the owner, the owner of the motor vehicle was liable for the damage. This Act provides that \"owner\" means the person to whom the certificate of title for the vehicle has been issued or assigned or to whom a 186 TRANSPORTATION manufacturer's or importer's certificate of origin for the vehicle has been delivered or assigned. If the vehicle is leased, the Act provides that \"owner\" means the person to whom the vehicle is leased. The Act also amends Section 321A.l to provide that for purposes of motor vehicle financial responsibility, the lessee is deemed to be the owner.
