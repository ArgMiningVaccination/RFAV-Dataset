According to previous estimates, about 85% of U.S. patients with skin disease have used alternative therapies, such as herbal, vitamin, and mineral supplements. Although the majority of patients with skin cancer undergo conventional treatment under the direction of a dermatologist, some patients will instead use alternative botanical treatments exclusively.1 Unfortunately, there's little reproducible evidence that supports the efficacy of these botanicals in skin cancer, and patients who opt for unproven alternative treatments often delay initiating conventional care that has proven efficacy.1 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't regulate herbal supplements, but it does address the problem of deceptive cancer cures on its website.2 Janet Y. Li, MD, and Jeremy T. Kampp, MD, from the Division of Dermatology, University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, recently published the results of their literature review of common topical herbal treatments that are advertised as skin cancer cures, which began with a search of the following terms in turn: \"nonmelanoma skin cancer,\" \"basal cell carcinoma,\" \"squamous cell carcinoma,\" and \"melanoma.\"1 The authors then applied evidence levels and grades of recommendation as determined by the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. Do any of these herbal supplements really work? Drs. Li and Kampp reviewed several herbal supplements for skin cancer, in addition to providing background information on each of them. Here's what they reported for 8 popular supplements. (Unfortunately, for those who believe in these products, the authors' findings can only be described as sobering.) Black salve Bloodroot and zinc chloride, the primary ingredients in black salve, cause localized tissue necrosis. Black salve is currently marketed, against the FDA's warning to desist, by a non-US based company as a cure for melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. Sanguinarine, which is the active ingredient in bloodroot, has been shown in mouse models to induce apoptosis and cytotoxicity in melanoma cells, but no clinical trials have studied its efficacy and safety. However, there are many case reports of serious adverse effects from black salve skin cancer therapy. Of the published case reports on black salve treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma lesions in 13 patients, 8 BCC lesions and 1 SCC lesion attained a complete response (6 were biopsy proven). Two cases each of residual and progressed BCC, and metastases in 2 melanomas, 1 SCC, and 1 BCC, were seen. Almost all patients experienced serious side effects, such as pain, ulceration, and scarring. Rating: Given the inconsistent evidence and the severity of adverse effects, black salve scored a D recommendation. Solasodine rhamnosyl glycosides These glycosides are derived from the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, bell peppers, and eggplant. They attach to the surface of cancer cells, but not normal tissue, and initiate apoptosis. Creams containing solasodine rhamnosyl glycosides are licensed in Australia and the U.K. but aren't approved for use in the U.S. A case series (86 patients total) and 1 randomized control trial (RCT) (N=94) were found in the literature. In the case series of 86 patients followed for 3 months, complete regression was seen in 100% of BCC, SCC, and actinic keratosis cases after roughly 5 weeks of treatment. In the 8-week RCT in 94 patients with BCC, 66% of patients using cream containing solasodine glycosides showed histologically confirmed clearance of BCC; however, 22% of these patients had a recurrence of BCC at the study's 1-year follow-up. No serious adverse effects were reported. Rating: Solasodine glycosides, because of the inconsistent results associated with them, scored a D recommendation. Frankincense Derived from the Boswellia tree, frankincense contains boswellic acid, which induces apoptosis, as shown in animal studies. In humans, only 1 case study, in a middle-aged man with 2 BCC lesions, was reported in the current literature review. After 4 months' treatment with frankincense oil, 1 lesion on the patient's arm completely resolved and 1 on his chest showed focal residual BCC. Treatment-associated allergic contact dermatitis has been reported. Rating: Because only 1 case study could be found, frankincense received a D recommendation. Cannabis Cannabinoids have shown melanoma and nonmelanoma antitumor effects in preclinical studies of mouse and human melanoma cell lines. Among the results, synthetic cannabinoids lead to apoptosis, impaired angiogenesis, and inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor, as well as decreased adhesion of melanoma cells to brain endothelial cells and impaired transendothelial migration of melanoma cells. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) was shown to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells and decrease cell viability, and also demonstrated decreased melanoma cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Rating: Various brands of cannabis oil are promoted to heal a wide array of medical diseases, from multiple sclerosis to depression, but there are no clinical trials to support any claims. This dearth of clinical evidence therefore earned topical use of cannabinoids a D recommendation. Black raspberry In the only skin cancer study thus far, use of black raspberry extract after ultraviolet B exposure reduced the number and size of skin cancer tumors in mice. However, no clinical trials in humans have been conducted, and no adverse effects associated with black raspberry have been reported. Rating: Because there's no clinical evidence, use of black raspberry extract scored (you guessed it) a D recommendation. Milk thistle Silibinin, a flavonoid isolated from milk thistle seed, induces apoptosis in mouse BCC cell lines and inhibits BCC tumor growth in mice. Even though milk thistle or its active compounds have been reported as skin cancer therapy, no clinical trials in humans have been conducted. No adverse effects associated with topical milk thistle have been reported. Rating: As with several of the other skin cancer herbals evaluated, Drs. Li and Kampp found no clinical evidence of the effectiveness of milk thistle or its active compounds. It, too, gets a D recommendation. St. John's wort Hypericin is an active ingredient in St. John's wort that induces apoptosis in human melanoma cell lines and SCC cells when given before photodynamic therapy. One pilot study conducted in 34 patients showed, after weekly treatment with St. John's wort extract and photodynamic therapy for 6 weeks, a complete clinical response in 50% of 8 patients with actinic keratosis, 28% of 21 patients with BCC, and 40% of 5 patients with SCC in situ. However, no RCTs have studied the efficacy or safety of St. John's wort in treating skin cancer. Rating: The jury is still out due to inconclusive evidence of efficacy. Therefore, topical use of St. John's wort in skin cancer scored yet another D. Tumeric Curcumin, a derivative of turmeric, induces apoptosis and inhibits in vitro melanoma cell migration and invasion in preclinical studies. However, no clinical studies show that curcumin is efficacious in treating nonmelanoma skin cancer. Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria, and pruritus have been reported with the use of topical turmeric. Rating: Another D recommendation, again thanks to the lack of clinical evidence. False, false, false Despite some support from preclinical data, there's little to no clinical evidence supporting the use of any of these botanicals for the treatment of skin cancer. So why do patients continue to purchase them? As the authors state, \"Many websites and patient testimonials cite a mistrust of physicians as a reason to turn to alternative therapies, often ignoring potentially devastating consequences. It is important for physicians to be aware of these alternative therapies and to maintain an open dialog with patients.\" Physicians and other healthcare professionals, they suggest, \"should warn their patients that although some encouraging results have been reported with herbal preparations, those positive results have not been reproducible and are not robust enough to replace current standard therapies . . . these botanicals may cause indiscriminate local tissue destruction . . . and produce an incomplete cure and a delay in diagnosis that allows for further local progression of disease at best and "}
