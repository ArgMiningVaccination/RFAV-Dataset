Their John of God Healing Bed, facilitated by psychic medium and intuitive Ed Carlton, is an exclusive offering in the Lake Norman area, and sessions are available twice a month. Ahlara also has one of the finest collections of crystals in the Charlotte/Lake Norman area. Ahlara International was created in 2005 by Wiggins, whose goal was to offer the community a center that would provide services to nurture the well-being of mind, body and spirit. She had been leading spiritual journeys for more than 25 years to sacred sites around the world such as Peru, Nepal, Tibet and Egypt that overflow with ancient culture and inspiring spiritual energies. Wiggins wanted to offer that spiritual energy in a wellness center and replicate the feelings of several of her favorite places by incorporating their artwork, textiles, and sacred statues. A space was created to offer body work, yoga, meditation and classes for spiritual growth. \"Ahlara is truly a healing oasis for mind, body and spirit,\" she says. Ahlara also presents a unique shopping experience, with a boutique filled with clothing and accessories, crystals and oils, skincare products and gift items. The relaxing atmosphere provides an enjoyable shopping destination. \"Ahlara has more than 32 dedicated people on staff that are highly educated in their fields and offer exceptional service to our clients,\" declares Wiggins. \"Ahlara has a high level of expectation from each staff member, and strives to provide the highest-quality services and products. Ahlara offers a full range of therapies and is dedicated to offering clients a holistic body, mind and spirit experience. They are different than franchise businesses which are only focused on profit and not in helping the client.\" Ahlara hosts a quarterly Mind, Body, Spirit Expo that brings together some of the area's finest holistic healers and intuitive readers/messengers. \"At this event, people can schedule 15-minute sessions and get a feel for what is available in longer sessions to help heal their physical, emotional or spiritual issues,' notes Wiggins. The next Expo is scheduled for July 21. Ahlara International is located at 155 Joe Knox Ave., in Mooresville, NC. For more information, call "}
