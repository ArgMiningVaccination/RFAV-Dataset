Vagus nerve stimulation. De-stress and relax. ?Cleanse meridians, cleanse emotional blockages and detox toxins while strengthening your immune system, endocrine system and entire constitution. ?Raise your vibration and increase your life force energy body, Prana, Qi and Aura while bringing your chakra energy centre frequencies into balance. ?Restore alignment and equilibrium. Anatomically, energetically, psychologically and emotionally. Within body, mind and soul Chakras are the 7 energy centres through which energy moves, believed to sit along the spine at each intersection of our 3 main Nadis. Each Chakra vibrates at a different frequency. Everything about us is 'alive' with a vibrational frequency and we can influence these frequencies to bring them into balance. One Chakra per week, we will utilise the following corresponding to each Chakra. Music note, Location, Gland, Positive Qualities, Affirmation, Malfunctions, Main focus, Seed-sound/Mantra, Sense, Element, Meaning, Colour, Food type, Stone/crystal and more. Activating your parasympathetic nervous system, supporting and allowing your body to relax, rest, digest, heal and regenerate. Dropping you out of and away from the 'yang' stress response of fight, flight, freeze, fawn which our body utilises when it perceives stress and/or danger. Take time and stillness to relax, stretch and come home to your true self and calm the mind enough to hear the whispers of innate divine wisdom from the timeless, ancient, unchanging divine source energy that resides within each and every one of us. 7.25pm Wednesday at Boheme and Body yoga Shala, Christine Corner shops, Varsity lakes 4227.
