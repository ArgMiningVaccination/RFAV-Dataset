Diabetes itself is the most common cause of neuropathy worldwide Approximately 66% of Type 1 and 59% of Type 2 diabetics will develop symptomatic neuropathy during their lifetime (or.. about 50% of all diabetics will eventually develop neuropathy) Subclinical neuropathy, and neuropathy associated with the pre -diabetic state of impaired glucose tolerance affects even more individuals. Multiple large clinical cohorts have extended the known risk factors to include the metabolic syndrome, glycemic variability, dyslipidemia, and smokingAxons from (CNS) motor neurons relay signals to muscles, while axons from CNS sensory neurons receive signals from skin and joints. Axons are frequently 20,000 times longer than their corresponding cell bodies. Schwann cells provide supporting myelin for a fraction of sensory axons, but many sensory axons are unmyelinated, making them more susceptible to damage. In addition, CNS sensory neurons are not protected by the blood-nerve barrier, unlike motor neurons, adding to their vulnerability. Pathogenesis of Distal Symmetric Polyneuropathy (the most common dependent \"dying back\" axonopathy. *Fiber selective the more vulnerable distal sensory and autonomic fibers, leading to the progressive loss of sensation that underlies the clinical manifestations of diabetic polyneuropathy (relative sparing of motor axons). PATHOGENESIS *No longer considered \"one single disrupted pathway\" * multiple differentially regular pathways that converge to promote mitochondrial dysfunction with bioenergetic failure and oxidative damage of axons. *Ischemic and metabolic factors may operate together. Ischemia itself has metabolic consequences that may be exacerbated by insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Inflammation, specifically acute phase reactants and interleukins, may also play a role. Nerve Fiber Repair: Peripheral nerve repair is impaired in diabetes. This complication may be due to disease- induced loss of neurotrophic peptides that normally mediate nerve repair, regeneration, and tonic maintenanceDistal symmetric neuropathy caused by diabetes -functionally morphologically indistinguishable many of the vasa nervorum are present early in the course of the disease and may parallel the severity of the nerve fiber loss. Thus, morphologic characteristics of diabetic neuropathy support a vascular component, although most damage is likely secondary to metabolic impairment and loss of required energy in the distal sensory axons. Classification of the Diabetic Neuropathies 1. Symmetric Polyneuropathy 2. Autonomic Polyneuropathy (it is a separate classification, but this very frequently co - occurs with #1) 3. Polyradiculopathies cachexia; diabetic anorexiaDistal Symmetric Neuropathy Length dependent (stocking/glove) Most common diabetic neuropathy; more than 80% of patients with diabetic neuropathy have DSP/A. In both type 1 & Type 2 DM, risk factors for neuropathy include poor glycemic control, HTN, smoking and cardiovascular disease Persons with mildly impaired glucose tolerance without frank DM are also at risk (check with a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test) Can affect large fibers or small fibers. Usually these co -exist. In small fiber neuropathy, it is mainly small, unmyelinated nerve fibers that are affected, and in these cases, standard EMG/NCV testing is NORMAL.Distal Axonal Degeneration *advances tingling, in toes are complaints UNSTEADY GAIT *pain very common*cramping sensations are common*Nocturnal (feet bedclothes)*True WEAKNESS very rare (if present -wasting of EDB is occasionally present) *autonomic symptoms Physical Signs: Symmetrically impaired vibration, position, touch, thermal and pain senses in the distal lower limbs that slowly advance proximally over time. *Vibratory sense is often heralding sign. *As time goes on, may also include the middle chest/abdomen (cuirass sign) *Lost ankle jerks (large fiber) Differential Diagnosis: Not difficult if long standing hyper -glycemia ; retinopathy; nephropathy. Remember -diabetes is a common disorder, and diabetics who develop distal symmetric sensory neuropathies unaccompanied by renal or retinal changes should not be assumed to have DSP/A. They should be evaluated for coincident metabolic/toxic, hereditary or dysimmune conditions associated with polyneuropathy, along with disorders of lumbar spine and spinal cord. Course and Prognosis One population based study showed 10% worsened over 2 years; 81% unchanged and 9%improved. Highly variable, but many never progress beyond a stage of numb feet, mildly unsteady gait, and occasional discomfort. Neuropathy, once established, is not significantly improved by strict glycemic control. It may help halt progression. In this kind of \"typical\" diabetic neuropathy presentation, additional testing offering highest yield is to check SPEP/IFE and B12 (with homocysteine, MMA). Full set of work -up for DSP: Tier 1: CBC, CMP, FBS/A1C/OGTT, b12 (mma or asymptomatic somatic neuropathy (clinical / subclinical). Many experts consider that DAN is really just part of the larger category of distal peripheral neuropathy. Low et al. (2004) reviewed the autonomic symptoms and standardized autonomic testing of patients with diabetes mellitus (Type 1 and 2) and of control patients, and found that 54% of patients with Type 1 diabetes, and 73% of patients with Type 2 diabetes had objective autonomic impairment, but this was generally in the mild range. Only 14% of the diabetic patients in that study had moderate to severe generalized autonomic failure. Symptomatic autonomic neuropathy difficult to assess, since many symptoms are vague. Most studies strongly suggest that once established, autonomic dysfunction steadily progresses; enhanced in the aged patient. Clinical Effects of Autonomic Neuropathy Cardiovascular GI Peripheral Sudomotor Genitourinary OtherCardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy tachycardia (earliest manifestation resting tachycardia) Orthostatic Hypotension (very common ) Postural Tachycardia (increase in HR without a drop in BP, can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, etc)-note a diagnosis of POTS should not be made in individuals with diabetes ; a more appropriate diagnosis would be diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Increased Mortality (two meta -analysis) Several potential mechanisms: * diminished perception of cardiac ischemia * Reduced cardiovascular response to physiologic stressors such as surgery or infection *Association between DAN and cardiac arrhythmias due to alterations in QT interval *Alterations in the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems have been considered to be pro-arrhythmogenic *Denervated myocardial tissue that has focal areas of reinnervation may be at increased risk for arrhythmia Despite the evidence that DAN is associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality, sudden cardiac death in patients with DAN may have a stronger relationship with atherosclerotic heart disease than with DAN itself. Sleep apnea \u2014There is evidence that sleep apnea and respiratory arrest may contribute to the increased mortality complicating diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Testing Autonomic Function *Heart rate response to standing (30:15 ratio....ratio of R R interval measured at beats 30 and 15 after standing) *Heart rate response to Valsalva maneuver (Valsalva ratio.... ratio of longest to shortest R R interval measured while performing the Valsalva maneuver) Sympathetic adrenergic function: *Beat to beat BP response to a Valsalva*Systolic / diastolic BP change in response to tilt table testing Sympathetic cholinergic function: 1. Try to prevent disease progression (modifiable risk factors such as smoking, HTN, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia) 2. Med review to try and remove worsen orthostatic hypotension 3. are refractory 4. Non -pharmacologic changes Rise Slowly Head of bed raised 10 -20 degrees Tensing the legs by crossing them while actively standing on both legs. In one report of patients with autonomic neuropathy, this procedure raised the cardiac output by 16 percent and the systemic blood pressure by 13 percent [ 92]. It can therefore minimize postural symptoms. Performing dorsiflexion of the feet or -Other Clinical Urogenital : Erectile dysfunction:(increases with age; once commences, impotence almost always permanent) Bladder dysfunction: incomplete emptying, reduced urinary flow, recurrent infectionsPeripheral sudomotor /vasomotor neuropathy - *loss (so can have proximal hyperhidrosis to compensate)*Changes in texture of skin, of nails*Pain (\"small fiber neuropathy\") Other: Pupillary abnormalities - can result in failure in dark adaptation and difficulty driving at night. GI Autonomic Testing *Gastric emptying scintigraphy *Isotope Based breath entities felt to be DISTINCT, pathogenetic entities. Recent studies - not only considerable co -occurrence and overlap, but also strikingly vasculopathic histologic changes in the lumbosacral condition. The 2 conditions are considered to exemplify the same disorder, occurring at slightly different levels of neuro the proximal limbs Most common: *middle aged and elderly type 2 DM males with GOOD GLYCEMIC CONTROL. *often associated with weight loss, often PROFOUND Often occurs early after a diagnosis of DM -is RARELY accompanied by nephropathy/retinopathy (as in DSP)Aching pain -often severe -initial symptom. Usually one side of the hip/thigh PROXIMALLY. RARELY - can affect distal leg. Frequently -this SPREADS to the other legThen -asymmetric, progressive weakness of one or both proximal L/E (usually anterior thigh) EVENTUALLY HOWEVER - weakness is also present in the distal limbs (eventually)AKA -diabetic amyotrophy , diabetic involvement Some cases -may begin with distal limb weakness, pain in lower back Patellar jerks -absent on one/both sides; AJ's depressed or absent if co- existent neuropathy Evolution - can occur over weeks /months DISABLING -can cause very severe weakness Monophasic -recovery is variable. Most improve slowly. Better if unilateral; worse if bilateral Pain - usually subsides over weeks/months No established treatment -Some controlled trials show using corticosteroids, IVIG, plasma exchange, or a combination can help with PAIN but not overall outcome. EMG/NCV: *Will show a poly - radiculopathy/ plexopathy , pure radiculopathy; perhaps an associated distal polyneuropathy. EMG'er will need good DX: Retroperitoneal Vasculitis lab screen CSF -could be helpful (increased protein) Nerve biopsy rarely usefulAgain -this is a different entity than typical diabetic symmetric polyneuropathy -seen in good glycemic control history, soon after diagnosis, absence of retinopathy/nephropathy This is secondary to a non -necrotizing, multi -focal, inflammatory micro -vasculitis with evidence of ischemic injury. Some suggest that the inflammatory infiltrate reflects an IMMUNE MEDIATED disorder; others maintain that the inflammatory cells are SECONDARY Would note, that this disorder can also occur in NON -DIABETIC patients (idiopathic radiculoplexus neuropathy). The demonstration of abundance microvasculopathy in DLRPN (and in the corresponding syndrome of those patients who are NOT diabetic) is strong evidence in favor of an ischemic, as opposed to a purely hyperglycemic/metabolic, alone, or WITH DLRPN More common with older type 2 diabetics; frequently associated with weight loss THORACIC SYNDROME PREDOMINATES -lumbar dysfunction often undetected. Onset -can be sudden or subacute Local thoracic or abdominal pain is HALLMARK -occasionally bilateral Can look like a zoster (without rash), lyme radiculoneuropathy Knife -like, burning, band -like, hard to wear clothes because of INTOLERABLE allodynia Can sometimes see an abdominal protruberance due to denervation Usually lasts 2 -5 months Diagnosis - straightforward. If atypical - consider spinal MRI. EMG, if done, can show denervation in paraspinal and /or abdominal wall intercostals (but most emg'ers wouldn't this) Focal Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: *present in about 14% of diabetics WITHOUT DSP and in 30% if DSP is present!! By comparison -there is about a 2% prevalence in a reference population There is also an increased incidence of peroneal, ulnar and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapments. Multiple entrapments in one patient can be seen (mononeuritis multiplex), but consideration should be given to underlying vasculitis 50 Trochlear (4thnerve) may accompany oculomotor Onset -ABRUPTPAINFUL May have orbital discomfort for days prior to onset Paralysis of the extraocular muscles is near total Pupils should be sparedMRA is needed if younger age or pupillary change Ischemic lesions may be present in either the extra -axial oculomotor nerve or in the fasicular fibers in the midbrain Acute Painful Neuropathy (Diabetic Neuropathic Cachexia) Starts right after severe, precipitous unintentional weight loss and POOR glycemic control. RARELY -unaccompanied by weight loss Gradual onset of intolerable burning pain over the soles of feet/legs with allodynia are hallmarks Pain may be diffuse, limbs, trunk NO WEAKNESS Monophasic -restoration of glycemic control and weight gain are associated with diminished pain Note -a similar condition may occur in anorexic females (intentional weight loss) -\"diabetic anorexia\" Some experts have argued that this entity is part of the spectrum of DPN with the same underlying mechanism and pain fibers being predominantly involved. This monophasic course, the lack of correlation between diabetes mellitus duration, and the neuropathy with associated weight loss, makes it unlikely to be part of DPNTreatment -Induced Neuropathy (insulin neuritis) Uncommon, small fiber involvement Acute, acral painful syndrome coincident within weeks of insulin therapy Pathogenesis -uncertain, but proposed mechanisms include endoneurial edema from glucose deprivation neuronal injury due to recurrent hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemic Neuropathy Newly diagnosed, poorly controlled diabetics may experience an episode of TRANSIENT acral pain / paresthesias Most improve following establishment of consistent glycemic controlNod to Bells Palsy Herpes simplex virus activation has become widely accepted as the likely cause of Bell's palsy in most cases. Herpes zoster is probably the second most common viral infection associated with facial palsy. In a recent article published in European Neurology, a clinical analysis of 372 cases and review of related literature did show that diabetes mellitus was the most common co- morbid condition accompanying Bells palsy. Alternate postulated mechanisms of Bell's palsy include a genetic predisposition in some cases and ischemia of the facial nerve . Diabetes is a risk factor for microangiopathy , which may lead to Bell's palsy via microcirculatory failure of the vasa nervosum . Nod to Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) Occurs in both TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 May be more frequent than idiopathic CIDP Classic CIDP -progressive weakness and predominantly DISTAL sensory symptoms over 2 months. Weakness is characteristically symmetric and generalized (proximal and distal). The presence of PROXIMAL weakness clinically, differentiates CIDP from the more common length -dependent axonal polyneuropathies. Diagnosis EMG/NCV -for all neuropathy presentations that are felt clinically to be within the peripheral nervous system (using emg/ ncvas an extension of the clinical exam). Multiple consensus panels recommend the inclusion of electrophysiologic testing in the evaluation of diabetic neuropathy. Autonomic Testing -typically in a lab that does specifically, autonomic testing ( ie academic centers) Skin Biopsy -small fiber neuropathy Diagnostic Pitfalls in ACADEMY OF NEUROLOGY Guideline Update: \"Oral and Topical Treatment of Painful Diabetic Polyneuropathy\" Practice Guideline Update, December 27, 2021. Practice Guidelines ( updated in 12/21 from 2011 guidelines). .An update was needed to review a large number of new randomized controlled trials of the treatment of pain in people with painful diabetic neuropathy and to highlight the alternatives to opioid use in this population. AAN does NOT recommend using opioids. This guideline also evaluates the effects of different medication classes on painful diabetic neuropathy, whereas most previous guidelines and systematic reviews have focused solely on individual medications. Understanding whether medications of the same class have similar or different effects on pain reduction has implications for optimal treatment of this common condition, such as considering other factors such as cost when choosing between pain medications of the same class and which medications to switch to after a treatment failure.Gabapentinoids Gabapentin is probably more likely than placebo to improve pain (SMD 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 -0.84; medium effect, moderate confidence; 1 Class I study). Pregabalin is possibly more likely than placebo to improve pain (SMD 0.29; 95% CI, 0.13 -0.45; small effect, low confidence; 8 Class I and 7 Class II studies). Mirogabalin is possibly more likely than placebo to improve pain (SMD 0.21; 95% CI, 0.02 -0.40; small effect, low II studies).

Three Class I and 6 Class II studies were included for medications of this class, including 1 for venlafaxine, 1 for desvenlafaxine, and 7 for duloxetine. SNRIs are probably more likely than placebo to improve pain (SMD 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34 -0.60; small effect, moderate confidence; 3 Class I and 6 Class II studies). Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) In addition to 1 new study, 2 Class I or Class II studies were identified for amitriptyline from the systematic review of the 2011 guideline.11 Amitriptyline is possibly more likely than placebo to improve pain (SMD 0.95; 95% CI, 0.15 -1.8; large effect, low confidence; 1 Class I study and 2 Class II studies). No Class I or Class II studies were found for other TCAs; therefore, the best estimate for the class effect is based solely on amitriptyline studies. .... TCAs are possibly more likely than placebo to improve pain (SMD 0.95; 95% CI, 0.15 -1.8; large effect, low confidence; 1 Class I study and 2 Class II studies). The I2 value for heterogeneity was 80%.Sodium Channel Blockers Valproic acid: Three Class II studies were identified, including 1 new Class II study.

Other Oral Medications: Nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, is probably more likely than placebo to improve pain (SMD 1.32; 95% CI, 0.52 -2.13; large effect, moderate confidence; 1 Class I study). Ginkgo biloba is possibly more likely than placebo to improve pain (SMD 0.83; 95% CI, 0.48 -1.18; large effect, low confidence; 1 Class II study). Ginkgo biloba is possibly more likely than placebo to improve pain (SMD 0.83; 95% CI, 0.48- 1.18; large effect, low confidence; 1 Class II study). Tocotrienols, which belong to the vitamin E family, are possibly no more likely than placebo to improve pain (SMD 0.09; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.32; low confidence; 1 Class II study).
