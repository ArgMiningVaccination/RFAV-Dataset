DT Vaccine Discontinuation In 2023, Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. stopped manufacturing the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids absorbed vaccine, commonly known as DT. Discussions are underway regarding updated vaccine recommendations for infants and children who should not receive acellular pertussis-containing vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed 12 vaccines for use in the United States to help protect against diphtheria and tetanus. Nine of these vaccines also help protect against pertussis. Some of the vaccines include protection against other diseases as well, including Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, hepatitis B, and poliomyeltis. Learn about the composition, types, immunogenicity, and efficacy of these vaccines, as well as view package inserts, below. The \"Pink Book\" contains the most comprehensive information on routinely used vaccines and the diseases they prevent. Six reference appendices include: vaccine minimum ages and intervals, current and discontinued vaccines, vaccine contents, foreign vaccine terms, and more. Types and Composition of Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccines Diphtheria and Tetanus (DT and Td) Only Vaccines There is one generic pediatric DT vaccine used in the United States.

The residual formaldehyde content, by assay, is less than 0.02%. The vaccine contains a trace amount of thimerosal (not as a preservative) from the manufacturing process [0.3 micrograms (g) mercury/dose]. There are two Td vaccines used in the United States: TENIVAC\u00ae and TDVAX\u00ae.

Those ingredients may be present in the final vaccine at 0.05 ng neomycin and 0.01 ng polymyxin B per dose. Each 0.5-mL dose of Pediarix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline) includes the same diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis components listed in Infanrix\u00ae above, the poliovirus components listed in Kinrix\u00ae above, and 10 \u00b5g of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg).

Each dose also contains 100 \u00b5g of residual formaldehyde and 100 \u00b5g of polysorbate 80 (Tween 80). The manufacturing process of the poliovirus vaccine uses neomycin sulfate and polymyxin B. Those ingredients may be present in the final vaccine at 0.05 ng neomycin and 0.01 ng polymyxin B per dose. The procedures used to manufacture the HBsAg antigen result in a product that contains 5% yeast protein.

Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy Diphtheria and tetanus Today, diphtheria and tetanus are at historic low rates in the United States. No one has ever studied the efficacy of tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid in a vaccine trial. However, experts infer efficacy from protective antitoxin levels. A complete vaccine series has a clinical efficacy of virtually 100% for tetanus and 97% for diphtheria. A complete series is 3 doses for people 7 years or older and 4 doses for children younger than 7. Pertussis In regard to pertussis, there has been an overall increasing trend in reported cases since the 1980s up until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In spite of this, pertussis affects many fewer people today than before pertussis-containing vaccines became widely available in the 1940s. There are several reasons to help explain why we are seeing more cases recently: - Increased awareness - Improved diagnostic tests - Better reporting - More circulation of the bacteria - Waning immunity The acellular pertussis vaccines now used in the United States do not protect for as long as the prior whole cell pertussis vaccine. CDC is looking into whether molecular changes to may also be contributing to the resurgence. In studies demonstrating the efficacy of the pertussis component for children who get all 5 doses on schedule, DTaP fully protects: - 98% of children within the year following the last dose - About 71% of children 5 years after getting the last dose of DTaP In studies demonstrating the efficacy of the pertussis component, Tdap fully protects: - About 73% of adolescents in the first year after vaccination - About 34% of people 4 years after vaccination In studies demonstrating the efficacy of the pertussis component when women get Tdap during pregnancy, the vaccine prevents: - About 78% of pertussis cases in infants younger than 2 months old - About 90% of hospitalizations for infants younger than 2 months old with pertussis Package Inserts Consult the following package inserts for proper storage and handing details, shelf life, and reconstitution instructions: References - Skoff TH, Blain, AE, Watt J, et al.
