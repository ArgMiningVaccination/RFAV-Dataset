The preliminary research included data from 35,691 pregnant women and findings showed the group reported similar side effects as women who were not pregnant. At the end of the study, 827 women who signed up for a special registry to track outcomes had completed their pregnancies. \"Importantly, no safety concerns for people vaccinated in the third trimester or safety for their babies,\" Dr. Walensky [said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/04/23/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-31/). Initial vaccine trials did not include pregnant women, with this study marking the largest ever analyzing COVID-19 vaccine safety in the group. The CDC had not updated its [site](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html) to reflect Dr. Walensky's recommendation as of April 23. "}
