Dr Keiji Fukuda, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Security recently said that AMR is occurring in every region of the world, potentially affecting anyone, of any age, in any country. He warned that, if measures were not taken immediately to counter AMR, the implications will be devastat - ing. Without urgent, coordinated action by many stakeholders, the world is headed for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries which have been treatable for decades can once again kill'.a In the light of this, this paper describes how the sector of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) can make a significant contribution to reducing the problem of AMR. The CAM perspective on health and disease is essentially different from the conventional biomedical perspective. It is not just a difference in the technology and instruments used, but in the underlying para - digms, basic concepts and philosophical perspective. Although CAM represents a variety of different medical systems and therapies, the CAM modalities have a common denominator, i.e. their individualised holistic approach and their focus on promoting the individual's health by assisting the person's innate self-healing and health-maintaining capacity. The CAM perspective on infectious disease also differs from the biomedical one. A short retrospective of the different scientific positions in the 19th century on the role of pathogens in infectious disease is helpful to understand this. The German physician Robert Koch (1843- 1910) argued that bacteria are the smallest but most dan - gerous enemies of mankind. His critic Max Josef von Pettenkofer (1818- 1901) a chemist and hygienist, maintained that pathogens infect only the most susceptible (those with poor diet, constitution, etc.) and, proving his point, he drank a large cholera cocktail without falling ill.In France a similar controversy existed between Louis Pasteur and Claude Bernard. Louis Pasteur (1822- 1885), a chemist and microbiologist, took the position that microorganisms infecting animals and humans cause disease. Physiologist Claude Bernard (1813- 1878) argued on the other hand that the body becomes susceptible to infectious agents only if the internal balance - or homeostasis as we now call it - is disturbed. After all, there are billions of microbes and bacteria inhabiting our gut, our blood, in fact our whole system most of which are essential to good health. Pathological bacteria, fungi and viruses take root as disease when the terrain is weakened and susceptible to them. This explains why when a bacterial or viral agent is \"doing the rounds,\" some people become sick while others remain healthy. History shows that the perspectives of Pasteur and Koch that focused on combating disease by directly killing germs have prevailed. There is no question that antibiotics have dramatically and successfully reduced illness and death from serious infectious diseases. However, the vital role of the host's ability to repel invaders based on a properly functioning immune system, has been neglected. In reality, infection is always the result of two factors: exposure to a pathogen and the person's susceptibility. a - World Health Organisation, 2014. WHO's first global report on antibiotic resistance reveals serious, worldwide threat to public health. Available from: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/ 5This one-eyed approach which focuses only on the infecting organism is also reflected in research, which has been directed at finding the most potent way to kill the germs, whereas hardly any research investigates ways and means to raise the effectiveness of the immune system. In fact, both approaches have their merits. In a patient who is seriously ill and affected by highly virulent bacteria, there is no argument, that antibiotics can be live saving. On the other hand, antibiotics do not offer an adequate solution for a patient who has had recurrent infections and taken several courses of antibiotics, because in this case it is the patient's susceptibility that needs to be addressed. Lastly there is a growing awareness of the importance to health of the microbiome - the collective genomes of the microbes (composed of bacteria, bacteriophage, fungi, protozoa and viruses) that live inside and on the human body. The human body has about 10 times as many microbial cells as human cells. The microbiome plays an essential part in the immune system protecting us against infection, breaking down food in the digestive system to release energy and producing vitamins and helping in the elimination of waste. What is also now being understood is that antibiotics can have a disrupting and disturbing effect on the microbiome and may be causatively involved in a number of the widespread chronic illnesses that currently affect us such as obesity, diabetes and cancer, e.g. a recent study revealed a connection between early antibiotic exposure in infants and the development of a tendency to obesity by the age of threeb. A large population-based study carried out in Finland showed a clear statistical correlation between the level of antibiotic exposure in early life and the likely development of cancer later in lifec. This growing awareness of how the microbiome is impacted by antibiotics adds another extremely important reason for why antibiotic use must be dramatically reduced to when they are absolutely es - sential. It also calls for other ways to treat and prevent illness that support and strengthen the health and resilience of the terrain of the microbiome which is being increasing understood to be so essential to our immune system and health generally. 2 THE ROLE OF CAM IN INCREASING THE RESILIENCE OF INDIVIDUALS When it comes to the host's ability to repel invaders, basic requirements to keep the immune system strong include quality sleep, regular exercise, healthy food, relaxation practice and healthy relationships. In building and maintaining resistance to infectious illness, CAM therapies have an important role to play because they mobilise and stimulate the self-regulating capacity of the organism, thus increasing its resilience. Greater resilience means: a swift and sustained recovery from infections; a reduced susceptibility to future infections; less reliance on antibiotics. Moreover, herbal medicinal products in particular, as used in CAM, can be used as an alternative means to fight infection based on their own antimicrobial properties. b - Trasande L et al (2013).

International Journal of Cancer, 123(9):2152-2155 6The following sections describe the role herbal, homeopathic and anthroposophic medicine and their associated medicinal products can play to reduce the problem of antimicrobial resistance both in humans and animals. These strategies to reduce our reliance on antibiotics or to make antibiotics that have now lost their efficacy viable once again, are backed by convincing research. Below we provide tables reviewing some promising evidenced-based research on herbal, anthroposophic and homeopathic medicines demonstrating their potential to help combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. This presentation is a selective review illustrating the way in which these medicines might make a useful contribution; it is not a completely comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the evidence. To produce this review searches were performed in October 2013 in AltHealthWatch, AMED, Embase, Estar, Cinahl, the Cochrane Library and PubMed. To provide a practical evaluation of the evidence presented in this review we have adapted a version of the widely used GRADE approach (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation)1. This allows for 4 levels of rating of the research evidence - High/Strong, Moderate, Low and Very Low. For simplicity, we have amalgamated Low and Very Low grades into a single category of Preliminary evidence. This selective review highlights potentially fruitful areas for future research. 3 HERBAL MEDICINE IN HUMANS Herbal medicine - also called botanical medicine, phytomedicine or phytotherapy - refers to using a plant's seeds, berries, roots, leaves, bark, or flowers at therapeutic doses in the maintenance of optimal health, and in the treatment and prevention of disease. Whole herbs contain many chemical constituents working synergistically together to treat disease and support the body's own healing mechanisms (e.g. its immunity). Herbal medicines may play a role as autonomous anti-bacterial agents or as adjuvant treatments used to potentiate conventional drugs. This section selectively reviews the evidence for herbal medicine as a valu - able resource to combat bacterial resistance to antibiotics and suggests that further research is warranted. Synergy is an important characteristic determining the medicinal action of many herbal medicines oc - curring at pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic levels2, 3 and a number of papers have been published investigating potential benefits conferred by the synergism of phytoconstituents4, 5, 6, 7. In particular, re - searchers have demonstrated that combining antibiotics with plant medicines can enhance the action of antibiotics thereby overcoming antibiotic resistance 8. This is achieved in three main ways: firstly by means of a combined phytochemical and antibiotic attack on the bacterial cell wall - epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) as found in green tea and carob powder is effective in this regard. Secondly, antibiotic resistance can be overcome by inhibition of enzymes that are generated by bacteria for the deactivation of antibiotics (again EGCG is active here) or, thirdly, by disabling an efflux pumping system developed by several bacteria in order to prevent potentially destructive compounds such as antibiotics from penetrating into the bacteria, or to expel the antibiotics out of the bacterial cell once they have invaded it9, for example the flavonoids in Hydrastis canadensis. Further examples are that thymol and carvacrol, two compounds in the essential oil of thyme (Thymus vulgaris), act as so-called into Gram-negative bacteria10. Thyme contains also contains baicalein also present in the Scutellaria species (Lamiaceae family) and baicalein has shown significant ability to reverse MRSA resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin by inhibiting the bacteria's defensive efflux pump11. 7Most research to find agents to support antibiotics which have become ineffective against common bac - teria has been lab-based rather than on humans. A recent review provided evidence of 34 different herbs containing constituents known to inhibit the bacterial efflux pumps12. For example, E. coli is currently dem - onstrating resistance to several antibiotics but, combined with extracts of Sophora alopecuroides, isolates of the bacteria were found susceptible to ciprofloxacin13. Similarly, Klan\u00e7nik et al. (2013) found that extracts of Rosmarinus officinalis inhibited drug resistant strains of Campylobacter14. Extracts from several other plants in this study, have shown similar inhibitory effects on Campylobacter, as have extracts of green tea15. Another major concern is the drug resistant bacterium, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Exposure to berberine, a compound found in many medicinal plants (e.g. Coptis chinensis and Phellodendron amurens) together with antibiotics such as levofloxacin and azithromycin16 (which had recently proved ineffective against MRSA), resulted in the reactivation of the efficacy of the antibiotic drugs. Similar re - sults were found employing Scutellaria baicalensis against Staphylococcus aureus to restore the antibacterial actions of ciprofloxacin via similar mechanisms of efflux pump inhibition17. Indirubin, extracted from the leaves of Wrightia tinctoria, used in Ayurvedic medicine, has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus18. Nineteen herbs commonly used in Chinese medicine have inhibitory al. investigated the antimicrobial effects of 30 plants tradi - tionally used to treat skin infection focusing on their potential to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus. Of these, 21 extracts were found to have anti-MRSA effects with Mallotus yunnanensis and Skimmia arborescens being the most active20. Herbal medicines may help to resolve the problem of antibiotic resistance more directly. Doctors faced with relatively minor, often self-limiting, but common infections e.g. pharyngitis, laryngitis and ton - sillitis or mild urinary tract infections (UTIs) have little to offer except advice on how to manage the condition or otherwise prescribe an antibiotic which may not be appropriate. Herbal medicines may fill this therapeutic gap, providing effective treatment that reduces antibiotic pre - scribing and does not contribute to microbial resistance. For example, a number of herbal medicines are traditionally used to treat sore throat such as sage Herbal medicine can also help to ease UTIs employing remedies such as Arctostaphylos uva ursi28,29,30,31 and Zea mays32. Nigella sativa shows promise in treating drug resistant H-pylori (see Table 1 , page 18). Several studies suggest that certain Indian and Chinese medicinal plants used in Ayurvedic medicine33,34,35,36 and traditional Chinese medicine37 respectively have significant antimicrobial activity. The systems of herbal medicine that developed in India and China differ in several significant ways from European herbal medicine. The most obvious difference is that the Western herbal tradition often, but not always, focuses on 'simples', that is a single herb taken by itself. In contrast, traditional Indian (Ayurvedic) and traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCHM) make almost exclusive use of herbal combinations. More importantly, these formulas are not designed to treat symptoms of a specific illness; rather, they are tailored specifi - cally to the individual according to the complex principles of traditional Indian (Ayurvedic) and traditional Chinese medicine. Herbal medicines form a potentially rich territory worth exploring as a practical way of combating micro - bial resistance to conventional antibiotics. Herbal medicines have been used as antibiotics for thousands of years, yet remain effective, suggesting that bacteria have a reduced ability to adapt to a plant-derived antibacterial regimen. 84 HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE IN HUMANS Homeopathic treatment is based upon the similarity principle referred to as 'like cures like'. This principle advocates that a substance that causes symptoms at a large dose in a healthy person can be used at lower doses to treat very similar symptoms in a person who is unwell. In practical, clinical terms, a homeopath aims to match an appropriate homeopathic remedy with the patient's symptom picture as closely as possible. In this way, two individuals presenting with tonsillitis, for example, may be prescri- bed different homeopathic remedies according to their individualised symptoms rather than accord - ing to the infectious agent. However, in many published trials and tests of the efficacy of homeopathy the methods used to investigate the treatment being applied infrequently reflect this central homeopathic principle, thus hampering the ability to demonstrate homeopathy's effectiveness in a real-world contextd. Those trials that have reflected the individualised approach collectively reveal that homeopathic medicines are up to twice as likely as placebos to produce positive effects.e Homeopathy is considered to be safe with minimal side effects. Adverse events have only occurred when homeopathic medicines have been improperly self-administered in inappropriate amounts, or when pa - tients taking homeopathic medicines have not been receiving concomitant conventional medical treatment where appropriate.51, 52, 53, 54 Homeopathic philosophy holds that homeopathic treatments improve functionality of an individual's immune system so that the person can deal with infection efficiently, and restore wellness without lasting damage or complications. There is no risk of resistance developing with homeopathic medicines: homeopathic medicinal treat - ment is aimed at stimulating a homeostatic response in an affected individual, supporting the efficient endogenous management of infections, e.g. those in the respiratory and urinary tracts without the need for antimicrobial treatments. In this way, homeopathic treatment focuses on supporting the resistance of the individual patient and not on the infecting microbe, removing the risk of microbial resistance developing to homeopathic medicines and leaving current conventional antimicrobial treat-ments to be safeguarded for essential usage in serious and life-threatening infections. Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) represent one of the most common reasons for antibiotic pre - scriptions in primary care, with these prescriptions often being unnecessary or inappropriate, because only approximately one-quarter of URTIs are of bacterial originf. Thus, any novel therapy that can be used effectively instead of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in these acute conditions would help support the EU strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance. The balance of moderate and strong evidence is considered positive for the effectiveness of homeopathy in URTIs, particularly for the following specific infectious conditions that are commonly treated with antimicrobials: otitis media55, 56, 57, sinusitis58, 59, 60, 61, common cold62, 63, influenza-like syndromes64, 65, 66, 67 and (unspecified) upper respiratory tract infections68, 69, 70 (see Table 2 , page 20). Also an HTA re - port on homeopathy as part of the Swiss Complementary Medicine Evaluation Programme68 concluded that [...] \"the trial results showed probable effectiveness of homeopathy for allergies and infectious diseas - es of the upper respiratory tract. Tolerability of the treatment is very good and is not reduced through combi d - Mathie RT et al (2012) Method for appraising model validity of randomised controlled trials of homeopathic treatment: multi-rater concordance study.

Economic advantages are possible due to the fact that homeopathic - treatment can lessen the need for conventional medication.\" That means that homeopathy may be effective in reducing excessive antibiotic prescribing in primary care. At the moment there are only two choices in managing acute otitis media and sinusitis: either immed- iate antibiotic treatment in case it is the uncommon bacterial form of the condition, or delaying antibiotic therapy for 2-3 days on the basis that it is more likely to be a viral infection (known as 'watchful waiting'). The former approach can lead to widespread inappropriate use of antibiotics, whilst the latter may increase the risk of complications from delayed treatment of a bacterial infection. In these conditions homeopathy offers an additional choice. In cases where watchful waiting would current - ly be recommended, homeopathy could be given immediately instead. Any patients who did not respond to homeopathic treatment by day 3 would be given antibiotics (just as they would with watchful waiting). As there are virtually no side effects from homeopathic medicines and they do not contribute to anti-micro - bial resistance, there is no expected negative impact from this proposed additional intervention. However, if homeopathy proved to be an effective treatment by day 3 of the disease, the potential benefits would include the reduced use of antibiotics and delivery of prompt treatment. In conclusion, there is some evidence to support the suggestion that homeopathy could provide an effective treatment option to support the EU strategy for combating antimicrobial resistance, especially in URTIs where antibiotics are commonly used. 5 ANTHROPOSOPHIC MEDICINE Anthroposophic Medicine is an integrative medicine system originated in Europe in the early 1920s, established nowadays in 80 countries worldwide, most significantly in central Europe.g An- throposophic medi cine is integrated with conventional medicine in hospitals and med ical practices. It applies me-dicines derived from plants, minerals, and animals; art apy, and rhythmical massage; psychotherapy; nursing techniques such as exter - nal embrocation. Anthroposophic healthcare is provided by medical doctors, therapists, and nurses. An HTA Reporth and its recent updatei identi fied 265 clinical studies the effi cacy and effective- ness of anthropo sophic medicine. Over decades, anthroposophic doctors practising within the primary health care sector have accumulated a large expertise in the treatment of bacterial infections using AM remedies alone or, if needed, in combina - tion with antibiotics. The International Integrative Primary Care Outcomes Study (IIPCOS) on anthropo - sophic medicine was conducted in four European countries and the United States and compared primary care patients who were treated by anthroposophic or conventional physicians for acute respiratory and ear infections72. [For more details of AM trials see Table 3 , page 23]. Compared to conven tional therapy, anthroposophic treatment was associat ed with much lower use of antibiotics and antipyretics as well as quicker recovery, fewer adverse reactions, and greater therapy satisfaction. These differences remained after adjustment for country, age, gender, and four markers of baseline severity. g - Kienle GS, Albonico HU et al.

Schattauer Verlag, Stuttgart-New York 10Improvement within 24 hours occurred in 30.9% (221/ 715) of patients treated by AM doctors and 16.6% (50/301) of patients treated by conventional doctors. Antibiotics were used in 5 ,5% of patients in the an - throposophic doctors group compared to 33, 6% in the conventional group. Day 7 complete recovery or major improvement was reported by 77. 1% (AM doctors) vs. 66. 1% of patients (conventional doctors), respectively. Adverse drug reactions were reported in 2 .7% patients treated by AM doctors compared to 6.0% within the other group. The safety analysis of the AM medicines used showed that adverse drug reac - tions were rare (2 /715 patients) and mild. In another multicentre prospective observational study in AM primary care centres in Germany74, 12,081 patients with 19, 050 acute upper airway infections occurring during one year of observation were en - rolled. The infections included most often common cold (63. 3%) and acute tonsillitis (12. 9%). 73. 7% of patients were children. In 63% of all cases, treatment was purely anthroposophic. In only 6 .3% antibiot - ics were used. Within the group of the 8 ,900 children with 14, 945 respiratory tract infections, antibiotic prescriptions occurred in only 5 .8%. The prescription rate of antibiotics was much lower than the mean in Germany. Antibiotic and antipyretic use in early childhood are known today as putative risk factors for the develop - ment of allergic and autoimmune diseases like asthma, atopic eczema and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, a reduced prescription rate of antibiotics and antipyretics is of use not only to reduce AMR but to increase health performance in children, which could be demonstrated in a well-controlled paedi - atric epidemiological study.j A recent study in an anthroposophic hospital73 demonstrated that 16/ 18 patients with community-ac - quired pneumonia were successfully treated with anthroposophic medicine only and 2 /18 needed ad - ditional antibiotic therapy (both of risk class IV). Thus, it was shown that even severe infectious diseases can be cured by means of AM lowering the need for antibiotics significantly. A recent surveillance on multi-resistant bacteria at the Paracelsus hospital in Bad Liebenzell, Germany, executed by the Department of Environmental Health Sciences of the Freiburg University revealed that the percentages of most multi-resistant bacteria in the anthropososphic medicine hospital were much lower than in the average conventional hospital. Patients mostly have CAM family doctors in their primary care prescribing antibiotic less often and they received fewer antibiotics during their hospital stay. The data showed frequencies for Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci of 0.4% (Paracelsus-Hospital) vs. 12.6% (group of comparable German hospitals of same size and patient structure), imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas vs. (the percent - ages of MRSA in anthropososphic medicine hospital vs. conventional hospitals were almost equal: 19% vs. 21.3%). This can be regarded as proof of principle: overall low prescription rates of antibiotics by fam - ily doctors and during hospital stays will lead to a significantly reduced prevalence of AMR in hospitals. i - Kienle GS et al (2011) Klinische eines Health und Status Quo [Clinical research on anthroposophic medicine: update of a health technology assessment report and status quo].

Lancet, 353(9163):1485-1488 116 ANTIBIOTICS IN THE FARMING INDUSTRY It is estimated that more than half of the worldwide production of antibiotics is used by the farming industryk. Animals are routinely put on a course of antibiotics to treat common bacterial infections and it is now common practice to treat the whole herd prophylactically (metaphylaxis) to stop the infection spread - ing. In addition, low, sub-therapeutic doses of antibiotics may be given to animals en masse over periods of weeks when they are considered to be at risk of infection. Although the practice of using low doses of antibiotics to promote growth in animals is banned in the EU, in practice growth-promoting effects are achieved through the low doses administered as chemoprophylaxis, thereby blurring the boundaries between the two uses. This extensive usage of veterinary antibiotics necessitates the development of sustainable alternatives. The basis for sustainable animal husbandry lies with a goal-oriented and responsible breeding policy, appropriate nutrition and housing and professional care with an eye for the individual animal. Health and wellbeing are intrinsically connected. Measures that improve animal welfare will also have a positive influence on health and productivity. Natural feed components and herbal and homeopathic medicinal products can help sustain animal healthl. Using these products can diminish the number of disease outbreaks on a farm and can help to restrict the use of antibiotics to a limited number of severely diseased animals. The greatest added value of the use of natural products is disease and prevention of disease. 7 RECENT POLICY OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN ORGANIC FARMING In June 2007 the European Council of Agricultural Ministers agreed on a new Council Regulationm on organic production and labelling of organic products. This Council Regulation contains defines goals, principles and general rules for organic production. The goal of this legal framework was to set a new course for the continued development of organic farm - ing. Sustainable cultivation systems and a variety of high-quality products are the aim. In this process, even greater emphasis is placed on environmental protection, biodiversity and high standards of animal protection. In addition, the legislation aims at ensuring consumer confidence and protecting consumers' interests. The European Commission funded ANIPLANn ran from 2007 to 2010 and was aimed to minimise medi - cine use in organic dairy herds through active and well-planned animal health and welfare promotion and disease prevention. The process having been implemented on the farms appeared to be a feasible approach to improve udder health and minimise use of antibiotics without impairment of productivity. k - Urgent action necessary to safeguard drug treatments, WHO (2011) at http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2011/whd_20110406/en/ l - Groot M,Kleijer-Ligtenberg G, van Asseldonk T, Hansma H (2011) Natural Dairy Cow Health - A guide to keeping your herd healthy with herbs and other natural products.

It includes, among other things, (1 ) the development of a pro-active monitoring protocol aiming for im - proved effectiveness of preventive and treatment strategies and for a reduction in the use of allopathic drugs, and (2 ) the assessment of the manageability of alternative treatments (CAM) according to the state-of-the-art. It runs until 30 September 2016. 8 HERBAL MEDICINE IN ANIMAL HUSBANDRY After the ban of antibiotic growth promoters in the European Union many alternative substances have been investigated for their potential to replace them. An interesting project was initiated in 2006 by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality. The project Development of phytotherapy as a tool for reducing and/or prevention of diseases in farm animals was carried out by the Institute of Food Safety (RIKILT) in cooperation with the Universities of Wageningen and Utrecht, the Institute for Ethnobotany and Zoo - pharmacognosy among others. The goal of the project was to increase the number of available herbal medicines for organic farmers, but also regular animal husbandry is interested in products that may reduce the need for antibiotics. The project showed that there are many herbal products (compounds of several herbs) available that can be primarily recommended for the promotion of health, both in organic and regular animal husbandry. Herbal products are mainly used for prevention, particularly in periods in which animals are more vulner - able to diseases, for example, in case of changing diet, housing or environment. Almost all herbal products selected for this project showed that the quality could be substantiated and the declared composition could be confirmed. This shows that reliable quality products are put on the market. In a number of these herbal products, the claimed effect has been made plausible by laboratory tests and / or animal studies. Because registration as veterinary medicine is expensive and often not feasible due to the complex nature of the products, most of these herbal products are sold as supplementary feed or feed additive. Even though they are not registered as veterinary medicinal products it is advisable to determine the effects of these herbal products on animal health in an objective manner, making it possible for farmers to rationally ap - ply these products to their animals and for veterinarians to take account of these products when treating the animals. During this project some animal experiments have been performed relating to current health problems in organic farming. They included animal experiments in proven animal study models where animals fed with herbal products were compared with untreated control animals. In addition field experiments were performed both on organic and conventional farms. Experiments were performed with organic layer hens, grower pigs and dairy cows. o - http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/104247_en.html http://www.dev.impro-dairy.eu/index.php/en/ 13The project produced two databases, one on products and one on background literature, which can be ac - cessed at the website (www.fyto-v.nl). The product database includes 142 herbal products, broken down by sectors: 86 in cattle, 74 in pigs, 54 in poultry and 41 in small ruminants (a large number of products is used in several animal species). The literature database covering each single herb has about 500 entriesp. Currently, veterinary and animal herbalists throughout the world use herbs from several systems of medi - cine, including Ayurvedic medicine, Western herbal medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine as well as Kampo (traditional Japanese medicine). A veterinarian need not adopt any or all of the principles and practices of these systems of medicine to benefit from its use. In India a considerable amount of literature on veterinary herbal drug research, clinical trials, pharmacol - ogy, and basic research has been generated with a view to scientifically systematising the ethnoveterinary medical practices and folklore claims on herbal treatments. Research efforts by the National Laboratories and Veterinary, Medical, Pharmacy, and Science Colleges in India have established detailed data regarding herbs-their effects, effectiveness and safety. The most investigated Ayurvedic herbs and the most commonly used Ayurvedic herbs in veterinary practice are listed in Wynn & Fougere's textbook of Veterinary Herbal Medicineq. Also phytogenic feed additives or phytobiotics are a promising alternative. These are plant-derived prod - ucts (extracts or essential oils) added to feed in order to improve performance. They comprise of a very wide range of substances with respect to biological origin, formulation, chemical description and purity. They act mainly in the direction of improving gut health, immune system and well-being. A great number of in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed a wide range of activities of phytobiotics in animal nutri - tion like stimulation of feed intake, antimicrobial, coccidiostatic, anthelmintic and immunostimulatingr action. Phytobiotics produce their beneficial effects in several wayss: (1) stimulation of feed intake and digestive secretions canadensis, coccidiostatic activity (e.g. oregano, cloves, cinnamon) (3) stimulation or moderation of the immune system (e.g. Astra - galus membranaceus), and (4) antioxidant activity (e.g. rosemary). 9 HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE IN ANIMAL HUSBANDRY Homeopathic medicine or homeopathy has traditionally been used for the treatment of animals as well as humans. In farming it is used for pigs, chickens, turkeys, sheep, and cattle. The most common diseases treated include diarrhoea, pneumonia, infertility, mastitis, and birthing problems. Mastitis is an economically important disease of dairy animals throughout world, due to its long-term ef - fects on milk yields. Huge economic losses are also incurred due to unmarketable milk or milk products contaminated with antibiotic residues. Conventional treatment depends on the use of antibiotics, which are not only costly but residues in milk and meat pose human health risks. Indiscriminate use of antibiotic results in the emergence of resistant bacterial strains causing an increase in treatment failures. p - http://www.fyto-v.nl/pub_data/table_summary.php?table=literatuur q - Wynn SG & Fougere B (2006) Veterinary Herbal Medicine, Mosby Elsevier, USA r - Jacela JY, DeRouchey JM, Tokach MD, et al (2010).

Phytobiotics: alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in monogastric animal feeds, Recent Advances in Animal Nutrition in Australia, 15, 131-144 14Diarrhoea became a disease with significant economic impact in the production of swine due to the systems of intensive farming adopted. Enteritis can appear in three different stages: neonatal diarrhoea, appearing during the first days of life; piglet diarrhoea, when it appears from the first week of life to weaning; and diarrhoea after weaning. Generally, 50- 60% of deaths during the suckling stage happen during the first week of life mainly due to crushing by the sow or neonatal diarrhoea. Neonatal diarrhoea, mostly caused by Escherichia coli, is the disease with highest impact in production of swine. If left untreated, it leads to weight loss and, not uncommonly, to death of the piglet, resulting in significant financial losses to the farmer. Conventional treatments of E. coli diarrhoea is administration of antibiotics to affected piglets, or preventive vaccination of the sows. A recent study involving the use of homeopathy in the treatment of E. coli diarrhoea in neonatal piglets showed promising results.81 Antimicrobial use in animals contributes less to the rising problem of resistance and it is obvious that any non-essential usage of antimicrobials in animals should be curtailed: homeopathy may therefore offer an appropriate alternative. Homeopathy is emerging as an alternative therapy in veterinary medicine for its ability to prevent recurrence of diseases without leaving residues in animal products. Homeopathy depends on the totality of physical and psychological symptoms of the diseased animals and aiming to augment the body's immune defences, supporting these rather than treating, inhibiting, or suppressing symptoms. Homeopathy can be effective in both bacterial and viral diseases. In addition, epidemic diseases in animals can be addressed with homeopathy, both in a preventive as well as a curative way. With one remedy often a whole epidemic within a herd can be treated. Both mastitis in cattle76, 77, 78, 79, 80 and Escherichia coli diarrhoea in swine81, 82 have been identified as clini - cally relevant issues for which homeopathy could be efficacious and some research has been conducted to begin evaluating these approaches (see Table 4 , page 24). The most recent trial on Escherichia coli diarrhoea81 is a very good example of how a trial would be relatively easy and inexpensive to carry out, yet in return for this small investment, the potential rewards could be significant. It was a robust observer-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial (triple-blinded, i.e. as to administration, scoring, and analysis) carried out by researchers at the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands. It explored the use of a homeopathic medicine derived from Escherichia coli bacteria (Coli 30K) instead of antibiotics at the prevention of E. Coli diarrhoea in piglets. 52 sows were randomly allocated into either the homeopathy group or the placebo group. The sows gave birth to 525 piglets that were scored for occurrence and duration of diarrhoea. The results clearly showed an effect of the homeopathic medicine with only 3 .8% of the homeopathy group suffering from diarrhoea compared to 23. 8% in the control group (p< 0.0001). This study and others80 indicates that potential benefits of the use of homeopathy in the treatment of neonatal diarrhoea in piglets is considerable; furthermore it does not carry the risk of AMR. EUROCAM recommends that a replication of this study be conducted. Given the size of the pig industry, a large-scale multi-centred approach would allow firm conclusions to be reached as to whether this form of homeo - pathic treatment is efficacious for prevention of E. coli diarrhoea in piglets in the EU and could therefore significantly replace the use of antibiotics for this purpose. We believe that the evidence mentioned here indicates an area of novel antimicrobial treatment options in animal care that deserve further investment and investigation with adequately sized and appropriately designed trials. 1510 CONCLUDING REMARKS AND SUGGESTIONS EUROCAM supports and encourages integrated and fully informed healthcare choices for patients and recognises that conventional antimicrobial treatment, when appropriately prescribed, plays a vital role in managing public health. However, the severity of the threat posed by AMR to global health means that all potential measures, particularly novel solutions, must be explored as a matter of urgency. EUROCAM therefore recommends that the potential of CAM in reducing the problem of AMR is given se - rious consideration and that further research is carried out in this area to determine in which conditions, both in human and veterinary healthcare, specific CAM modalities are particularly effective. Compared with other avenues of such as the identification and development of new antibiotics, such trials would be relatively easy and inexpensive to carry out, yet in return for this small investment, the potential rewards could be highly significant clinically. To date, there has been a huge disparity between public funding for conventional drug research and that for CAM research. Whilst CAM may improve health, reduce disease, reduce health costs and help reduce the problem of antimicrobial resistance, the CAM sector alone cannot be expected to fund the research to investigate these possibilities. The CAM industry is small and there are no major financial and/or industrial interests driving research efforts in this field. Like mainstream medical research, there is a social responsibility for government to fund such research. As for conventional medicine there should be industry-independent funded research. Complementary and Alternative Medicine can support the EU strategy to conserve and steward the effectiveness of existing antimicrobial treatments and offer an avenue for the development of novel future therapies. It is time for serious consideration and investment to be given to it. 1617 TablesTABLE 1: HERBS TO HELP COMBAT GROWING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE (RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS ONLY) STUDY DESIGN PUBLICATION DETAILS MAIN FINDINGS POSSIBLE MECHANISMS STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE An evidence-based systematic review of umckaloabo (Pelargonium sidoides) by the US Natural Standard Research Collaboration.Ulbricht C et al.

Inpatient treatment of community-acquired pneumonias with integrative medicine. Evidence Based Complementary Alternative Medicine, 2013: 578274. 16/18 patients with community-acquired pneumonia could be cured successfully by application of AM medicine only, using AM medicines and external applications like compresses and embrocations. The pneumonia severity index (PSI) was used to estimate the severity of pneumonia. 2/18 patients needed antibiotic therapy in addition. 15/16 patients without antibiotic treatment belonged to risk groups I-III (low and moderate risk) and one patient to risk group V (high risk). Both patients with antibiotic treatment belonged to risk group I V. Thus, it was shown that in specialized units treatment of severe infectious conditions like pneumonia by AM is possible and will lead to a significantly reduced need for antibiotics. Moderate GCP-conform prospective observational nonrandomised comparative outcomes study including 21 primary care centres in 4 European countries and the US. 715 patients with acute respiratory and ear infections treated by 27 anthroposophic physicians were compared to 301 patients treated by 16 conventional physicians.Hamre HJ, Fischer M et al.

Wiener klinische Wochenschrift, 117, 256-268Improvement within 24 hours occurred in 30.9% (221/715) of patients treated by AM doctors and 16.6% (50/301) of patients treated by conventional doctors. Day 7 complete recovery or major improvement was reported by 77.1% (AM doctors) vs. 66.1% of patients (conventional doctors), respectively. Antibiotics were used in 5,5% of patients in the anthroposophic doctors group compared to 33,6% in the conventional group.Strong GCP-conform prospective observational nonrandomised comparative cohort study including 21 primary care centres in 4 European countries and the US.Hamre HJ, Fischer M et al.

Drug Target Insights, 2, 209-219.The safety analysis of the AM medicines used showed that ADR\u00b4s were rare (2/715 patients) and mild. In one case, there was sleeplessness at night, in the other case local swelling due to subcutaneous injection of an AM remedy. ADR\u00b4s thus occurred at a significantly lower percentage than with conventional treatment.Strong Large multi-centre prospective observational study in AM primary care centres in Germany including 12,081 patients with 19,050 acute upper airway infections including common cold (63,3%) and tonsillitis (12,9%). 73,7% of patients were children. practices in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in anthroposophic medicine]. Forschende Komplement\u00e4rmedizin, 14, 207-215.In 63%, treatment was purely anthroposophic. In only 6,3% of cases antibiotics were used. Within the group of the 8,900 children showing 14,945 respiratory tract infections, antibiotic prescriptions occurred in only 5,8%.Strong 23TABLE 4: HOMEOPATHY IN ANIMALS WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASES (RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS ONLY) STUDY DESIGN PUBLICATION DETAILS MAIN FINDINGS STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE Randomised placebo-controlled trial on 104 cows with subclinical mastitis. Six different homeopathic medicines were compared with placebo. Intra-mammary application of 1 ml of the homeopathic medicine or isotonic saline solution as placebo.Andersson R, Morcillo \u00fcber a prophylactic effect. Four of the six homeopathic medicines did not show a therapeutic effect. Only Lachesis D8 and Silicea D6 in mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus had a therapeutic effect, i.e. a significant decrease of cells in the milk and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) blood level.Preliminary Randomized placebo-controlled trial including 26 cows, divided in 2 groups, pairing on clinical and subclinical mastitis status, milk production and number of lactations.Searcy R, Reyes O, Guajardo G (1995). Control of subclinical bovine mastitis. Utilization of a homeopathic combination. British Homeopathic Journal, 84: 67-70.The proportion of affected quarters (a cow's udder is divided up into four quarters) according to the California Mastitis Test was 32% in the treated group, and 68% in the control group. The odds ratio of the difference shows that animals receiving placebo presented 4.5 (1.78-11.73) times more subclinical mastitis than those under homeopathic treatment (p<0.05). Average milk production in the treated group did not differ significantly from that of the control group.Preliminary Ninety-six mastitic quarters (non-fibrosed 67 and fibrosed 29) were treated with a homeopathic with acute mastitis (non-fibrosed) treated with different antibiotics were included in the study. Varshney JP, Naresh R (2005). Comparative efficacy of homeopathic and allopathic systems of medicine in the management of clinical mastitis of Indian dairy cows. Homeopathy, 94: 81-85.The overall effectiveness of homeopathic combination medicine in the treatment of acute non-fibrosed mastitis was 86.6% with a mean recovery period of 7.7 days (range 3-28), and total cost of therapy as Indian Rupees 21.4 (\u20ac0.39, US$0.47). The corresponding cure rate for the antibiotic group was 59.2% with a mean recovery period of 4.5 days (range 2-15) and an average treatment cost of Rs.149.20 (\u20ac2.69, US$3.28). The authors conclude that the homeopathic combination medicine Healwell VT-6 was effective and economical in the management of mastitis in lactating dairy cows.Preliminary Randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment with antibiotic and placebo treatments in cases of mild and moderate bovine clinical mastitis. A total of 136 lactating dairy cows with 147 affected quarters from four herds in Germany were randomly allocated to three treatment groups. The cows were examined on days 0, 1, 2 and on days 7, 14, 28 and 56 post initial infection to assess clinical signs. Simultaneously, with the exception of days 1 and 2, quarter milk samples for laboratory examinations (bacteriology, somatic cell count) were collected to assess bacteriological and cytological cure rates.Werner C, Sobiraj A, Sundrum A (2010). Efficacy of homeopathic and antibiotic treatment strategies in cases of mild and moderate bovine clinical mastitis. Journal of Dairy Research, 77: 460-467.On days 28 and 56, treatment strategies did not differ significantly with respect to the clinical outcomes and the total cure rate in cases of bacteriological negative mastitis (n=56). In cases of pathogen-positive mastitis (n=91), the cure rate after 4 and 8 weeks was similar between the two treatment strategies, homeopathy and antibiotic treatment, but the difference between the homeopathic and the placebo treatment at day 56 was significant (P<0.05). The results indicate a therapeutic effect of homeopathic treatment in cases of mild and moderate clinical mastitis.Preliminary 24A field trial with 102 dairy cows from 13 Swiss organic dairy farms was conducted. Cows were randomly assigned to one of three groups within a herd. In the Internal Teat Sealer group (ITS; 36 cows) cows were treated with the commercial ORBESEAL (Pfizer) in all four quarters immediately after the last milking. In the homeopathy group (HDT; 32 cows) the cows were treated per-orally by a herd-specific homeopathic formulation consisting of two remedies in 1:10(6) dilution over 5 days before and after drying-off. The untreated group received no therapy (U; 34 cows).Klocke P, Ivemeyer S, Butler G, Maeschli A, Heil F (2010). A randomized controlled trial to compare the use of homeopathy and internal Teat Sealers for the prevention of mastitis in organically farmed dairy cows during the dry period and 100 days post-calving. Homeopathy, 99: 90-98.For ITS, HDT and U the clinical mastitis incidence rates for the first 100 days post-calving were 11%, 9% and 3%, respectively, and the proportion of normally secreting quarters was (quarter somatic cell count (SCC) [QSCC]<100,000/ml) 70%, 68%, and 65%, respectively. Power analysis indicates that a proportion of 75% would support the rejection of null hypothesis in the HDT, and 74% in the ITS group against untreated control. Quarters of cows with SCC<200,000/ml at drying-off showed significantly higher normal secretion in HDT group (odds ratio [OR] 9.69) compared to untreated control, whereas Teat Sealing lead to an OR of 3.09 (not significant, post hoc power 31.3%). Under the studied conditions herd-specific homeopathic dry cow therapy was effective in increasing the number of animals with normal milk secretion after subsequent parturition, compared to untreated control. It may be an effective alternative to Teat Sealing, particularly in animals with relatively low SCCs. Preliminary Randomized controlled trial in which newborn piglets were divided into 4 groups (n= 11 or 12): 1) control, subjected to antibiotic treatment against diarrhea; 2) homeopathic Phosphorus 30CH according to the symptoms collected; 3) homeopathically prepared Escherichia coli 30CH prepared from the locally obtained bacteria; 4) a combination of Phosphorus 30CH and Escherichia coli 30CH.Coelho C de P, Soto FRM et al. (2009). Evaluation of preventive homeopathic treatment against colibacillosis in swine production. International Journal of High Dilution Research, 8: 183-190.Group 2, 3 and 4 presented a significant reduction of diarrhea compared to the control group (p=0.02); the group treated with Phosphorus 30CH + Escherichia coli 30CH presented the highest weight gain which was significant by comparison to all other groups (p=0.001).Preliminary Randomised, observer blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. On a commercial pig farm 52 sows of different parities, in their last month of gestation, were treated twice a week with either the homeopathically prepared Escherichia Coli 30K or placebo. The 525 piglets born from these sows were scored for occurrence and duration of diarrhoea.Camerlink I, Ellinger L et al (2010). Homeopathy as replacement to antibiotics in the case of Escherichia coli diarrhoea in neonatal piglets. Homeopathy, 99: 57-62.Piglets of the homeopathic treated group had significantly less E. coli diarrhoea than piglets in the placebo group (p< 0.0001). Especially piglets from first parity sows gave a good response to treatment with Escherichia Coli 30K. The diarrhoea seemed to be less severe in the homeopathically treated litters, there was less transmission and duration appeared shorter.Strong 2526 References1.
