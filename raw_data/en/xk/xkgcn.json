A-4 2012 Annual Technical Report Executive Summary Delmarva Foundation 1 District of Columbia - Department of Health Care Finance 2012 Annual Technical Report Executive Summary Introduction The District of Columbia (the District ) Department of Health C are Finance (DHCF) is the single state agency responsible for managing the District's Medicaid program which provides healthcare coverage to low -income children, adults, elderly, and persons with disabilitie s. As of December 2012, nearly 150,000 Medicaid enrollees were receiving heal thcare services through one of two managed care organizations (MCOs) or one pre-paid inpatient health plan (PIHP)1 that contract s with DHCF to manage the healthc are of Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition to Medicaid, DHCF administers the District's Heath Care Alliance program2, with approximately 12,500 Alliance members . Unlike Medicaid, this program is paid for entirely with local government dollars. Lastly, j ust over 1,900 additional enrollees were served by a new MCO that began participation in the District's managed care program in November 2012. The services provided by this MCO are not included in this report. As the single agency responsible for managing the District's Medicaid program, DHCF is charged with ensuring that Medicaid beneficiaries receive care that is of high quality, accessible, and timely. To ensure this, DHCF mandates that MCOs: Achieve 100% compliance with federal and contractual operational requirements; Conduct ongoing quality improvement initiatives and submit performance results; Calculate and submit valid and reliable Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Systems (HEDIS \u00ae) 3 and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and System s (CAHPS \u00ae)4 data; and Attain National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) accreditation. DHCF 's Strategic Plan for fiscal years (FY) 2012 -2014 describes its goals in support of its mission \"to improve health outcomes for residents of the District of C olumbia by providing access to a comprehensive and cost- effective array of quality health care services .\" In addition, DHCF 's Performance Plan established in 1 The PIHP serves SSI eligible Medicaid members age 0 -26 years. 2 The DC Healthcare Alliance is a public program that provides free healthcare to individuals and families who live in the District, have no health insurance, and earn less than 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL). 3 HEDIS\u00ae is a registered trademark of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). 4 CAHPS\u00ae is a registered trademark of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). 2012 Annual Technical Report Executive Summary Delmarva Foundation 2 FY 2011 sets forth specific initiatives aimed at attaining the District's quality goal to improve health outcomes for residents and to support the MCOs' efforts to improve the quality of care and services provided to Medicaid enrollees. Four key initiatives pertinent to managed care are set forth in the Performance Plan and remain relevant for Calendar Y ear (CY) 2012 : 1) Improve birth and perinatal outcomes in the Medicaid program; 2) Launch a resource website for case managers and perinatal providers; 3) Reduce adverse outcomes for people with chronic illnesses; and 4) Produce a Consumer Report Card to faci litate beneficiary choice in managed care. In May 2012, DHCF issued a request for proposals for re -procurement of managed care services for the District's Medicaid and Alliance members. As a result of the procurement activities, it is important to note that the two M COs providing services in CY 2012, which are the subject of this evaluation, exited the District's managed care program on June 30, 2013. Beginning July 1, 2013, the District implemented contracts with 3 new MCOs to provide healthcare services to District residents. In addition to the new MCOs, the PIHP, designated as MCO B in this report, will continue servin g the District's SSI residents. Purpose Federal regulations require that states contracting with managed care plans ensure that organizations , independent of both the District and the managed care plans perform an annual external review of the quality, timeliness, and access to health care services furnished by each managed care plan. In fulfillment of this requirement, DHCF contra cts with the Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care, Inc. (Delmarva) to serve as the external quality review organization ( EQRO ). This report describes the review activities conducted by Delmarva during CY 2012 -2013, the methods used to aggregate and analyze information from the review activities, and draws conclusions as to the quality, timeliness, and access to healthcare services furnished by Medicaid managed care plan s in the District of Columbia during CY 2012 . Methodology Federal regulations require that three mandatory activities be performed by the EQRO using methods consistent with p rotocols developed by the Center s for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) for conducting the activities.5 These protocols specify t hat the EQRO must conduct the following activities to assess managed care performance: 1) A review conducted within the previous 3 -year period to determine the MCO s' compliance wi th standards established by DHCF to comply with the requirements of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.204( g), as well as 5 The Executive Summary Delmarva Foundation 3 applicable eleme nts of the MCO s' contract s with DHCF . The MCO s are responsible for addressing any recommendations or opportunities for improvement made by the EQRO . 2) Validation of DHCF required performance measures; and 3) Validation of DHCF required performance improvement projects (PIPs) that were underway during the prior 12 months. As the EQRO, Delmarva conducted each of the required activities in a manner consistent with t he protocols . Comprehensive MCO operational systems compliance reviews were conducted in the prior year. Therefore, the EQRO review activities for the current reporting period are focused on evaluating the actions undertaken by the MCOs to address identified areas of non- compliance and r ecommendations for imp rovement. In addition to the mandatory review activities, Delmarva conducted an analysis of MCOs' reported HEDIS and CAHPS results, as well as an assessment of DHCF's progress in meeting goals set forth in its FY 2011 Performance Plan. In aggregating and analyzing the data, Delmarva allocated standards and/or measures from each activity to domains indicative of quality, access, or timeliness to care and services. A detailed description of the methods used to conduct the activities can be found in Section I of this report. Separate report sections address each specific domain and describe the methodology and data sources used to draw conclusion s for the particular area of focus. The final report section summarizes findings and recommendations to DHCF and the health plans to further improve the quality of, access to, and timeliness of health services for Medicaid members. Findings Quality Operational Systems The previous comprehensive operational systems review noted that the participating MCOs had quality systems and procedures in place to promote high quality care with well -organized approaches to quality improvement. The MCOs operate d strong Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) programs that include d annual planning, participatio n from providers and MCO leadership, and provide d for on-going assessment of quality improvement activities. Measurement, follow -up, and reporting were evident across the organizations based on discussions with staff, reports reviewed, a nd presentations of activities. There were no recommendations o r opportunities for improvement identif ied in the CY 2011 report in regards to operational systems associated with quality, and requiring follow -up in CY 2012 -2013. 2012 Annual Technical Report Executive Summary Delmarva Foundation 4 Performance Improvement Projects and Performance Measures Validation Recognizing the impact of chronic illnesses and poor birth outcomes on both cost and quality of life for District residents, DHCF and the MCOs work collaboratively on efforts to reduce adverse health outcomes for Medi caid members enrolled in MCOs. Collaborative goals are aimed at reducing adverse perinatal outcomes such as prematurity , low birth weight, and infant deaths . The chronic care collaborative goals are focused on reducing emergency department and inpatient ut ilization for enrollees with diabetes, asthma, congestive heart failure, and hyper tension. Delmarva validate s the accuracy and reliability of the MCOs' performance measures rep orted in conjunction with the c ollaborative performance improvement projects (P IPs), Improving Perinatal and Birth Outcomes and Adverse Outcomes of Chronic Diseases. Delmarva validated the MCOs' processes for conducting PIPs and their reported rates for the collaborative PIPs that were underway during CY 201 2. Although MCO A submitted its PIP report for evaluation, it did not participate in validation of its processes for programming and calculating the PIP indicator rates as it was preparing to exit the District's Medicaid managed care program at the time audit activities were underway. Goals for reduction in adverse health outcomes were set at the outset of the initiatives and are measured annually. The goal for reducing adverse perinatal outcomes for M Y 201 2 is set at <2 10 adverse events per 1,000 members. It is important to note that a single pregnancy could potentially result in multiple adverse events. Adverse perinatal outcomes are defined as: Miscarriage or fetal loss; Neonates <2500 grams; Neonates with a gestational age <32 weeks; Pregnancies f or which the outcome is unknown; Lack of maternal HIV testing; and Death of an infant age 0 -365 days. Although MCO A submitted unvalidated data for the perinatal measures, the reported rate appears consistent with previously reported data. Therefore, a Di strict weighted average was calculated for the perinatal measure. The District rate for adverse birth outcomes for MY 2012 is 180 adverse events per 1,000 members, meeting the collaborative goal. The goal for adverse events related to chronic diseases is set at < 450 per 1,000 members for MY 2012 . An adverse event is defined as an emergency department visit or an acute inpatient hospitalization. An individual could potentially have multiple adverse events contributing to the rate. Data submitted by MCO A d oes not appear to be valid and reliable when compared to previously reported rates. Therefore, a District rate was not calculated. However, based on validated data submitted by MCO B and MCO C, it does not appear that the chronic diseases collaborative would have achieve d its goal to reduce emergency department and inpatient 2012 Annual Technical Report Executive Summary Delmarva Foundation 5 hospital utilization for MY 2012. Individually none of the MCOs met the goal of <450 adverse events per 1,000 members for chronic diseases. HEDIS and CAHPS A subset of HEDIS effecti veness of care measures was also used to assess MCO performance in the area of quality. These measures include comprehensive care for diabetics, controlling high blood pressure, and appropriate use of medications for people with asthma. Analysis of the HED IS measures found that although the MCOs' rates for these measures improved over M Y 2011, the MCOs continue to perform below the national Medicaid averages on almost all mea sures for members with diabetes and hypertension. A subset of CAHPS measures were chosen by Delmarva as representative of consumers' perceptions of quality. These measures include: Customer service, How well doctors communicate, Coordination of care, Rating of health plan, Rating of all health care, Rating of personal doctor, and Rating of specialist. Only two of the three participating MCOs conducted adult and child CAHPS surveys for M Y 2012. MCO A did not conduct the survey as it was preparing to exit the Medicaid market at the time the surveys would have been perform ed. Since MCO A p rovided services to approximately two -thirds of the District's managed care enrollees for M Y 2012, a District average was not calculated for MY 2012 as it would not accurately reflect the District's Med icaid managed care population. MCO B conducted the adu lt CAHPS survey for the first time in CY 2012. Prior to this, MCO B did not have a large enough adult population to conduct the surveys. MCO B achieved >80% sati sfaction ratings by its members and exceede d the national Medicaid average in 6 of the 7 measur es of adult satisfaction. For the child survey, MCO B exceeded the national Medicaid average in 5 of the 7 measures and exceeded an 80% satisfaction level in 6 of the measures. MCO B scored highest in how well doctors communicate and customer service for both the adult and child surveys. MCO C exceeded the national Medicaid average in 3 of the 7 measures and exceeded 80% satisfaction for 3 of the measures. For the child survey, MCO C exceeded the national Medicaid average in 3 of the 7 measures and exceede d the 80% satisfaction level for 5 of the 7 measures. For both surveys, MCO C performed best in how well doctors communicate. 2012 Annual Technical Report Executive Summary Delmarva Foundation 6 Strategic Plan In regards to DHCF's goals, DHCF met its performance plan goals for improving perinatal and birth outcomes but did not achieve its goal for reducing adverse events of chronic diseases. Production of the consumer report card was deferred to FY 2015 when new health plans will have reliable data available for reporting. Access Operational Systems An evaluation of the M COs' operational systems relative to access conducted in the prior year found that all MCOs conduct on -going analys is of the adequacy of provider networks, both for primary and specialty care. Member utilization of services and geo -access reports are used to identify providers with open networks to ensure that adequate numbers of providers are available to meet the needs of the population. Members receive information regarding providers, hours of operations, and the availability of transportation and transl ation services. The MCOs have policies and procedures in place that promote access to women's health services and services for members with special needs through direct access to specialists. Care coordination and disease management programs are aimed at identifying members with special needs, or those who are non -compliant with care, to provide additional assistance in accessing needed servic es and improving health status. There were no recommendations o r opportunities for improvement identified related to the MCOs' operational systems requiring action or follow -up during CY 2012 -2013. HEDIS and CAHPS HEDIS measures of adult and child access to preventive/ambulatory health services were used to evaluate outcomes for members relative to access . For adults, in all age ranges, access to preventive/ambulatory health services fell below the national HEDIS Medicaid average . Both breast cancer and cervical cancer screening rates exceeded the national Medicaid average. MCOs should assess barriers to care that may be limiting access to preventive services for members. Dependent upon the barrier analysis, expansion of primary care office hours and increased member education and outreach efforts may be effective i nterventions. The District performed well in measures of access for children and adolescents, particularly in lead screening, adolescent well visits, and dental visits. Annual dental visits improved by nearly 3 perc entage points and exceeded the n ational Medicaid average. Adolescent well care visits exceeded the n ational Medicaid average, as did lead screening for children and immunizat ions for adolescents (Combo 1). 2012 Annual Technical Report Executive Summary Delmarva Foundation 7 The CAHPS adult satisfaction with \"getting needed care\" fell below the national Medicaid a verage for both MCO B and C. Parent /guardian satisfaction with \"getting needed care\" for child enrollees also fell below the national Medicaid average for MCO B and C but exceeded 80% for both MCOs . MCO A did not conduct adult or child CAHPS for MY 2012. Timeliness Operational Systems MCOs must have procedures in place to make timely decisions in order to not disrupt or delay the provision of care or services to their members. An evaluation of the MCOs' operational systems in the previous year relative to timeliness found that all MCOs monitor authorization decisions for timeliness. Turn -around time is measured and documented with results summarized and reported to the utilization and quality management committee s. The health plans were able to demonstrate that there are p olicies and procedures in place to address timeliness standards for availability of appointments. All MCOs that failed to achieve 100% compliance on operational standards for CY 2011 were required to submit an action plan indicating the steps they will take to resolve the non -compliant issues. The action plans are reviewed and approved by Delmarva. Once an acceptable action plan has been approved, Delmarva requires the MCOs to submit periodic updates regarding implementation of the action plans. Any revisions to policies and procedures are reviewed as well as MCO generated reports to show evidence of compliance with the requirements. All three MCOs submitted action plans per requirements and all identified issues were resolved or the MCO h ad exited the District Medicaid market. HEDIS and CAHPS HEDIS measures for timeliness of prenatal care and the frequency with which pregnant women accessed on - going prenatal care (the number of expected prenatal visits) were used to evaluate member outcom es relative to timeliness of services. Improvement in these measures could potentially result in decreased rates of prematurity and low birth weight infants . The District's weighted average fell short of the national Medicaid averages for both measures. However, those women receiving > 81% of the recommended number of prenatal visits improved by over 4 percentage points over MY 2011. CAHPS results for adult satisfaction with getting care quickly fell below the National Medicaid average for both MCO B and MCO C. Parent/guardian satisfaction with \"getting care quickly\" for children exceeded 80% for MCO C but fell below the National Medicaid average. MCO B exceeded the National Medicaid average and h ad a greater than 90% satisfaction rating for this measure. As previously stated, MCO A did not conduct the adult or child CAHPS. 2012 Annual Technical Report Executive Summary Delmarva Foundation 8 Status of Recommendations from Prior Year MCOs As a result of the CY 2011 review activities several recommendations for improvement were made to the MCOs . The MCOs were expected to act on the recommendations during CY 2012. The status of each recommendation is addressed below: MCOs must ensure that written policies and procedures encompass all required federal and contractual language. During the CY 2011 review, MCO A was found to be non -compliant with requirements for timely notification to members when availability of after -hours services changed and for timely notifications of denials in accordance w ith the District's requirements. An action plan was developed and implemented by MCO A and this issue was resolved . MCO B did not meet requirements for notifying members of changes to the provider network in a timely manner and did not meet requirements f or timely notification of denials in accordance with the District's requirements. An action plan was developed and implemented. Monitoring of reports indicate that these issues have been resolved. MCO C did not meet requirements for its providers for time ly access to care and services, taking into account the urgency of need for services. An evaluation of the MCO's provider surveys found that appointments for asymptomatic health assessments including adult physicals and EPSDT services were compliant only 7 0% of the time fo r appointments within 3 weeks. Appointments for routine symptomatic care were available within 10 business days 80% of the time. MCO C also did not meet timeliness requirements for resolving grievances. An action plan was developed and implemented. MCOs must ensure that PIP activities include a robust analysis of performance for each indicator and tie results to specific interventions. This should include a drill down of data to develop system- wide interventions that may help to sustain improvement. MCOs submitted CY 2012 PIP reports to Delmarva in July 2013 for review and evaluation. By this point in time, two of the MCOs (MCO A and MCO C) participating in CY 2012 activities had been notified that they did not successfully secure new D HCF contracts to provide services to the District's Medicaid enrollees. Therefore, more robust analysis of PIP data was not undertaken by these two MCOs. MCO B continued to conduct robust data analysis of PIPs results and to develop multi- faceted approache s to quality improvement based on data findings. MCOs should evaluate HEDIS outcomes measures in relationship to PIP results. Two of the MCOs (MCO A and MCO C) participating in CY 2012 activities were notified that they did not successfully secure new DH CF contracts to provide services to the District's Medicaid enrollees. Therefore, 2012 Annual Technical Report Executive Summary Delmarva Foundation 9 evaluation of HEDIS outcomes measures in relationship to PIP results were not undertaken by these two MCOs. However, within its PIP report, MCO B did include HEDIS data relative to the PIP indicators. MCOs should set goals and develop interventions to achieve, at a minimum, the Medicaid average for HEDIS comprehensive diabetes care and controlling high blood pressure measures. All three (3) MCOs improved in nearly all HEDIS m easures comprehensive diabetes care. MCO B and MCO C also improved in the controlling high blood pressure measure. MCO A did not submit HEDIS data for controlling high blood pressure. MCOs should conduct a root cause analysis tied to CAHPS results to identify reasons for member dissatisfaction, particularly in the areas of customer service and care coordination. MCO A did not conduct a CAHPS survey for CY 2012. MCO B improved in both both care coordination and customer service in its child population. CY 2012 was the first year that MCO B had a large enough population to field the adult survey. MCO C improved in care coordination and customer service in both t he child and adult populations . DHCF As a result of EQRO activities conducted for CY 201 1, Delmarva made the following recommendations to DHCF for program improvement: Consider designing and implementing a robust value -based purchasing plan consisting of incentives/disincentives base d on MCOs' performance across a designat ed set of performance measures. DHCF is actively working with its actuary to develop a value -based purchasing program. DHCF began contracting with three (3) new MCOs on July 1, 2013. Therefore, it is not expected tha t data will be available until FY 2015 to implement a value -based purchasing program. Choose a subset of HEDIS, CAHPS, and operational measures that align with DHCF 's Strategic Plan and set specific goals against which MCO performa nce will be assessed annu ally. These should include goals such as adult access to preventive services, child access to preventive services, quality outcomes related to chronic illnesses, care coordination, and member satisfaction. Use performance against the designated measures a s the basis for a consumer report card. DHCF plans to implement the consumer report card in FY 20 15 when data becomes available. Re-evaluate the current collaborative PIP structure to expand the stakeholders group and add measures more closely tied to heal th outcomes. The collaborative PIP efforts include monthly meetings with stakeholders who have a direct interest in improving health outcomes in the District, among these are MCOs, physicians, clinics, hospitals, and special interest organizations like the Ameri can Diabetes Association. The purpose of these stakeholder meetings is to identify resources and potential interventions that promote improved health outcomes. Over the course of the collaborative activities , stakehold er participation has declined. I n order to effect system -wide improvement it is important to 2012 Annual Technical Report Executive Summary Delmarva Foundation 10 receive input and recommendations from a wide variety of service providers. DHCF began working with the newly contracted MCOs in September 2013 to restruc ture the collaboratives and rev ise the me asure indicators. Several local asthma coalitions have begun actively participating in the collaborative work groups. Consider gauging MCO performance separate ly for the collaborative PIPs. Aggregation of results may be skewed by including rates from one MCO that only serves a special needs population. This recommendation remains under consideration by DHCF and the collaborative work group. As noted above, DHCF is actively working to address the recommendations from CY 2012 . However, implementation of program changes that may result from these recommendations are not expected to occur until FY 2015. DHCF issued a request for proposals in CY 2012 to procure new MCO contracts. New MCOs began program participation in July 2013. It is not expected that MCOs will have adequate data available to implement incentive based performance or a consumer report card until FY 2015 . DHCF is currently reviewing its Strategic Plan for possible revisions to include performance goa ls for HEDIS and CAHPS measures, a value -based purchasing plan, and use of a consumer report card. In regards t o the collaborative PIPs, DHCF continues to require MCOs to participate in two collaborative PIPs. Both collaborative work gr oups are focused on reviewing and potentially revising the PIP focus and indicators . Additional stakehold ers have been identified and have begun actively participating in collaborative efforts to re -structure the PIPs. DHCF , in conjunction with the work groups, will determine whether separate MCO rates for the indicators will be reported versus an overall District rate dependent upon the final indicators chosen. It is expected that CY 2014 data, which will be reported in Jun e 2015, will be used to construct baseline rates for both collaboratives. Opportunities for Improvement Recommendations for MCOs Although each health plan is committed to delivering high quality care and services to its managed care members, opportunitie s exist for continued performance improvement. As MCO A and MCO C will no longer be participating in CY 2013, recommendations are made only for MCO B. The status of these recommendations will be included in the CY 2013 Annual Technical Report. Based upon the evaluation of 2012 activities, Delmarva developed the following recommendations for MCO B : Renew efforts to obtain stakeholder involvement in the collaborative PIPs. Identify and leverage current quality improvement efforts underway in the District that support the collaborative aims . Tie proposed interventions to data points to enable analysis of the effectiveness of the interventions. 2012 Annual Technical Report Executive Summary Delmarva Foundation 11 Recommendations for DHCF As new health plans begin providing healthcare services to District residents, it will be important for DHCF to: Set performance improvement goal s for each MCO for key PIP indicators . This will improve MCO accountability and engag ement in collaborative efforts. Require that each collaborative identify at least one intervention that will be conducted jointly by the MCOs. Consider expanding the perinatal collaborative indicators to include a new measure of deliveries prior to 39 weeks gestation. Set minimum performance goals for health plans on select HEDIS and CAHPS measures. These should include an array of measures pertinent to the District's enrolled managed care population. In particular, we would recommend that measure goals be set for diabetes and prenatal care. The status of these recommendations will be discussed in the CY 2013 Annual Technical Report. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section I - Overview Delmarva Foundation 12 Section I - Overview Introduction The District of Columbia (the District ) Department of Healthcare Finance (DHCF) is the single state agency responsible for managing the District's Medicaid program which provides healthcare coverage to low -income children, adults, elderly, and persons with disabilities. As of December 2012, ne arly 150,000 Medicaid enrollees were receiving heal thcare services through one of two managed care organizations (MCOs) or one pre-paid inpatient health plan (PIHP) that contract s with DHCF to manage the healthcare of Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition to Medicaid, DHCF administers the District's Heath Care Alliance program6, with approximately 12,500 Alliance members not eligible for Medicaid receiving services through these same MCOs as of December 2012. Unlike Medicaid, this program is paid for entirely with local government dollars. In May 2012, DHCF issued a request for proposals for re -procurement of managed care services for the District's Medicaid and Alliance members. As a result of the procurement activities, it is important to note that the two MCOs providing services in CY 2012, which are the subject of this evaluation, exited the District's managed care program on June 30, 2013. Beginning July 1, 2013, the District implemented contracts with 3 new MCOs to provide healthcare services to District residents. In addition to the new MCOs, the PIHP, designated as MCO B in this report, will continue serving the District's SSI residents. DHCF requires that MCOs providing services to managed care beneficiaries are National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) accredited. NCQA health plan accreditation includes two major components \u2014 an evaluation of the plan's structure and processes to maintain and improve quality and an evaluation of the plan's performance on process and outcomes measures related to clinical care and member satisfaction. NCQA accreditation has been widely recognized by both federal and state regulators as the gold standard for health plan operations, and information from the NCQA accreditation activities is often used to augment state strategies for assessing health plan performance. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) (42 CFR \u00a7 438.202(a)) require s that each state contracting with a n MCO or PIHP must have a written strategy for assessing and improving the q uality of managed care services. DHCF 's Strategic Plan for fiscal years (FY) 2012 -2014 describes its goals in support of its mission \"to improve health outcomes for residents of the District of Columbia by providing access to a comprehensive and cost- effective array of quality health care services\" 7. 6 The DC Healthcare Al liance is a public program that provides free healthcare to individuals and families who live in the District, have no health insurance, and earn less than 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL). 7 Department of Health Care Finance FY2012 -2014 Strategic Plan Available at: http://dhcf.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dhcf/publication/attachments/DHCFStrategicPlanFY12 -14.pdf 2012 Annual Technical Report Section I - Overview Delmarva Foundation 13 In FY 2011, DHCF also established a Performance P lan that sets forth specific initiatives aimed at achieving its overarching goal to improve health outcomes for District residents and to support the MCOs' efforts to improve the quality of care and services provided to Medicaid enrollees.8 Delmarva also assessed DHCF's progress in meeting its strategic goals for f our key initiatives pertinent to managed . These performance indicators include: 1) Improve birth and perinatal ou tcom es in the Medicaid program; 2) Launch a resource website for case ma nagers and perinatal providers; 3) Reduce adverse outcomes for people with chronic illnesses; and 4) Produce a Consumer Report Card to facilitate beneficiary choice in managed care. Detailed findings on DHCF's progress in meeting its quality goals can be found in Section II - Quality of this report. Federal regulations (42 CFR Part 438 Subpart E) require that states contracting with managed care plans ensure that organizations , independent of both the District and the managed care plans , perform an annual external review of the quality, timeliness, and access to health care services furnis hed by each managed care plan. Protocols 9 describing mandatory and optional activities were issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2002 and were updated in 2012. These protocols specify t hree mandatory activities that must be conducted to as sess managed care performance. Th e mandatory activities include : 1) A review condu cted within the previous 3 -year period to determine the MCO s' compliance with standards established by the State to comply with the requirements of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.204(g), as well as applicable eleme nts of the MCO s' contract s. The MCO s are responsible for addressing any recommendations by the EQRO based on the findings and recommendations in the following year. 2) Validation of State req uired performance measures; and 3) Validation of State required performance improvement projects (PIPs) that were un derway during the prior 12 months . In fulfillment of this requirement, DHCF contracts with the Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care, Inc. (Delmarva) to serve as the external quality review organization ( EQRO ). 8 FY 2011 Performance Plan, Department of Healthcare Finance. Available at: http://oca.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/oca/publication/attachments/DHCF11.pdf 9 The updated EQR Protocols -Listing -Items/CMS Report Section I - Overview Delmarva Foundation 14 Purpose Federal regulations require that the EQRO aggregate information obtained through the mandatory review activities and produce an annual technical report to the District describing the MCOs' performance and the District 's progress in meeting its quality goal s. This report describes the activities conducted by Delmarva , the methods used to aggregate and analyze information from the review activities, and draws conclusions as to the quality, timeliness, and access to healthcare services furnished by Medicaid ma naged care plan s in the District of Columbia during CY 2012 . In addition, the report includes findings related to the District's performance in meeti ng its strategic goals. Methodology As previously noted, federal regulations require that three mandatory activities be conducted by the EQRO using methods consistent with the EQRO Protocols developed by CMS. As the EQRO, Delmarva conducted each of the required activities in a manner consistent with the protocols. The processes for completing these activities are described below. Structur e and Operational Systems The purpose of the structure and operational systems review is to assess MCO performance against the federal regulatory requiremen ts and DHCF contractual requirements . Key areas of focus include: Enrollee Rights and Protections (ER) - 42 CFR \u00a7 438 Subpart C, Enrollee Rights and Protections, details requirements to ensure that managed care enrollees have the right to receive information about available health care services, how to access services, policies and procedures relative to obtaining services, and the right to make health care decisions. Grievance Systems (GS) - 42 CFR \u00a7 438 Subpart F, Grievance Systems, mandates that each MCO has in effect a grievance system that meets specific requirements to ensure notification of enrollees in a timely manner for all types of grievances and appeals. Access to a grievance system affords enrollees with the right to express dissatisfaction with care or services provided by the MCO or its providers and the ability for MCOs to potentially identify issues that need to be addressed (e.g. requesting payment from enrollees, inappr opriate denial of payment or services). Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QA) - 42 CFR \u00a7 438 Subpart D, Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement, sets forth MCO specifications for quality strategies to ensure the delivery of high quality health care and customer service. MCOs must measure performance (e.g. immunization rates, preventive screening rate) and use their data to improve the quality of services provided to enrollees through quality of care studies and other activities. Standa rds for quality, access, 2012 Annual Technical Report Section I - Overview Delmarva Foundation 15 and timeliness of care are defined and MCOs must monitor these to ensure enrollees receive the benefits and services to which they are entitled. The annual structure and operational systems review is conducted in acco rdance with t he EQRO P rotocol , Assessment of Compliance with Medicaid Managed Care Regulations, using a systematic approach consisting of pre - site, on -site, and post- site activities . A comprehensive operational systems review of each MCO was conducted in CY 2012 with findings reported in the CY 2011 Annual Technical Report. During the first two quarters of CY 2013 Delmarva assisted the MCOs in preparing action plans in response to identified opportunities for improvement. Delmarva also conducted monitoring activities a nd reviewed supporting documentation to ensure that areas noted for improvement were actively addr essed and resolved by the MCOs. Validation of Performance Measures The validation of performance measures activity is conducted in acco rdance with the EQRO P rotocol , Validation of Measures Reported by MCOs , using a systematic approach consisting of pre -site, on -site, and post- site activities . There are two primary objectives associated with the validation process: 1) To evaluate the accuracy of the performance me asures reported by the MCO and 2) To determine the extent to which the MCO followed the specifications required by the District for calculating the performance measures. Key validation activities include : Review of data systems and processes used by the MCO to construct the measure rates; Assessment of the calculated rates for algorithmic compl iance to defined specifications; and Verification that the reported rates are based on accurate sources of information. Pre-Site The validation process begins with a conference call between the audit team, MCOs and DHCF to confirm the measures and specifications to be used in the audit. Next, each MCO completes and submits its Information Systems Capabilities Assessment (ISCA), which describes the MCO's data systems for collecting valid, accurate data, and then calculating and reporting quality improvement data. The auditors evaluate the information in the ISCA for consistency with findings reported in previous as sessments of the MCO's systems, and a site visit date is set. A tentative agenda is developed and a summary of ISCA issues is compiled. On-Site The validation team conducts an onsite visit to the MCO to investigate any potential issues identified through review of the ISCA document and to observe the systems and procedures used by the MCO to col lect and 2012 Annual Technical Report Section I - Overview Delmarva Foundation 16 produce measure data. The members of the validation team hold an entrance meeting with the MCO staff to describe the validation purpose, scope, necessary documentation, and to ide ntify staff to be interviewed. These staff interviews provide insight into the accuracy and reliability of the reporting processes by allowing the health plan to clarify and provide more detail on any issues identified through the auditor's review of the ISCA. During the onsite visit, the auditors review the information systems structure, protocols and procedures, and measure specific data collection me thods. A preliminary review of the source code the MCO intends to use to produce t he measures is also conducted. At the conclusion of th ese activities, the auditor meets with the MCO staff to review preliminary findings, request additional documentation if necessary, and provide guidance on areas requiring action. Post-Site Following the onsite visit, any action items are forwarded to the MCO in the form of a preliminary validation report. The MCO must demonstrate that it has the automated systems, information management practices, and data control procedures needed to ensure that all information required for performance measures reporting is adequately captured, translated, stored, analyzed, and reported. All outstanding issues must be resolved prior to the MCO calculating its final performance measures rates. A review and approval of the final source code is performed prior to the MCO cal culating its final rates. A final validation report is produced detailing MCO performance against information systems standar ds and measure specifications. Standards are assigned designations : Fully Compliant, Substantially Compliant, Not Valid, or Not Ap plicable to the MCO's measures. A final measure designation is assigned \u2014Reportable or Not Reportable. DHCF contracts with Delmarva to validate the accuracy and reliability of the MCOs' performance measures reported in conjunction with its mandated performance improvement projects ( PIPs), Improving Perinatal and Birth Outcomes and Adverse Outcomes of Chronic Diseases. Delmarva validated two of the three MCOs' measures rates for the collaborative PIP s that were underway during CY 2012. MCO A did not particip ate in validation activities. The MCO was undergoing acquisition by a new MCO and preparing to exit the District's Medicaid managed care program at the time audit activities were underway. Hence, Delmarva cannot attest to the accuracy and reliability of MC O A's reported collaborative pe rformance measures rates . Validation of Performance Improvement Projects Delmarva's PIP review methodology is based upon the CMS protocol, Validating Performance Improvement Projects. The validation is aimed at evaluating whether or not the PIP s are designed, conducted, and reported in a sound manner and the degree of confidence DHCF can have in the reported results. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section I - Overview Delmarva Foundation 17 Each MCO is required to provide the study framework and project description for each PIP at the onset of the projects. This information is reviewed to ensure that each MCO is using relevant and valid study techniques. The MCOs are required to provide updates on the progress of t heir PIPs in July of each year. The submissions include results of measurement activ ities, a status report of intervention implementations, analysis of the measurement results using the MCO's data analysis plan as described in its PIPs, as well as information concerning any modifications to (or removal of) intervention strategies that may not be yi elding anticipated improvement. If an MCO decides to modify other portions of the project, updates to the submissions are permitted in consultation with Delmarva. Delmarva's PIP reviewers evaluate each project submitted using a standard validation tool that employs the CMS validation methodology. This includes assessing each project in ten critical areas noted in Table I -1. Table I -1. 10 -Step PIP Review Process Step Description 1 Assess the Study Topic - The study topic/project rationale must include demographic characteristics, prevalence of disease, and potential consequences (risks) of disease. MCO specific data must support the study topic and demonstrate the need for the PIP. 2 Review the Study Question(s) - The study question should reference the study population, activity, and expected outcome. The study question guides the PIP an d must be clear and answerable. 3 Review the Selected Study Indicator(s) - The study indicator(s) must be meaningful, clearly defined, and measurable. 4 Review the Identified Study Population - The study population must reflect all individuals to whom the study questions and indicators are relevant. 5 Review Sampling Methods - The sampling method must be valid and protect against bias. 6 Review Data Collection Procedures - The data collection procedures must use a systematic method of collecting valid and reliable data. 7 Assess Improvement Strategies - The improvement strategies , or interventions, must be reasonable and address barriers on a system -level. 8 Review Data Analysis & Interpretation of Study Results - The study findings , or results, must be accurately and clearly stated. 9 Assess Whether Improvement is Real Improvement - Project results must demonstrate real improvement . 2012 Annual Technical Report Section I - Overview Delmarva Foundation 18 Step Description 10 Assess Sustained Improvement - Sustained improvement must be demonstrated through repeated measurements. As Delmarva conducts PIP reviews, each component within a step is rated as Yes , No, or Not Applicable . Components are then collectively reviewed to arrive at a determination of: Met - All required components are present . Partially Met - At least one, but not all components are present. Unmet - None of the required components are present. Not Applicable - None of the components are applicable . Delmarva validated the MCOs' collaborative PIPs, Improving Perinatal and Birth Outcomes and Adverse Outcomes of Chronic Diseases, which were underway during CY 201 2. A description of the collaborative PIPs and the measures specifications can be found in Appendix 1 and 2 . HEDIS/CAHPS Measures Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Systems (HEDIS \u00ae)10 and Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems ( CAHPS \u00ae)11 measures have become an invaluable evaluation tool used by over 9 0% of health plans nationally. Because the District requires MCOs to report HEDIS and CAHPS measures and many health plans a cross the nation collect this data, it is possible to compare health plan performance among DHCF contracted health plans as well as to national Medicaid benchmarks. HEDIS measures are designed to provide information to reliably compare the performance of health care plans across a wide array of clinical health care measures. These measures focus heavily on areas such as prenatal and postpartum care, child health preventive care such as well child visits and immunizations, management of chronic diseases, and access to care. CAHPS measures specifically address consumers' satisfaction and experience with Medicaid providers and systems of care. These measures can provide DHCF with data to comprehensively assess MCO performance in the areas of quality, access, a nd timeliness of healthcare services. The District's contracted MCOs are required to submit validated results of their HEDIS and CAHPS measures to DHCF and Delmarva . To avoid duplicative efforts, Delmarva does not re -validate these 10 HEDIS\u00ae is a registered trademark of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). 11 CAHPS\u00ae is a registered trademark of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). 2012 Annual Technical Report Section I - Overview Delmarva Foundation 19 measures, but does review the audit findings and use s MCOs' reported rates for the HEDIS and CAHPS measures in it s analysis of MCO performance. Of note, MCO A submitted unvalidated data for HEDIS and did not conduct a CAHPS survey for CY 2012 as it was in the process of being ac quired by a new MCO . Therefore, the accuracy and reliability of the reported rates for MCO A cannot be assured. The full set of reported HEDIS and CAHPS rates can be found in Appendix 3 and 4 . Aggregation and Analysis of Results Findings from the mandatory activities outlined in the EQRO contract as well as the MCOs' HEDIS and CAHPS measures are aggregated and analyzed by Delmarva to provide an evaluation of the MCOs' performance . Standards and/or measures from each activity are allocated to domains indicative of quality , access , or timeliness of care and services. Separate report sections address each specific domain and describe the methodology and data sou rces used to draw conclusions. The final report section summarizes findings and recommendations to DHCF and the health plans to further improve the quality of, access to, and timeliness of health services for Medicaid members.2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 20 Section II - Quality Introduction Quality , as it pertains to external quality review, is defined as \"the degree to which a Managed Care Organization (MCO) or Prepaid Inpatient Health Plan (PIHP) increases the like lihood of desired health outcomes for its enrollees (as defined in 42 CFR 438.320[2]) through its structural and operational characteristics and through the provision of health services that are consistent with current professional knowledge.\" (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [CMS], Final Rule: Medicaid Managed Care; 42 CFR Part 400, et. al. Subpart D - Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement, [June 2002]) . Purpose and Methodology This assessment of quality encompasses health outcomes as well as the process es of care delivery (e.g., operational systems) and the experience of receiving care to assess how well the MCOs are performing in improving health outcomes for members. In evaluating quality, Delmarva assessed whether DHCF achieved its Strategic Plan goals pertinent to the managed care program. In addition, Delmarva conducted an analysis of the MCOs' progress in resolving operational issues that were identified as opportunities for improvement from the prior year's structure and operational systems compliance review activities, evaluated the processes MCOs used to calculate performance measures for the PIP indicators, validated the MCOs' processes for conducting the PIPs, and analyzed the results from the MCOs' reported HEDIS and CAHPS ra tes. Findings Strategic Performance Plan 42 CFR Part 438.202 (a) requires that each state contracting with a MCO or PIHP must have a written strategy for assessing and improving the quality of managed care services provided by MCOs and PIHPs. DHCF established a performance plan in FY 2011 which sets forth specific quality initiatives and goals aimed at improv ing health outcomes for District residents. Quality initiatives focus on informing consumers and providers about the quality of services provided to Medicaid enrollees, making information about available resources more readily available to providers, and establishing goals for reducing adverse health outcomes. The findings regarding the status of the District's performance goals can be found in Table II -1. Table II -1. Strategic Plan Initiatives Initiative Description 1) Improve birth and perinatal outcomes in the Medicaid program . CY 2012 marks the fourth and final year in a multiyear initiative to improve the health of babies born to mothers in the Medicaid program. The goal of this health care quality improvement collaboration is to reduce the rate of adverse outcomes per 1,000 pregnancies and infants by reducing the following adverse events: newborns with birth weight less than 2,500 grams; 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 21 Initiative Description newborns of 32 weeks or less gestational age; pregnant women not tested for HIV prior to giving birth; pregnancies ending in miscarriage or fetal loss (early or late); and deat hs of infants in the first year of life. 2) Launch a resource website for case managers and perinatal providers. As part of the collaborative to reduce adverse birth outcomes, DHCF will launch a resource website for health plan case managers and other medical care providers. Resources will include information on services to meet psychosocial risk factors (such as alcohol or other substance misuse, domestic violence, and mental health problems), as well as services to support healthy babies, such as brea st feeding. The site will clearly make the connection between psychosocial needs and health, and link case managers to services that are available to the mother. The services will include those based in the District, services available from national organizations, and services through virtual communities on the web. 3) Reduce adverse outcomes for people with chronic diseases. CY 2012 marks the fourth year of this multiyear initiative to improve the health of people with serious chronic illnesses. The goal of this collaborative is to reduce the rates of emergency room visits and hospital admissions for individuals with asthma, diabetes, high blood pres sure, and congestive heart failure. Performance is calculated and reported annually, as the number of adverse chronic disease outcomes per 1,000 individuals with asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes and congestive heart failure. DHCF expects to see signi ficant reductions in the rates of emergency department and acute hospital admissions among the targeted population as a result of this collaborative. 4) Produce a consumer report card to facilitate beneficiary choice in managed care. In FY 2009, DHCF developed a managed care report card, with reporting requirements for Medicaid managed care plans beginning in FY 2010. Foremost, the report card is intended to be a tool that adult Medicaid and Alliance beneficiaries and parents or guardians of children c an use to help choose a managed care organization (MCO). The report card will work in concert with DHCF's other quality improvement, pay -for-performance, and managed care initiatives. Data on the report card will include information on: patient satisfactio n; access to specialist doctors; how well patient care is managed; customer service; how well each plan met national quality standards; and how often each plan meets quality standards for specific health conditions. An evaluation of DHCF's status in meeting its quality goals found that: Goal 1: Although one MCO submitted unvalidated data, all MCOs met the goal to decrease adverse perinatal and birth outcomes to <210 adverse events per 1,000 members for MY 2012. Goal 2: DHCF 's goal to launch a perinata l resources website was partially met for MY 2012 . Although the website was in development, the actual launch of the website did not occur until Spring 2013. The website can be found at : http://dh cf.dc.gov/page/pregnancy -resources Goal 3: The goal to decrease adverse outcomes of chronic diseases to <450 per 1,000 members was not met for MY 2012 by any of the individual MCOs. In the upcoming year, DHCF and the collaborative work group have opted to focus efforts on decreasing emergency department and acute inpatient hospita l admissions related to asthma. Goal 4: DHCF issued a request for p roposal s (RFP) to solicit new MCOs for FY 2013. Therefore, the goal to produce a consumer report card is deferred to FY 2015 when it is expected that data from the new MCOs will be available to produce a report card. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 22 Structure and Operational Systems Review Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) - 42 CFR \u00a7 438 Subpart D, Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement, sets forth MCO specifications for quality strategies to ensure the delivery of high quality health care and customer service. Several operational standards related to quality were evaluated and reported for the CY 2011 Annual Technical Re port, including review of the Quality Improvement (QI) Program, Annual QI Review, QI Work Plan, QI Committee structure, Performance Improvement Projects (PIPs), other related documentation such as meeting minutes, and evidence of evaluation, analysis and f ollow - up on findings. DHCF mandates that MCOs must achieve full compliance with all standards and must submit action plans to address any areas that are not found fully compliant or for which opportunities for improvement have been identified . Delmarva fo cused activities on providing MCOs with technical assistance in the development of action plans and monitoring MCOs' progress in resolving areas of concern identified in the CY 2011 report . There were no structure or operational systems findings related to the MCOs' quality programs in the prior year, therefore, no action plans were required in this area. Performance Measures Validation Given that the health plans are required to submit audited HEDIS/CAHPS rates , the District chose to direct EQRO activit ies to auditing and validating the MCOs' information systems and processes for collecting data and reporting collaborative PIP measurement results as these are not validated as a component of the MCOs' NCQA audit activities . Delmarva conducted validation a ctivities for MCO B and MCO C. MCO A did not participate in validation activities as it was preparing to exit the Medicaid market. Therefore, Delmarva cannot attest to the accuracy and reliability of rates submitted by MCO A. The goal of conducting the performance measures validation activity is to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the measures produced and reported by the MCOs and to determine the extent to which the MCOs followed specifications established by DHCF for cal culating and reporting the collaborative measures rates . The accuracy and reliability of the reported rates is essential to ascertaining whether the MCOs' quality improvement efforts have resulted in improved health outcomes. Three k ey valida tion activities are conducted : 1) Review of data systems and processes used by the MCO to construct the measure rates; 2) Assessment of the calculated rates for algorithmic compl iance to defined specifications; and 3) Verification that the reported rates are based on ac curate sources of information. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 23 Information from several other sources is also used to satisfy validation requi rements. These sources include , but are not limited to the MCO s': Information Systems Capabilities Assessment (ISCA); Claims systems and process es (including lab, dental, and pharmacy data) ; Data warehouse overview ; Documentation (e.g., IS specifications, data dictionaries, program source code, data queries, record review tools, policies and procedures) for review prior to or during the onsite validation ; Observations resulting from onsite information system queries and MCO staff interviews ; Source code review ; and Information provided subsequent to the onsite visit to address any deficiencies and/or outstanding issues . The ISCA tool was reviewed and u sed to assess the MCOs on factors essential in the performance measure process, including data integration, data control, and calculation of rates. Based on the information provided, the MCOs have a satisfactory process for data integration, appropria te data control, and adequate interpretation of measures specifications. Source code was reviewed which included an assessment and validation of the diagnosis, procedure, pharmacy, and revenue codes to ensure these codes were correctly applied. Additionally, the source code review determined that members of the denominators were correctly selected from the populations, time parameters were accurate and numerators included appropriate parameters and members. Table II -2 provides the MCOs' validation of systems and processes for constructing the Adve rse Perinatal and Birth Outcomes measures and Adverse Outcomes of Chronic Diseases measures. MCO A did not participate in validation activities. Therefore, Delmarva cannot att est to the validity of the processes used by MCO A to calculate the performance measures. Table II -2. Audit Designation Table for Adverse Perinatal and Birth Outcomes and Adverse Outcomes of Chronic Diseases Performance Measure: Adverse Perinatal Outcomes and Adverse Outcomes of Chronic Diseases Validation Component Audit Element Validation Results MCO A * MCO B MCO C Documentation Data integration and control procedures are assessed to determine whether the MCO has the appropriate processes and documentation in place to extract, link, and manipulate data for accurate and reliable measure rate construction. Measurement procedures and programming specifications including data sources, programming logic, and computer source codes are documented . Not Met Met Met 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 24 Performance Measure: Adverse Perinatal Outcomes and Adverse Outcomes of Chronic Diseases Validation Component Audit Element Validation Results MCO A * MCO B MCO C Denominator Validation of the denominator calculations for the performance measures is conducted to assess the extent to which the MCO used appropriate and complete data to identify the entire population and to the degree to which the MCO followed the measures specifications for calculating the denominator. Not Met Met Met Numerator The validation of the numerator determines if the MCO correctly identified and evaluated all qualifying medical events for appropriate inclusion or exclusion in the numerator for each measure and followed the measure specifications for calculation of the numerator. Not Met Met Met Reporting Validation of reporting assesses whether the MCOs followed the District's requirements for reporting the measures rates and followed specifications. The District requires the MCOs to report the denominator, specific numerator event s, and calculated final rates. A final determination is made as to whether the MCO is fully compliant (FC), substantially compliant (SC), or non - compliant (NC). NC FC FC *MCO A did not participate in validation activities. Therefore, Delmarva cannot attest to the validity of the processes used by MCO A to calc ulate the performance measures. In conducting the validation activities for the Adverse Perinatal and Birth Outcomes measures, auditors concluded that : MCO A did not undergo validation activities and therefore MCO A's processes and systems for constructing the measures must be deemed \"Non Compliant. \" Since the MCO did not participate in validation activities, Delmarva cannot attest to the accuracy or rel iability of the reported rates. MCO B and MCO C used valid and reliable methods for calculating performance measures. Performance Improvement Projects Each MCO is required to annually conduct PIPs that are designed to achieve, through ongoing measurements and interventions, significant improvement in clinical or non- clinical care areas that are expected to have a favorable effect on health o utcomes. The MCOs' PIPs must include measurements of performance using objective quality indicators, the implementation of system interventions to achieve improvement in quality, evaluation of the effectiveness of the interventions, and planning and initiation of activities for increasing or sustaining improvement. The validation activity is performed to assess whether the MCOs' PIPs are designed, conducted, and reported in a sound manner , and the degree of confidence DHCF can have in the reported results. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 25 DHCF made some key decisions at the outset of these initiatives. First, they decided to measure progress for the three participating plans as a whole rather than to compare and contrast their performance. The intent was to establish a baseline for 2008 and then gauge progress of the managed care effort as a whole to drive improvement on a population rather than health plan basis. All plans are required to participate, but they are not competitively scored on these initiatives. The collaborative stakeholders me et on a monthly basis. Both collaborative work groups have sought community participation to solicit input from providers and consumers and to expand their influence beyond the formal membership. Each plan document s its individual progress as a component of its PIP reporting . Improving Perinatal and Birth Outcomes Prenatal care is one of the most effective interventions for improving birth outcomes. Regular prenatal care, early and on -going throughout pregnancy, is a key factor in preventing prematurity and low birth weight. By using early risk assessment tools, providers can improve and sometimes prevent costly outcomes. The cost of care for premature and low birth weight infants not only puts a strain on current budgets , but the costs associated with lo ng-term care as well for children born with developmental delays. DHCF, in collaboration with the District's three Medicaid MCOs and other stakeholders, embarked on a multiyear initiative to improve perinatal birth outc omes for District residents. Adverse events are defined as: Miscarriage or fetal loss; Neonates weighing <2500 grams; Neonates with a gestational age <32 weeks; Pregnancies for which the outcome is unknown; Lack of maternal HIV testing; and Death of a n infant age 0 -365 days. The goal of the collaborative is to reduce the rate of adverse perinatal events that occur for pregnancies in the measurement year, as well as among infants, ages 0 -365 days, in the same measurement year. Data from CY 2008 were used to calculate the baseline rate and MY 2012 represents the fourth and final re-measurement period for the collaborative. A description of the PIP and associated measures specifications can be found in Appendix 1 . Table II -3 provides findings for each MCO against the 10 validation steps for the Adverse Perinatal and Birth Outcomes PIP. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 26 Table II -3.

The entire eligible population was assessed. Each MCO's perinatal PIP was reviewed against all components contained within the 10 step review process to assess the validity of the MCOs' PIP processes. Findings are as follows: Step 1: The study topic was selected by DHC F as a joint topic for all MCOs. It addresses key aspects of care and services relevant to the population served by the MCOs . Step 2: The study question was deemed partially met for MCO C because the MCO addressed the overall project aim but did not develop a clear and measureable study question. Step 3: Study indicators were deemed partially met for MCO A because the MCO did not follow through on the recommendations made in the previous year to include specific advers e event (outcome) indicators in line with collaborative requirements and to facilitate comparison of MCO project results. Step 4: All MCOs conducted a nalysi s of the study p opulation to identify barriers. Step 5: Sampling methods are not applicable for the perinatal study as the entire eligible population was assessed and MCOs were not required to conduct sampling. Step 6: All MCOs used administrative data to study the population and to construct the measures. Step 7 : All MCOs conducted o n-going analysi s of the effectiveness of interventions. Step 8: Data analysis and interpretation of results, was deemed partially met for MCO A because t he project analysis did not adequately address or analyze performance against previous rates for the indicators. MCO C did not report all numerical results ac curately in its analysis. Step 9: MCO A could not document any quantitative improvement in the indicators. Step 10: None of the MCOs were able to sustain i mprovement over ba seline rates in all indicators. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 27 In addition to the validation activity, Delmarva conducted analysis and trending of reported indicators from baseline to MY 201 2 utilizing MCO reported rates. The MCO weighted average for adverse events improved from the baseline 2008 rate of 328 (32. 83%) adverse events per 1,000 pregnancies and births to 1 80 (17.99%) adverse outcomes per 1,000 in MY 201 2. The number of pregnant women served by the MCOs with pregnancies ending in each measurement year increased from 4,419 ( baseline) to 6,124 ( MY 2012 ). In baseline year 2008 the rate of pregnancies resulting in low birth weight babies was 1.3%. By MY 2012 the rate increased to 5.4%. Preterm births increased from ba seline .36% to a MY 2012 rate of 3.7%. The rate of HIV testing improved substantially over th e course of the collaborative. Lack of maternal HIV testing has been the largest contributor to the adverse perinatal health outcomes rate s since initiation of the PIP. In spite of growth in the perinatal denominator population, this w as the area most impa cted by the MCOs' PIP efforts. In 2008, lack of HIV testing was noted in approximately 8 2% of the eligible population. In 2012, the rate decreased to approximately 30% of the eligible population. Improvement in the HIV testing rate contributed significantly to the overall reduction in adverse perinatal outcomes District- wide over the course of the collaborative. Trended rates for adverse perinatal outcomes can be found in Table II -4. Although PIP processes were evaluated for MCO A, MCO A did not participate in validation activities to ascertain the reliability of its reported rates for MY 2012. Table II -4. Trended Rates for Adverse Perinatal Outcomes Measurement Year Adverse Perinatal Outcomes MCO A * MCO B MCO C DC Weighted Average Baseline: MY 2008 50.10% 22.22% 6.64% 32.83% 501 29.22% 36.97% 10.32% 23.14% 292 25.64% 25.15% 17.39% 23.15% 256 35.84% 20.62% 15.30% 18.91% 33.00% 13.71% 17.99% 189 330 137 180 Comparison of rates between MCOs is not advised as no population risk adjustment has been conducted. *MCO A did not undergo validation activities to confirm rates for MY 2012. Therefore, Delmarva cannot attest to the accuracy of the reported rate for MY 2012. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 28 MCOs implemented a variety of interventions over the course of the collaborative projects aimed chiefly at early identification of pregnant women and edu cation of providers and members : Perinatal Risk Assessment Form - In year one of the collaborative, all MCOs agreed upon and implemented a standardized perinatal risk assessment form to be completed at the ti me of the first prenatal visit. Tied provider pa yment to the completion of the form and initiated provider incentives for timely completion and submission of the form. Case Management - MCOs used a variety of case management processes including face -to-face contact with members who are hard to reach usi ng case managers, social workers, and patient navigators. Outsourced case management of high- risk members to an organization specializing in this type of intense case management. Extended outreach staff hours to provide increased case management services d uring hours when members might be more easily contacted. Developed a multi- disciplinary team of behavioral health specialists, case managers, and social workers to focus efforts on members with co- existing mental health iss ues or classified as high risk. Utilized co -management of pregnant members by an OB case manager and the members pre - pregnancy case manager. Member and Provider Education - All MCOs focused on increased education of provider and members in the following areas. Member pre -conception and i nter-conception counseling and education. Provider education specific to completion of the perinatal risk form. Provider education on guidelines associated with perinatal HIV testing. Member education through community \"baby shower\" events. Data Analysis - MCOs used a variety of data analytic techniques in an effort to identify pregnant and high risk members earlier in the pregnancy. Increased the frequency of obtaining and analyzing laboratory data from monthly to weekly. Received weekly census reports fro m its largest participating OB provider. Utilized automated technologies to target hard to reach members. Identified members with co -occurring mental health or learning disabilities for intensive case management. Adverse Outcomes of Chronic Diseases DHCF, recognizing the impact of chronic illnesses on both costs to the Medicaid program and health outcomes for the District's Medicaid residents, embarked on a multi -year collaborative effort to reduce adverse health outcomes of chronic diseases for Medi caid m embers enrolled in MCOs. The PIP focuses on measuring changes in the health outcomes of individuals with asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure to improve the health of people in the DC Medicaid and Alliance programs enrolled in MCOs. A description of the PIP and associated measures specifications can be found in Appendix 2 . 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 29 The adverse outcomes of chronic diseases indicator measures the rate of occurrence of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for Medicaid and Alliance managed care plan enrollees with any one, or combination, of the diagnoses of asthma, diabetes, hypertension, or congestive heart failure. This proxy measure for adverse outcomes is founded in the belief that people with chronic illnesses who are well managed and have an ongoing source of medical care will have fewer emergency department visits or hospitalizations which may indicate poor control or complications secondary to the chronic disease. Each MCO's chronic diseases PIP was reviewed against all components c ontained within the 10 step review process used to evaluate the validity of the MCOs' PIP activities. Step 1: The study topic was selected by DHCF as a joint topic for all MCOs. It addresses key aspects of care and services relevant to the population serve d by the MCOs . Step 2: All MCOs developed clear a nd measureable study questions. Step 3: All MCOs addressed the individual st udy indicators by disease type. Step 4: All MCOs conducted analysi s of the study p opulation to identify barriers. Step 5: Sampling methods are not applicable for the perinatal study as the entire eligible population was assessed and MCOs were not required to conduct sampling. Step 6: MCO A submitted unvalidated data. Data collection methods appear to deviate from the methodology used in prior years. Step 7: All MCOs conducted on- going analysi s of the effectiveness of interventions. Step 8: Data analysis and interpretation of results, was deemed partially met for MCO A and MCO C because the project analysis did not adequately address or analyze performance against pre vious rates for the indicators. Step 9: All M COs were able to document improvement in the death rate indicator but none could document improvement in the overall adverse event rates. Step 10: MCO A and MCO B were unable to s ustain improvement over baseline rates in all indicators. MCO C was able to document sustained improvement in the death rate indicator but not in any other project indicators or the overall adverse event rate. Validation results for the Adverse Outcomes o f Chronic Disease s PIP can be found in Table II -5. Table II -5.

The entire eligible population was assessed. In addition to the PIP validation activities, Delmarva conducted ana lysis and trending of reported adverse event rates from baseline to MY 2012. The collaborative goal for adverse event s related to chronic diseases was set at <450 per 1,000 members. None of the MCOs were able to individually achieve this goal. An aggregated District rate was not calculated because data submitted by MCO A was not validated . The methodology used by MCO A to calculate the MY 2012 rate appears to be substantially changed from prior years. The overall rates of adverse events for members with chronic diseases fluctuated from 7 -14 percentage points each year. Table II -6 provides trended rates for adverse outcom es of chronic diseases over the course of the collaborative. Table II -6.

Therefore, Delmarva cannot attest to the accuracy of the reported rate for MY 2012. *NA denotes that a District weighted average was not calculated because MCO A data was not validated. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 31 An analysis of the PIP results found that: High emergency department utilization for members with asthma, without a corresponding high rate of hospitalizations, indicates that there is the potential to decrease emergency department visits by focusing on medication compliance, coordination of care, and better access to ongoi ng primary care physicians for these members. Of those members diagnosed with a chronic illness, those with hypertension had the highest rate for hospitalizations and were second to asthmatics for emergency department visits . MCOs implemented a variety of interventions over the course of the collaborative projects aimed chiefly at education of providers and members: Offered incentives for routine and preventative care visits. Dedicated case managers to follow -up on members who utilized the nurse triage lin e. Targeted face -to-face education of providers regarding hypertension guidelines. Used pharmaceutical programs to remind members when refills were due. Sent case listings of members identified with a chronic illness to PCPs. Sent notices to PCPs of all me mbers utilizing emergency department services 3 or more times in a 6 month period. Offered transportation to all members receiving case management ser vices for medical appointments. Used \"Health Navigators\" to provide face -to-face cont act with hard to reach members. HEDIS As previously noted, all District Medicaid MCOs are required to calculate and submit audited HEDIS and CAHPS measures to DHCF. Delmarva selected and analyzed results from HEDIS effectiveness of care measures and CAHPS measures reported by the MCOs to assess quality. The full set of HEDIS and CAHPS measures and corresponding MCO rates can be found in Appendix 3. Managing chronic disease is a complex matter requiring care coordi nation between the health plan and the servicing providers. Research has shown that following evidence -based health care guidelines for treatment and monitoring of these individuals can improve health status. HEDIS measures provide information on the health status of the MCOs' chronic diseases populations and can be used in conjunction with the MCOs' chronic diseases adverse event rates to assess how well the MCOs are performing in improving health status for those living with a chronic illness. Comprehensive Diabetes Care In 2008, diabetes ranked as the sixth leading cause of death in the District of Columbia. According to 2010 estimates by the CDC, nearly 25.8 million people in the United States have diabetes. 8.3% of the District's residents reported having been diagnosed with diabetes.12 Diabetes can lead to signi ficant health 12 Diabetes in the District of Columbia, District of Columbia Department of Health, Diabetes Prevention and Control Program.

Controlling High Blood Pressure According to CDC statistics approximately 1 in 3 adults in the United States has hypertension and less than 46% of people with hypertension have their blood pre ssure under control (<140/90). Costs associated with hypertension are estimated to be nearly $131 billion annually for the nation.13 Lifestyle modifications such as increased exercise and reduced salt intake can help individuals control their blood pressure. In addition, antihypertensive pharmacotherapy is effective in controlling blood pressure and has been associated with reduced incide nce of stroke, heart attack, heart failure , and kidney disease . Table II -8 provides the MCOs' and District weighted averages for 201 1 and 201 2 for controlling high blood pressure. Table II -8.

The District weighted average for controlling high blood pressure did not meet the National Medicaid average for MY 2012. Of note, one MCO that did not have a large enough population of members with hypertension in MY 2011 to report on this measure was abl e to report for MY 2012. MCO A, compri sed of approximately 2/3 of the District's Medicaid enrollees, chose not to report on this measure. Use of Appropriate Medication for People with Asthma According to the CDC approximately 1 in 12 adults and 1 in 10 children in the Uni ted States had asthma in 2009. It is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood and accounts for about $50 billion in 13 \"High Blood Pressure Facts\". Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Available at: www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 34 associated medical costs annually. The overall prevalence of asthma in the District is estimated to be 18.0%.14 Asthma is a chronic lung disease that can be life -threat ening if not properly managed. However, research has shown that the use of evidence -based guidelines can significantly impr ove management of the disease. These guidelines recommend specific pharmaco therapy aimed at controlling asthma exacerbations in the long term as well as medications for quick relief of acute asthma symptoms. The HEDIS indicator, use of appropriate medications for people with asthma, measures how well providers are adhering to these treatment guidelines. The HEDIS measure for medication management for people with asthma provides an indication of how compliant asthmatics are with use of prescribed asthma control medications. MY 2012 represents the f irst year for this new measure. The MCOs' and the District's weighted averages for 201 1 and 201 2 are found in Table II -9. Table II -9.

MCO B exceeded the national Medicaid average for MY 2012 and improved slightly over its MY 2011 rate for appropriate medications f or people with asthma. MCO A and C fell belo w the national Medicaid average and declined in performa nce from their MY 2011 rates for appropriate medi cations for people with asthma. MCO B exceeded the National Medicaid average for 75% compliance with medications for people with asthma. CAHPS Adult enrollees and parents/guardians of child enrollees are asked annua lly to rate the quality of care and services provided by MCOs in which they are enrolled. MCOs are required to assess consumer satisfaction using a standardized instrument, the Co nsumer Assessment of H ealthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS). The C AHPS survey questionnaire was updated from version 4.0H to version 5.0H for M Y 2012 . The revisions included changes to ordering and wording of survey questions and specification changes for some measures including Shared Decision Making and Health Promotion and Education . The specification changes were significant enough that NCQA did not publicly report benchmarks for these measures for MY 2012. MCO A did not conduct an adult or child survey for MY 2012. As this MCO represented nearly two -thirds of the Dis trict's managed care population, a weighted average was not calc ulated for MY 2012. MCO B did n ot conduct an adult CAHPS survey in MY 2011 because its adult population was too small. MY 2012 is the first year that MCO B had a large enough adult population to field the survey. Tables II -10 and II -11 provide results from the adu lt and child CAHPS surveys for M Y 201 1 and 201 2 on measures representative of quality. Table II -10.

As with the adult surveys, the highest level of satisfaction for both MCO B and C were in the area o f how well doctors communicate. MCO B exceeded the national M edicaid average for 5 of the 9 measures. MCO B achieved an 80% satisfaction rating for 6 of the 9 measures. MCO B declined by 7 perecntage points in members' rating of health plan. MCO C exceeded the national Medicaid average for 3 of the 9 measures. MCO C achieved an 80% satisfaction rating for 5 of the 9 measures. It is recommended that MCO B focus efforts on further assessment of member dissatisfaction and development of interventions to improve member satisfaction. MCO B may consider development of a more specific survey of members, or focus groups, to identify key areas of dissatisfaction . 2012 Annual Technical Report Section II - Quality Delmarva Foundation 38 Quality Conclus ions The health plans have quality systems and procedures in place to promote high quality care and have well - organized approaches to quality improvement. Policies, procedures, and operational plans presented during the previous year's compliance review w ere well defined and documented. Measurement, follow -up, and reporting across the organizations was evident based on discussions with staff, reports reviewed, and presentations of activities. The MCOs operate strong QAPI programs that include annual planning, participation from providers and MCO leadership, and provide for on -going assessment and quality improvemen t activities . There were no action plans required to address operational systems relative to quality based on the most recent compliance review. In regards to the perinatal collaborative, the MCOs demonstrated improvement with a decrease in adverse events by 14.84 percentage points over the baseline 2008 rate. The largest contributor to improvement in the overal l rate was the substantial increase in the rate of H IV testing for pregnant women. For the chronic care collaborative none of the MCOs achieved the goal of < 450 adverse events per 1,000 members. The lack of valid and reliable data from MCO A hampered the ability to thoroughly analyze PIP data. Overall, the MCO HEDIS rates improved for diabetes and controlling high blood pressure ; however, almost all HEDIS indicators for these chronic illnesses remained below the national Medicaid average. The HEDIS indica tor for use of appropriate medications for people with asthma fell nearly 4 percentage points below the 2011 rate and failed to meet the national Medicaid average. As MCO A and MCO C are no longer participating health plans in the District, recommendations are made only for MCO B. It is recommended that MCO B , as a component of its Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement Program , develop improvement efforts that focus on HEDIS/CAHPS performance and strive to meet minimum performance levels at the Medicaid national average.2012 Annual Technical Report Section III - Access Delmarva Foundation 39 Section III - Access Introduction An assessment of access considers the degree to which individuals are inhibited or facilitated in their ability to gain entry to and to receive care and services from the health care system. Factors influencing this ability include geographic, architectural, transportation, and financial considerations, among others. Access (or accessibility), as defined by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), is \"the extent to which a patient can obtain available service s at the time they are needed. Such service refers to both telephone access and ease of scheduling an appointment, if applicable. The intent is that each organization provides and maintains appropriate access to primary care, behavioral hea lth care, and member services.\" Access to healthcare is the foundation of good health outcomes. Factors influencing access include provider availability, geographic proximity, transportation, and policies that enhance access. Availability is the extent to which the organization provides the appropriate types and number of practitioners and providers necessary to meet the needs of its members wit hin defined geographical areas. Purpose and Methodology Access depends on many factors, including availability of appointments, the patient's ability to see a specialist, adequacy of the healthcare network, a nd availability of transportation and translation services. The purpose of this review is to ensure that MCO procedures do not result in barriers that might restrict Medicaid enrollees' access to necessary medical care and services that promote optimal health outcomes. In addition, MCO policies and procedures must demonstrate that the MCO can adequately monitor access and have programs in place that enhance an enrollee's ability to access necessary services, such as transportation and in terpretive services. Delmarva evaluates access to care and services for MCO enrollees through a review of the MCOs' structure and operational systems, analysis of HEDIS measures of access (such as preventive care and well visits), and analysis of CAHPS survey results regarding member satisfaction with access . Findings Structure and Operational Systems Review MCOs must have policies and procedures in place that promote access to care and services for enrollees. The specific operational policies examined addressed areas such as: second opinions; PCP selection/assignment; services provided by the Member Services Department; Member Education and 2012 Annual Technical Report Section III - Access Delmarva Foundation 40 Outreach; access to covered services, emergency care, direct access services (such as family planning) and out of network care. DHCF mandates that MCOs must achieve full compliance with all standards and must submit action plans to address any areas that are not found fully compliant or for which opportunities for improvement have been identified. Delmarva focused ac tivities on providing MCOs with technical assistance in the development of action plans and monitoring MCOs' progress in resolving areas of concern id entified in the CY 2011 report. There were no structure or operational systems findings related to access in the prior year ; therefore, no action plans were required in this area. HEDIS/CAHPS Measures Preventive health care measures provide information about how well a health plan provides services that maintain good health and prevent illness in adults and children. Children 's access to health care is an important determinant of better health outcomes as well as readiness to learn. A regular source of care is vitally important in terms of providing appropriate preventive service s and/or diagnosing and treati ng acute/chronic conditions in a timely manner. From a cost perspective, regular access to preventive services can decrease the need for emergency and specialized services. Table III -1 provides information on the MCOs' performance on measures of access. Table III -1.

In the area of adult access to preventive/ambulatory care, the District fell below the Medicaid national average for adults ages 20-44 years as well as for adults ages 45-64 years . However, in areas pertinent to children and adolescents' access to preventive/ambulatory care, the District performed well. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section III - Access Delmarva Foundation 42 The District weighted average exceeded the Medicaid average in 7 of the 12 meas ures pertain ing to children and adolescents , and performed above the national Medicaid average for : Lead screening. Children and adolescents' access to PCP (25 mos. to 6 yrs.). Children and adolescents' access to PCP (7 -11 yrs.). Well child visits (ages 3 -6). Adolescent well -care visits (ages 12 -21). Immunizations for adolescents (Combo 1). Annual dental visit (ages 2 -21). The District's weighted average fell below the national Medicaid average by a narrow margin for two measures : Access to PCP (ages 12 mos. - 24 mos.) . Access to PCP (12 -19 yrs .). The District has made steady progress in improving access to preventive/ambulatory care for children and adolescents. Table III -2 provides a comparison of CY 201 1 and 201 2 performance on the CAHPS measure rela ted to getting needed care. This measure gauges the member's or parent/ guardian's perceptions and satisfaction with access to care and services. Table III -2.

Analysis of CAHPS result s related to access found that: Satisfaction with access to needed care for adults improved overall approximately 7 percentage points from M Y 201 1. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section III - Access Delmarva Foundation 43 Satisfaction with access to needed care for children rose approximately 10 percentage points overall from 2011. MCO B improved approximately 9 percentage points in ge tting needed care for children. MCO C improved approximately 9 percentage points in satisfaction with getting needed care for adults and nearly 14 percentage points for children. Adult and Child rates for getting needed care were below the National CAHPS Medicaid Average indicating an opportunity for continued improvement. Access Conclusions All MCOs conduct on -going analysi s of the adequacy of provider networks , both for primary and specialty care. Member utilization of services and geo -access reports are used to identify providers with open networks to ensure that adequate numbers of providers are available to meet the needs of the population. Members receive information regarding providers, hours of operations, and the availability of transportation and translation services. Care coord ination and disease management programs are aimed at identifying members with special needs, or those who are non -compliant with care, to provide additional assistance in accessing needed service s and improving health status . There were no action plans req uired to address operational systems relative to access based on the most recent compliance review. Access to preventive/ambulatory services for adults decreased slightly from MY 2011 for members ages 20 - 44 and ages 45 -64. Both rates also fell below the National Medicaid average. Although adult access to PCPs measures declined, measures for access to preventive and well -child services have shown improvement year over year with 7 of the 12 child measures ac hieving or exceeding t he national Medicaid averages. In concert with the adult access to PCP measure, adult satisfaction with \"getting needed care\" did not meet the National Medicaid average. However, member satisfaction increased by nearly 7 percentage po ints over MY 2011 rates. Parent/guardian satisfaction with \"getting needed care\" for child enrollees improved over MY 201 1 by 10 percentage points. MCO B fell below the national avaergae for both adults and children for \"getting needed care\". MCO B shoul d further assess potential barriers to access to services by evaluating the availability of after -hours care and adequacy of provider networks. In addition, MCO education and outreach efforts should focus on the importance of preventive ambulatory care. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section IV - Timeliness Delmarva Foundation 44 Section IV - Timeliness Introduction The Institute of Medicine (IOM) considers timeliness to be one of the six domains of healthcare quality. The IOM defines timeliness as \"reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays.\" Standards for timeliness are incorporated into MCO contracts and define the length of time in which an enrollee would be able to schedule or receive an appointment. Timeframes are bas ed on the urgency of need and the presence or absence of health symptoms. Timeliness of care can affect utilization, including both appropriate care and over - or underutilization of services and contribute to enrollee complaints and dissatisfaction. Presu mably, the earlier an enrollee sees a medical professional, the sooner he or she can receive necessary healthcare services. Postponing needed care may result in adverse health outcomes and increases in hospitalization and emergency room utilization. Timeliness can also be a marker for the adequacy and effectiveness of policies and procedures that promote health outcomes through communication and resolution of complaints and grievances so as to not disrupt or delay healthcare services. Purpose and Met hodology In assessing timeliness, Delmarva selected operational standards from enrollee rights, quality assessment and performance improvement, and grievance systems . The enrollee rights standards pertain to information that MCOs must provide to member s within specified timeframes. Quality standards include availability of appointments and timeliness of authorization decisions, while grievance system standards relate to the availability and timeliness of processes for resolving compla ints, grievances, a nd appeals. In conjunction with the analysis of operational elements, Delmarva used findings from HEDIS and CAHPS measures to draw conclusions regarding the timeliness of services provided by MCOs. Findings Structure and Operational Systems Timeliness is an important factor for evaluating MCO performance because organizations must have procedures in place to make timely decisions in order not to disrupt or delay the provision of care or services to their members. Several operational standards related to t imeliness are evaluated during the compliance review process, including review of the MCOs' credentialing and re -credentialing procedures, authorization activities, grievance and appeals procedures, and monitoring availability of providers and appointments . Access to a grievance system affords enrollees with the right to express dissatisfac tion with care or services 2012 Annual Technical Report Section IV - Timeliness Delmarva Foundation 45 provided by the MCO or its providers and the ability for MCOs to potentially identify i ssues that need to be addressed. The following findings were noted in assessing MCOs for compliance with operational standards for CY 2011 related to timeliness of services for members: MCO B did not meet requirements for notifying members of changes to the provider network in a timely manner. The MCO did not provide timely notification to members when availability of after -hours services changed. MCO C did not meet requirements for its providers for timely access to care and services, taking into account the urgency of need for services. An evaluation of the M CO's provider surveys found that appointments for asymptomatic health assessments including adult physicals and EPSDT services were compliant only 70% of the time for appointments within 3 weeks. Appointments for routine symptomatic care were available wit hin 10 business days 80% of the time. MCO A and MCO B did not mail timely notifications of denials in accordance with the District's requirements. MCO C did not meet timeliness requirements for resolving grievances. All MCOs that failed to achieve 100% compliance on operational standards for CY 2011 were required to submit an action plan indicating the steps they will take to resolve the non -compliant issues. The action plans are reviewed and approved by Delmarva. Onc e an acceptable action plan has been approved, Delmarva requires the MCOs to submit periodic updates regarding implementation of the action plans. Any revisions to policies and procedures are reviewed as well as MCO generated reports to show evidence of co mpliance with the requirements. All three MCOs submitted action plans per requirements and all identified issues were resolved or the MCO had exited the District Medicaid market . HEDIS/CAHPS Measures Prenatal Care The leading causes of infant mortality in the U.S. are congenital malformations, disorders related to pre -term birth and low -birth weight, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Prenatal visits in the first trimester provide an opportunity for early risk assessment, health promotion and medical , nutritional and psychosocial interventions that can promote good clinical outcomes for both mother and child. On- going prenatal care visits provide opportunities for early identification of complications that can put both mother and c hild at risk for poo r outcomes. Table IV -1 provides MCOs' performance on timeliness of prenatal care for pregnant women and the frequency at which wome n receive prenatal care visits. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section IV - Timeliness Delmarva Foundation 46 Table IV -1. Timeliness and Frequency of Prenatal Care Analysis of HEDIS measures related to timeliness of services found that: The District's weighted average fell short of the national Medicaid average for timeliness of prenatal care , largely due to a nearly 11 percentage point drop in timeliness for MCO A. MCO B improved in timeliness of prenatal care by nearly 11 percentage points over MY 2011 and MCO C improved by 4 percentage points over MY 2011. The District's weighted average for the frequency with which women obtain ongoing prenatal care (at least 81% of the recommended prenatal care visits) improved by 4 percentage points over MY 2011 but still fell substantially short of the national Medicaid average. Approximately 58 % of pregnant women in the District received >61% of the recommended number of prenatal care visits compared to approximately 74 % for the National Medicaid average. CAHPS CAHPS surveys query adu lts and parents/guardians of children regarding satisfaction with how qu ickly they can get needed care. Table IV -2 provides information regarding members' satisfaction with getting care quickly .

Adults' satisfaction with getting care quickly improved by approximately 4 percentage points from the M Y 2011 rate, while satisfaction with getting care quickly for children rose approximately 5 \u00bd percentage points from MY 201 1 to MY 201 2. The District averages for getting care quickly for both a dults and child ren were below their respective National CAHPS Medicaid averages indicating further opportunities for improvement. Timeliness Conclusions All MCOs monitor authorization decisions for timeliness. Turn -around time is measured and documented with results summarized and reported to the designated Quality Improvement and Utilization Management committee s. The health plans were able to demonstrate that there were policies and p rocedures in place to address the majo r requirements for timeliness. Timeliness standards for availability of appointments were documented in the relevant procedures and are monitored through surveys. All MCOs submitted action plans to address any areas of non- compliance from the prior year's operational systems reviews. Action plans were reviewed and approved by Delmarva, implemented by the MCOs, and on-going monitoring was conducted by Delmarva to ensure that all i dentified issues were resolved. HEDIS mea sures for timeliness of prenatal care and the frequency with which pregnant women accessed on - going p renatal care fell short of the N ational Medicaid averages , declining over MY 2011 rates . CAHPS results for satisfaction with getting care quickly improved approximately four percentage points for adults, while satisfaction with getting care quickly rose approximately 5 \u00bd percentage points for children. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section V - Summary Delmarva Foundation 48 Section V - Summary of Findings Quality The MCOs operate strong QAPI programs that include annual planning, participation from providers and MCO leadership, and provide for on -going assessment and quality improvement activities. The MCOs operate r obust care management and disease management programs to improve access to services for members who have experienced a critical event or diagnosis that requires the extensive use of resources and who need help navigating the system to facilitate appropriate delivery of care and services, as well as to bring non-compliant members into care. MCOs met all operational standards relative to quality for CY 2011 ; therefore, action plans were not required based on the prior year's findings. Health outcomes remained below national Medicaid averages for District residents with chronic illnesses. However, MCOs improved in nearly all HEDIS measures for comprehensive diabetes care. Although the perinatal collaborative PIP met established goals for MY 201 2, there remains much room for improvement especially in decreasing the rates of preterm infan ts and low birth weight babies. MCOs improved in nearly all measures of satisfa ction for child enrollees with 5 of the 9 indicators nearly exceeding an 80% satisfaction level. CAHPS results show s atisfaction among adult enrollees exceeded 80% in 3 of the 9 measures , but improved over MY 2011 rates for 7 of the 9 measures. Both adult and child satisfaction with how well doctors communicate exceeded 90%. Acce ss An evaluation of the MCOs' operational systems relative to access found that all MCOs conduct ongoing analys is of the adequacy of provider networks , both for primary and specialty care. Member utilization of services and geo -access reports are used to identify providers with open networks to ensure that adequate numbers of providers are available to meet the needs of the population. Care coordination and disease management programs are aimed at identifying members with special needs, or those who are non -compliant with care, to provide additional assistance in accessing needed service s and improving health status. MCOs met all operational standards relative to access for CY 2011 ; therefore, action plans were not required based on the prior year's finding s. Adult access to PCPs fell below the national HEDIS Medicaid average for MY 2012 and showed a slight decline over MY 2011 rates. However, measures for access to preventive and well -child services have shown improvement over prior years with 7 of the 12 child measures achieving or exceeding the national Medicaid averages. MCOs performed well above the national Medicaid average for annual dental visits, lead screening, well child visits ages 3 -6, and adolesce nt well -care and immunizations. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section V - Summary Delmarva Foundation 49 Adult satisfaction with \"getting needed care\" improved substantially ( 7 percentage points) over MY 2011 rates. Parent/guardian satisfaction with \"getting needed care\" for child enrollees improved over MY 201 1 by nearly 10 percentage points. Timeliness Timeliness is an important factor for evaluating MCO performance . Procedures must be in place to make timely decisions in order not to disrupt or delay the provision of care or services to members. An evaluation of the MCOs' operational systems relative to timeliness found that all MCOs monitor authorization decisions for timeliness. Turn -around time is measured and documented with results summarized and reported to the designated QI/UM committee. However, the CY 2011 findings identified several opportunities for improvement in the MCOs' structure and operational processes for timely notification of decisions to members, timely resolution of grievances, and availability of provider appointments within the District's specified timeframes. All MCOs submitted a ction plans for review and approval by Delmarva. Action plans were implemented and monitored until the i dentified issues were resolved. HEDIS measures for timeliness of prenatal care and the frequency with which pregnant women accessed on - going prenatal c are fell short of the national Medicaid averages. CAHPS results for satisfaction with getting care quickly declined approximately 4 percentage points for adults, while satisfaction with getting care quickly rose approximately 5 \u00bd percentage points for children. Status of Recommendations from Prior Year MCOs As a result of the CY 2011 review activities several recommendations for improvement were made to the MCOs. The MCOs were expected to act on the recommendations during CY 2012. The status of each recommendation is addressed below: MCOs must ensure that written policies and procedures encompass all required federal and contractual language. During the CY 2011 review, MCO A was found to be non -compliant with requirements for timely notification to members when availability of after -hours services changed and for timely notifications of denials in accordance with the District's requirements. An action plan was developed and implemented by MCO A and this issue was resolved . MCO B did not meet require ments for notifying members of changes to the provider network in a timely manner and did not meet requirements for timely notification of denials in accordance with the District's requirements. An action plan was developed and implemented. Monitoring of r eports indicate that these issues have been resolved. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section V - Summary Delmarva Foundation 50 MCO C did not meet requirements for its providers for timely access to care and services, taking into account the urgency of need for services. An evaluation of the MCO's provider surveys found that appointments for asymptomatic health assessments including adult physicals and EPSDT services were compliant only 70% of the time for appointments within 3 weeks. Appointments for routine symptomatic care were available within 10 business days 80% of the tim e. MCO C also did not meet timeliness requirements for resolving grievances. An action plan was developed and implemented. MCOs must ensure that PIP activities include a robust analysis of performance for each indicator and tie results to specific interventions. This should include a drill down of data to develop system- wide interventions that may help to sustain improvement. MCOs submitted CY 2012 PIP reports to Delmarva in July 2013 for review and evaluation. By this point in time, two of the MCOs (MCO A and MCO C) participating in CY 2012 activities had b een notified that they did not successfully secure new DHCF contracts t o provide services to the District's Medicaid enrollees. Therefore, more robust analysis of PIP data were not undertaken by these two MCOs. MCO B continued to conduct robust data analysis of PIPs results and to develop multi -faceted approaches to quality i mprovement based on data findings. MCOs should evaluate HEDIS outcomes measures in relationship to PIP results. Two of the MCOs (MCO A and MCO C) participating in CY 2012 activities w ere notified that they did not successfully secure new DHCF contracts to provide services to the District's Medicaid enrollees. Therefore, evaluation of HEDIS outcomes measures in relationship to PIP results were not undertaken by these two MCOs. However, within its PIP report, MCO B did include HEDIS data relative to the PIP indicators. MCOs should set goals and develop interventions to achieve, at a minimum, the Medicaid average for HEDIS comprehensive diabetes care and controlling high blood pressure measures. All three (3) MCOs improved in nearly all HEDIS measures comprehensive diabetes care. MCO B and MCO C also improved in the controlling high blood pressure measure. MCO A did not submit HEDIS data for controlling high blood pressure. MCOs should conduct a root cause analysis tied to CAHPS results to identify rea sons for member dissatisfaction, particularly in the areas of customer service and care coordination. MCO A did not conduct a CAHPS survey for CY 2012. MCO B improved in both both care coordination and customer service in its child population. CY 2012 was the first year that MCO B had a large enough population to field the adult survey. MCO C improved in care coordination and customer service in both t he child and adult populations. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section V - Summary Delmarva Foundation 51 DHCF As a result of EQRO activities conducted for CY 201 1, Delmarva made the following recommendations to DHCF for program improvement: Consider designing and implementing a robust value -based purchasing plan consisting of incentives/disincentives based on MCOs' performance across a designated set of performance measures. DHCF is actively working with its actuary to develop a value -based purchasing program. DHCF began contracting with three (3) new MCOs on July 1, 2013. Therefore, it is not expected that data will be available until F Y 2015 to implement a value -based purchasing program. Choose a subset of HEDIS, CAHPS, and operational measures that align with DHCF 's Strategic Plan and set specific goals against which MCO performance will be assessed annually. These should include goals such as adult access to preventive services, child access to preventive services, quality outcomes related to chronic illnesses, care coordination, and member satisfaction. DHCF is currently in the process of revising its Strategic Plan to incorporate spec ific goals for MCO performance. Use performance against the designated measures as the basis for a consumer report card. DHCF plans to implement the consumer report card in FY 20 15 when data becomes available. Re-evaluate the current collaborative PIP structure to expand the stakeholders group and add measures more closely tied to health outcomes. The collaborative PIP efforts include monthly meetings with stakeholders who have a direct interest in improving health outcomes in the District, among these are MCOs, physicians, clinics, hospitals, and special interest organizations like the American Diabetes Association. The purpose of these stakeholder meetings is to identify resources and potential interventions that promote improved health outcomes. Over the course of the collaborative activities, stakeholder participation has declined. In order to effect system -wide improvement it is important to receive input and recommendations from a wide variety of service providers. DHCF began working with the newly contracted MCOs in September 2013 to restructure the collaboratives and revise the measure indicators. Several local asthma coalitions have begun actively participating in the collaborative work groups. Consider gauging MCO performance separately for the collaborative PIPs. Aggregation of results may be skewed by including rates from one MCO that only serves a special needs population. This recommendation remains under consideration by DHCF and the collaborative work group. As noted above, DHCF is activel y working to address the recommendations from CY 2012. However, implementation of program changes that may result from these recommendations are not expected to occur 2012 Annual Technical Report Section V - Summary Delmarva Foundation 52 until FY 2015. DHCF issued a request for proposals in CY 2012 to procure new MCO contract s. New MCOs began program participation in July 2013. It is not expected that MCOs will have adequate data available to implement incentive based performance or a consumer report card until FY 2015. DHCF is currently reviewing its Strategic Plan for possib le revisions to include performance goals for HEDIS and CAHPS measures, a value -based purchasing plan, and use of a consumer report card. In regards to the collaborative PIPs, DHCF continues to require MCOs to participate in two collaborative PIPs. Both c ollaborative work groups are focused on reviewing and potentially revising the PIP focus and indicators. Additional stakeholders have been identified and have begun actively participating in collaborative efforts to re -structure the PIPs. DHCF, in conjunct ion with the work groups, will determine whether separate MCO rates for the indicators will be reported versus an overall District rate dependent upon the final indicators chosen. It is expected that CY 2014 data, which will be reported in June 2015, will be used to construct baseline rates for both collaboratives. Opportunities for Improvement Recommendations for MCOs Although each health plan is committed to delivering high quality care and services to its managed care members, opportunities exist for continued performance improvement. Based upon the evaluation of 201 2 activities, and recognizing that MCO A and MCO C will exit the Dis trict Medicaid market in 2013, Delmarva developed the following recommendations for MCO B: Renew efforts to obtain stake holder involvement in the collaborative PIPs. Identify and leverage current quality improvement efforts underway in the District that support the collaborative aims . For future PIPs, ti e proposed interventions to data points to enable analysis of the effec tiveness of the interventions. Recommendations for DHCF Considering all the results for measures of quality, access and timeliness of care for the contracted health plans, Delmarva developed the following recommendations for DHCF: Set performance improvement goals for each MCO for key PIP indicators. This will improve MCO accountability and engagement in collaborative efforts. Consider expanding the perinatal collaborative indicators to include a new measure of deliveries prior to 39 weeks gestation. 2012 Annual Technical Report Section V - Summary Delmarva Foundation 53 Set minimum performance goals for health plans on select HEDIS and CAHPS measures. These should include an array of measures pertinent to the District's enrolled managed care population. In particular, we would recommend that measure goa ls be set for diabetes and prenatal care. Link all goals to D HCF 's Strategic Plan . The status of implementation of recommendations made to the MCO and to DHCF will be addressed in the CY 2013 Annual Technical Report. Best and Emerging Practices The health plans effectively and collaboratively addressed quality, timeliness and access to care issues in their respec tive managed care populations. The health plans implemented several best practices strategies which are noted below. MCOs t ied provider pa yment and incentives to timely completion and submission of the perinatal risk assessment form. Outsourced case management of high- risk members to an organization specializing in this type of intense case management. Extended outreach staff hours to provid e increased case management services during hours when members might be more easily contacted. Developed a multi- disciplinary team of behavioral health specialists, case managers, and social workers to focus efforts on members with co- existing mental healt h issues or classified as high risk. Utilized co -management of pregnant members by an OB case manager and the members pre -pregnancy case manager. Increased the frequency of obtaining and analyzing laboratory data from monthly to weekly to identify members with ch ronic conditions or pregnancy earlier. Received weekly census reports from largest participating OB provider for earlier identification of pregnant members . Monitored after hours nurse triage line utilization for follow -up of members. Initiated a Ph armaceutical Adherence Program to track medication compliance and to send reminders when members did not obtain a refill wi thin the appropriate time span. Sent providers case listings of all members identified with a chronic condition. Sent providers notif ication of members utilizing the emergency department 3 or more times in a 6 month period. Developed disease management toolkit for members with chronic illnesses. Established \"Health Navigators\" for face -to-face contact with members who are hard to reach. 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix I Delmarva Foundation A1-1 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE FINANCE IMPROVING BIRTH OUTCOMES PERINATAL MEASURE SPECIFICATION AND INSTRUCTIONS MY 2011 Perinatal Measure Specification The District of Columbia (DC) Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) measures selected perinatal outcomes as part of a multiyear initiative to improve the health of infants born to mothers in the DC Medicaid program. This measure predominantly assesses health care outcomes, as opposed to certain aspects of the delivery (processes) of health care. Because of this, and because nearly all pregnant women and infants in DC Medicaid are enrolled in managed care as opposed to fe e-for-service health care, the unit of analysis will be DHCF's managed care program as a whole, as opposed to individual managed care plans. Although individual managed care organizations (MCOs) that deliver service to DC Medicaid members have and will continue to implement quality improvement (QI) initiatives in perinatal health and report the outcomes of these initiatives to DHCF, individual managed care plan performance on this outcome measure is not publicly reported. Thus, no risk adjustment is require d, as is the case when health outcomes are compared across individual providers. Specifications for the perinatal measure are outlined below. Measure Specifications TITLE: Adverse Perinatal Outcomes : The rate of adverse perinatal events (as defined belo w) that occurred among pregnancies ending in each calendar year, and infants ages 0 -365 days in the same calendar year. Adverse events are defined as: neonates with birth weight less than 2,500 grams; neonates of 32 weeks or less gestational age; pregnant women NOT tested for HIV prior to giving birth; pregnancies ending in miscarriage or fetal loss (early or late); pregnancies for which no outcome is known; and death of infant ages 0 -365 days. DESCRIPTION This measure tracks the outcomes of all pregnancies (i.e., those that end in a live birth as well as those that end in a miscarriage or fetal loss) and infant deaths among DC Medicaid managed care enrollees, and determines the rate at which: 1) pregnancies ended with: fetal or infant death; a neonate with low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) or who are severely preterm (less than 32 weeks gestation); or with NO testing for the HIV status of the mother prior to delivery; and 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix I Delmarva Foundation A1-2 2) infant death occurred in the first year of life. In addition, when a managed care plan does not have data on the outcome of the pregnancy, this is included as an adverse outcome. Because this measure calculates rates of adverse events, we seek to achieve reductions in this rate from year to year. RATIONALE Approximately 7,900 babies are born in the District of Columbia each year; the Medicaid program pays for nearly two -thirds of these. Of all births in DC, 11.2 percent are born at low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) and 3.3 percent are born very preterm (less than 32 completed weeks of gestation)15 placing them at increased risk for neuro -developmental handicaps, respiratory illness, the need for long term hospitalizations and long term learning difficulties.16 Twelve babies out of every 1 ,000 live births die before their first birthday.17 Among HIV infected mothers the rate of perinatal transmission is 25 percent without treatment and 2 percent or less with treatment.18 In D.C. in 2006, only 20 percent of HIV infected mothers whose children were perinatally infected had been tested before or during the birth of the child.19 Among District residents wide disparities exist across the city in infant mortality rates. For instance, in 2005 Ward 3 reported the lowest infant mortality rate (5.3 out o f 1,000 live births) and Ward 8 reported the highest (21.7 out of 1,000).20 Nationally, the rate of infant mortality among African Americans is more than twice that of Caucasians (13.6 vs. 5.7 per 1,000 live births in 2004). Much of the discrepancy between infant mortality rates among African Americans and Caucasians can be explained by discrepancies in prematurity and low birth weight rates. 21African American women are twice as likely to give birth to a low birth weight infant as compared to Caucasian women, and one and a half times more likely to deliver preterm.22 Other factors contributing to the discrepancy in infant mortality between African Americans and Caucasians include sudden infant death syndrome, infections, congenital abnormalities, and injuries. 23 15 March of Dimes, District of Columbia Maternal and Infant Health Overview available at marchofdimes.com/peristats.

There are a number of evidence -based interventions to reduce poor pregnancy outcomes. Early, comprehensive prenatal care has been shown to promote healthier pregnancies by early detection of risk factors, by monitoring symptoms, and by providing health behavior advice and education.24, 25 In 20 05 the national infant mortality rate for infants whose mothers began prenatal care either after the first trimester or not at all was 40 percent higher than the rate for infants whose mothers began care in the first trimester (8.69 deaths per 1,000 live b irths compared to 6.2 deaths per 1,000 live births).26 Prenatal care is especially important in the presence of birth complications.27 Yet in DC only 69 percent of women receive prenatal care in the first trimester. Among African Americans, the number of women receiving prenatal care in the first trimester is only 62 percent compared to 91 percent among Caucasian women. 28 Good evidence also suggests that nurse home visiting programs29 and other programs which include regular home visits with education and pare ntal support30 can result in earlier and more frequent well -baby visits, and longer intervals between births. These interventions are especially effective for women with few economic and social resources.31 Improving rates of prenatal care visits have been s hown to have a more marked effect on improving birth outcomes in the African American patient population than the Caucasian patient population. 32 By employing multidisciplinary prenatal interventions (e.g., care coordination, nutrition counseling, or psych osocial counseling) targeted toward specific risks (smoking, inadequate weight gain, psychosocial 24 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

For sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), a condition responsible for more infant deaths in the United States than any other cause of death during infancy beyond the neonatal period,38 maternal smoking during pregnancy has been identified as a major risk factor.39 Mothers who smoke during pregnancy are up to three times as likely to have a baby die from SIDS as mothers who are nonsmokers.40 Smoking during pregnancy nearly doubles a woman's risk of having a low -birth weight baby and increases the likelihood of prete rm delivery.41 According to the US Public Health Service, if all pregnant women in the U.S. stopped smoking there would be an estimated eleven percent (11 percent) drop in stillbirths and a five percent (5 percent) reduction in newborn deaths.42 Effective s moking cessation interventions are available,43 ranging from brief counseling interventions to long - term support programs, and have been shown to reduce preterm birth and low birth weights.44 Pregnant women who receive brief smoking cessation counseling are more likely to quit smoking.45 A combination of social support and rewards to reduce smoking during pregnancy has proven to be especially effective for high risk pregnant smokers.46 33 Ricketts, SA, Murray EK, Schwalberg R.

Tobacco Control, 9 (Supp III), iii67 -iii69. 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix I Delmarva Foundation A1-5 Alcohol and illicit drug use during pregnancy are significant and preventable risk factors for preterm birth/low birth weight, and infant mortality.47 Drinking alcohol during pregnancy increases the risk for miscarriage and premature birth and may be linked to stillbirth.48 Validated screening tools for identifying women f rom all racial and ethnic groups who might be consuming alcohol at risky levels are available.49 Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that interventions to reduce alcohol use in pregnant women are effective.50 A study of nearly 7000 pregnant women who were screened for alcohol and other drug use during routine prenatal care visits and received even a single brief intervention demonstrated a reduced rate of low birth weight and preterm infants51. In one study, pregnant women enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program who received education and cognitive -behavioral interventions were five times more likely to be abstinent by the third trimester and had fetal mortality rates one -third those of the contr ol group (0.9 percent compared to 2.9 percent).52 Contingency management has been successful at improving retention of pregnant women in illicit drug treatment programs and transiently reducing illicit drug use53 Even minimal drug interventions (such as met hadone maintenance) and counseling, combined with prenatal care, have resulted in improved pregnancy and infant outcomes.54 Effective means of reducing perinatal HIV transmission to less than two percent are available.55 For this reason, the CDC has recomme nded prenatal HIV testing for all pregnant women.56 Community outreach programs that include on -site HIV and pregnancy testing have been shown to be effective in increasing prenatal HIV testing.57 47 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Denominator Part 1: Include in the denominator of this rate all pregnancies that ended in the measurement year. NOTE 1 : All pregnancies (those that ended in a live birth as well as those that end in a miscarriage or fetal loss) are to be included in the denominator with the exception of ectopic pregnancies and pregnancies terminated through legally and illegally induced abortions. Although Collaborative members are aware that some miscarri ages early in pregnancy may not be amenable to intervention, for ease of measurement these pregnancies are included in the denominator. NOTE 2 : There is no continuous enrollment requirement for this measure. Pregnancies that ended in the measurement year are to be included in the denominator regardless of how long the woman was enrolled in the managed care plan prior to the end of the pregnancy. However, because limited enrollment in a managed care program or an individual health plan offers limited opportunities for intervention, data on the length of continuous enrollment of women whose pregnancies ended in the measurement year is also collected along with the rate of Adverse Perinatal Outcomes. NOTE 3: Use the procedure and diagnosis codes as written. If you think a code is missing or should be considered for inclusion in the measure, please submit the code to poynorl@dfmc.org . NOTE 4: Some analysts recommend running separate queries for each diagnosis, procedure or CPT code and then eliminating any duplicate counts of pregnancies. Calculating the Denominator - Part 1 Step 1: Identify all pregnancies that ended in the calendar year, excluding legally and illegally induced abortions and ectopic pregnancies. (Note: A pregnancy ending in multiple births is counted as one pregnancy. Two separate pregnancies ending in the measurement year are each counted in the deno minator). Pregnancies that ended are identified by a UB04 or CMS 1500 claim that has any of the following codes in any claim line and in any sequence; e.g., 1st claim line, 2nd claim line etc. 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix I Delmarva Foundation A1-7 Table 1: Diagnostic or Procedures Codes to Identify Pregnanci es that Ended (Denominator) Description ICD-9 -CM Diagnosis pregnancy 632 (missed abortion- early fetal death prior to 22 weeks) 634.xx (spontaneous (newborn care codes) *These services are coded to the newborn and should be used by the MCO only to identify a pregnancy of an enrolled woman not otherwise identified by other denominator codes. Step 2: Eliminate any duplicate pregnancies: If the data identifies the same pregnancy using more than procedure or diagnosis code, count the pregnancy only once. If the data shows a woman with > 1 delivery within an 8 -week period, count as one pregnancy. Denominator exclusions: Exclude from the denominator all pregnancies identified by the diagnosis and procedure codes specified in T able 2. Table 2: Denominator Exclusions Description ICD-9 -CM Diagnosis conception 631 Complications following abortion or ectopic pregnancy 639.x 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix I Delmarva Foundation A1-9 Calculating the Denominator - Part 2 The second part of the denominator is a count of all children ages 0 -365 days for any part of the measurement year, and who were enrolled in the health plan during the measurement year, regardless of length of enrollment. This second denominator is calculated by counting all children whose date of birth occurred between January 1, of the year prior to measurement year and December 31 of the measurement year (a two year period). Numerator Description Two corresponding numerators also are calculated. The first is the total number of the following adverse events associated with pregnancies included in the first denominator: 1) miscarriage or fetal loss (at any time during pregnancy) 2) neonates weighing <2,500 grams 3) neonates of 32 weeks or less gestational age 4) pregnancies for which the outcome is unknown 5) pregnancy during which NO maternal testing for HIV was performed. Note: A single pregnancy can be counted more than once in the numerator. For example, a woman who was never tested for HIV during her pregnancy and prior to delivery, and gives birth to twins at 30 weeks gestational age, each twin weighing less than 2,500 gra ms and one twin dying in the neonatal period is counted as six numerator events: No HIV test during pregnancy =1, plus two preterm infants, plus two low -birth-weight infants, plus one infant death between the age of 0 and 365 days = six (6) adverse events. Calculating the Numerator - Part 1 The first numerator includes two types of adverse events (i.e., adverse outcomes and adverse process of care). A separate step is used to identify each of these two types of numerator events. Step 1: Identify and Include Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in the Numerator. From the first denominator population, identify all pregnancies whose claim contained any of the following in any claim line and in any sequence; e.g., 1 st claim line, 2nd claim line etc. The total of all suc h Indicator events are included in the numerator. Table 3: Codes to Identify Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Numerator Events Description ICD-9-CM Diagnosis CPT Other Data Source Notes Adverse Event Indicator 1 Pregnancies resulting in miscarriage or fetal loss at any time 632 (missed abortion - early fetal death prior to 22 weeks) 656.40 (Intrauterine death) 656.41 (Intrauterine death delivered) 656.43 partum complications) 59812, 59820, 59821, 59830 Stillborn deliveries are also included in the report of each birth that plans send to DHCF, IMA and the Enrollment Broker within 10 business days of delivery in order to receive \"Kick This indicator excludes legally or illegally (635.xx, 636.xx) induced abortions, 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix I Delmarva Foundation A1-10 Description ICD-9-CM Diagnosis CPT Other least one live born and one stillborn) 634.xx (spontaneous abortion) 637.xx (unspecified abortion) Payments.\" Check these \"Kick Payment\" reports and include in the numerator any stillborn births reported that are not otherwise captured in the IC D diagnosis or procedure codes to the left. ectopic pregnancies (633xx, 761.4), abnormal products of conception (631) and hydatiform mole (630).

Step 2: Identify and Include in the Numerator Pregnancies in Which the Mother's HIV Status was not Determined Prior to the Admission Date for Delivery. From the denominator, identify all pregnancies whose ambulatory claim data prior to date of delivery included: 1) a procedure code/LOINC code for HIV testing59; 2) a diagnosis code for HIV or AIDs; or 3 ) a drug claim for an antiretroviral medication. NOTE: A claim for HIV testing during the inpatient stay for the delivery is not included. 58 The primary means of determining gestational age should be the interval between the first day of the mother's last normal menstrual period (LMP) and the date of birth. When the LMP dating appears to be inconsistent with the birth weight, as when normal weight births of apparently short gestations or very -low-birth weight births reported to be full term, the U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth allows the use of \"clinical estimat e of gestation.\" The clinical estimate of gestation should also be us ed when LMPs are not available. 59 Although the CDC's HIV screening guideline recommends testing twice during pregnancy (during the first and third trimesters), the measurement standard for the collaborative is only 1 HIV test per pregnancy. 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix I Delmarva Foundation A1-12 Table 4: Codes to Identify Testing or Identification of HIV Status Prior to Delivery Description ICD-9-CM Diagnosis CPT NDC Drug Codes Other Data Source*DC DOH HIV Registry or other administrative data that can be validated LOINC Codes Adverse Indicator 5 Pregnancies with evidence of Maternal testing for HIV, diagnosis of HIV prior to delivery, or use of antiretroviral medications ICD-9 codes for those with diagnoses of HIV or attached list of NDC codes Health plans can also supplement the identification of mothers whose HIV status was already known prior to delivery by reviewing clinical and / or administrative records of those women whose claims do not show testing for HIV or a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS. See attached list of LOINC codes Subtract the pregnancies whose am bulatory claim data included: 1) a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS prior to delivery; or 2) a code for HIV testing prior to delivery (refer to the LOINC code table for laboratory codes); or 3) an NDC code for antiretroviral medication prior to delivery from the d enominator total to produce the number of pregnancies during which NO determination of HIV status was performed prior to the delivery . Add these women (events) to the first numerator from Step 1. Calculating the Numerator - Part 2 From the second denominator, identify the number of infant deaths occurring among these infants : These infant deaths are identified as below: Description of Second Numerator: ICD-9-CM Diagnosis Other Infant death age 0-365 days 674.92, 674.9x ,674.90,) sudden infant death after delivery, cause not stated) 798.x (Cot, Crib death, sudden infant death syndrome) 779.9 (neonatal death) Review the MCO's Sentinel Event report and Death Reports to detect any cases of infant mortality in the first year of life (aged 0-365 days ) and include these deaths in the numerator. 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix I Delmarva Foundation A1-13 The number of infant deaths age zero to 365 days constitutes a second numerator. Calculating the Adverse Perinatal Outcome Rate The Adverse Perinatal Outcomes Rate is calculated by dividing the total of the two numerator events by the total of the two denominators: Total adverse

FINANCE IMPROVING ADVERSE OUTCOMES OF CHRONIC DISEASE MEASURE SPECIFICATION AND INSTRUCTIONS MY 2011 Chronic Disease Measure Specification The District of Columbia (DC) Collaborative to Improve Chronic Disease Outcomes is measuring changes in the health outcomes of individuals with asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure as part of a multiyear initiative to improve th e health of people in the DC Medicaid and Alliance programs who live with chronic diseases. This measure assesses health care outcomes, as opposed to certain aspects of the delivery (processes) of health care. The uni t of analysis is the DC Medicaid and Alliance managed care program as a whole, as opposed to individual managed care plans. Althoug h individual managed care plans that deliver service to DC Medicaid and Alliance members have and will continue to implement quality improvement (QI) initiatives to care for individuals with these diseases, and report the outcomes of these initiatives to t he DC Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF), individual managed care plan performance on the measure described below is not publicly reported. Thus, no risk adjustment is required, as is the case when health outcomes are compared across individual providers. The chronic care measure specifications used to gauge improvement in chronic disease outcomes of Medicaid and Alliance beneficiaries are outlined below. Measure Specifications TITLE: Adverse Outcomes of Chronic Disease DESCRIPTION : The rate of oc currence of emergency room visits and hospitalizations for Medicaid and Alliance managed care plan enrollees with any one, or combination, of the diagnoses of asthma, diabetes, hypertension, or congestive heart failure. The death rate of this population is also measured, separately. RATIONALE : Chronic diseases are ongoing, generally incurable illnesses or conditions. Some health services research has found that patients suffering from a number of chronic diseases can attain significant improvements in hea lth outcomes when health care is provided in accord with an explicit, evidence -based plan that includes systematic assessments, regular patient follow -up, provider care coordination, and attention to patient self -management needs. i Proper outpatient care h as the potential to reduce the rate of chronic disease exacerbations and complications and thereby reduce hospital utilization a s measured by rates of emergency department (ED) encounters and hospitalizations.ii This measure uses the rate of hospital and E D use by enrollees who have certain chronic diseases common in children and adults as a proxy indicator for chronic disease morbidity. In recognition of the fact that some ED and hospital use is appropriate and unavoidable, the rate of death among this population is also monitored so that if efforts to reduce hospital utilization rates have an unintended consequence of increasing death rates, this result is captured by the data. 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix II Delmarva Foundation A2-2 Asthma Multiple studies including randomized controlled trials have consistent ly shown that asthma is a readily treatable chronic condition that can be managed in the outpatient setting.iii Patient education with self -management support and regular medical review significantly reduces hospital admissions, emergency room visits, and unscheduled visits to the doctor. iv Adverse outcomes can be reduced in patients by using case management that includes good medical therapy, and patient and parent education and outreach. v Studies looking at reductions in risk of admission provide evidence th at inhaled steroid use may decrease risk of admission by 50 percent in adults. vi In one study, severely ill adult asthma patients given intensive illness self -management training and vigorous medical therapy had a two -fold decrease in hospital stays compare d with controls. vii Children who received asthma self -monitoring and management instruction, coordinated follow -up and environmental change interventions in a randomized controlled trial had significantly fewer unscheduled visits for asthma care during follow-up than controls. viii Another randomized controlled trial found children who received illness self -management education with or without enrollment in a nurse case -management program experienced 73 percent fewer ED visits and 84 percent fewer hospitalizations (with case -management) and 40 percent reduction in ED visits (with patient self -management alone). ix Using coordinated community care networks and case managers when needed, the state of North Carolina improved the quality of asthma care for its Medicaid recipients and decreased utilization of ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma (by 8 percent and 34 percent respectively) in the first year. x Relationship to Quality The causes for hospital admissions in patients with asthma are multi -factorial and may include: poor quality of care, lack of patient compliance, and problems accessing care. All of these factors may be addressed in a comprehensive health care delivery system such as a managed care program. Admission rates for asthma as a quality indicator has been tested and included as part of well -recognized national quality indicator measure sets.xi ED visits also are included in this measure in order to include patients who receive preventable asthma care in the hospital emergency room without being admi tted.xii Diabetes Diabetes is a chronic condition that can result in life -threatening short- term complications as a result of an excess of glucose (hyperglycemia) or insulin (hypoglycemia) and in long -term complications such as blindness, kidney failure, lo ss of limb, and heart disease. Long -term diabetes complications are thought to arise from poor control of diabetes over a sustained period. For both short- term and long -term complications, high quality outpatient care has been shown to lead to reductions i n hospitalizations. xiii At least two randomized controlled trials demonstrate that chronic care intervention (self -management support, individualized goal setting, regular follow -up, and provider decision support) resulted in significant lowering of cardiovas cular disease risk factors (HbA1c, blood pressure and cholesterol levels), xiv and/or significant reductions in emergency room visits. xv 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix II Delmarva Foundation A2-3 In an analysis of hospital utilization rates among 18,404 adult Medicaid recipients receiving primary care at eight differe nt clinics, having had any type of educational visit for diabetes self -care was associated with 9.18 fewer hospitalizations per 100 person years and $11,571 less in hospital charges per person after adjusting for other variables. xvi In a study designed to as sess the impact of improved glycemic control on diabetic complications in managed care patients, patients with better glycemic control experienced reduced hospital admissions for both acute and chronic diabetic complications and corresponding reductions in mean adjusted hospital costs. xvii The United Kingdom prospective diabetes study (UKPDS) provided evidence that intensive blood glucose control with sulfonylureas or insulin was superior to traditional (mainly diet) management of patients with type II diabete s; both the number and duration of hospitalizations were reduced because of lower complication rates among intensively treated patients compared to controls. Treatment included combination medication therapies in addition to diet and self management and mo nitoring. xviii A systematic review of 26 studies addressing diabetes self -management training and education found that more than half (18) were associated with decreased cost, cost saving, cost -effectiveness or positive return on investment; xix Intensive diabete s therapy reduces the risk of development of microalbuminuria and progression to kidney disease people with type I and type II diabetes. xx In a review of studies in which elements of the chronic care model were employed, 19 out of 20 interventions improved a process or outcome of care.xxi Relationship to Quality Hospital admission rates for short- term or long -term complications of diabetes may be the result of poor quality medical care, noncompliance of patients, lack of education, or access to care. Because proper outpatient treatment and adherence to care may reduce the incidence of long -term diabetic complications, admission rates for diabetic emergencies and for long - term diabetic complications are included in well -established sets of prevention quality in dicators.xxii Congestive Heart Failure Congestive heart failure is a chronic progressive disorder which can be controlled in an outpatient setting for the most part, but for which some hospitalizations are appropriate. Analysis of data from 10 randomized clinical trials of care management programs for heart failure carried out in the United States, Australia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, found that hospital readmissions could be reduced by 25 percent and total readmission days by 30 percent when ca re management methods included a multi -disciplinary team approach and in -person communication with patients. xxiii Randomized controlled trials demonstrate 30 - 56 percent reduction in hospital readmissions for congestive heart failure xxiv and 18 percent reductio n in mortality when chronic care model interventions (i.e., patient education with home visit follow -up post hospitalization) are used.xxv Self-management interventions alone can result in significant reductions in all -cause hospital readmissions and heart failure readmission with reported cost savings ranging from $1,300 to $7,515 per patient per year; however, this study found the effect on mortality is not significant. xxvi 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix II Delmarva Foundation A2-4 Relationship to Quality High admission rates for congestive heart failure may reflect problems with poor quality care, poor patient compliance with care, or problems accessing care. Because hospital admission rates for congestive heart failure have been shown to respond to interventions such as the use of protocols for ambulatory management of low -severity patients and facilitation of access to outpatient care, hospital admission rates for congestive heart failure has been adopted by the Institute of Medicine as a \"Priority Area for National Action\" and is included in their 2003 publication \"Transforming Health Care Quality\"xxvii. Hypertension Patients with hypertension are at risk for stroke, heart disease and other cardiovascular problems such as kidney failure, impotence, and problems with poor blood supply to the feet and legs. The decrease in life expectancy for persons with high blood pressure is 5.1 years for men and 4.9 years for women. xxviii Hypertension is being increasingly recognized in children and adolescents with approximately 5 percent of children and adolescents having essential hype rtension.xxix At least one large randomized clinical trial using the chronic care model has demonstrated a 17 percent reduction in all - cause mortality when chronic care elements are incorporated into care. xxx Antihypertensive therapy is associated with a 35 to 40 percent reduction in stroke incidence, 20 to 25 percent reduction in heart attack and a more than 50 percent reduction in heart failure. xxxi Based on results of a large study, reducing blood pressure by 5 mmHg is estimated to decrease deaths due to stroke by 14 percent, death due to coronary heart disease by 9 percent and death from all causes by 7 percent. xxxii Early detection and control of hypertension has been shown to slow the onset and progression of renal failure due to high blood pressure. xxxiii Relationship to Quality Appropriate outpatient care is often successful in controlling hypertension and may lower rates of ED visits and hospitalizations for hypertension. Outpatient management of hypertension has been adopted by the Institute of Medicine as a \"Prior ity Area for National Action\" and is included in its 2003 publication \"Transforming Health Care Quality.\"xxxiv Denominator Description Include in the denominator of this rate all enrollees with one or more of the following diagnoses during the measurement year: diabetes, asthma, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. NOTE: There is no continuous enrollment requirement for inclusion in the denominator. A member is identified as having a diagnosis of diabetes, asthma, congestive heart failure, or hyper tension by the presence of at least one specific diagnosis code on any claim or encounter form generated from at least one ambulatory care or ED visit or inpatient stay. An enrollee with any of these codes should be counted only once in the denominator. Note 1: Coding to identify enrollees with the diagnoses of interest and to identify exclusions is based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ's) Prevention Quality Indicators set.xxxv This indicator set was chosen for two reasons: 1) it is designed to be calculated using routinely collected, readily available hospital administrative data, and 2) it is 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix II Delmarva Foundation A2-5 widely used by other states, which indicates its feasibility and facilitates meaningful comparisons with national and regiona l data. Note 2 : Use the procedure and diagnosis codes as written. If you think a code is missing or should be considered for inclusion in the measure, please submit the code to poynorl@dfmc.org Calculating the Denominator Step 1: Identify all individuals with any of the conditions of interest. Identify all enrollees in the indicated age categories during the measurement year with a UB04 or CMS 1500 claim or encounter form containing any of the diagnosis codes listed in Table 1 in any position, in any claim line and in any sequence; e.g., 1st claim line, 2nd claim line etc. Step 2: Eliminate duplicates. Any individual identified more than once because more than one claim contained any combination of the codes above should be counted only once in the denominator population. The denominator consists of all individuals identified in Step 1 (counted only once, per Step 2). Table 1.

Visits or hospitalizations are identified by claim/encounter data generated from the institution providing care to Medicaid and Alliance members. Note: Numerator events (i.e., ED visits and hospital admissions) may occur multiple times for a single individual. When this occurs, each ED visit and hospitalization is counted separately. For example, an individual identified in the denominator 2012 Annual Technical Report Appendix II Delmarva Foundation A2-7 might have three ED visits and two hospitalizations during the measurement year. This person would be counted once in the denominator, but account for five numerator events. Calculating the Numerator Step 1. Identify all enrollees in the denominator who had one or more emergency visits or inpatient stays. From the denominator, identify all enrollees with a claim/encounter containing any of the codes in Table 2 in any claim line and in any sequence; e.g., 1st claim line, 2nd claim line etc. Table 2.

For example, review of 15 Medicare demonstration projects designed to measure the effect of care coordination by itself on hospital utilization, found that the two projects that were judged to have the potential to generate savings from less frequent hospitalizations had important attributes not found in the other studies: first the care coordinators interacted in person with patients, not by telephone, and second the care coordinators collaborated closely with patients' physic ians, most often by being located in the physicians' offices.
