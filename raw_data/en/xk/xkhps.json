Spring has officially sprung! One of my favourite ways to welcome the new season is with an annual deep clean. There's no better feeling than coming home to a clean house, especially one that has been scrubbed and polished using 100% non-toxic ingredients. Spring is such a great opportunity to give your home some extra TLC, so I figured what better time to provide you with some of my best tips and tricks to when it comes to creating a clean environment to live in. To get into the cleaning zone, I'll turn on some good music, get my diffuser going, and set out all of my cleaning tools and supplies that I'll need for the day. My favourites are listed below! I also like to keep a list of all the things I want to deep clean in the house. I usually have an idea of what I want to get done, but I'll always keep my checklist close by because some things are easy to forget! Plus, next to having a clean home, nothing beats the satisfaction of checking things off your to-do list haha. I find it so satisfying, and it always motivates me to finish every single task! Whether it's a [Roomba](http://amzn.to/2u76NAh) , [Swiffer Roomba](https://amzn.to/3bfi3eu), or a [Dyson, ](https://amzn.to/394iuXC)you need one of these powerful machines to keep floors clean and allergies at bay. I love this vacuum because not only is it cordless and lightweight, but it also comes a set of attachments that allows you to easily access dirt and grime trapped deep inside all areas of your home! It's a bit of an investment, but I promise you it's worth every penny. Have you ever used a fabric cleaner? If not, prepared to be amazed! I've been using [this one](https://amzn.to/307CNmQ) for years, and I love it. I fill up the base with hot water, add in a capful of all-natural household cleaner, and start cleaning all of the fabrics in my home. From cushions, rugs, couches, or even dog beds, this fabric cleaner has you covered! Plus, dumping out the dirty water at the end is so satisfying, haha. Out of all of the cleaning tools we use, this one is by far my favourite. This [steam mop](https://amzn.to/38Cw31J) deep cleans and disinfects all surfaces in your home using hot water. Not only is it efficient and useful, but it's also eco-friendly because the fabric is machine washable! Of course, you can buy replacements and rotate them, but I just love the fact that it cleans without producing any waste. Once I fill the steam mop with water, I like to add a capful my [Thieves Household Cleaner](https://www.healthnutnutrition.ca/essential-oils/) for an extra deep clean. Then, I'll put a few drops of [essential oils ](https://www.healthnutnutrition.ca/essential-oils/)directly on the mop for delicious smell without using any artificial fragrances, and away we go! It works on tiles, wood floors, and laminates, and it has different settings to customize whatever part of the house you're cleaning. If you don't yet have a detail cleaning brush, you need one! It's seriously like a toothbrush on overdrive, haha. [This Micro-Manager](https://bit.ly/3ahuXbK) never misses a detail, whether it be lurking around your sink drain, your faucet, or even on kitchen appliances. I love this two-in-one tool because it has a flexible pointed nib for removing hidden gunk, and a scrub brush that keeps all surfaces sparkling. Plus, it's non-toxic and BPA free! There's nothing cleaning without getting your hands dirty, am I right?! I love these [natural latex cleaning gloves](http://bit.ly/2IbcaVi) because they combat muck while keeping your hands dry and clean. They're super soft and designed for comfort and protection from hot water. From kitchens and baths to mudrooms and more - this sturdy pair goes the distance in style! Let's just say, my spring cleaning routine wouldn't be the same without these [walnut scrubbing sponges](http://bit.ly/2X1h4aY). They're effective, durable and they won't scratch any surfaces! They're made out of walnut shells and an absorbent plant-based, biodegradable cellulose sponge - which is how they got their name. Cool right? I use these most to clean the kitchen (hello dirty sink!), but feel free to use them on any surface that could use a good scrub. These multi-use and biodegradable sponge clothes are a perfect way clean any surface using an all-purpose cleaner!
