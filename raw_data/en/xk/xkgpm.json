When you emerge, you might not be the same person as before.' Androulla, experienced late effects of breast cancer treatmentAbout this booklet 1 About this booklet This booklet is about the possible long-term or late effects of breast cancer treatment. These are side effects that continue for 6 months or longer after treatment, or delayed side effects that develop months or years after treatment. In this booklet, we use the term late effects to describe long-term and late effects. The booklet is for anyone who has late effects of breast cancer treatment. The booklet describes the possible effects of treatment and how they can be improved or managed. It also includes information on positive lifestyle changes, which can help reduce the risk of developing some late effects. There is also information about coping with some of the sexual and emotional difficulties that you may experience. Although this booklet is written for women, some of the information may help men who have late effects of breast cancer treatment. Breast cancer in men is rare. We have more information about this in our booklet Understanding breast cancer in men (see page 110). However, treatments for breast cancer are similar for men and women. So men may also experience some of the side effects described in this booklet. If you have late effects, we hope this booklet will help you know who can help you and what can be done. It also suggests some positive ways to help yourself.2 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment How to use this booklet The booklet is split into sections to help you find what you need. You do not have to read it from start to finish. You can use the contents list on page 5 to help you. It is fine to skip parts of the booklet. You can always come back to them when you feel ready. At the end of this booklet, there are details of other organisations that can help (see pages 115 to 124). If you find this booklet helpful, you could pass it on to your family and friends. They may also want information to help them support you. Quotes We have included quotes from people affected by the late effects of breast cancer treatment, which you may find helpful.

This is used to plan and improve health and care services. Your hospital will usually give this information to the registry automatically. There are strict rules to make sure the information is kept safely and securely. It will only be used for your direct care or for health and social care planning and research. Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions. If you do not want your information included in the registry, you can contact the cancer registry in your country to opt out. You can find more information at macmillan.org.uk/cancerregistryContents 5 Contents Late effects and breast cancer treatment 7 Breast and arm changes 15 Other physical effects 33 Fertility, sexuality and the menopause 63 Effects on concentration and memory 85 Your feelings and relationships 91 Getting help and support 99 Further information 109Late effects and breast cancer tre at m e n t Long-term and late effects 8 Talking to your doctor 9 Side effects from breast cancer treatments 118 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Long-term and late effects Most women have side effects during treatment for breast cancer and for a few weeks after treatment ends. Usually, these side effects get better slowly and then stop. But sometimes side effects do not go away. Or they can develop months or years after treatment. There are two commonly used terms for these side effects: long-term effects late effects. Long-term effects begin during, or shortly after, treatment. They last for more than 6 months after treatment has finished. They may go away on their own, with symptoms getting better over 1 or 2 years after treatment. Or they may be permanent. Late effects are a delayed reaction to treatment. They do not appear during treatment, but can happen months or even years later. In this information, we use the term late effects to describe both long-term and late effects. There are many things that can be done to manage or treat late effects. It is important that you do not feel you have to cope with them without getting help. Late effects may be minor and not affect your daily life much. Or, they may be more difficult to live with and affect your daily life more. There are usually a lot of things that can help you cope with them to live life as well as you can. This information talks more about ways to cope. Some late effects improve over time and may eventually go away on their own. Late effects and breast cancer treatment 9 Talking to your doctor If treatment side effects do not go away after treatment, or if you develop late effects, always let your cancer doctor or specialist nurse know. Give your doctor as much information as you can about your side effects. The more they know, the better they can help you. You may feel embarrassed talking about urinary problems or difficulties with your sex life. But doctors and nurses are used to having these conversations, so there is no need to worry. Some late effects may be similar to the symptoms you had when you were first diagnosed. This can be scary, and you may worry the cancer has come back. The breast care team will assess your symptoms. They will explain whether they could be caused by treatment. They will also talk to you about what can be done to manage them. You may be referred to a doctor who specialises in the late effects of treatment. Sometimes symptoms are caused by other conditions not related to the cancer or its treatment. Your doctor may arrange tests to find out more about the cause of your symptoms. 10 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Remember that you can contact your specialist nurse if you have any concerns. This is true even if you no longer have follow-up appointments with a doctor. You can also contact your GP. You may need support from your family, friends or a support organisation (see pages 115 to 124). You can also talk to one of our cancer support specialists on 0808 808 00 00 . ' After my treatment ended, I felt like a watered down version of myself. Aside from the physical changes to my body, I felt I had changed.' AndroullaLate effects and breast cancer treatment 11 Side effects from breast cancer treatments The main treatments for breast cancer are: surgery radiotherapy chemotherapy hormonal therapy targeted therapies. Surgery and radiotherapy Surgery and radiotherapy to the breast, especially involving the armpit, can cause: pain in the breast, chest, arm and shoulder limited movement of the shoulder or arm swelling of the arm or breast (lymphoedema - see pages 28 to 31). Women who have had part of the breast removed and have had radiotherapy may find the treated breast shrinks slightly over time. If this happens, the breasts will be different sizes. 12 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Chemotherapy Chemotherapy may cause: an early menopause (see pages 73 to 83) changes in sensation, such as pins and needles or numbness in your hands and feet (see pages 21 to 22). Hormonal therapies Hormonal therapies can cause: side effects similar to menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis - see pages 47 to 51) joint pain (see pages 53 to 54) vaginal bleeding. Other treatments Bisphosphonates (bone strengthening drugs) can cause problems with the teeth and jaw. Targeted therapy drugs such as trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae) and some chemotherapy drugs can cause changes in the way the heart works.Late effects and breast cancer treatment 13 Other changes Cancer treatments can also cause more general changes in how you feel. You may: be more tired than usual for several months after treatment (see pages 34 to 39) have difficulty concentrating or remembering things (see pages 86 to 89). These effects are usually mild and get better over time. But some can be permanent. Treatments for breast cancer are constantly improving. Better treatments mean that women are now living for longer. As treatments develop, we are learning more about late effects and how they can be managed. Doctors and researchers are trying to make sure people get the best treatment for them, with as few side effects as possible. 'After the last radiotherapy appointment, I have had regular check-ups. I am feeling good. I still get tired, but I am staying busy and just getting on with things.' ZoeWhat changes might happen? 16 Changes to the appearance of the breast 17 Pain and changes in sensation 21 Movement and strength in your arm and shoulder 23 Cording 26 Lymphoedema 28Breast and arm cha ng e s16 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment What changes might happen? Surgery and radiotherapy to the breast can cause a number of changes. These can include: changes to the appearance of the breast pain and changes in sensation problems with movement or strength swelling of the arm (lymphoedema), if the armpit is treated. Always let your cancer doctor or specialist nurse know if you have any of these symptoms. They can give you advice on the different ways that these effects can be managed. Your doctor may also refer you to other specialists who can help.Breast and arm changes 17 Changes to the appearance of the breast Changes caused by surgery After any type of breast cancer surgery there will be a scar. The amount of scarring will depend on the type of surgery you have and how well it heals. Most scars fade with time and become less obvious. Stretching and massaging the scar area every day during the first year after surgery can help to reduce scarring. Ask your cancer doctor or specialist nurse for more advice. Women who have a breast removed (mastectomy) may find it hard to accept the change in their appearance. It may change how you feel about yourself (your body image) and affect your sex life. It may also result in problems with depression. Some women choose to have breast reconstruction. You may need support adjusting to the changes. Having only a small part of the breast removed (wide local excision) will cause fewer changes in the appearance of the breast. This may be easier to adjust to. We have booklets about body image and cancer, the emotional effects of cancer, and breast reconstruction. See page 110 for ways to order.18 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Breast reconstruction Breast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape after a mastectomy. It is also sometimes used to improve the shape of the breast after a wide local excision. After breast reconstruction, there are sometimes dents or irregularities in the outline (contour) of the new breast. It may be possible to fill in these dents using fat cells removed from the tummy area (abdomen) or thighs. This technique is called lipomodelling. The fat cells are removed using gentle liposuction. The whole fat cells are then separated and injected into the breast. For some women, breast reconstruction can help to restore self-confidence and feelings of femininity and sexual attractiveness. There is not a time or age limit on when the operation should be done. But you will need to be fit enough for the surgery. Many women have reconstruction years after their initial breast operation. Your cancer doctor or specialist nurse can discuss this with you. They can also arrange a referral to a specialist breast cancer surgeon or a plastic surgeon.Breast and arm changes 19 Changes caused by radiotherapy Colour After radiotherapy, the skin of the breast may change colour. It may become darker with a blue or black tinge. It may also be more sensitive. It is important to protect the area from strong sunlight by covering up with clothes or using a suncream with a high sun protection factor (SPF). Blood vessels Sometimes blood vessels under the skin can become dilated. This is called telangiectasia. It can cause lots of thin red lines. This changes how the breast looks, but it should not cause any other problems. Rarely, prominent blood vessels in the skin of the breast or chest can be a sign of more serious conditions. Always talk to your doctor about any changes. Appearance and size After radiotherapy, some women develop a hardening or thickening of the breast tissue. This is called fibrosis. The breast may also shrink slightly over time. This can cause the breast to become harder and smaller than it was. Breast shrinkage is worse in women who smoke. Your doctor may strongly advise you to give up smoking. Sometimes after radiotherapy, the breast may be red and swollen. This usually goes back to normal over a few weeks or months. If you notice changes to the appearance or feel of your breast, it is best to have them checked by your doctor or specialist nurse.20 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Breasts often get bigger with age or weight gain. But if you have had radiotherapy, the treated breast will not always grow to match the other breast. Keeping to a healthy weight can help the breasts stay more the same size. If the breasts are very different sizes, some people choose to have surgery to reduce the size of the larger breast. The size of the treated breast can also be increased, using fat injections. Your cancer doctor or specialist nurse can tell you more about this. Some people choose to use a partial breast prosthesis (shell) to help make the breasts look more even under clothing. A breast prosthesis is an artificial silicone insert. It fits over the smaller breast and can be worn inside one side of a bra. Breast Cancer Care has information on different kinds of prostheses. You can find their contact details on page 115. Breast and arm changes 21 Pain and changes in sensation Changes caused by surgery Surgery can cause changes in sensation in the chest area, the armpit, and the shoulder and arm on the affected side. These can include: sharp, shooting or burning pain aching pain sensitivity to touch or to the cold numbness or pins and needles. These symptoms happen because the nerves in the chest area or armpit are cut or injured during surgery. These symptoms are common, particularly after surgery to remove all the lymph nodes in the armpit. Symptoms usually improve with time, but in some cases they may take months or years to get better. If you have an aching in the breast, wearing a supportive sports bra during the day and a soft bra with no underwire at night may help. You may find that bras with adjustable straps, soft seams and full cups are more comfortable. We have a booklet called Managing cancer pain that you may find helpful (see page 110). 22 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Describing your symptoms clearly will help your doctor to prescribe the right painkiller for you. Simple painkillers such as paracetamol, or anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, can often control the pain. But if you have nerve pain (shooting or burning pain), you may need other types of painkillers. Changes caused by radiotherapy Very rarely, radiotherapy to treat breast cancer can damage the nerves in the shoulder. This is called brachial plexus neuropathy. It can cause problems with pain and numbness. In extreme cases it can cause loss of movement. As radiotherapy techniques have improved, this problem is now very rare. Although this condition cannot be reversed, the symptoms can be improved with drug treatment and physiotherapy. Physiotherapy involves doing exercises to strengthen the muscles and keep them supple. The physiotherapist will also be able to show you how to use slings or splints to support your arm, if needed. If you are unable to work because of damage to your arm, you may be entitled to some benefits. Our booklet Your rights at work when you are affected by cancer may be helpful. We also have a booklet called Working while caring for someone with cancer that might be helpful. See page 110 for ways to order these. Breast and arm changes 23 Movement and strength in your arm and shoulder Radiotherapy and surgery, especially to the armpit, can affect the range of movement and strength in your arm or shoulder. This may change your ability to do everyday activities, such as household tasks or your work. It may also interfere with some types of exercise, such as swimming or tennis. After breast surgery, a physiotherapist usually gives you exercises that will help you recover shoulder movement. Doing these will help your arm and shoulder movement slowly improve after treatment.24 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Tips to help improve movement and strength See a physiotherapist Ask your doctor to refer you to a physiotherapist. They will assess you and show you some exercises to improve movement and strength. If your problems continue, the physiotherapist may be able to give you different exercises. Having good posture is also important. Your physiotherapist can give you advice on this. Tell your doctor if you have pain Talk to your doctor if you have pain. Problems with pain may mean that you are not using your arm or shoulder properly. This can make things worse. Your doctor can also prescribe painkillers to help improve movement and relieve stiffness. Relax your muscles before exercise Take painkillers half an hour before you exercise, or have a warm bath. This can help relax your muscles. If you still cannot do your exercises, or you find them painful, then stop. Avoid doing things that cause pain If it hurts to reach out and lift or carry heavy things with the affected arm and shoulder, avoid doing these things. Use a shopping trolley instead of a basket, shop online and get heavy things delivered. Try to make sure that objects you use often are low down and easy to reach. See an occupational therapist If you are having difficulty doing daily tasks, ask your doctor to refer you to an occupational therapist (OT). They can assess your needs and suggest aids or equipment to help you.Breast and arm changes 25 Accept offers of help Let people know what kind of practical help you need. They could help you with things like shopping, taking the rubbish out or mowing the lawn. Ask about complementary therapies Complementary therapies such as relaxation or deep breathing exercises may be helpful. Ask your doctor, nurse or physiotherapist for advice on these. We also have a booklet called Cancer and complementary therapies that may be helpful (see page 110). 'You do start very slowly getting back to your fitness levels but it is also psychological. You have to get out of that bubble, get back into the world again and see other people. It is also about realising what you can do.' Jill26 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Cording After surgery to remove lymph nodes in the armpit, some women develop cord-like structures under the skin on the inner arm. This is called cording or axillary web syndrome. We do not know exactly why cording happens. It is thought to be caused by inflammation and scarring of the tissues that surround the lymph vessels, blood vessels and nerves. Cording is fairly common in women who have had most of the lymph nodes removed from the underarm. This is called an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). It happens less to women who have had just 1 or 2 lymph nodes removed in a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). You may be able to see or feel the cords when you lift your arm to shoulder height or above your head. There may be one thick cord or several smaller cords. They can cause a painful sensation and tightness that can reduce the range of movement of your arm and shoulder. This can affect your ability to do many daily activities. Cording may develop within a few days of surgery, but it can develop a few weeks after surgery. Sometimes it appears many months later. Breast and arm changes 27 Managing cording It is important to keep your arm and shoulder moving when you have cording. This helps prevent further tightness, which can cause more serious problems with movement. The following tips may help: Ask your doctor to refer you to a physiotherapist. They can teach you exercises to gently stretch the cords and improve movement. Your specialist nurse may also be able to help you. Gentle massage to the area may help reduce pain and tightness. Your physiotherapist or specialist nurse may do this for you. They can also show you how to do it yourself. Apply a warm, moist heat pad. The physiotherapist may do this for you. It is important not to use it for too long each time, as heat can increase the risk of lymphoedema (see pages 28 to 31). If you have pain that stops you moving the arm and shoulder, ask your doctor for some painkillers. They may give you an anti-inflammatory painkiller, such as ibuprofen. Cording usually gets better slowly over a few months. But it can last longer. Sometimes it can come back, but this is rare. If the cording continues, surgery can sometimes be done to improve symptoms. 28 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Lymphoedema Lymphoedema (swelling) of the arm, hand, or breast, can develop at any time after treatment for breast cancer. Surgery to remove the lymph nodes in the armpit, or radiotherapy to the nodes, can change the way that lymph fluid drains from the arm. Lymphoedema is more likely to happen if you have had all or many of your lymph nodes removed, and have also had radiotherapy to the armpit. It usually develops gradually. It can develop months or years after treatment. If you have had just 1 or 2 of the lymph nodes removed (a sentinel lymph node biopsy), the risk of getting lymphoedema is low. If you are not sure about what type of lymph node surgery you have had, your specialist nurse can tell you. We have a booklet called Understanding lymphoedema that you may find helpful (see page 110). 'I do exercises on the affected breast to move the fluid onto the good side, where it drains away as normal.' SukiBreast and arm changes 29 Reducing the risk of lymphoedema It is thought that some things may cause swelling in someone who is at risk of developing lymphoedema. For example, overuse of a limb may cause inflammation. Having a skin infection may also increase the risk. The following things could help reduce the risk of infection and help prevent lymphoedema. If you already have lymphoedema, following this advice may stop it getting worse. Look after your skin It is very important to keep your skin clean and well moisturised. This reduces the risk of inflammation and infection. It is also important to protect your skin from cuts and grazes, insect bites and sunburn. Look out for early signs of infection See your GP immediately if you develop any signs of infection. Signs may include having a high temperature, or your limb becoming red, hot or swollen. Try to keep active Regular exercise and physical activity will help encourage lymph fluid to drain. Ask your physiotherapist or nurse for advice about exercise. 30 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Keep to a healthy weight The risk of lymphoedema is higher if you are overweight. Your GP can tell you what your ideal weight should be. You can also ask your GP or a dietitian for advice and support on eating healthily. Take care when travelling It can help to use a suitcase on wheels so you do not have to carry a heavy bag. Protect your skin from the sun by covering up with clothes or using suncream with a high sun protection factor (SPF). Use an insect repellent to prevent bites. Avoid getting travel vaccinations in the affected arm. Avoid injections Avoid having any injections or blood taken from the affected arm. Treating and managing lymphoedema Lymphoedema is a long-term condition but the earlier it is diagnosed, the more effective and straightforward treatment is. If you notice any swelling in your arm or chest, always get it checked by your doctor or nurse. If lymphoedema is diagnosed, you will be referred to a specialist lymphoedema nurse, breast care nurse, doctor or physiotherapist for an assessment. You may be seen at a specialist lymphoedema centre. Treatment aims to reduce and control swelling, relieve discomfort and prevent more build-up of fluid.Breast and arm changes 31 Treating lymphoedema involves: skin care to prevent injury and infection exercises including limb positioning and movement to help drain fluid support using compression sleeves or bandages that help stop fluid from building up self-massage or a specialised type of massage called manual lymphatic drainage. 'I have a glove and a sleeve, and the lymphoedema nurse showed me daily self-drainage exercises that help. It is another thing to cope with but it is a question of keeping it under control and being careful about scratches and insect bites.' ZelieAdrienne 'I wasn't a patient anymore, but I wasn't the 'me' I was before the cancer and treatment.' AndroullaOther physical effects Tiredness or fatigue 34 Effects on the heart 40 Effects on the lungs 45 Effects on the bones 47 Effects on the joints 52 Weight gain 55 Peripheral neuropathy 57 Diabetes 6134 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Tiredness or fatigue Tiredness is probably the most common side effect of breast cancer treatment. It is common for tiredness to last for months after treatment is over. For some people, it may last for 1 or 2 years. Some people feel very tired and exhausted most, or all of the time. This is known as fatigue. Some of the more common effects of fatigue include: difficulty doing simple things, such as brushing your hair or getting dressed feeling you have no energy or strength difficulty concentrating and remembering things (see pages 86 to 89) difficulty thinking, speaking or making decisions feeling breathless after light activity feeling dizzy or lightheaded difficulty sleeping (insomnia) losing interest in sex (see pages 69 to 72) feeling low in mood and more emotional than usual. Fatigue can affect the way you think and feel. Even things you usually enjoy, such as reading or watching TV, can be difficult. We have a booklet called Coping with fatigue that you may find helpful (see page 110).Other physical effects 35 You may find fatigue affects your relationships. You may need to rest more, meaning you might spend less time with friends and family. Or you may avoid going out or being with friends because it makes you very tired. But there are things you can do to improve fatigue. Possible causes Recovering from cancer treatments can take time. For some people, tiredness continues while they are taking hormonal therapies. Hormonal therapies may be given for several years. Sometimes fatigue is also related to problems such as: depression sleep problems pain anaemia thyroid problems. The most important thing is to tell your doctor or nurse how you are feeling. Do not pretend everything is okay. Tell them what your fatigue is like when it is at its worst.36 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment It is important to find out if there is a particular cause of your fatigue. This will help you find a suitable treatment. Your doctor can take blood samples to find out if you have anaemia (a low number of red blood cells), or to find out if your thyroid gland is underactive. Both these conditions can be treated with medicines. Fatigue is a common symptom of depression. It is not unusual to feel depressed, anxious or stressed after treatment for cancer. If you think you are depressed, talk to your doctor or nurse. You and your doctor will be able to work out if your fatigue is caused by depression. Your doctor can then refer you to a counsellor to help you with how you are feeling. They may also prescribe antidepressants. Sleep problems or pain may be causing your fatigue or making it worse. Improving these will help you feel better. Coping with pain is tiring and affects the quality of your sleep. Always let your doctor or nurse know if you have pain that is not controlled. 'They got me to keep a fatigue diary. You record your tiredness and write a note about your activity. It helps identify the things that make you tired'. RonniOther physical effects 37 Tips to help with fatigue Keep to a normal sleep routine Going to sleep at the same time every evening and waking up at the same time every morning can help. Try not to sleep late into the day, even after a sleepless night. Eat a healthy diet Eat as healthily as possible. This can help you feel better. It may also give you more energy. Get support Accept help from family, friends and carers. They will usually be happy to help. It is useful if you can tell them exactly what would help you most. You could make a list of tasks you would like help with. This could include practical help such as taking out the rubbish, or things like setting up direct debits to pay bills. If you have internet access, you could do grocery shopping online and have it delivered. Keep active Regular exercise can help to reduce fatigue and increase your energy levels. It can also help you sleep better and can improve anxiety and depression. If you have not been very active in the past or for a long time, it is best to start slowly. Try to get a balance between being active and getting some rest. You could start by going for short walks and gradually build up. We have a booklet called Physical activity and cancer that can help you get started (see page 110). 38 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Ask your doctor about complementary therapies Complementary therapies may help to reduce stress and anxiety, and may improve fatigue. Relaxation, counselling and psychological support are available at many cancer treatment centres. Find ways to cope with concentration problems Problems with concentration and memory are common when you have fatigue. This can be frustrating to deal with. But there are ways of coping with concentration and memory problems. See pages 86 to 89 for more information. Talk to your children If you have children, it can be difficult to cope when you are feeling very tired. You may sometimes feel that you are letting your family down. It might help to explain to your children that you feel tired often and will not be able to do as much with them as before. Try to plan activities with them that you can do sitting down. If they are old enough, you could involve them in some household tasks. Ask for and accept help from people you trust to help look after your children sometimes. For example, they might be able to take them to and from school or childcare. Our booklet Talking to children and teenagers when an adult has cancer may also be useful (see page 110).Other physical effects 39 Talk to your employer You might find that you cannot carry on working or that you need to reduce your hours. There may be things that your employer can do to help. This may be changing your hours or making other reasonable adjustments. If your job is physical, they might be able to find you lighter work within your role. 'I finished treatment a year ago and struggled with fatigue. It is a balance between getting exercise and not doing too much. It gradually improved. I have a strategy now.' Ronni40 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Effects on the heart Some treatments for breast cancer may increase the risk of developing heart problems, usually many years later. Most people will never experience any effects on the heart. But it may help to understand more about how you can take care of your heart. The most important risk factor for developing heart problems is pre-existing heart disease, including high blood pressure. Women at risk are carefully monitored before and during their treatment to find out if their treatment needs to be changed. We have a booklet called Heart health and cancer treatment that you may find helpful (see page 110). Chemotherapy The standard chemotherapy treatment for early breast cancer usually includes drugs known as anthracyclines. For example, you may be given drugs like epirubicin or doxorubicin. Research shows that these drugs are good at reducing the risk of breast cancer coming back. In a small number of people, treatment with anthracyclines may cause slight damage to the heart muscle. Because these changes are small, they usually do not cause any symptoms straight away. But they may lead to an increased risk of developing heart problems much later in life.Other physical effects 41 Radiotherapy Radiotherapy to the chest has a very small risk of damaging the heart muscle, or the major blood vessels around the heart. This can only happen if you had treatment to the left breast. This is because the heart is on the left side of the chest. Radiotherapy is now very carefully planned so that the heart is either completely outside the area being treated with radiation, or only a small part of the heart is inside the treatment area. This means the risk of developing any heart problems is now very low. Hormonal therapy Hormonal therapy drugs, called aromatase inhibitors, may increase the risk of high cholesterol. This can cause heart problems. An early menopause Having an early menopause because of your treatment may increase the risk of heart problems. This is because oestrogen and progesterone help protect the heart. 42 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Targeted therapy Trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae) can cause changes in the way the heart works, particularly in women who already have heart disease. This means you are not given this drug if you have a certain type of heart condition. You have tests before treatment to check your heart. You also have regular tests throughout and after treatment. If heart problems happen during treatment with trastuzumab, they are usually temporary. This means they improve with medication and get better after treatment finishes. Possible symptoms Possible symptoms of heart problems include: feeling your heart beating fast, hard or irregularly pain or discomfort in your chest getting breathless, for example when climbing stairs feeling weak or dizzy getting tired very easily swollen feet and lower legs. These symptoms can be caused by lots of other things. But it is still important to let you doctor know if you develop any of them. If these problems happen many years after treatment, you may need to tell them which cancer treatments you have had This will help them find the right help for you. If you have heart problems, your doctor will refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist).Other physical effects 43 What you can do to keep your heart healthy Making small changes to your lifestyle may help reduce your risk of developing heart problems. If you already have problems, small changes can help to reduce your risk of further problems. The British Heart Foundation has lots of information and advice about keeping your heart healthy. You can find their contact details on page 116. Keep active This can help your heart healthy and has other benefits too. Keeping physically active can: help you keep to a healthy weight (see pages 55 to 56) reduce your risk of bone thinning (see pages 47 to 59) reduce stress improve fatigue help you look and feel better. There is some evidence that regular exercise may help to reduce the risk of breast cancer coming back. There is also evidence that it reduces the risk of getting some other cancers.44 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Eat healthily Eating healthily helps protect your heart. It also helps you maintain a healthy weight. Try to eat: at least 5 portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day protein like chicken and fish, especially oily fish high fibre foods less saturated fat like pastries, cakes and cheese less red and processed meat less salt. Drink less alcohol Too much alcohol can cause heart problems. It is also high in calories. Sticking to sensible drinking guidelines is good for your general health. Current guidelines recommend that women drink no more than 14 units of alcohol per week. It is also good to have a few alcohol-free days each week. Give up smoking If you smoke, stopping is the healthiest decision you can make. It is one of the major risk factors for heart disease. Stopping smoking also reduces your risk of developing lung disease, bone thinning (osteoporosis) and smoking-related cancers. You will also feel and look better.Other physical effects 45 Effects on the lungs Radiotherapy can change the cells that line the lungs and cause a hardening and thickening of the tissue. This is called fibrosis. This can cause problems with breathlessness months or years after treatment. However, this is a rare side effect because radiotherapy is carefully planned and ways of giving it have improved. If you already have a chest problem such as asthma, or if you smoke, the symptoms can be worse. Some women get inflammation of the lung (radiation pneumonitis) 1 to 3 months after radiotherapy. This causes symptoms such as: breathlessness a dry cough chest pain. However, the condition usually improves so the symptoms will go away. You should always talk to your doctor if you develop new symptoms.46 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Treatment for lung problems Treatment will depend on your situation. You may need to make some lifestyle changes. For example, it is best to give up smoking and keep to a healthy weight. Your doctor or specialist nurse will give you advice and support about this. You may be given inhalers that contain drugs to help open up the airways. These are called bronchodilators. Or you may be given steroids. These can be given as tablets or inhalers to reduce inflammation. If you have an infection in the lung, you will be given antibiotics. What you can do to keep your lungs healthy Making small changes to your lifestyle can reduce your risk of developing lung problems. The British Lung Foundation has lots of information and advice. You can find their contact details on page 116. Give up smoking If you smoke, the most important thing you can do is to stop. It is also important to avoid being exposed to other people's smoke (passive smoking). Stopping smoking has lots of benefits. Keep to a healthy weight Keeping to a healthy weight improves breathing problems. Do some breathing exercises You can ask to be referred to a physiotherapist who can teach you deep breathing exercises and give you advice on exercise. This can help you breathe better and improve breathlessness.Other physical effects 47 Effects on the bones Bone thinning After the menopause, all women have an increased risk of bone thinning (osteoporosis). But after breast cancer treatment, some women are at a greater risk. This is because some treatments can reduce the amount of oestrogen in the body. Oestrogen helps to keep bones healthy and strong. Treatments for breast cancer that can increase the risk of bone thinning are: chemotherapy, especially if it causes an early menopause hormonal therapy with aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, exemestane or letrozole ovarian ablation to stop the ovaries from working by removing them, having radiotherapy, or using drugs called LHRH analogues, such as goserelin (Zoladex \u00ae). Before treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, national guidelines recommend that women have their bone health (density) checked. This is done using a DEXA scan. This uses an x-ray with a very low dose of radiation. DEXA is short for dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. The scan only takes about 15 minutes. You lie on a couch while the scan is done. You do not need to have any injections for this scan. You also do not have to undress, as long as there is no metal, such as zips, in the area being scanned.Other physical effects 49 Your bone density can be monitored during and after treatment. Depending on the results, you may be prescribed calcium and vitamin D supplements or bone strengthening drugs called bisphosphonates. These help to minimise the risk of problems. If you have a family history of osteoporosis, ask your cancer doctor or specialist nurse about using bisphosphonates to help prevent osteoporosis. Radiotherapy damage to bones Rarely, radiotherapy weakens the bones in the treatment area, such as the ribs and collarbone. Radiotherapy can reduce the blood supply to bones. This makes them thinner and increases the risk of a bone breaking, but this is very rare. If you have any symptoms, such as bone pain, always talk to your doctor. Usually the symptoms are caused by something else, but it is important to get them checked. Treatment might involve taking painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs. Sometimes calcium supplements, vitamin D or bisphosphonates and antibiotics are given. We have a booklet called Managing cancer pain that we can send you (see page 110).50 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment What you can do to keep your bones healthy Regular exercise, a healthy diet and stopping smoking can help to keep your bones healthy. The National Osteoporosis Society can give you more information about the prevention of osteoporosis and treatments. Breast Cancer Care also has a helpful leaflet. Their contact details can be found on page 115. Keep active Physical activity makes your bones stronger. Regular weight-bearing exercise is best. Examples of this kind of exercise are: walking or hiking climbing stairs dancing gentle weight-lifting. Swimming is good for general health, but it is not as good for bone health as these other activities. This is because your bones are not supporting your weight while you swim. If you already have osteoporosis, avoid exercises that put too much strain on your bones, such as jogging. A physiotherapist or your specialist nurse can give you further advice about exercise after breast cancer.Other physical effects 51 Get enough calcium and vitamin D It is important to make sure that you get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet. Good sources of calcium include: low-fat dairy products eggs green, leafy vegetables, such as kale nuts whole fish, such as whitebait and sardines. Vitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium. It is found in oily fish, eggs and food with added vitamins, but we mainly get it from sunlight. Most people get enough vitamin D by being outside in the summer months. If you have dark skin, you need more sunlight to make vitamin D. A well-balanced diet and safe exposure to enough sunshine usually gives you the calcium and vitamin D you need. If you are not getting enough calcium or vitamin D, taking supplements may help. Your specialist nurse can advise you about this. Drinking too much alcohol can interfere with the balance of calcium in your body, so it is best to follow sensible drinking guidelines. Give up smoking If you are a smoker, choosing to stop is a decision that will benefit your health. Stopping smoking has lots of benefits. It is also important to avoid being exposed to other people's smoke (passive smoking). 52 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Effects on the joints Pain in the joints (arthralgia) Women taking aromatase inhibitors (such as anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane) may have joint pain and sometimes muscle pain. This is probably caused by a decrease in oestrogen levels. Joint pain is also a common symptom of the menopause. Pain is most common in the hands and feet, but can also happen in the knees, hips, lower back and shoulders. It may be there all the time or it may come and go. Some women notice that their joints are stiffer in the morning, when they first get up. If you have recently started taking an aromatase inhibitor, the pain may get better over the next few months as the body adjusts to changes in hormone levels. Aromatase inhibitors are very good at reducing the risk of breast cancer coming back. You should not stop taking your treatment without talking to your cancer specialist. There is usually something that can be done to improve the pain. Treatment for joint pain Doctors can prescribe several different painkillers for joint and muscle pain. These include: simple painkillers, as paracetamol or morphine for severe pain.Other physical effects 53 If the pain is difficult to cope with, your doctor may suggest changing the type of aromatase inhibitor you take. If that does not work, they may suggest you take tamoxifen instead. Tamoxifen causes fewer problems with joint pain. Small studies suggest that for women with lower levels of vitamin D, taking vitamin D3 supplements may improve symptoms. Talk to your doctor before taking a supplement. Research is going on to discover if a drug called glucosamine may help some women with joint pain from aromatase inhibitors. Glucosamine is often used to treat arthritis. You can buy it over-the-counter in shops and pharmacies, but it is not suitable for everyone. For example, it is not suitable for women with diabetes, because it may change your blood sugar levels. Talk to your GP or cancer doctor before taking this drug. What you can do about joint problems It is important to talk to your doctor or specialist nurse if joint or muscle pain is a problem for you. Your doctor can prescribe drugs to help control the symptoms and find other ways of improving them. See a physiotherapist or occupational therapist If you are having lots of problems with pain, your doctor can refer you to a physiotherapist. They can give you more advice and treatment. If you are having difficulty doing daily tasks, you can also ask to be referred to an occupational therapist (OT). They will be able to assess your needs and suggest aids and equipment to help you.54 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Some things that might help joint problems include the following: Keep active Doing regular exercise to strengthen the muscles around your joints. This can help to keep them flexible and reduce pain. Non-weight-bearing exercises, such as swimming and cycling, may feel more comfortable than other types of exercise. Try acupuncture Acupuncture may help to reduce pain from joint symptoms for some women. Some hospitals and primary care practices offer acupuncture on the NHS. The needles should not be used on the arm of the affected side. Ask your doctor about complementary therapies Complementary therapies such as massage may be helpful for some women. Some hospitals offer massage on the NHS. It is very important to talk to your cancer doctor or specialist nurse before starting complementary therapies. They can talk to you about any possible harmful impacts they could have on your cancer treatment, and about any possible side effects. Other physical effects 55 Weight gain After breast cancer treatment some women find that they have gained weight. This can happen because: chemotherapy or another treatment has caused an early menopause you are taking steroids, which are often given with chemotherapy you are having hormonal therapies you are less active during treatment and eat a less healthy diet. Losing weight can be difficult. Even keeping to a healthy weight is sometimes hard. But there are lots of benefits. It reduces the risk of getting heart problems and other illnesses such as diabetes. There is evidence that keeping to a healthy weight after the menopause helps reduce the risk of breast cancer coming back. What you can do to help manage your weight Try to keep your weight within the normal range for your height. Your GP or practice nurse can advise you on your ideal weight. Eat a healthy diet Reduce your calorie intake by eating less fat and sugar. It is important to eat a balanced diet to make sure you get all the nutrients you need to keep your body healthy. Ask your GP or a dietitian for advice and support.56 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Keep active Choose a type of exercise you enjoy. For most people, it is safe to do exercise. But get advice from your GP before you start. They may be able to refer you to exercise groups run by fitness trainers. If you are a member of a gym, you can ask for supervised help from a trainer. Keep to a healthy weight Avoid losing weight too quickly to help maintain a healthy weight.Losing weight slowly and eating well is healthier, and you are more likely to stay a healthy weight in future. Aim to lose 1 to 2 pounds (0.5kg to 1kg) a week. Be patient with yourself. To help you lose weight, try to: only eat as much food as you need eat a balanced diet with lots of fruit and vegetables eat less fat and sugar drink less alcohol or stop drinking, if you drink be more physically active.Other physical effects 57 Peripheral neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (also called neuropathy) is damage to nerves that carry messages between the brain, the spinal cord and the rest of the body. Nerve damage can cause symptoms such as pins and needles, numbness or pain in the hands and feet. For a few people, this may lead to problems with balance and walking. Treatment with the chemotherapy drugs docetaxel or paclitaxel is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in women who have had breast cancer. Surgery and radiotherapy to the breast may also cause nerve damage. After treatment has stopped, most women find that their symptoms slowly get better as the nerves recover. This usually takes several months. But for some women, the nerves do not completely recover and some nerve damage is long-term. Many women still find that their symptoms get better over time. Managing nerve pain There is not a drug or treatment that can repair damaged nerves. But nerve pain (neuropathic pain) can often be treated. There are also things you can do to help yourself. Treating nerve pain Nerve pain can be treated in different ways. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used. This includes drugs like ibuprofen. Some drugs change nerve impulses. This helps relieve nerve pain. Drugs that can do this include: some antidepressants some heart drugs some anticonvulsants, which are drugs used to treat epilepsy drugs such as morphine.58 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment If your pain is difficult to treat, you can ask for a referral to a pain clinic where there is expert help available from specialist doctors and nurses. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a treatment that may also help. It uses pads that give off small electrical pulses. These are put on the skin. They stimulate nerves close to the pain. This may block pain messages from the nerves to the brain. It is unlikely to cause side effects. Acupuncture may also be helpful. It uses very fine needles that are placed through the skin at particular points. It is not clear exactly how this works, but it may help to block pain messages being sent to the brain. Some hospitals and GP surgeries offer acupuncture on the NHS. The needles should not be used on the arm on the affected side. We have more information about different ways in which pain can be treated and complementary therapies. Other support A physiotherapist will be able to offer treatment and advice for problems with balance or walking. If you are having difficulty carrying out daily tasks, you can ask to be referred to an occupational therapist (OT). They can assess your needs andsuggest aids and equipment to help you. If your symptoms continue for more than 6 months and you find walking or doing daily activities difficult, you may be able to get financial help. You can contact our cancer support specialists on 0800 808 00 00 for more information. We also have more information on our website. Just visit macmillan.org.ukOther physical effects 59 What you can do to help manage peripheral neuropathy It is important to protect your hands or feet and try to reduce your risk of accidents and falls. Here are some tips: Keep your hands and feet warm. It may help to wear gloves and warm socks in cold weather. Do not walk around barefoot. Check your feet regularly for any problems. Always wear well-fitting shoes or boots. Wear gloves when doing household chores, gardening or DIY. Always use pot holders and oven gloves to avoid burning your hands when cooking. Before baths or showers, test the temperature of water with your elbow to make sure it is not too hot. Make sure rooms are well lit so you do not hurt yourself. Always put on a light if you get up during the night. Keep areas that you walk through free of clutter and things you could trip over, such as loose rugs.Other physical effects 61 Diabetes Some hormonal therapies used to treat breast cancer can slightly increase your risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes is a condition where the amount of glucose in the blood is too high. Glucose is a type of sugar that our bodies use for energy. Most women will not get diabetes because of their cancer treatment. But it may help to know the symptoms of diabetes so you can get them checked if they develop. Usually the benefits of hormonal therapies outweigh the small risk of diabetes. Your doctor or specialist nurse can talk to you about this. Symptoms of diabetes Diabetes can cause the following symptoms: passing a lot of urine (peeing), especially at night feeling very thirsty feeling very tired losing weight for no obvious reason itching in the genital area or getting thrush a lot cuts and wounds that take a long time to heal blurred vision. These symptoms can be caused by many other conditions. But you should always talk to your GP if you have any of them.Effects on fertility 64 Sexuality 69 Menopausal symptoms 73ferti Lity, sexualit y and the men Opaus e64 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Effects on fertility Some breast cancer treatments can affect your ability to have children (fertility). Not being able to get pregnant and have children is called infertility. Some women do not have problems getting pregnant naturally after treatment. This is especially true for younger women. The risk of infertility increases with age and how close you are to your natural menopause. Infertility may be temporary or permanent, depending on the treatment you have had and your age. Infertility can be very difficult to deal with, especially if you wanted to have children or add to your family. It can be particularly hard when you are already coping with cancer. Having a family may feel like an important part of moving on with life after cancer. Pregnancy after treatment Doctors usually advise that you wait at least 2 years after treatment before trying to get pregnant. This is usually because: the first 2 years after treatment is when the cancer is most likely to come back it gives you time to recover from treatment. Pregnancy raises your natural hormone levels, so it is important to talk to your specialist nurse first if you are planning to get pregnant. However, recent research has shown that pregnancy after breast cancer does not increase the risk of the cancer coming back. This is true even if the original cancer had hormone receptors (oestrogen positive). Fertility, sexuality and the menopause 65 Your cancer doctor or specialist nurse can advise you on the risk of the cancer coming back and how safe pregnancy is in your situation. You should not get pregnant if you are continuing to take hormonal or targeted therapy drugs, as they may harm the developing baby. How treatments may affect fertility Hormonal therapy Women taking tamoxifen often find that their periods change. Your periods may stop, or become less regular, heavier or lighter. If your periods stop, they usually start again when you stop taking tamoxifen. Even if your periods stop, it is still possible to become pregnant. Tamoxifen can affect an unborn baby, so it is not safe to become pregnant while taking it. It can also increase the chances of a multiple pregnancy, such as twins or triplets. Tamoxifen is usually prescribed for up to 10 years. Depending on your age when you start taking tamoxifen, this may be an issue if you want to get pregnant. It is important to talk this over with your cancer doctor. Drugs such as goserelin, which are used to stop the ovaries from working (known as ovarian suppression), cause temporary infertility. Your period will usually start again about 6 months after treatment finishes. The side effects of hormonal therapy are similar to the effects of menopause. Women in their 40s may go through the menopause without knowing it while taking hormonal therapy.66 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Chemotherapy Some chemotherapy drugs may temporarily or permanently stop your ovaries producing eggs. Some women may go into the menopause immediately after treatment, especially if they are close to their natural menopause. If your periods do not come back after a few months, your cancer doctor can do blood tests. These can show if you have gone through the menopause. If you are in your 30s and you stop having your periods, they will usually come back. This is particularly true if you are under 35. It may take a few months or up to 2 years. Some young women do not stop having periods at all. The younger you are, the more likely it is that you will still be fertile after chemotherapy. Chemotherapy reduces your egg supply. This means that even if you get your period after treatment, your menopause may start earlier than it would have without cancer treatment. It is important to consider this if you are thinking about having a family. Referral to a fertility clinic If you have had chemotherapy and are having difficulty getting pregnant, ask your doctor to refer you to a fertility specialist. You can usually be referred after 6 months of trying to get pregnant. This is because of your risk of an early menopause. The fertility specialist will talk to you about possible options for you. There are different ways of becoming a parent. You might consider egg donation, surrogacy or adoption.Fertility, sexuality and the menopause 67 If you had eggs or an embryo (a fertilised egg) frozen and stored before treatment, you can have fertility treatment later on. This may result in a successful pregnancy. Becoming infertile can be very hard to live with - whether or not you already have children. You may find it helpful to talk through your feelings with a trained counsellor. If you need more specialised help, your doctor can arrange this for you. We have booklets about sex, relationships and fertility for men and women. See page 110 for ways to order. Contraception after treatment Check with your cancer doctor or specialist nurse if you are not sure whether you need to continue using contraceptives to prevent pregnancy. You will be advised not to take the contraceptive pill or use coils (IUDs) containing hormones. This is because they could encourage breast cancer cells to grow. Your cancer doctor or specialist nurse will give you more advice about this.Fertility, sexuality and the menopause 69 Sexuality How breast cancer can affect your sexuality Breast cancer and its treatment can affect your sex life and your body image. Body image is how you think and feel about your body and how you think others value you. Sexual difficulties can happen as a result of the physical and emotional effects of cancer and its treatment. You may lose interest in sex, feel unattractive, or worry that you will never be able to be sexually active. For some people, these problems continue long after treatment has finished. Try not to think that sex is never going to be as important in your life as it was before. Bringing sex back into your life can involve a period of adjustment for you and your partner. After treatment, some women continue to have problems with their body image and self-esteem. Others may be left with a low sex drive (libido) or have sexual difficulties as a result of the physical effects of treatment. Usually, women find that they overcome most difficulties with time. Many people find it difficult to talk about sexual issues because they feel embarrassed or self-conscious. Your doctor or nurse specialist will be used to talking about these things. They can advise you about where to go for specialist help and support.70 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Changes in your appearance If you feel less confident and attractive because your operation has changed your appearance, it may be possible to have further surgery. Breast reconstruction (see page 18) or surgery to change the shape of your breast can help restore your self-confidence. Many women have reconstruction done years after their first breast operation. You can discuss this with your cancer doctor or specialist nurse. They can also arrange a referral to a plastic surgeon. If you use a prosthesis (false breast) but it is no longer a good fit, you may feel less confident about how you look. You can have a reassessment, even if your prosthesis is still in good condition. Sometimes new prosthesis styles have been developed. Even getting a new bra fitted in a different style can improve how you look and feel. Breast Cancer Care has helpful information about prostheses, underwear and clothing. See page 115 for their contact details. 'Everyone is expecting me to go back to normal, but every time I look in the mirror I know it can never go back to exactly how it was. And I find that hard.' ToniFertility, sexuality and the menopause 71 Tiredness (fatigue) You may feel too exhausted to have sex during treatment and for a while afterwards. Most women find that this slowly improves. But sometimes it can last for months or longer. If you are very tired, it might help to have sex differently. For example, it might help to try a less energetic position. Menopausal symptoms You may have vaginal dryness and hot flushes. These can make having sex difficult and reduce your sex drive. Using gels and creams can help lessen discomfort during sex. Managing hot flushes and other menopausal symptoms may help to improve your sex drive. Discomfort or pain If you have problems with pain, this may lower your sex drive. You may have pain in your chest and shoulders after surgery or radiotherapy. Managing the pain may improve your desire to have sex. It may help to support painful areas with pillows and avoid positions where your weight rests on your chest or arms.72 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment You and your partner The emotional effects of treatment and cancer can also reduce your sex drive. Surgery to remove part or all of the breast can cause changes to how you see yourself. If you have a partner, you may feel insecure and worry if they will still find you sexually attractive. These anxieties may cause problems between you and your partner. They may also make you feel anxious about new relationships. A partner may struggle with the changes at first. Or they may not have a problem with your changed appearance. It can be helpful to try to discuss how you both feel. If you are feeling self-conscious about how you look, talking with your partner about how you feel can help you feel more confident. Partners are often concerned about how to express their love physically and emotionally after treatment. If you do not feel like having sex, cuddles, kisses and massages can be affectionate and sensual ways of showing how much you care for someone. If you feel very self-conscious, you might prefer to have sex partly dressed, or in low lighting. Let your cancer doctor or specialist nurse know if you are having problems with your sex life. They may be able to reassure you about your concerns or get you some help. You can also call us for a confidential chat on 0808 808 00 00 . Our booklet Cancer, you and your partner may also be helpful. (see page 110). Fertility, sexuality and the menopause 73 Menopausal symptoms Some breast cancer treatments can affect the way the ovaries work. This can cause an early menopause for some women. It can also cause side effects similar to menopausal symptoms. Sometimes these effects do not last long. Before the menopause, the ovaries produce the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. These control a woman's period. During the menopause, periods gradually stop as the ovaries stop producing these hormones. This usually happens naturally for most women between the ages of 45 and 55. Chemotherapy may cause an early menopause. This is more likely to happen in women who are closer to their natural menopause. Hormonal treatments may cause menopausal symptoms or a temporary menopause. This is because these treatments block the effects of oestrogen on breast cancer cells, or reduce oestrogen in the body. Surgery that removes the ovaries will lead to a permanent menopause. 74 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Managing menopausal symptoms There are different ways to reduce menopausal symptoms. Choosing the right method for you will depend on: your personal preferences the possible risks and benefits of each approach the type of symptoms you have how severe your symptoms are what other treatments you are having. We have more detailed information about breast cancer and menopausal symptoms on our website. Visit macmillan.org.uk for more information. 76 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Hot flushes and sweats This is the most common menopausal symptom. Hot flushes can vary from a mild feeling of warmth in the face to a heavy night sweat. It is difficult to stop hot flushes and sweats, but how often they happen and how bad they are can often be reduced. Using more than one method often works best. Ways to manage hot flushes include: keeping a record of when you have flushes to see whether something triggers them - to help you avoid them wearing natural fabrics, such as cotton dressing in layers, so you can remove clothes if and when you need to using cotton sheets or fabrics and pillows that are designed to keep you cool in bed having layers of bedding that you can easily take off during the night keeping the room temperature cool or using a fan having cold drinks rather than hot ones drinking less alcohol if you smoke, stopping or smoking less losing weight, if it is suitable for you to trying complementary therapies, such as controlled breathing or yoga.Fertility, sexuality and the menopause 77 Medicines for hot flushes There are different medicines that your doctor can prescribe to help you have fewer and less severe hot flushes and sweats. These include: low doses of some antidepressants the anti-epilepsy drug gabapentin clonidine, that is used to treat high blood pressure or migraines. These medicines are not recommended for all women. They may affect how your breast cancer treatment works. Your doctor or specialist nurse can give you more information. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) HRT is not usually recommended after breast cancer because it contains oestrogen, which may increase the risk of the cancer coming back. Breast cancer guidelines also do not recommend non-oestrogen types of HRT, such as tibolone progestogens (megestrol acetate, norethisterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate) are not recommended either. Rarely, if a woman's symptoms are severe and nothing else helps, HRT may be prescribed. This is only done after careful discussion with your cancer doctor and nurse specialist. They will help you understand the possible risks and benefits. 78 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Complementary therapies for hot flushes Some women find that complementary therapies help reduce hot flushes. Some complementary therapies may interfere with your breast cancer medicines. Talk to your cancer doctor or specialist nurse if you are thinking of starting a complementary therapy. Here are some types of complementary therapy: Acupuncture This is the practice of putting sterile needles through the skin at specific points in the body. There is some evidence that it may help reduce the number and severity of hot flushes. The needles should not be used on the arm of the affected side. Hypnotherapy This is the practice of encouraging a positive state of mind. This may help reduce the length and severity of hot flushes, but it is unlikely to be available on the NHS. Controlled breathing techniques This is the practice of paced breathing or a yoga technique called Sheetali. It can be an effective way of managing flushes. Evening primrose oil This is an oil made from the seeds of primrose flowers. It may be helpful, although it is expensive. A few small research studies have shown that it might help. But there is no strong evidence that it works. Sage The sage plant can be used to make tablets or tea. Some women find taking sage tablets or tea helps reduce hot flushes. But there is no strong evidence that it works.Fertility, sexuality and the menopause 79 Homeopathy This is the practice of using tiny amounts of substances that would normally produce the symptoms being treated. It is used by some women. But there is no strong evidence that it works. Plant oestrogens Plant oestrogens (phytoestrogens) such as black cohosh and red clover, can have a weak oestrogen-like effect. So doctors do not recommend them for women who have had breast cancer. Vaginal dryness Having a low level of oestrogen can cause vaginal dryness and itching. It can make having sex uncomfortable or painful. Vaginal creams or lubricants can help to rehydrate the walls of the vagina. They can reduce discomfort, especially during sex. Not all products are the same. Some products may cause skin irritation. You may need to try more than one product to find out which works best for you. Your doctor or specialist nurse can give you more information about which products are safe and suitable for you. You can buy them in chemists or online. Some creams may damage condoms and diaphragms, so you may need to use another form of contraception to avoid pregnancy.80 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Hormone-based treatments Some vaginal treatments contain a small amount of oestrogen. The long-term risks of using products containing oestrogen after breast cancer are unknown. However, some breast specialists think very little oestrogen is absorbed. So they may prescribe hormone-based treatments for short periods of time. However, hormone-based vaginal treatments are not recommended for women taking an aromatase inhibitor, such as anastrozole, exemestane or letrozole. It is important to talk to your doctor or specialist nurse before you use any products containing oestrogen. The hormonal therapy drug tamoxifen can cause vaginal discharge. Let your doctor or specialist nurse know if this happens. Fertility, sexuality and the menopause 81 Urinary problems During the menopause you may pass urine (pee) more often. You may also have some urine leakage and be more likely to get urine infections. Urine infections are also called urinary tract infections or UTIs. Speak to your doctor if you develop symptoms of a UTI. Symptoms include: cloudy or smelly urine pain or discomfort when passing urine (peeing). It is important to drink enough fluid each day to keep your bladder healthy. You should try to drink at least 2 to 3 pints (1\u00bd litres) of fluid a day. If you do not drink enough, your urine will become concentrated. This can irritate the bladder. You will also be more likely to develop a UTI. If you have problems with urine leakage, doing regular pelvic floor exercises can help. These exercises strengthen the muscles that hold urine in the bladder. Your nurse or doctor can explain how to do these exercises. Or you can get more information from the Bladder and Bowel Community (see page 115).82 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Difficulty sleeping You may have difficulty sleeping because of hot flushes, sweats or anxiety. The following suggestions may help you to relax and sleep well: Have a bedtime routine. This could include having a warm drink, brushing your teeth or reading in bed. This will help your brain know that it is time to sleep. Sleep for the right amount of time. Too much time in bed can affect the quality of your sleep. Try to go to sleep at the same time each evening and wake up at the same time each morning. Get out of bed if you cannot sleep. You could try reading, or listening to some soothing music. Wait until you feel tired again, and then go back to bed. Try breathing exercises and relaxation techniques. Or listen to relaxation CDs or podcasts. Fertility, sexuality and the menopause 83 Psychological effects The psychological effects of menopausal symptoms can be hard to cope with when you are already dealing with cancer. These effects can include: a low sex drive mood swings lack of confidence loss of concentration and memory feeling very emotional or anxious. Many women find it helpful to talk through their feelings with family and friends, or their doctor or nurse. A number of organisations provide support to women going through menopause. Some women may find counselling helpful. Your doctor or nurse can give you more advice. 'I have been on hormone treatment for 5 years, and some of my ups and downs can be put down to that. But a lot of it is the shock of settling, now that active treatment has finished.' Bethan'I went on an IT course and struggled to understand it.

Doctors call this cognitive impairment. It is also sometimes called chemo brain or chemo fog. But these changes can also happen with other cancer treatments, such as hormonal therapy. Changes in memory or concentration are usually mild. They often get better within a year of finishing treatment. But they can sometimes go on for longer, or have a bigger impact on your daily life. Examples of these difficulties include: difficulty concentrating and focusing (mental fogginess) feeling mentally slower than before trouble remembering things you would usually remember, such as names or events mixing up dates and appointments not being able to find things difficulty doing more than one thing at a time (multitasking) finding it hard to remember the right word. Effects on concentration and memory 87 If you are having these problems, talk to your doctor. They will look for possible causes for your symptoms. They may arrange for you to have tests and scans. For example, you might have a blood test. There may be other things that are linked to your symptoms. It might be possible to treat these, which could help. An early menopause may result in similar symptoms, or make them worse. Hormonal therapies, such as tamoxifen may also affect your memory and concentration. Aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane may have the same effect. Feeling extremely tired (fatigue) is a common side effect of cancer treatment. It can cause problems with concentration and memory. Improving fatigue may help improve these problems. See pages 36 to 41 for more information about fatigue. Anxiety, stress and depression can all cause problems with memory and concentration. Treatment to help anxiety or depression may improve your memory and concentration. Pain or other symptoms can make it difficult to focus on anything else. Treatment and finding ways to manage pain and other symptoms may improve your concentration. 88 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment What you can do to help with concentration and memory It is important to take care of yourself. Get plenty of rest, but balance this with regular activity. Being more active improves fatigue and sleep problems. Feeling less tired could improve your concentration and memory. Gentle exercise like walking is a good way to get started. Some women also find activities like yoga, meditation, reading and complementary therapies helpful. These activities can help you relax and feel less anxious. Tell your family and friends about the difficulties you are having. They can support you and help you find ways of making life easier. 'I told close family and friends that if I hesitated in conversation, it wasn't because I wasn't listening, I just needed to get the right word. They were very supportive.' SylvieEffects on concentration and memory 89 There are some things you can do to improve your symptoms: Keep notes of anything important. This could include conversations with your doctor or specialist nurse and questions you want to ask them. Have a daily routine and try to keep to it. Try to do one thing at a time. When you are trying to concentrate, minimise distractions such as background noise. Use tools to help your memory. These could include diaries, planners, calendars, post-it notes or lists. Keep things in the same place. You are more likely to know where they are, even if you do not remember putting them there. If you need to take something with you when you leave the house, put it near the front door. Use a dosette box (pill organiser) to store your medicines. This will help you take the right dose of medicine. Try crosswords, word puzzles or sudoku to help your concentration. Or you could try doing simple maths in your head. For example, you might do this when you are calculating your change. Keep a diary of times when your concentration or memory problems are worse. You can then plan to do things that require concentration when you will find it easiest.Your feelings 92 Relationships 94your feeLings and relatiO nships92 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Your feelings It is normal to find it difficult to cope with some of your feelings months or even years after treatment. It can be especially hard if you have late effects. These feelings often become easier to cope with over time and with the right support. Feeling alone You might find some late effects embarrassing or difficult to talk about. This can make you feel isolated. You may feel more alone if you do not know anyone else with the same difficulties. You may also feel isolated as you begin to have less contact with the hospital. Uncertainty You may worry that some of your late effects are a sign of the cancer coming back. After cancer treatment, it is also common to feel anxious about aches and pains that you would not have worried about before. It can help to know more about your late effects and where you can get support if you are worried.Your feelings and relationships 93 Anger You might feel angry about your illness. It is understandable that you may feel very upset about the cancer. This is especially true if you are coping with late effects of treatment. You do not need to feel guilty for feeling this way. You might find that it helps to tell yourself and the people close to you when you are feeling angry. Your family and friends may think your anger is directed at them, when it is really directed at your illness or late effects. Keeping strong feelings to yourself may make you feel depressed. You can talk to your doctor about seeing a counsellor. Depression Coping with the late effects of treatment can be physically and emotionally difficult. This can sometimes make people feel depressed. Signs of depression include: feeling low in mood having no interest in, or getting no enjoyment from, things that you normally would enjoy feeling helpless or hopeless. If you think you may be depressed, talk to your doctor. They can refer you to a counsellor or psychologist, or prescribe a course of antidepressant drugs for you. Our booklet How are you feeling? The emotional effects of cancer has more detailed information that you may find helpful (see page 110).94 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Relationships Your experience of cancer may have improved and strengthened your relationships with people close to you. The support of family and friends may have helped you cope. But cancer is stressful, and this sometimes affects your relationships. Any problems usually improve over time, especially if you talk openly with each other. Family and friends You may sometimes feel that your family and friends do not understand if you are not feeling positive about certain things. You may feel they do not realise how much the effects of treatment are affecting your life. Talking openly about how you are feeling will help them understand you better and give you the support you need. Our booklet Talking about cancer - a guide for people with cancer has useful tips on how to talk to family and friends (see page 110).96 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Children Deciding what to tell your children or grandchildren about your late effects can be difficult. The way your illness affects children often depends on their age. An open, honest approach is usually best. Explain the late effects that you are coping with. You may want to find ways of getting them involved in managing them, such as going for walks with you. Tell them what you can do and help them to understand that recovery takes time. Teenagers may find it particularly difficult because they are going through a lot of emotional changes themselves. At a stage when they want more freedom, they may be asked to take on more responsibilities. It is important that they can go on with their normal lives as much as possible and get the support they need. If they find it hard to talk to you, you could encourage them to talk to someone close who can support and listen to them. This could be a relative, friend, teacher or counsellor. They may also find it useful to look at the website riprap.org.uk , which is for teenagers who have a parent with cancer. Our booklet Talking to children and teenagers when an adult has cancer has helpful advice (see page 110).Your feelings and relationships 97 Your partner Some couples become closer because they have shared the experience of cancer. But cancer can put a lot of strain on a relationship. Problems sometimes develop, even between close and loving couples who have been together for a long time. If a relationship was already difficult, the stress of a major illness may make things worse. The changes caused by some late effects may also be difficult to cope with. You may both need time to adjust. You may both assume you know what the other person is thinking, but you may not always be right. Talking openly about your feelings and listening can help you understand each other's point of view. We have a booklet called Cancer, you and your partner that you may find helpful (see page 110). get ting help and support How and when to get help 100 Work 101 Financial help and benefits 104100 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment How and when to get help You do not have to wait until your next check-up to contact your doctor or any other health professional. Let your doctor or specialist nurse know as soon as possible if: you have physical or emotional problems because of the cancer treatment you think that your symptoms have come back. Even if you are just feeling nervous or worried, tell your doctor so you can get support. After going through cancer, it is natural for your body to feel different, and for you to feel differently about your body. Aches and pains that you would not have worried about before may now make you wonder if the cancer has come back. This is a common reaction. Your GP or cancer specialist can assess your situation and refer you to the appropriate services. You can get physical and emotional support services through the NHS. Voluntary organisations can also offer a range of support services. Your doctor or nurse can arrange these for you during an appointment at the hospital.Getting help and support 101 Work You may not know how cancer will affect your work, now or in the future. It is a good idea to talk to your manager early on. If your workplace has a human resources (HR) or personnel department, contact them as soon as you can. If they know how the cancer or treatment may affect your ability to work, they can support you better. Some people stop working during cancer treatment and for a while after, until they feel ready to go back. Others carry on working, perhaps with reduced hours or other changes to their job. Some people may decide not to go back to work. Or they may choose to do something different. Others may not be able to go back to work because of the effects of cancer on their health. Going back to work may depend on the type of work you do or how much your income is affected. It is important not to take on too much, too soon. Your cancer doctor, GP or specialist nurse can help you decide when and if you should go back to work. Our booklets Work and cancer , Working while caring for someone with cancer and Self-employment and cancer have more information that may be helpful (see page 110). For more information, visit macmillan.org.uk/work102 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Employment rights If you have, or have ever had cancer, the law considers you to be disabled. This means you cannot be treated differently (less favourably) than other people at work because of cancer. If you are treated less favourably because of cancer, this is called discrimination. The law also says your employer has to make reasonable adjustments (changes) to your workplace and their work practices. If you live in England, Scotland or Wales, you are protected by the Equality Act 2010. If you live in Northern Ireland, you are protected by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Our booklet Your rights at work when you are affected by cancer has more information (see page 110).'As a family we knew this was what he wanted and we all agreed to rally around to help Joyce cope with his care' AdrienneHaving a CT scan 104 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Financial help and benefits When you are affected by cancer, you might need help with extra costs. Or you might need financial support if you have to stop working. Statutory Sick Pay If you work for an employer and take time off sick, you may be able to get Statutory Sick Pay. Your employer will pay this for up to 28 weeks. Benefits Benefits are payments from the government to people who need financial help. You can find out more about benefits and apply for them online. Go to gov.uk if you live in England, Wales and Scotland or nidirect.gov.uk if you live in Northern Ireland. Here are some benefits that you might be able to get if you are affected by cancer. Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) This benefit is for people under State Pension age who cannot work because of illness or disability. There are different types of ESA:Getting help and support 105 Contribution-based ESA may be available if you have paid enough National Insurance. Income-related ESA may be available if your income and savings are low, or if you cannot get contribution-based ESA. Income-related ESA is gradually being replaced by a new benefit called Universal Credit. Personal Independence Payment This benefit is for people aged between 16 and 64 who have problems moving around and looking after themselves. You must have had these difficulties for at least 3 months and expect them to last for at least 9 months. Attendance Allowance This benefit is for people aged 65 or over who have problems looking after themselves because of an illness or disability. This could mean getting out of bed, having a bath or getting dressed. You must have had these problems for at least 6 months. Special rules If you are terminally ill, and your doctor thinks you may be expected to live for less than 6 months, you can apply for some benefits using a fast-track process called special rules. Your claim will be dealt with quickly and you will get the benefit you applied for at the highest rate. It does not matter if you live longer than 6 months. Your doctor or specialist nurse will need to fill out a form for you.106 Managing the late effects of breast cancer treatment Help for carers Carer's Allowance is a weekly benefit that helps people who look after someone with a lot of care needs. If you do not qualify for it, you can apply for Carer's Credit. Carer's Credit helps prevent gaps in your National Insurance record if you have to stop working while you are caring for someone else. You do not get money, but it protects your right to a State Pension later in life. Macmillan Grants Macmillan Grants are small, mostly one-off payments to help people with the extra costs that cancer can cause. They are for people who have a low level of income and savings. If you need things like extra clothing, help paying heating bills or even a relaxing holiday, you may be able to get a Macmillan Grant. How much you get will depend on your situation and needs. The average grant is around \u00a3400. A grant from Macmillan would not normally affect the benefits you are entitled to. It is an extra bit of help, not a replacement for other support.Getting help and support 107 Insurance If you have, or have had, cancer, you may find it hard to get certain types of insurance. This includes life and travel insurance. A cancer diagnosis might also mean that you can get a payout from an insurance scheme that you already have.
