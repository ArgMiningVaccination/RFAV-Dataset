Vol. 10-7Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is a monthly pub lication of the Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, Department of Administration, pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation of all administrative rulemaking documents in Idaho. All of ficial rulemaking notices, of ficial rule text, executive orders of the Governor, all legislative documents affect ing rules, and any other documents required by law are published in the Bulletin. State agencies are required to provide public notice of all proposed rulemaking actions and must invite public input once proposed rulemaking has been initiated. The public receives notice of proposed rulemaking actions through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and a Public No tice (legal notice) that publishes in specific newspapers throughout the state. The legal notice provides reasonable o pportunity for the public to participate when a proposed rule publishes in the Bulletin. Interested parties can submit written comments to the agency or request public hearings of the agency if none have been scheduled. Such submission s or requests must be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the individual \"Notice of Rule making\" for each proposed rule that is published in the Bulletin. After the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all information submitted regarding the proposed rule. Comment periods and public hearings are no t provided for when the agen cy adopts a temporary or pending rule. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is cited by year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 09-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2009 ; Bulletin 10-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2010 . V olume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; V olume No. 10-1 refers to January 2010; V olume No. 10-2 refers to February 2010; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January 2010 is cited as V olume 10-1. The December 2009 Bulletin is cited as V olume 09-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE I DAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is published once a year and is a compilation or supplemental compilation of all final and enforceable administrative ru les in effect in Idaho. In an effort to provide the read er with current, enforceable rules, temporary rules are also published in the Administrative Code. Temporary rules and final rules approved by the legislature during the legislative session, and published in the monthly Idaho Administrative Bulletin, supplement the Administrative Code. Negotiated, proposed, and pending rules are only published in the Bulletin and not printed in the Administrative Code. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect, or to determine if a change has occurred, the reader should refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index of Idaho Administrative Rules , printed in each Bulletin. THE DIFFERENT RULES PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Idaho's administrative rulemaking process, governed by th e Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises five distinct activities: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings involve all five. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begi ns with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explana tion of each type of administrative rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 5 July 7, 2010 - Vol. 10-7NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested parties and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule. Agencies are encouraged, and in some cases requir ed, to engage in this rulemaking activity whenever it is feasible to do so. Publication of a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate - Negotiated Rulemaking\" in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process should result in the formulation of a proposed or temporary rule, or both. PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to am end or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to th e adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the subs tance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective; provided, however, that notwithstanding Sec tion 67-5231, Idaho Code, the absence or accuracy of a fiscal impact statement provided pursuant to this subsection shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the rule. d) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format;e) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; f) the manner in which persons may make written comments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to wh om comments on the proposal may be sent; g) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and h) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. All proposed rulemakings that are submitted for publication in the Bulletin that would impose a fee or charge must be accompanied by a cost/benefit analysis th at is prepared by the agen cy. This cost/benefit anal ysis must estimate, as reasonably as possible, the costs to th e agency to implemen t the rule and the estimated co sts that would be borne by citizens or the private sector. This analys is is filed with the Director of LSO who then forwards it to the appropriate germane joint subcommittee assigned to review the promulgating agency's proposed rules. When incorporating by reference, the notice of proposed rulemaking must include a brief synopsis detailing the need to incorporate by reference any additional materials into the rule. The agency must also provide information regarding access to the incorporated materials. At a mini mum, and when available, th e agency must provide an electronic link to the documents that can accessed on a website or post this information on its own website, or both. This link can be placed into the ru le and activated once it is posted on the Coordinator's website. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may proceed to th e pending rule stage. A proposed rule does not have an assigned effective date, even when pub lished in conjunction with a temporary ru le, and therefore, is not enforceable. An agency may vacate (terminate) a rulemaking after the pu blication of a proposed rule if it decides, for whatever reason, not to proceed further to finalize the rulemaking . The publication of a \"Notice of Vacation of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin officially stops the formal rulemaking process.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 6 July 7, 2010 - Vol. 10-7TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets one or more of the above legal cr iteria and the governor finds it is necessary that a rule become effective before it has been submitted to the legisl ature for review and approval and without allowing for any public input, the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. The law allows that agency to make a temporary rule immediately effective upon adopti on. However, a temporary rule that imposes a fee or charge may be adopted only if the governor finds that the f ee or charge is necessary to avoid an immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is extended by concurrent resolution, is replaced by a final rule, or expires under its own terms. State law requires that the text of both a proposed rule and a temporary rule be published in the Administrative Bulletin. In cases where the text of the temporary rule is the same as the proposed rule, the rulemaking can be done concurrently as a proposed/temporary rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text. An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule that has been adopted and is in effect. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been pu blished concurrently with a proposed rule that is being vacated, the agency, in mo st instances, will rescind the temporary rule. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Rulemaking Pending Rule.\" This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective and a statement that the pending rule may be rejected, amended or modified by co ncurrent resolution of the legislature; d) an identification of any portion of the rule impo sing or increasing a fee or charge and a statement that this portion of the rule shall not become fi nal and effective unless affirmatively approved by concurrent resolution of the legislature; (e) the specific statutory authority for the rulemaking including a citation to the specific section of the Idaho Code that has occasioned the rulemaking, or the federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; and (f) a specific description, if applicable, of any nega tive fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective; provided however, that notwithstanding section 67-5231, Idaho Code, the absence or IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 7 July 7, 2010 - Vol. 10-7accuracy of a fiscal impact statement provided pursuant to this subsection shall not affect the validity or the enforceability of the rule. Agencies are required to republish the te xt of the rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which wa s originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that members of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending ru le. With the permission of th e Rules Coordinator, only the Section(s) that have changed from the proposed text are republished. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Pending Rulemaking\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is in effect and enforceable. No pending rule adopted by an agency will become final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review. Where the legislature finds that an agen cy has violated the legislative intent of the statute under which the rule was made, a concurrent resolution may be ad opted to reject the rulemaking or any part thereof. A \"Notice of Final Rule\" must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is rejected, amended, or modified by the legislature showing the changes made. A rule reviewed by the legislature and not rejected, amended or modified becomes final with no further legislative action. No rule sha ll become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactiv ely, as provided in the rule.

Each state agency ha s a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphab etical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections with a number of subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrativ e Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administrations's Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" 200.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii. DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. All rulemaking actions (documents) are assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The \"Docket Number\" is a series by a hyphen \"-\", ( 38-0501-1001 ). The docket numbers are published sequentially by IDAPA designation (e.g. the two- digit agency code). The following example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket number: \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-1001\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule bein g promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"1001\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being published; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2010 . A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2010 would be designated as \" 1002 \". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501- 1002 . Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections aff ected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 9 July 7, 2010 - Vol. 10-7INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CITA TIONS TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES IN THE CODE AND BULLETIN When making a citation to another Section or Subsection of a rule that is part of the same rule, a typical internal citation may appear as follows: \"...as found in Section 201 of these rules.\" OR \"...in accordance with Subsectio n 201.06.c. of these rules.\" The citation may also include the IDAPA, Title, or Chapter number, as number of the rule. \"01\" denotes the Chapter number of the rule. \"201\" denotes the main Section number of the rule to which the citation refers. Citations made within a rule to a different rule chapter (external citation) should also include the name of the Department and the name of the rule chapter being referenced, as well as the IDAPA, Title, and Chapter numbers. The following is a typical example of an external citation to another rule chapter: \"...as outlined in the Rules of the Department of Administration, IDAPA 38.04.04, \"Rules Governing Capitol Mall Parking.\"IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10 July 7, 2010 -

Each state is required to check its child abuse registry when an individual has resided in the state within the past five years. Because of budgetary constraints, the Department is adding a fee to cover the administrative co sts that occur when these ch ecks are provided. This rule provides the guidelines and fee for an Idaho Child Protection Central Registry Check. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(a)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of these rule s are appropriate for the following reasons: This temporary fee rule is needed to protect children from immediate danger. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid immediate danger and the fee is described herein: The fee amount for providing the Idaho Child Protection Central Registry checks is based on costs incurred to complete each check. The fee am ount to be charged to other states is $20 per check. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: The Department estimates that approximately 840 registry checks will generate $16,900 in additional revenue to the dedicated fund for SFY 2011, and will have no fiscal impact to the state general fund. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220, Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because this rule change is n ecessary to protect the public health, sa fety, or welfare, and to comply with governing law.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Title 39, Chapter 11, Idaho Code, was amended to provide a statewide system for the protection of children in daycare facilities. The statutory changes were effective on January 1, 2010, and necessitate corresponding changes and clarification in this chapter of rules. The Department presented rules to the 2010 Legislature that were rejected. These rules are being published as temporary rules, in order to have rules effective on July 1, 2010, with changes to address concerns of the legislature. These rule changes provide requirements and clarification for areas related to daycare licensing that include: safety and health standards, licensure requirements, susp ension, denial, and revocation of licenses. While amending these child care licensing rules for daycare standards, other updates were made for consistency in language, clarification, deletion of obsolete language, and updating references. These amendments will help assure standards and processes to better protect the health and safety of children in child care licensed by the Department. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(a) and (b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: These temporary rules are necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of children in child care and daycare, and to comply with amendments to statutes effective January 1, 2010. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid imme diate danger and the fee is described herein: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: The Department estimates the anticipated cost for SFY 2011 is $69,000. This cost will be covered by the Federal Child Care Development Funds which is 100 percent federally funded. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220, Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted this year, 2010, because extensive rulemaking negotiations were held in 2009 under Docket No. 16-0602- 0901, to meet new statutory requirements effective January 1, 2010.

LEGAL AUTHORITY. Under 56-1003, 56-1004A, and 56-1005(8), Idaho Code, the Idaho Legislature authorizes the Department of Health and Welfare and the Board of Health and Welfare to adopt and enforce rules governing standards and procedures for licens ureing or certification of daycare centers, group daycare facilities, family daycare homes, foster homes, children's agencies, and children's residential care facilities, children's camps, and children's therapeutic outdoo r programs which are maintained or operated with in Idaho. (7-1-09) (7-1-10)T 001. TITLE, SCOPE, AND POLICY, PURPOSE, EXCEPTIONS, AND EXEMPTIONS TO LICENSING . 01. Title . The title of this chapter of rules is IDAPA 16.06.02, \"Rules Governing Standards for Child Care Licensing.\" (7-1-09) 02. Scope . These rules establish minimum standards and procedures for the licens ureing, or certification of maintaining, and operating the following facilities or programs within Idaho: (7-1-10)T a. Daycare ,; cChildren's agencies , and ; (7-1-10)T f. cChildren's residential care facilities, including non-accredited residential schools ,; (7-1-10)T g. cChildren's camps providing child care in Idaho.

It is the policy of the Department to assure that children of this state receive adequate substitute parental care in the event of absence, temporary or permanent inability of parents to provide care and protection for their children or the parents are seeking a lternative twenty-four (24) hour long-term care for their children. This policy is based on the fact that children ar e vulnerable and not capable of protecting themselves. When parents, for any reason have relinquished their children's care to others, there arises the possibility of certain risks to those children's lives, health and safety which the commun ity as a whole must protect against. This requires the offsetting statutory protection of review and, in certain instances, licensing or registration. (7-1-09) 04. Purpose .
