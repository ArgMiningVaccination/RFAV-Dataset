Yes! Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), which is the only polio vaccine that has been given in the United States since 2000, protects 99 - 100 percent of people who get all the recommended doses. Among both children and adults, IPV has long proven safe and effective. IPV does not contain any live virus, and it cannot cause polio. Given in either the arm or the leg depending on the patient's age, it's critical to get all recommended doses for the best protection possible. Learn more about [IPV at CDC's Polio vaccination website.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/) Who should get immunized against polio? - All unvaccinated children (17 years of age or younger) or those children not up to date with immunizations should get immunized. This is particularly urgent if they live, work, attend school, or have frequent social interactions with [communities where poliovirus has been repeatedly detected in wastewater](/diseases/communicable/polio/wastewater.htm)which currently includes Rockland, Orange, and Sullivan Counties. - Most adults (18 years of age or older) are already up to date with their polio vaccine series. Adults who were born and raised in the United States or outside the United States can assume they were vaccinated for polio as children, unless there are specific reasons to believe they were not vaccinated. - Adults who live or work in the areas where poliovirus has been repeatedly detected in wastewater (Rockland, Orange, and Sullivan Counties) and are unvaccinated, under-vaccinated, or don't believe they are vaccinated should get all recommended vaccine doses. - New York adults outside of these areas who are unvaccinated, unsure of their vaccination status, or not up to date with vaccinations should consult with a healthcare provider. If vaccination is recommended and a provider does not have doses on hand, New Yorkers should contact their local health department. When should children get vaccinated against polio? As part of routine childhood immunization, children should get inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to protect against polio. In accordance with CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations, children should get four doses total, with one dose at each of the following ages: |Dose 1||6 weeks |Dose 4||4 years through 6 years old| Children who have not started their polio vaccine series or who are delayed in getting all recommended doses should start as soon as possible or finish their series by following the recommended catch-up schedule. For more information, see [CDC's Vaccine Schedules for Parents](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/schedules/). If I am not vaccinated, not up to date with vaccinations, or unsure of my vaccination status, what should I do? - Adults who live or work in the areas where poliovirus has been repeatedly detected (Rockland County, Orange County, and Sullivan County) and don't believe they are vaccinated should get vaccinated. - Adults who live or work in these areas and who have only had 1 or 2 doses of the polio vaccine in the past should get the remaining 1 or 2 doses - it does not matter how long it has been since the earlier doses. - People starting the polio immunization series after 4 years of age who are unvaccinated or are unsure if they have been immunized should receive a total of 3 doses of IPV: - The first dose at any time - The second dose 1 to 2 months later - The third dose 6 to 12 months after the second - New York adults outside of these areas who are unvaccinated, unsure of their vaccination status, or not up to date with vaccinations should consult with a healthcare provider. If vaccination is recommended and a provider does not have doses on hand, New Yorkers should contact their local health department. If I am unsure or can't locate proof of my or my child's vaccination status, what should I do? New Yorkers who are unsure of their own or their child's vaccination status should contact their healthcare provider or immunization clinic. If your child is under 19 years old, their healthcare provider is required to record their polio immunizations to the New York State Immunization System (NYSIIS) and should have that information available. A core component of CDC's childhood immunization schedule and required by [NYSDOH for all school-aged children](/prevention/immunization/schools/school_vaccines/), most children and adults are already vaccinated. But adults who live or work in the areas where poliovirus has been repeatedly detected (Rockland County, Orange County, and Sullivan County) and don't believe they are vaccinated should get vaccinated. Who should get a booster dose? One lifetime booster dose of IPV should be offered to adults 18 years of age and older who have previously completed their polio vaccination series and are at the highest risk of infection. This includes: - Individuals working in a laboratory or healthcare setting and handling specimens that might contain polioviruses. In New York State, this may include individuals who collect or work with wastewater specimens for poliovirus testing. - Healthcare providers or other caregivers who have close contact with a person who could be infected with poliovirus. In New York State, this would include: - Healthcare workers who work in areas with community transmission of poliovirus and who could care for patients with poliovirus (e.g., urgent care, emergency department, neurology, pediatrics). - Individuals who will or might have exposure to a person known or suspected to be infected with poliovirus, such as household members and other close contacts of a case or suspect case who provide care. - Child care or pre-K providers who work in areas with community transmission of poliovirus and provide diapering or toileting care or assistance. - Individuals traveling to a country where there is a documented increased risk of exposure to poliovirus, in accordance with [CDC guidance for travelers](https://www.cdc.gov/polio/what-is-polio/travelers.html). Areas considered to have community transmission of poliovirus include those where poliovirus has been repeatedly detected in [wastewater](/diseases/communicable/polio/wastewater.htm). At this time, that includes Rockland, Orange, and Sullivan Counties. At this time, booster doses are not recommended for individuals traveling to the New York City metropolitan area, including Rockland, Orange, or Sullivan Counties, merely because of their travel status. What side effects should I expect after polio immunization(s), for me or my child? You or your child may not notice any changes after getting your polio shots. But it's also possible to feel a little \"under the weather.\" This can happen after any vaccine. Following IPV, you or your child may have a sore spot where the shot was given. Importantly, IPV has not been known to cause serious problems, and most people do not have any problems with it. Learn more about [IPV at CDC's Polio vaccination website](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/). Can IPV give me polio? No! The IPV vaccine, which does not contain live virus, cannot give you polio. What is the oral polio vaccine (OPV), and can it give people polio? OPV, which is no longer licensed or available in the United States, is a type of polio vaccine that is used in other parts of the world. Children receive doses of the vaccine by drops in the mouth. The virus strain in OPV doesn't cause polio, but if it spreads among an under-vaccinated population, it can - very rarely - mutate into a form that can cause disease. Since 2000, only IPV has been used in the United States to eliminate the risk of [vaccine-derived poliovirus](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/vaccine-derived-poliovirus-faq.html) that can occur with OPV. For more information, see the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI)'s webpage [About Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) here](https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/faq/). How can people pay for the polio vaccine? Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to the doctor. If you don't have health insurance, or if your insurance does not cover vaccines for your child, the [Vaccines for Children Program (VFC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/) may be able to help. This program helps families of eligible children who might not otherwise have access to vaccines. [To find out if your child is eligible](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/parents/qa-detailed.html), visit the [VFC website](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/) or ask your child's doctor. You can also contact your [State VFC coordinator](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/contacts-state.html). Adults can also see [Finding](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/find-vaccines.html) and [Paying Vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/pay-for-vaccines.html) or [Find a Travel Medicine Clinic](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/find-clinic). Get immunized! Make sure you and your children are up to date with polio immunizations. Local health departments, including the [Rockland County Department of Health (RCDOH)](https://rocklandgov.com/departments/health/communicable-diseases/polio/), are hosting free polio vaccine clinics. New Yorkers can also contact a healthcare provider, clinic, or local health department in their area. Scheduling information: [Rockland "}
