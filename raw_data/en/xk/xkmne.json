PNEUMOVAX 23 will not prevent disease caused by capsular types of pneumococcus other than those contained in the vaccine. What are the contraindications, warnings and precautions, and most common adverse reactions for PNEUMOVAX\u00ae23 (Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent)? What are the contraindications, warnings and precautions, and most common adverse reactions for PNEUMOVAX\u00ae23 (Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent)? Do not administer PNEUMOVAX 23 to individuals with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to any component of the vaccine. Defer vaccination with PNEUMOVAX 23 in persons with moderate or severe acute illness. Use caution and appropriate care in administering PNEUMOVAX 23 to individuals with severely compromised cardiovascular and/or pulmonary function in whom a systemic reaction would pose a significant risk. Available human data from clinical trials of PNEUMOVAX 23 in pregnancy have not established the presence or absence of a vaccine-associated risk. Since elderly individuals may not tolerate medical interventions as well as younger individuals, a higher frequency and/or a greater severity of reactions in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Persons who are immunocompromised, including persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a diminished immune response to PNEUMOVAX 23. PNEUMOVAX 23 may not be effective in preventing pneumococcal meningitis in patients who have chronic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage resulting from congenital lesions, skull fractures, or neurosurgical procedures. The most common adverse reactions, reported in >10% of subjects vaccinated with PNEUMOVAX 23 for the first time in a clinical injection-site pain/soreness/tenderness, and myalgia. For subjects aged 65 years or older in a clinical study, systemic adverse reactions which were determined by the investigator to be vaccine-related were higher following revaccination than following initial vaccination.

The vaccine is used directly as supplied. No dilution or reconstitution is necessary. Administer PNEUMOVAX 23 intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the deltoid muscle or lateral mid-thigh. Do not inject intravascularly or intradermally. - Single-Dose Vial Administer a single 0.5 mL dose of PNEUMOVAX 23 using a sterile needle and syringe. Discard vial after use. - Single-Dose, Prefilled Syringe Administer the entire contents of the single-dose, prefilled syringe per standard protocol using a sterile needle. Discard syringe after use. How is PNEUMOVAX\u00ae23 (Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent) prepared for administration? Vaccine Polyvalent) prepared for administration? Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. If either of these two conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered. Do not mix PNEUMOVAX 23 with other vaccines in the same syringe or vial. Use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual patient to prevent transmission of infectious agents from one person to another. - Single-Dose Vial Withdraw 0.5 mL from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe free of preservatives, antiseptics, and detergents. - Single-Dose, Prefilled Syringe The package does not contain a needle. Attach a sterile needle to the prefilled syringe by twisting in a clockwise direction until the needle fits securely on the syringe. Can PNEUMOVAX\u00ae23 (Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent) be administered concurrently with other vaccines? Can PNEUMOVAX\u00ae23 (Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent) be administered concurrently with other vaccines? Limited safety and immunogenicity data from clinical trials are available on the concurrent administration of PNEUMOVAX 23 and vaccines other than ZOSTAVAX\u00ae(Zoster Vaccine Live). In a randomized clinical study, a reduced immune response to ZOSTAVAX as measured by gpELISA was observed in individuals who received concurrent administration of PNEUMOVAX 23 and ZOSTAVAX compared with individuals who received these vaccines 4 weeks apart. Consider administration of the two vaccines separated by at least 4 weeks. Can PNEUMOVAX\u00ae23 (Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent) be administered with vaccines for COVID-19?
