Non toxic and completely in alignment with nature, Lulani Moon herbal incense has many aromatic layers and some may be more pleasant than others as the intention is about connection to the plant realm rather than the aromatic qualities. Description Celebrating the Lights Return Y U L E: Yule is a word of Germanic origin which refers to a holiday celebrated at and around the winter solstice from which many Christmas traditions were taken. (Witchipedia) For those in the Southern hemisphere, the night frosts blanket the Earth, the darkness fills every space of a trees decidious form and the wind speaks of cold curiosities as a slowing of all life takes place.. The wheel of life keeps turning, and it is at the time of the Winter Solstice, we are reminded that the light will return. Yule Ritual Herbal Incense is to honour the Winter Solstice.. A warm blend of floral spices, resins & berries to evoke stillness & illumination. A highly aromatic blend to be shared throughout the festive season, this blend has all the feels of Christmas warmth!! Warming and comforting to burn throughout the winter season. I love this blend Uses Meditation, Prayer Work, Healing work, Practitioner tools, purifying spaces, clearing the air, and personal enjoyment Although there has not been many studies based on incense as \" aromatic medicine\", there are some reputable reports on herbs when offered as a smoke, has the potential to create anti bacterial & antimicrobial qualities. Lulani Moon herbal incense is burned on a charcoal disc for you to enjoy and to connect to the Spirit of smoke. How to use To burn your incense, simply sprinkle a pinch onto a lit charcoal disk and bring your attention to the smoke as it dances around your space. I recommend opening windows while this takes place as, the smoke will remove the unwanted energies and carry it away. Only the smallest amount is needed to do the work. IMPORTANT! NEVER leave burning incense unattended as it may cause fire.
