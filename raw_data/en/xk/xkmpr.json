Sometimes, those experiences find them dazzled by a butterfly or nest filled with cheeping chicks. But other times, they're left with grass stains, ripped pants, and bug bites. Fortunately, while bug bites can certainly be temporarily unpleasant, they're often nothing to worry about. What's more, in many cases, your child's discomfort can be quickly soothed with something you already have in your home. Ahead, we'll discuss the most common types of bug bites your child might come home with, along with the remedies that will help them feel better fast, and when to reach out to a health care provider for further assistance. What Does Heat Rash Look Like in Kids? Mosquito Bites Mosquito bites are incredibly ubiquitous and typically create an itchy, red, raised bump on the skin where the bite occurred. \"They are by far the most commonly seen bug bite in the office,\" says Sara Guerrero-Duby, MD, a pediatrician with Dayton Children's Hospital. \"Young children frequently have larger reactions due to their sensitive skin.\" While you don't want your child to itch a mosquito bite directly (or at the very least, they should try their hardest not to) as it can lead to a secondary infection, there are ways to sate the urge to itch and tame the symptom. \"Itching the opposite part of the body or around the bite may help, as well as applying ice,\" explains Sarah Lazarus, DO, an emergency department physician at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. If they simply can't resist touching the bite, Dr. Guerrero-Duby suggests pressing on it. \"Firm, direct pressure for 10 seconds on the bite can push the itch chemical away from the area,\" she says, noting that you could also try applying heat if ice doesn't seem to do the trick. A mixture of baking soda and water can also help ease the itch-factor, along with over-the-counter (OTC) anti-itch creams. Contact a health care provider any time you notice signs of infection in a bug bite. An infected bug bite may appear red, swollen, or warm, and could have a red streak spreading outward from the bite itself. The Most Common Skin Rashes in Children and Their Causes Bee, Wasp, and Hornet Stings Stings from bees, wasps, and hornets are more painful than mosquito bites, often causing redness, swelling, and pain. Before treating these symptoms, check to see if the stinger is still in the skin. If it is, Dr. Lazarus suggests gently removing it with tweezers before continuing with treatment. \"Applying ice to the area may decrease the discomfort of stings,\" says Dr. Guerrero-Duby. \"Or applying a small paste of baking soda and water to the bee sting for 15 to 20 minutes can reduce pain.\" If your child continues to complain, you can use OTC options like Motrin or Tylenol to curb pain or an oral antihistamine to reduce swelling. Also important: While only about 3% of children who are stung by bees will experience an allergic reaction, and only a tiny fraction of those will lead to anaphylactic shock, be on the lookout for any signs of distress. \"If your child develops hives and vomiting, vomiting and shortness of breath, or shortness of breath and hives after a bee sting, please seek medical care immediately,\" urges Dr. Lazarus. Tick Bites Tick bites are usually painless and don't cause many local symptoms. Ticks will remain on the skin after they bite, so seeing a tick on your child is typically the way you identify that they have been bitten. Any symptoms that result from a tick bite are not from the bite themselves, but rather from any diseases that the tick may have been carrying, such as Lyme disease, Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), or Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). Common symptoms of these illnesses include fever, aches and pains, and distinctive rashes that look like a bulls eye. Your child probably isn't going to like it, but removing the tick is essential. \"You have to pull the tick off,\" says Dr. Guerrero-Duby. \"Firmly grip the tick on both sides, with fingers or tweezers, and pull back directly to prevent breaking the pincer or mouth off. Please remember things like petroleum jelly, fingernail polish, alcohol swabs, ice cubes, or fire from matches do not make a tick release its grip.\" Once the tick has been removed, not much further care is needed. \"Wash with warm soapy water and keep an eye out for rash and fever,\" says Dr. Lazarus. If any of these symptoms develop, it's crucial to reach out to a health care provider immediately. Ant Bites \"During an ant bite, an ant releases formic acid, which can cause localized swelling, redness and a papule or pustule,\" explains Dr. Lazarus. \"Ant bites appear different from mosquito bites since they have a small fluid-filled blister.\" The most dangerous ant bites come from fire ants, one of which can sting multiple times. Their name comes from the burning sensation that their bite causes, which happens immediately and typically subsides within 10 minutes. \"Cleaning the area with soap and water to remove the secretions helps. Basil- and thyme-seeped cool water will contain tannins, which can denature the secretions,\" says Dr. Guerrero-Duby. You can use that water to clean the area. \"Chamomile or mint tea bags can reduce the sting,\" she adds. Those should be soaked in cold water for 10 to 15 minutes and then placed on the bites for 10 minutes. An anaphylactic reaction to fire ant stings does happen in 1 to 2% of children. If your child develops hives, exhibits trouble breathing or swallowing, hoarseness, or slurred speech, you should call 911. In the event that your child has stomach pain, vomiting, or fever, or if they have more than five stings per 10 pounds of weight, reach out to a health care provider immediately. Fly Bites While not as common as the others on this list, flies such as the black fly, horse fly, deer fly, and sand fly do sometimes bite humans, causing localized redness, swelling and serious pain\u2014much of which comes from the fact that flies, and therefore their bites, are quite large as far as insects go. Fly bites can be treated using many of the remedies above, including thorough washing, applying ice, and using OTC pain medications. In rare instances, there may be allergic reactions to fly bites such as hives or wheezing, in which case you should contact a health care provider. Not Sure What to Do After a Bug Bite? While bug bites can be painful or uncomfortable, most symptoms will start to subside and improve fairly quickly. Any symptoms or reactions that don't remain localized to the bite itself, such as vomiting, hives or a rash, are typically a sign of something more serious, such as an allergic reaction, and warrant a call to a pediatrician or health care provider. It's also worth noting that local skin infections are not uncommon complications of bug bites; any worsening redness, tenderness, or new fevers may be signs of an infection, and should be evaluated further by a health care professional. 10 Home Remedies for Seasonal Allergies Was this page helpful?
