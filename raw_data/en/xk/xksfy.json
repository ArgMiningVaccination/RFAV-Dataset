Services We Offer [More Services](/services/) About Dr. Thompson \"I'm Just An Educator Helping People Get Connected With Their Bodies. If You're Coachable, Your Body Will Heal Itself.\" - Dr. John A. Thompson A native of Pasadena, California, Dr. John A. Thompson has dedicated his life to helping others achieve optimal health. It wasn't always this way, however. His interest in health and wellness began with dis-ease. On track to become a lawyer, in his second year of undergraduate school, Dr. Thompson began experiencing gastrointestinal discomfort, cramping, pain, and fatigue. When he presented these issues to traditional medical doctors, he received no answers. Exploratory surgery was offered, but that wasn't a risk he was willing to take. \"It's Interesting We Pay All This Money For Tuition And Still Don't Know How To Feed Ourselves.\" These were the words that changed everything. While searching for a safer, alternative approach to invasive surgery, a colleague made this statement and introduced Dr. Thompson to the concept of healing through nutrition. Dr. Thompson's unexplained ailment resolved completely after only 2 weeks of dramatically altering his diet and lifestyle. Now empowered and fascinated by the body's ability to heal itself with the right tools, he took a break from his law studies for a little over a year to dedicate his time and energy to self-study and changing his focus to the field of medicine. This proved to be a transformative experience in Dr. Thompson's life. He returned to school fully committed to studying the connections between diet, lifestyle, symptoms, and disease. Dr. Thompson obtained his medical degree in osteopathic medicine from Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona, California. DOs & MDs - What's The Difference? DOs and MDs are similar in medical training and licensure. As a DO or Doctor of Osteopathy, Dr. Thompson is licensed to practice medicine at the same level as his physician counterparts in allopathic medicine \u2014 Medical Doctors, or MDs. DOs are licensed to prescribe medication, perform invasive procedures, and practice in all medical specialties. However, there are distinct differences that prompted Dr. Thompson to choose osteopathy. He appreciated the emphasis on treating the body as a whole rather than viewing systems in isolation and enjoyed the additional training osteopaths receive in musculoskeletal medicine and the greater focus on prevention. One unique aspect of the osteopathic medical school experience is that students often get the opportunity to train and gain exposure at different medical institutions for their clinical practicums. Dr. Thompson was privileged to complete rotations at the prestigious Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles. He then completed an internship in general medicine at Oakland General Hospital in Michigan, and a 3-year allopathic residency in the specialty of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at the Detroit Medical Center Rehabilitation Institute, which he completed in 1996. After medical school, Dr. Thompson obtained licensure in four states: Michigan, Virginia, California, and Nevada, where he opened the Desert Oasis Clinic in 1999. He considers himself a coach for clients who feel powerless in their health journey. \"For The Last 22 Years, I've Made This Practice Connecting The Dots And Helping People Get Better.\" - Dr. John A.

Thompson What Our Patients Are Saying Fran N. I cannot praise the staff and especially the Doctor enough. I have been going to Dr. Thompson for about 12 years now and absolutely feel he has kept me feeling great with hormone replacement therapy. Michael P. Dr. Thompson is the best doctor of osteopath you'll find anywhere. I used to have the worst problems with allergies. He was the first to accurately identify the cause and treat the problem. That was in 2009 and I still am allergy free. He's also succesfully reduced my A1C and provided me with testosterone implants for the last few years. I feel amazing everyday. Great staff, too. Highly recommend! Rob S. Absolutely love Dr Thompson and his staff. Their alternative and holistic therapies have really helped me and my health. Most other doctors said I would need surgery yet prolo therapy and PRP injections have me good as new! Crystal S. Dr. Thompson is amazing and straight forward. If there were more Doctors like him there would be a lot more happy and healthy people in Vegas!!! Katherine H. Absolutely the best doctor I or my family have been to see.
