Proper formation of neural circuits is dependent on the elegant and co-ordinated development of its component neurons. Each neural circuit is composed of different types of neurons, drastically varying in morphology. These differences are prominently seen in the neuronal dendrites which are processes that allow the neuron to receive information from connected neurons. The shape, length, and number of dendritic branches of a neuronal cell are critical determinants of its synaptic connections. Equally, synapses are key players in determining dendritic structure. In vivo studies done in tadpoles and zebrafish have shown that formation of chemical synapses guides the trajectory of dendritic growth and affects dendritic branch stability. However, the relationship between electrical synapses (or \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2gap junctions\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2) and dendrite development has not been fully explored. Gap junctions are intercellular bridges connecting the cytosol of two cells. They are formed by the docking of two hemi-channels, each of which is formed by six connexin protein sub-units in vertebrates. Knock-down and knock-out experiments done in invertebrates and vertebrates demonstrate that disrupting gap junction formation during critical early periods can hamper the development of chemical synapses. We hypothesized that signalling via gap junctions could guide dendritic development even before chemical synapses start forming, thus providing a framework for their assembly. We tested our hypothesis in cerebellar Purkinje neurons (PN) of zebrafish larvae. These neurons express the gap junction protein Gjd2b, the fish orthologue of Cx36 which is the most abundant neuronal connexin in mammals. We observed that globally knocking out Gjd2b in zebrafish significantly affected the growth of PN dendritic arbors. In imaging of PNs at 5-8 days post fertilisation (dpf) showed that mutant neurons had significantly reduced total dendritic branch lengths on all days of observation. Probing this further, we observed reduced hourly growth rate of gjd2b-/- PN dendrites, attributed to a reduced rate of branch elongation, and not branch retraction. Analysis of single dendrites in PNs overexpressing Gjd2b-mCherry showed that branches with at least one Gjd2b punctum elongated more than the ones without any puncta, suggesting a local regulating effect of the protein. We then investigated the possible mechanisms by which Gjd2b regulates PN dendritic arbor growth. Rescue experiments done by overexpressing functional and non-functional Gjd2b-mCherry showed that a conducting pore is important for the proper growth of dendrites. Independently, work in our group revealed that there was an enhanced expression of the mRNA of CaMKII isoforms in the brains of gjd2b-/- fish. Based on this, we looked at the effects of inhibiting CaMKII activity on PN dendritic growth in mutants and observed a complete rescue of dendritic lengths at 7dpf. This result demonstrates that inhibition of CaMKII activity is sufficient to rescue PN dendritic growth defects even in the absence of Gjd2b, suggesting that Gjd2b may be acting via CaMKII signaling. In conclusion, my thesis shows that Gjd2b guides dendritic arborisation, regulating dendrite growth at the level of single branches. This control is possibly exerted via pore-mediated signalling and by regulating CaMKII levels. My results provide strong evidence for the role of gap junction protein in morphological development of neural circuits and expand our understanding of the factors involved in neurons attaining their proper structure and consequently, their function.

My project has two aims (I) to identify new genes in the presynaptic vesicle (PSV) transport pathway & (II) to understand the contribution of the transport machinery in axon regeneration. I: Identifying new genes in the PSV transport pathway I am interested in the motor Kinesin-3, UNC-104, in C elegans which exclusively transports synaptic vesicles in neurons. The UNC-104-PSV transport pathway can have several steps- molecules that unfold the motor to allow interaction with cargoes, other proteins that along with UNC-104 help in recognizing cargo (e.g. DENN/MADD), molecules that act with UNC-104 to improve its motility characteristics (e.g. SYD-2) other motors (Kinesin-1) that participate with or in parallel with UNC-104 to transport cargoes and molecules that allow release of cargo at correct locations. The central premise of my work is to identify more proteins in the PSV transport pathway, some of which may be associated with UNC-104. To do so, I performed an enhancer screen, using a sensitized genetic background in which PSV transport and behaviour is partially compromised. My screen yielded 16 candidates with varying degrees of locomotion defects, severely reduced PSVs in the synapses and axon, increased PSV accumulations in the cell body and I have further characterized them. II. Role of UNC-16 in axon regeneration The process of intracellular transport has been shown to be crucial for the signalling machinery post-trauma as well as for the actual regeneration process. We are interested in the role different molecules associated with the transport machinery and the cytoskeletal dynamics play in the neuronal process regeneration. I have previously developed a laser axotomy assay in the lab with which we set up the regeneration assay. We see that unc-16 (a JIP3 scaffold protein) mutants show an increase in the rate at which the neurons regenerate post laser-induced axotomy. They also display an \u00e2early take-off\u00e2 phenomenon \u00e2 the neurons start regenerating at an earlier time-point compared to wild-type. We have also seen that this increase in neuronal regeneration happens through the MAPKKK (DLK-1) pathway. It has been reported that DLK-1 is required for neuronal regeneration post injury in many systems including C. elegans. I have explored in detail the mechanism through which neuronal regeneration is regulated by the interconnected roles of DLK-1, UNC-16 and cytoskeletal dynamics and its possible read-out in terms of functionality of the regenerating neurons. Our study identifies a key role for UNC-16 in balancing the rate of axon regrowth to enable functional recovery.

The disease prevalence is estimated to be 1 case per 500 persons in the general population. Variants in genes encoding the sarcomere and signaling proteins critical for contractile function have been identified to cause cardiomyopathies. Despite these successful advancements in understanding the molecular bases of cardiomyopathy, a large proportion of individuals (~ 50%) with a clinical diagnosis of cardiomyopathy remain unexplained, suggesting that novel disease-associated genes remain to be discovered. Also, there are currently no curative therapies for cardiomyopathies. To bridge these gaps and meaningfully translate the genetic findings into clinical practice, I will be outlining our robust research program at inStem using approaches that span patient exomes, stem cells to animal models. These findings shed light on new genes, mechanisms, and drug targets for cardiomyopathy. 10:15 AM, Tuesday, Feb 15, 2022 | Remote VCTalk by Dr Harsha G Suresh unanchored polyubiquitin chains and protein homeostasis' 09:30 AM, Monday, Feb 21, 2022 | Remote VCThesis Seminar by Ms Bharti Nawalpuri protein 03:00 PM, Monday, Feb 2022 Seminar by Mr Ashutosh Shukla on 'Stress, Amygdala and Innate Responses to Emotionally Salient Ultrasonic Vocalization Calls in Rats' 03:00 PM, Monday, Feb 28, 2022 | Remote VCTalk by Prof K.
