Acupuncture is the insertion of thin, metal, single-use needles to stimulate specific points (acupoints) throughout the body's various meridians. There are over 300 commonly used acupoints located on 20 meridians of the human body. Acupuncture treatment protocols are based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory and diagnosis. It is meant to promote the smooth flow of Qi through the body and restore the balance of Yin & Yang, thereby reviving health to the body and mind. When should I see a Naturopath? You should seek a board-certified Naturopathic Doctor if you would like a primary healthcare provider who will take the time to assess all aspects of your health, and provide natural, non-pharmaceutical treatment options to optimize your health. These treatment options may include lifestyle and dietary recommendations, vitamins and minerals, herbal remedies, acupuncture, comprehensive lab testing and more. When Should I See an Acupuncturist? You should seek a licensed Acupuncturist if you would like to try acupuncture and/or cupping to address your acute or chronic health concerns, using a body of medicine (TCM) that has been in existence for over 2500 years. Acupuncture has shown proven benefit with chronic pain, fertility, hormonal imbalances, recurrent migraines, and more. What Is The Difference Between Acupuncture and a Naturopathic Treatment? In a sense, Naturopathic medicine is a Western form of natural medicine, using Western herbal medicine and diagnosis/terminology. During an initial consultation with a Naturopathic Doctor, you may expect a head-to-toe assessment similar to seeing any other primary healthcare provider, but treatment options offered would exclude any pharmaceuticals. Any natural forms of treatment such as Western botanicals, vitamins/minerals, dietary recommendations and acupuncture are under the scope of Naturopathic care. Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an Eastern form of natural medicine, using TCM theory and pulse and tongue diagnostic methods. An Acupuncturist may discuss your health concerns using Eastern theory and terminology, and treatment mainly focuses on the use of acupuncture and cupping.

What Our Acupuncture/Naturopathic Patients Say (More than 264 5-star Google Reviews) I have been coming to the Madison Chiropractic Clinic for over 6 years. After I raved about the clinic to my husband, he also started coming, as well as other family members. I go for monthly massage therapy as well as appointments with our Naturopath. It really is a one-stop shop for your all-around health needs. They are courteous, professional and have a group of practitioners that have a passion for their professions and the people they take care of. Julie: can't imagine life without you! (and neither can my mommy achy muscles.) Absolutely amazing experience at Madison Sports Clinic. I have been a regular patient and have experienced the massage therapy, physio therapy, chiropractic and naturopathic services there. The staff is always friendly and accommodating right when I walk in the door. Observing my overall health/wellness and body mobility improvement has been quite impressive! I am very happy with my pain reduction and will continue to visit. Been going here since Oct 2015 - amazing service at all levels. From the warm greeting of the reception staff to their experienced and friendly medical staff, all around great service. I've used them for Chiropractic, Massage and Naturopathic services (including acupuncture). All great! Highly recommend. Very friendly and professional staffs at the clinic. The knowledge, experience, patience and care from Dr. Rodney, Slava and Dr. Ma for chiropractor, physiotherapy and naturopathic services were very pleasant and helpful. Would definitely recommend friends and family to check them out as well. I have been using the Madisson clinic for at least 3 years on and off with different physical injuries, car accident, everyone in their specific fields, either physiotherapy, chiropractic, naturopathic acupuncture or massage and even recently a new pair of orthotics, all done professionally. Everyone are all so kind and caring and ready to answer any questions. Thanks guys for all the good care. Book Your Next Visit Please book your next visit, even if it's a check up!
