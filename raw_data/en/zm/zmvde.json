Let us tell you all about the benefits of a phosphatidylcholine IV and how it works!", "sitename": "Rahav Wellness", "date": "2021-05-22", "cleaned_text": "What in the world is phosphatidylcholine? And, why would you want to have a phosphatidylcholine infusion? We admit it's a pretty big word, but we promise it's not as out there as it sounds! Phosphatidylcholine, called PC for short, is simply one of the main components of lecithin... a micronutrient you've probably seen listed in various places, such as the label of your favorite multivitamin. PC is found in every cell membrane in your body. It's called a phospholipid, and it's made up of phosphorus, glycerol, and fatty acids. In the diet, it can be found naturally in foods like soybeans, nuts, seeds, egg yolks, and liver. Phosphatidylcholine is essential for intestinal, liver, and brain health. It also plays a key role in the metabolism of cholesterol and has an anti-inflammatory effect on the digestive system. Now that you know what phosphatidylcholine is, let's dive into what it does and how a phosphatidylcholine IV can benefit you! What is lecithin? As we mentioned above, phosphatidylcholine is a main component of lecithin. Lecithin is a substance that's made up of various fatty acids. It's found naturally in the body's tissues and has a variety of commercial and medical applications. In the body, lecithin works as an emulsifier. That means it suspends oils and fats to prevent them from mixing with other substances. The human body can produce a small amount of lecithin in the liver, but not enough to meet the body's requirements. The rest must come from food or supplements. Those who follow a plant-based diet are at higher risk of being deficient in lecithin (and phosphatidylcholine) because they don't eat meat or eggs. Deficiencies may lead to poor liver and brain function, fatigue, a higher risk of blood clots, and more. In supplement form, lecithin can help treat a host of issues, such as ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, dementia, and high cholesterol. What does phosphatidylcholine do? All of the cells in the human body are encapsulated with a membrane that's made up of a double layer of phospholipids. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most essential phospholipid and it's found in young, healthy cellular membranes. Unfortunately, when we're ill or aging, the amount of PC in the cellular membranes decreases. It is replaced with less efficient phospholipids that can trap and retain common toxic compounds like heavy metals and pesticides. These toxic substances compromise the cell membrane and inhibit effective communication between the cells. They can also impair cellular function at the mitochondrial level, which is the energy center of each cell. By making phosphatidylcholine available to the cells again, we can restore the cellular membranes to their former integrity. This improves the cells' ability to eliminate toxins across the membrane and transport nutrients more efficiently. Phosphatidylcholine is also a good source of choline. Choline is the main substance used to produce acetylcholine, which is a crucial neurotransmitter for memory and cognitive function. But that's not all! In addition to maintaining cell integrity and assisting in the production of acetylcholine, phosphatidylcholine also: - Assists in the breakdown of fats - Protects against liver damage - Protects the nerves - Makes up a large portion of the mucus that lines and protects the digestive system and gut - Builds a combination of proteins and fats which line and the lungs What is a phosphatidylcholine IV infusion and how is it administered? A phosphatidylcholine IV is an infusion that delivers PC directly into the bloodstream. This technique is much more efficient than taking an oral supplement because it completely bypasses the digestive system. It delivers the nutrient directly to the cells where it can do the most good. Of course, every patient is different, but most patients will receive between 8 to 10 phosphatidylcholine IV infusions over 1 to 2 months. The treatments themselves can take up to two hours. Phosphatidylcholine IV therapy is administered by our [highly trained IV technicians](https://rahavwellness.com/iv-therapy/) using sterile, medical-grade equipment and the purest ingredients. Our practitioners may also recommend that you follow your PC infusion with a [ glutathione IV](https://rahavwellness.com/iv-therapy/glutathione-iv/), or combine it with an [ion foot bath](https://rahavwellness.com/ion-detox-footbath/), as part of a comprehensive treatment plan to enhance the benefits. The therapy is virtually painless, and you can sit in a comfy recliner surfing the web, reading a book, napping, or listening to music throughout your entire treatment. The Benefits of a Phosphatidylcholine IV Just about anyone with age-related or chronic health issues can benefit from IV phosphatidylcholine. That's because age and chronic illness affect the functional integrity of cell membranes, which has a major impact on the vascular and neurological systems. By replenishing the supply of phosphatidylcholine to cells with an IV infusion, you can improve cellular function. Phosphatidylcholine supplementation through IV infusion is highly effective for improving mitochondrial function and allowing toxins such as chemicals, heavy metals, and organic pollutants to be exported more efficiently. The benefits of a phosphatidylcholine IV include: - Improved liver function - Improved energy - Improved overall brain health and memory - Improved vascular health and circulation - A stronger immune system - Improved male sexual function Conditions That Can Be Treated with a Phosphatidylcholine IV Any condition that is associated with poor cellular membrane health can be treated with PC supplementation. These include: - Fatty liver disease - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - Toxic Overload, Including Mold Toxicity - Recovery from Stroke and Brain Injury/Trauma - Autoimmune Disease - Neurodegenerative Disorders, Including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's Disease, Dementia, and Memory Loss - High Cholesterol and Heart Disease - Neuropathy and Other Nerve Disorders - Migraines - Ulcerative Colitis/Inflammatory Bowel Disease - Skin Issues, Including Eczema and Acne - PMS - Anxiety and Other Mood Disorders - Premature Aging Do phosphatidylcholine IVs really work? What does the science say? There is extensive research to back up the benefits of phosphatidylcholine for the vascular and neurological systems. For example, one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7782901/) shows that PC therapy can enhance concentration and improve memory, even in patients who have been diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. [Science has also proven](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(20)58787-5/fulltext) that PC reduces inflammation of the digestive system in patients suffering from issues like irritable bowel syndrome and ulcerative colitis. [According to another study](https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(10)00595-2/fulltext), it can help reduce the lipids that lead to fatty liver disease and even aid in liver repair. There's also [evidence to indicate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3572323/) that PC may help to prevent gastrointestinal damage related to the overuse of NSAIDs. Other scientific studies show that PC may help reduce the size of fat cells, dissolve gallstones, and much more. Of course, we've also seen the results of phosphatidylcholine intravenous therapy firsthand in our patients. In addition to the benefits outlined above, many of our patients report a dramatic improvement in their energy levels and overall health. Are there any risks or side effects? Most patients have no complaints after their phosphatidylcholine treatments. However, some people experience a temporary lowering of the blood pressure after treatment, which may result in lightheadedness. It's not dangerous, nor does it warrant discontinuing treatment. However, you should not drive until you are feeling back to normal. Rarely, a patient may experience loose stools or mild irritation at the injection site after treatment. These side effects usually go away within a few days. If you are pregnant, take any medications or supplements, or have a chronic illness you should let your technician know before receiving treatment, just to be safe. Wrapping Things Up If you suffer from any condition related to cell membrane health, you may benefit from phosphatidylcholine IV therapy. Our practitioners may also suggest additional supplementation and [detoxification therapies](https://rahavwellness.com/colonics/) to further enhance cellular health and improve organ function.
