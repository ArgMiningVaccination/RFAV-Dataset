(1) A lease, although subject to this Article, is also subject to any applicable: certificate of title statute of this State; certificate of title statute of another jurisdiction (Section 2A-105); or consumer protection statute of this State, or final consumer protection decision of a court of this State existing on the effective date of this Article. (2) In case of conflict between this Article, other than Sections 2A-105, 2A-304(3) and 2A-305(3), and a statute or decision referred to in subsection (1), the statute or decision controls. (3) Failure to comply with an applicable law has only the effect specified therein. \u00a72A-105. TERRITORIAL APPLICATION Of ARTICLE TO GOODS COVERED BY CERTIFICATE OF TITLE. Subject to the provisions of Sections 2A-304(3) and 2A-305(3), with respect to goods covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this State or of another jurisdiction, compliance and the effect of compliance or noncompliance with a certificate of title statute are governed by the law (including the conflict of laws rules) of the jurisdiction issuing the certificate until the earlier of (a) surrender of the certificate, or (b) four months after the goods are removed from that jurisdiction and thereafter until a new certificate of title is issued by another jurisdiction. \u00a72A-106. LIMITATION ON POWER OF PARTIES TO CONSUMER LEASE TO CHOOSE APPLICABLE LAW AND JUDICIAL FORUM. (1) If the law chosen by the parties to a consumer lease is that of a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in which the lessee resides at the time Chapter 249 821 822 Chapter 249 the lease agreement becomes enforceable or within 30 days thereafter, or in which the goods are to be used, the choice is not enforceable. (2) If the judicial forum chosen by the parties to a consumer lease is a forum that would not otherwise have jurisdiction over the lessee, the choice is not enforceable. \u00a72A-107. WAIVER OR RENUNCIATION OF CLAIM OR RIGHT AFTER DEFAULT. Any claim or right arising out of an alleged default or breach of warranty may be discharged in whole or in part without consideration by a written waiver or renunciation signed and delivered by the aggrieved party. \u00a72A-108. UNCONSCIONABILITY. If the court as a matter of law finds a lease contract or any clause of a lease contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made, the court may refuse to enforce the lease contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the lease contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result. With respect to a consumer lease, if the court as a matter of law finds that a lease contract or any clause of a lease contract has been induced by unconscionable conduct or that unconscionable conduct has occurred in the collection of a claim arising from a lease contract, the court may grant appropriate relief. Before making a finding of unconscionability under subsection (1) or (2), the court, on its own motion or that of a party, shall afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to the setting, purpose, and effect of the lease contract or clause thereof, or of the conduct. In an action in which the lessee claims unconscionability with respect to a consumer lease: If the court finds unconscionability under subsection (1) or (2), the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to the lessee. If the court does not find unconscionability and the lessee claiming unconscionability has brought or maintained an action he knew to be groundless, the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to the party against whom the claim is made. In determining attorney's fees, the amount of the recovery on behalf of the claimant under subsections (1) and (2) is not controlling. \u00a72A-109. OPTION TO ACCELERATE AT WILL. A term providing that one party or his successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral \"at will\", or \"when he deems himself insecure\" or in words of similar import must be construed to mean that he has power to do so only if he in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired. With respect to a consumer Tease, the burden of establishing good faith under subsection (1) is on the party who exercised the power; otherwise the burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against whom the power has been exercised. PART 2. FORMATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF LEASE CONTRACT \u00a72A-201. STATUTE OF FRAUDS. (1) A lease contract is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless: (a) the total payments to be made under the lease contract, excluding payments for options to renew or buy, are less than $1,000; or (b) there is a writing, signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's authorized agent, sufficient to indicate that a Chapter 249 823 lease contract has been made between the parties and to describe the goods leased and the lease term. (2) Any description of leased goods or of the lease term is sufficient and satisfies subsection (1)(b), whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described. (3) A writing is not insufficient because It omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon, but the lease contract is not enforceable under subsection (1)(b) beyond the lease term and the quantity of goods shown in the writing. (4) A lease contract that does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (I), but which is valid in other respects, is enforceable: if the goods are to be specially manufactured or obtained for the lessee and are not suitable for lease or sale to others in the ordinary course of the lessor's business, and the lessor, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances that reasonably indicate that the goods are for the lessee, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a lease contract was made, but the lease contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or with respect to goods that have been received and accepted by the lessee. (5) The lease term under a lease contract referred to in subsection (4) is: if there is a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's authorized agent specifying the lease term, the term so specified; if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony, or otherwise in court a lease term, the term so admitted; or a reasonable lease term. \u00a72A-202. FINAL WRITTEN EXPRESSION: PAROL OR EXTRINSIC EVIDENCE. Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented: by course of dealing or usage of trade or by course of perfomance; and by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement. \u00a72A-203. SEALS INOPERATIVE. The affixing of a seal to a writing evidencing a lease contract or an offer to enter into a lease contract does not render the writing a sealed instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to the lease contract or offer. \u00a72A-204. FORMATION IN GENERAL. A lease contract may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a lease contract. An agreement sufficient to constitute a lease contract may be found although the moment of its making is undetermined. Mar-- 824 chapter 249 (3) Although one or more terms are left open, a lease contract does not fall for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a lease contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy. \u00a72A-205. FIRM OFFERS. An offer by a merchant to lease goods to or from another person in a signed writing that by its terms gives assurance it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or, if no time is stated, for a reasonable time, but in no event may the period of irrevocability exceed 3 months. Any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror. \u00a72A-206. OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE IN FORMATION OF LEASE CONTRACT. (1) Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances, an offer to make a lease contract must be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances. (2) If the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance, an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance. \u00a72A-207. COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR PRACTICAL CONSTRUCTION. If a lease contract involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection is relevant to determine the meaning of the lease agreement. The express terms of a lease agreement and any course of performance, as well as any course of dealing and usage of trade, must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other; but if that construction is unreasonable, express terms control course of performance, course of performance controls both course of dealing and usage of trade, and course of dealing controls usage of trade. Subject to the provisions of Section 2A-208 on modification and waiver, course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance. \u00a72A-208. MODIFICATION, RESCISSION AND WAIVER. An agreement modifying a lease contract needs no consideration to be binding. A signed lease agreement that excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing may not be otherwise modified or rescinded, but, except as between merchants, such a requirement on a form supplied by a merchant must be separately signed by the other party. Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2), it may operate as a waiver. A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of a lease contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver. \u00a72A-209. LESSEE UNDER FINANCE LEASE AS BENEFICIARY OF SUPPLY CONTRACT. (1) The benefit of a supplier's promises to the lessor under the supply contract and of all warranties, whether express or implied, including those of any third party provided in connection with or as part of the supply contract, extends to the lessee to the extent of the lessee's leasehold interest under a finance lease related to the supply contract, but is subject to the terms of the warranty and of the supply contract and all defenses or claims arising thereform. The extension of the benefit of a supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee (Section 2A-209(1)) does not: (i) modify the rights and obligations of the parties to the supply contract, whether arising therefrom or otherwise, or (ii) impose any duty or liability under the supply contract on the lessee. Any modification or rescission of the supply contract by the supplier and the lessor is effective between the supplier and the lessee unless, before the modification or rescission, the supplier has received notice that the lessee has entered into a finance lease related to the supply contract. If the modification or rescission is effective between the supplier and the lessee, the lessor is deemed to have assumed, in addition to the obligations of the lessor to the lessee under the lease contract, promises of the supplier to the lessor and warranties that were so modified or rescinded as they existed and were available to the lessee before modification or rescission. In addition to the extension of the benefit of the supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee under subsection (I), the lessee retains all rights that the lessee may have against the supplier which arise from an agreement between the lessee and the supplier or under other law. \u00a72A-210. EXPRESS WARRANTIES. (1) Express warranties by the lessor are created as follows: Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the lessor to the lessee which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the affirmation or promise. Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the description. Any sample or model that is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods will conform to the sample or model. (2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the lessor use formal words, such as \"warrant\" or \"guarantee,\" or that the lessor have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the lessor's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty. \u00a72A-211. WARRANTIES AGAINST INTERFERENCE AND AGAINST INFRINGEMENT; LESSEE'S OBLIGATION AGAINST INFRINGEMENT. There is in a lease contract a warranty that for the lease term no person holds a claim to or interest in the goods that arose from an act or omission of the lessor, other than a claim by way of infringement or the like, which will interfere with the lessee's enjoyment of its leasehold interest. Except in a finance lease, there is in a lease contract by a lessor who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind a warranty that the goods are delivered free of the rightful claim of any person by way of infringement or the like. A lessee who furnishes specifications to a lessor or a supplier shall hold the lessor and the supplier harmless against any claim by way of infringement or the like that arises out of compliance with the specifications. \u00a72A-212. IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY. Except in a finance lease, a warranty that the goods will be merchantable is implied in a lease contract if the lessor is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind. Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as (a) pass without objection in the trade under the description in the lease agreement; Chapter 249 825 826 Chapter 249 in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description; are fit for the ordinary purposes for which goods of that type are used; run, within the variation permitted by the lease agreement, of even kind, quality, and quantity within each unit and among all units involved; are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the lease agreement may require; and conform to any promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label. (3) Other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade. \u00a72A-213. IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Except in a finance lease, if the lessor at the time the lease contract is made has reason to know of any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the lessee is relying on the lessor's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is in the lease contract an implied warranty that the goods will be fit for that purpose. \u00a72A-214. EXCLUSION OR MODIFICATION OF WARRANTIES. (1) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit a warranty must be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but, subject to the provisions of Section 2A-202 on parol or extrinsic evidence, negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that the construction is unreasonable. (2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention \"merchantability\", be by a writing, and be conspicuous. Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and be conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it is in writing, is conspicuous and states, for example, 'There is no warranty that the goods will be fit for a particular purpose'. (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), but subject to subsection (4), unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like 'as is,' or 'with all faults,\" or by other language that in common understanding calls the lessee's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty, if in writing and conspicuous; if the lessee before entering into the lease contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as desired or has refused to examine the goods, there is no implied warranty with regard to defects that an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed; and an implied warranty may also be excluded or modified by course of dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade. (4) To exclude or modify a warranty against interference or against infringement (Section 2A-211) or any part of it, the language must be specific, be by a writing, and be conspicuous, unless the circumstances, including course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade, give the lessee reason to know that the goods are being leased subject to a claim or interest of any person. \u00a72A-215. CUMULATION AND CONFLICT OF WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. Warranties, whether express or implied, must be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if that construction is unreasonable, the intention of the parties determines which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply: Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description. A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description. Express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. \u00a72A-216. THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES. A warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee under this Article, whether express or implied, extends to any natural person who may reasonably be expected to use, consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured by breach of the warranty. This section does not displace principles of law and equity that extend a warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee to other persons. The operation of this section may not be excluded, modified, or limited with respect to injury to the person of an individual to whom the warranty extends, but an exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty, including any with respect to rights and remedies, effective against the lessee is also effective against any beneficiary designated under this section. \u00a72A-217. IDENTIFICATION. Identification of goods as goods to which a lease contract refers may be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement, identification occurs: when the lease contract is made if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are existing and identified; when the goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the lessor as goods to which the lease contract refers, if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are not existing and identified; or when the young are conceived, if the lease contract is for a lease of unborn young of animals. \u00a72A-218. INSURANCE AND PROCEEDS. A lessee obtains an insurable interest when existing goods are identified to the lease contract even though the goods identified are nonconforming and the lessee has an option to reject them. If-a lessee has an insurable interest only by reason of the lessor's identification of the goods, the lessor, until default or insolvency or notification to the lessee that identification is final, may substitute other goods for those identified. Notwithstanding a lessee's insurable interest under subsections (1) and (2), the lessor retains an insurable interest until an option to buy has been exercised by the lessee and risk of loss has passed to the lessee. Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law. The parties by agreement may determine that one or more parties have an obligation to obtain and pay for insurance covering the goods and by agreement may determine the beneficiary of the proceeds of the insurance. \u00a72A-219. RISK OF LOSS. Except in the case of a finance lease, risk of loss is retained by the lessor and does not pass to the lessee. In the case of a finance lease, risk of loss passes to the lessee. Subject to the provisions of this Article on the effect of default on risk of loss (Section 2A-220), if risk of loss is to pass to the lessee and the time of passage is not stated, the following rules apply: Chapter 249 827 (a) If the lease contract requires or authorizes the goods to be shipped by carrier and it does not require delivery at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier; but if it does require delivery at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the lessee to take delivery. (b) If the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the lessee on acknowledgment by the bailee of the lessee's right to possession of the goods. (c) In any case not within subsection (a) or (b), the risk of loss passes to the lessee on the lessee's receipt of the goods if the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the lessee on tender of delivery. \u00a72A-220. EFFECT OF DEFAULT ON RISK OF LOSS. (1) Where risk of loss is to pass to the lessee and the time of passage is not stated: If a tender or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the lease contract as to give a right of rejection, the risk of their loss remains with the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, until cure or acceptance. If the lessee rightfully revokes acceptance, he, to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage, may treat the risk of loss as having remained with the lessor from the beginning. (2) Whether or not risk of loss is to pass to the lessee, if the lessee as to conforming goods already identified to a lease contract repudiates or is otherwise in default under the lease contract, the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage may treat the risk of loss as resting on the lessee for a commercially reasonable time. \u00a72A-221. CASUALTY TO IDENTIFIED GOODS. If a lease contract requires goods identified when the lease contract is made, and the goods suffer casualty without fault of the lessee, the lessor or the supplier before delivery, or the goods suffer casualty before risk of loss passes to the lessee pursuant to the lease agreement or Section 2A-219, then: if the loss is total, the lease contract is avoided; and if the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as to no longer conform to the lease contract, the lessee may nevertheless demand inspection and at his option either treat the lease contract as avoided or, except in a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, accept the goods with due allowance from the rent payable for the balance of the lease term for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the lessor. PART 3. EFFECT OF LEASE CONTRACT \u00a72A-301. ENFORCEABILITY OF LEASE CONTRACT. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a lease contract is effective and enforceable according to its terms between the parties, against purchasers of the goods and against creditors of the parties. \u00a72A-302. TITLE TO AND POSSESSION OF GOODS. 828 Chapter 249 Except as otherwise provided in this Article, each provision of this Article applies whether the lessor or a third party has title to the goods, and whether the lessor, the lessee, or a third party has possession of the goods, notwithstanding any statute or rule of law that possession or the absence of possession is fraudulent. \u00a72A-303. ALIENABILITY OF PARTY'S INTEREST UNDER LEASE CONTRACT OR OF LESSOR'S RESIDUAL INTEREST IN GOODS; DELEGATION OF PERFORMANCE; TRANSFER OF RIGHTS. (1) As used in this section, \"creation of a security interest\" includes the sale of a lease contract that is subject to Article 9, Secured Transactions, by reason of Section 9-102(1)(b). (2) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4), a provision in a lease agreement which (1) prohibits the voluntary or involuntary transfer, including a transfer by sale, sublease, creation or enforcement of a security interest, or attachment, levy, or other judicial process, of an interest of a party under the lease contract or of the lessor's residual interest in the goods, or (i1) makes such a transfer an event of default, gives rise to the rights and remedies provided in subsection (5), but a transfer that is prohibited or is an event of default under the lease agreement is otherwise effective. (3) A provision in a lease agreement which (1) prohibits the creation or enforcement of a security interest in an interest of a party under the lease contract or in the lessor's residual interest in the goods, or (11) makes such a transfer an event of default, is not enforceable unless, and then only to the extent that, there is an actual transfer by the lessee of the lessee's right of possession or use of the goods in violation of the provision or an actual delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the provision. Neither the granting nor the enforcement of a security interest in (1) the lessor's interest under the lease contract or (11) the lessor's residual interest in the goods is a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the lessee within the purview of subsection (5) unless, and then only to the extent that, there is an actual delegation of a material performance of the lessor. (4) A provision in a lease agreement which (1) prohibits a transfer of a right to damages for default with respect to the whole lease contract or of a right to payment arising out of the transferor's due performance of the transferor's entire obligation, or (11) makes such a transfer an event of default, is not enforceable, and such a transfer is not a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract within the purview of subsection (5). (5) Subject to subsections (3) and (4): if a transfer is made which is made an event of default under a lease agreement, the party to the lease contract not making the transfer, unless that party waives is the default or otherwise agrees, has the rights and remedies described in Section 2A-501(2); if paragraph (a) is not applicable and if a transfer is made that (1) is prohibited under a lease agreement or (11) materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract, unless the party not making the transfer agrees at any time to the transfer in the lease contract or otherwise, then, except as limited by contract, (1) the transferor is liable to the party not making the transfer for damages caused by the transfer to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the party not making the transfer and (19 a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the lease contract or an injunction against the transfer. (6) A transfer of \"the lease\" or of \"all my rights under the lease\", or a transfer in similar general terms, is a transfer of rights and, unless the language or the circumstances, as in a transfer for security, indicate the Chapter 249 829 830 Chapter 249 contrary, the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the transferee. Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by the transferee to perform those duties. The promise is inforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease contract. Unless otherwise agreed by the lessor and the lessee, a delegation of performance does not relieve the transferor as against the other party of any duty to perform or of any liability for default. In a consumer lease, to prohibit the transfer of an interest of a party under the lease contract or to make a transfer an event of default, the language must be specific, by a writing, and conspicuous. \u00a72A-304. SUBSEQUENT LEASE OF GOODS BY LESSOR. (1) Subject to Section 2A-303, a subsequent lessee from a lessor of goods under an existing lease contract obtains, to the extent of the leasehold interest transferred, the leasehold interest in the goods that the lessor had or had power to transfer, and except as provided in subsection (2) and Section 2A-527(4), takes subject to the existing lease contract. A lessor with voidable title has power to transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith subsequent lessee for value, but only to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence. If goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase, the lessor has that power even though: the lessor's transferor was deceived as to the identity of the lessor; the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored; it was agreed that the transaction was to be a \"cash sale\"; or the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law. (2) A subsequent lessee in the ordinary course of business from a lessor who Is a merchant dealing in goods of that kind to whom the goods were entrusted by the existing lessee of that lessor before the interest of the subsequent lessee became enforceable against that lessor obtains, to the extent of the leasehold interest transferred, all of that lessor's and the existing lessee's rights to the goods, and takes free of the existing lease contract. (3) A subsequent lessee from the lessor of goods that are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this State or of another jurisdiction takes no greater rights than those provided both by this section and by the certificate of title statute. \u00a72A-305. SALE OR SUBLEASE OF GOODS BY LESSEE. (1) Subject to the provisions of Section 2A-303, a buyer or sublessee from the lessee of goods under an existing lease contract obtains, to the extent of the interest transferred, the leasehold interest in the goods that the lessee had or had power to transfer, and except as provided in subsection (2) and Section 2A-511(4), takes subject to the existing lease contract. A lessee with a voidable leasehold interest has power to transfer a good leasehold Interest to a good faith buyer for value or a good faith sublessee for value, but only to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of lease the lessee has that power even though: the lessor was deceived as to the identity of the lessee; the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored; or the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law. (2) A buyer in the ordinary Course of business or a sublessee in the ordinary course of business from a lessee who is a merchant dealing in goods of that kind to whom the goods were entrusted by the lessor obtains, to the extent of the interest transferred, all of the lessor's and lessee's rights to the goods, and takes free of the existing lease contract. (3) A buyer or sublessee from the lessee of goods that are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this State or of another jurisdiction takes no greater rights than those provided both by this section and by the certificate of title statute. \u00a72A-306. PRIORITY OF CERTAIN LIENS ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW. If a person in the ordinary course of his business furnishes services or materials with respect to goods subject to a lease contract, a lien upon those goods in the possession of that person given by statute or rule of law for those materials or services takes priority over any interest of the lessor or lessee under the lease contract or this Article unless the lien is created by statute and the statute provides otherwise or unless the lien is created by rule of law and the rule of law provides otherwise. \u00a72A-307. PRIORITY OF LIENS ARISING BY ATTACHMENT OR LEVY ON, SECURITY INTERESTS IN, AND OTHER CLAIMS TO GOODS. (1) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2A-306, a creditor of a lessee takes subject to the lease contract. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (3) and (4) and in Sections 2A-306 and 2A-308, a creditor of a lessor takes subject to the lease contract unless: the creditor holds a lien that attached to the goods before the lease contract became enforceable, the creditor holds a security interest in the goods and the lessee did not give value and receive delivery of the goods without knowledge of the security interest; or the creditor holds a security interest in the goods which was perfected (Section 9-303) before the lease contract became enforceable. A lessee in the ordinary course of business takes the leasehold Interest free of a security interest in the goods created by the lessor even though the security interest is perfected (Section 9-303) and the lessee knows of its existence. A lessee other than a lessee in the ordinary course of business takes the leasehold interest free of a security interest to the extent that it secures future advances made after the secured party acquires knowledge of the lease or more than 45 days after the lease contract becomes enforceable, whichever first occurs, unless the future advances are made pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the lease and before the expiration of the 45-day period. \u00a72A-308. SPECIAL RIGHTS OF CREDITORS. A creditor of a lessor in possession of goods subject to a lease contract may treat the lease contract as void if as against the creditor retention of possession by the lessor is fraudulent under any statute or rule of law, but retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by the lessor for a commercially reasonable time after the lease contract becomes enforceable is not fraudulent. Nothing in this Article impairs the rights of creditors of a lessor if the lease contract (a) becomes enforceable, not in current course of trade but in satisfaction of or as security for a pre-existing claim for money, security, or the like, and (b) is made under circumstances which under any statute or rule of law apart from this Article would constitute the transaction a fraudulent transfer or voidable preference. A creditor of a seller may treat a sale or an identification of goods to a contract for sale as void if as against the creditor retention of possession by the seller is fraudulent under any statute or rule of law, but retention of possession of the goods pursuant to a lease contract entered into Chapter 249 831 by the seller as lessee and the buyer as lessor in connection with the sale or identification of the goods is not fraudulent if the buyer bought for value and in good faith. \u00a72A-309. LESSOR'S AND LESSEE'S RIGHTS WHEN GOODS BECOME FIXTURES. (1) In this section: goods are \"fixtures\" when they become so related to particular real estate that an interest in them arises under real estate law; a \"fixture filing\" is the filing, in the office where a mortgage on the real estate would be filed or recorded, of a financing statement covering goods that are or are to become fixtures and conforming to the requirements of Section 9-402(5); a lease is a \"purchase money lease\" unless the lessee has possession or use of the goods or the right to possession or use of the goods before the lease agreement is enforceable; a mortgage is a \"construction mortgage\" to the extent it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land including the acquisition cost of the land, if the recorded writing so indicates; and \"encumbrance\" includes real estate mortgages and other liens on real estate and all other rights in real estate that are not ownership interests. (2) Under this Article a lease may be of goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures, but no lease exists under this Article of ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land. (3) This Article does not prevent creation of a lease of fixtures pursuant to real estate law. (4) The interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if: the lease is a purchase money lease, the conflicting interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures, a fixture filing covering the interest of the lessor is made before the goods become fixtures or within ten days thereafter, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate; or a fixture filing covering the interest of the lessor is made before the Interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record, the lessor's interest, has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate. (5) Whether or not a fixture filing covering the fixtures has been made, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, Including the lessor's residual interest, has priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if: the fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real estate, or readily removable replacements of domestic appliances that are goods subject to a consumer lease, and before the goods become fixtures the lease contract is enforceable; or the conflicting interest is a lien on the real estate obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the lease contract is enforceable; or the encumbrancer or owner has consented in writing to the lease or has disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or the lessee has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner. If the lessee's right to remove terminates, the priority of the interest of the lessor continues for a reasonable time. 832 Chapter 249 Chapter 249 833 Notwithstanding subsection (4)(a) but otherwise subject to subsections (4) and (5), the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a construction mortgage recorded before the goods become fixtures if the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage. In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate. If the interest of a lessor of fixtures, ..including the lessor's residual interest, has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may (i) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of.the lease agreement but subject to the lease agreement and this Article, or (ii) if necessary to enforce other rights and remedies of the lessor or lessee under this Article, remove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but the lessor or lessee must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the Performance of this obligation. \u00a72A-310. LESSOR'S AND LESSEE'S RIGHTS GOODS BECOME ACCESSIONS. (1) Goods are \"accessions\" when they are installed in or affixed to other goods. (2) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into before the goods became accessions is superior to all interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (4). (3) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into at the time or after the goods became accessions is superior to all subsequently acquired interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (4) but is subordinate to interests in the whole existing at the time the lease contract was made unless the holders of such interests in the whole have in writing consented to the lease or disclaimed an interest in the goods as part of the whole. (4) The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract described in subsection (2) or (3) is subordinate to the interest of: a buyer in the ordinary course of business or a lessee in the ordinary course of business of any interest in the whole acquired after the goods became accessions; or a creditor with a security interest in the whole perfected before the lease contract was made to the extent that the creditor makes subsequent advances without knowledge of the lease contract. (5) When under subsections (2) or (3) and (4) a lessor or a lessee of accessions holds an interest that is superior to all interests in the whole, the lessor or the lessee may (a) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease contract by the other party but subject to the provisions of the lease contract and this Article, or (b) if necessary to enforce his other rights and remedies under this Article, remove the goods from the whole, free and clear of all interests in the whole, but he must reimburse any holder of an interest in the whole who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury but not for any diminution in value of the whole caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity for replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation. \u00a72A-311. PRIORITY SUBJECT TO SUBORDINATION. Nothing in this Article prevents subordination by agreement by any person entitled to priority. PART 4. PERFORMANCE OF LEASE CONTRACT: REPUDIATED, SUBSTITUTED AND EXCUSED \u00a72A-401. INSECURITY: ADEQUATE ASSURANCE OF PERFORMANCE. A lease contract imposes an obligation on each party that the other's expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. If reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party, the insecure party may demand in writing adequate assuarance of due performance. Until the insecure party receives that assurance, if commercially reasonable the insecure party may suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return. A repudiation of the lease contract occurs if assurance of due performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is not provided to the insecure party within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days after receipt of a demand by the other party. Between merchants, the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered must be determined according to commercial standards. Acceptance of any nonconforming delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party's right to demand adequate assurance of future performance. \u00a72A-402. ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION. If either party repudiates a lease contract with respect to a performance not yet due under the lease contract, the loss of which performance will substantially impair the value of the lease contract to the other, the aggrieved party may: for a commercially reasonable time, await retraction of repudiation and performance by the repudiating party; make demand pursuant to Section 2A-401 and await assurance of future performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case; or resort to any right or remedy upon default under the lease contract or this Article, even though the aggrieved party has notified the repudiating party that the aggrieved party would await the repudiating party's performance and assurance and has urged retraction. In addition, whether or not the aggrieved party is pursuing one of the foregoing remedies, the aggrieved party may suspend performance or, if the aggrieved party is the lessor, proceed in accordance with the provisions of this Article on the lessor's right to identify goods to the lease contract notwithstanding 'default or to salvage unfinished goods (Section 2A-524). \u00a72A-403. RETRACTION OF ANTICIPATORY REPUDIATION. Until the repudiating party's next performance is due, the repudiating party can retract the repudiation unless, since the repudiation, the aggrieved party has cancelled the lease contract or materially changed the aggrieved party's position or otherwise indicated that the aggrieved party considers the repudiation final. Retraction may be by any method that clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform under the lease contract and includes any assurance demanded under Section 2A-401. Retraction reinstates a repudiating party's rights under a lease contract with due excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation. Chapter 249 \u00a72A-404. SUBSTITUTED PERFORMANCE. If without fault of the lessee, the lessor and the supplier, the agreed berthing, loading, or unloading facilities fail or the agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or the agreed manner of delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable, but a commercially reasonable substitute is available, the substitute performance must be tendered and accepted. If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation: the lessor may withhold or stop delivery or cause the supplier to withhold or stop delivery unless the lessee provides a means or manner of payment that is commercially a substantial equivalent; and if delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the lessee's obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive, or predatory. \u00a72A-405. EXCUSED PERFORMANCE. Subject to Section 2A-404 on substituted performance, the following rules apply; Delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a lessor or a supplier who complies with paragraphs (b) and (c) is not a default under the lease contract if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the lease contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order, whether or not the regulation or order later proves to be invalid. If the causes mentioned in paragraph (a) affect only part of the lessor's or the supplier's capacity to perform, he shall allocate production and deliveries among his customers but at his option may include regular customers not then under contract for sale or lease as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allocate in any manner that is fair and reasonable. The lessor seasonably shall notify the lessee and in the case of a finance lease the supplier seasonably shall notify the lessor and the lessee, if known, that there will be delay or nondelivery and, if allocation is required under paragraph (b), of the estimated quota thus made available for the lessee. \u00a72A-405. PROCEDURE ON EXCUSED PERFORMANCE. (1) If the lessee receives notification of a material or indefinite delay or an allocation justified under Section 2A-405, the lessee may by written notification to the lessor as to any goods involved, and with respect to all of the goods if under an installment lease contract the value of the whole lease contract is substantially impaired (Section 2A-510): terminate the lease contract (Section 2A-505(2)); or except in a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, modify the lease contract by accepting the available quota in substitution, with due allowance from the rent payable for the balance of the lease term for the deficiency but without further right against the lessor. (2) If, after receipt of a notification from the lessor under section 2A-405, the lessee fails so to modify the lease agreement within a reasonable time not exceeding 30 days, the lease contract lapses with respect to any deliveries affected. \u00a72A-407. IRREVOCABLE PROMISES: FINANCE LEASES. (1) In the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease the lessee's promises under the lease contract become irrevocable and independent upon the lessee's acceptance of the goods. Chapter 249 835 836 Chapter 249 (2) A promise that has become irrevocable and independent under subsection (1): is effective and enforceable between the parties, and by or against third parties including assignees of the parties, and is not subject to cancellation, termination, modification, repudiation, excuse, or substitution without the consent of the party to whom the promise runs. (3) This section does not affect the validity under any other law of a covenant in any lease contract making the lessee's promises irrevocable and independent upon the lessee's acceptance of the goods. PART 5. DEFAULT A. IN GENERAL \u00a72A-501. DEFAULT: PROCEDURE. Whether the lessor or the lessee is in default under a lease contract is determined by the lease agreement and this Article. If the lessor or the lessee is in default under the lease contract, the party seeking enforcement has rights and remedies as provided in this Article and, except as limited by this Article, as provided in the lease agreement. If the lessor or the lessee is in default under the lease contract, the party seeking enforcement may reduce the party's claim to judgment, or otherwise enforce the lease contract by self-help or any available judicial procedure or nonjudicial procedure, including administrative proceeding, arbitration, or the like, in accordance with this Article. Except as otherwise provided in Section 1-106(1) or this Article or the lease agreement, the rights and remedies referred to in subsections (2) and (3) are cumulative. If the lease agreement covers both real property and goods, the party seeking enforcement may proceed under this Part as to the goods, or under other applicable law as to both the real property and the goods in accordance with that party's rights and remedies in respect of the real property, in which case this Part does not apply. \u00a72A-502. NOTICE AFTER DEFAULT. Except as otherwise provided in this Article or the lease agreement, the lessor or lessee in default under the lease contract is not entitled to notice of default or notice of enforcement from the other party to the lease agreement. \u00a72A-503. MODIFICATION OR IMPAIRMENT OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the lease agreement may Include rights and remedies for default in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this Article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this Article. Resort to a remedy provided under this Article or in the lease agreement is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive. If circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, or provision for an exclusive remedy is unconscionable, remedy may be had as provided in this Article. Consequential damages may be liquidated under Section 2A-504, or may otherwise be limited, altered, or excluded unless the limitation, alteration, or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation, alteration or exclusion of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation, alteration or exclusion of damages where the loss is commercial is not prima facie unconscionable. Chapter 249 837 (4) Rights and remedies on default by the lessor or the lessee with respect to any obligation or promise collateral or ancillary to the lease contract are not impaired by this Article. \u00a72A-504. LIQUIDATION OF DAMAGES. (1) Damages payable by either party for default, or any other act or omission, including indemnity for loss or diminution of anticipated tax benefits or loss or damage to lessor's residual interest, may be liquidated in the lease agreement but only at an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the then anticipated harm caused by the default or other act or omission. (2) If the lease agreement provides for liquidation of damages, and such provision does not comply with subsection (1), or such provision is an exclusive or limited remedy that circumstances cause to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this Article. (3) If the lessor justifiably withholds or stops delivery of goods because of the lessee's default or insolvency (Section 2A-525 ,or 2A-526), the lessee Is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his payments exceeds: the amount to which the lessor is entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the lessor's damages in accordance with subsection (1); or in the absence of those terms, 20 percent of the then present value of the total rent the lessee was obligated to pay for the balance of the lease term, or, in the case of a consumer lease, the lesser of such amount or $500. (4) A lessee's right to restitution under subsection (3) is subject to offset to the extent the lessor establishes: a right to recover damages under the provisions of this Article other than subsection (1); and the amount or value of any benefits received by the lessee directly or indirectly by reason of the lease contract. \u00a72A-505. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION AND EFFECT OF CANCELLATION, TERMINATION, RESCISSION, OR FRAUD ON RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. on cancellation of the lease contract, all obligations that are still executory on both sides are discharged, but any right based on prior default or performance survives, and the cancelling party also retains any remedy for default of the whole lease contract or any unperformed balance. on termination of the lease contract, all obligations that are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior default or performance survives. Unless the contrary intention clearly appears, expressions of \"cancellation,\" \"rescission,\" or the like of the lease contract may not be construed as a renunciation or discharge of any claim in damages for an antecedent default. Rights and remedies for material misrepresentation or fraud include all rights and remedies available under this Article for default. Neither rescission nor a claim for rescission of the lease contract nor rejection or return of the goods may bar or be deemed inconsistent with a claim for damages or other right or remedy. \u00a72A-506. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. (1) An action for default under a lease contract, including breach of warranty or indemnity, must be commenced within 4 years after the cause of action accrued. In a lease contract that is not a consumer lease, the parties in the original lease contract may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year. A cause of action for default accrues when the act or omission on which the default or breach of warranty is based is or should have been discovered by the aggrieved party, or when the default occurs, whichever is later. A cause of action for indemnity accrues (a) in the case of an indemnity against liability, when the act or omission on which the claim for indemnity is based is or should have been discovered by the indemnified party, whichever is later, or (b) in the case of an indemnity against loss or damage, when the person indemnified makes payment thereof. If an action commenced within the time limited by subsection (1) is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same default or breach of warranty or indemnity, the other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within 6 months after the termination of the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute. This section does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations nor does it apply to causes of action that have accrued before this Article becomes effective. \u00a72A-507. PROOF OF MARKET RENT: TIME AND PLACE. Damages based on market rent (Section 2A-519 or 2A-528) are determined according to the rent for the use of the goods concerned for a lease term identical to the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement and prevailing at the times specified in Sections 2A-519 and 2A-528. If evidence of rent for the use of the goods concerned for a lease term identical to the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement and prevailing at the times or places described in this Article is not readily available, the rent prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the time described or at any other place or for a different lease term which in commercial judgment or under usage of trade would serve as a reasonable substitute for the one described may be used, making any proper allowance for the difference, including the cost of transporting the goods to or from the other place. Evidence of a relevant rent prevailing at a time or place or for a lease term other than the one described in this Article offered by one party is not admissible unless and until he has given the other party notice the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise. If the prevailing rent or value of any goods regularly leased in any established market is in issue, reports in official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of that market are admissible in evidence. The circumstances of the preparation of the report may be shown to affect its weight but not its admissibility. B. DEFAULT BY LESSOR \u00a72A-508. LESSEE'S REMEDIES. (1) If a lessor fails to deliver the goods in conformity to the lease contract (Section 2A-509) or repudiates the lease cntract (Section 2A-402), or a lessee. rightfully rejects the goods (Section 2A-509) or justifiably revokes acceptance of the goods (Section 2A-517), then with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to all of the goods if under an installment lease contract the value of the whole lease contract is substantially impaired (Section 2A- 510), the lessor is in default under the lease contract and the lessee may: cancel the lease contract (Section 2A-505(1)); recover so much of the rent and security as has been paid and is just under the circumstances; 838 Chapter 249 Chapter 249 839 1 cover and recover damages as to all goods affected whether or not they have been identified to the lease contract (Sections 2A-518 and 2A-520), or recover damages for nondelivery (Sections 2A-519 and 2A-520); exercise any other rights or pursue any other remedies provided in the lease contract. (2) If a lessor fails to deliver the goods in conformity to the lease contract or repudiates the lease contract, the lessee may also: if the goods have been identified, recover them (Section 2A-522); or in a proper case, obtain specific performance or replevy the goods (Section 2A-521). (3) If a lessor is otherwise in default under a lease contract, the lessee may exercise the rights and pursue the remedies provided in the lease contract, which may include a right to cancel the lease, and in Section 2A- 519(3). (4) If a lessor has breached a warranty, whether express or implied, the lessee may recover damages (Section 2A-519(4)). (5) On rightful rejection or justifiable revocation of acceptance, a lessee has a security interest in goods in the lessee's possession or control for any rent and security that has been paid and any expenses reasonably incurred in their inspection, receipt, transportation, and care and custody and may hold those goods and dispose of them in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, subject to Section 2A-527(5). (6) Subject to the provisions of Section 2A-407, a lessee, on notifying the lessor of the lessee's intention to do so, may deduct all or any part of the damages resulting from any default under the lease contract from any part of the rent still due under the same lease contract. \u00a72A-509. LESSEE'S RIGHTS ON IMPROPER DELIVERY; RIGHTFUL REJECTION. Subject to the provisions of Section 2A-510 on default in installment lease contracts, if the goods or the tender or delivery fail in any respect to conform to the lease contract, the lessee may reject or accept the goods or accept any commercial unit or units and reject the rest of the goods. Rejection of goods is ineffective unless it is within a reasonable time after tender or delivery of the goods and the lessee seasonably notifies the lessor. \u00a72A-510. INSTALLMENT LEASE CONTRACTS: REJECTION AND DEFAULT. Under an installment lease contract a lessee may reject any delivery that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that delivery and cannot be cured or the nonconformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection (2) and the lessor or the supplier gives adequate assurance of Its cure, the lessee must accept that delivery. Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to one or more deliveries substantially impairs the value of the installment lease contract as whole there is a default with respect to the whole. But, the aggrieved party reinstates the installment lease contract as a whole if the aggrieved party accepts a nonconforming delivery without seasonably notifying of cancellation or brings an action with respect only to past deliveries or demands performance as to future deliveries. \u00a72A-511. MERCHANT LESSEE'S DUTIES AS TO RIGHTFULLY REJECTED GOODS. (1) Subject to any security interest of a lessee (Section 2A-508(5)), if a lessor or a supplier has no agent or place of business at the market of rejection, a merchant lessee, after rejection of goods in his possession or control, shall follow any reasonable instructions received from the lessor or the supplier with respect to the goods. In the absence of those instructions, a merchant lessee shall make reasonable efforts to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the goods for the lessor's account if they threaten to decline in value speedily. Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming. If a merchant lessee (subsection (1)) or any other lessee (Section 2A-512) disposes of goods, he is entitled to reimbursement either from the lessor or the supplier or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and disposing of the goods and, if the expenses include no disposition commission, to such commission as is usual in the trade, or, if there is none, to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10 percent of the gross proceeds. In complying with this section or Section 2A-512, the lessee is held only to good faith. Good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance or conversion nor the basis of an action for damages. A purchaser who purchases in good faith from a lessee pursuant to this section or Section 2A-512 takes the goods free of any rights of the lessor and the supplier even though the lessee fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this Article. \u00a72A-512. LESSEE'S DUTIES AS TO RIGHTFULLY REJECTED GOODS. (1) Except as otherwise provided with respect to goods that threaten to decline in value speedily (Section 2A-511) and subject to any security interest of a lessee (Section 2A-508(5)): the lessee, after rejection of goods in the lessee's possession, shall hold them with reasonable care at the lessor's or the supplier's disposition for a reasonable time after the lessee's seasonable notification of rejection; if the lessor or the supplier gives no instructions within a reasonable time after notification of rejection, the lessee may store the rejected goods for the lessor's or the supplier's account or ship them to the lessor or the supplier or dispose of them for the lessor's or the supplier's account with reimbursement in the manner provided in Section 2A-511; but the lessee has no further obligations with regard to goods rightfully rejected. (2) Action by the lessee pursuant to subsection (1) is not acceptance or conversion. \u00a72A-513. CURE BY LESSOR OF IMPROPER TENDER OR DELIVERY; REPLACEMENT. If any tender or delivery by the lessor or the supplier is rejected because it is nonconforming and the time for performance has not yet expired, the lessor or the supplier may seasonably notify the lessee of the lessor's or the supplier's intention to cure and may then make a conforming delivery within the time provided in the lease contract. If the lessee rejects a nonconforming tender that the lessor or the supplier had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance, the lessor or the supplier may have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender if he seasonably notifies the lessee. \u00a72A-514. WAIVER OF LESSEE'S OBJECTIONS. (1) In rejecting goods, a lessee's failure to state a particular defect that is ascertainable by reasonable inspection precludes the lessee from relying on the defect to justify rejection or to establish default: if, stated seasonably, the lessor or the supplier could have cured it (Section 2A-513); or between merchants if the lessor or the supplier after rejection has made a request in writing for a full and final written statement of all defects on which the lessee proposes to rely. 840 Chapter 249 (2) A lessee's failure to reserve rights when paying rent or other consideration against documents precludes recovery of the payment for defects apparent on the face of the documents. \u00a72A-515. ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS. Cl) Acceptance of goods occurs after the lessee has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods and the lessee signifies or acts with respect to the goods in a manner that signifies to the lessor or the supplier that the goods are conforming or that the lessee will take or retain them in spite of their nonconformity; or the lessee fails to make an effective rejection of the goods (Section 2A-509(2)). (2) Acceptance of a part of any commercial unit is acceptance of that entire unit. \u00a72A-516. EFFECT OF ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS; NOTICE OF DEFAULT; BURDEN OF ESTABLISHING DEFAULT AFTER ACCEPTANCE; NOTICE OF CLAIM OR LITIGATION TO PERSON ANSWERABLE OVER. (1) A lessee must pay rent for any goods accepted in accordance with the lease contract, with due allowance for goods rightfully rejected or not delivered. (2) A lessee's acceptance of goods precludes rejection of the goods accepted. In the case of a finance lease, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it. In any other case, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured. Acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this Article or the lease agreement for nonconformity. (3) If a tender has been accepted: within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered any default, the lessee shall notify the lessor and the supplier, if any, or be barred from any remedy against the party not notified; except in the case of a consumer lease, within a reasonable time after the lessee receives notice of litigation for infringement or the like (Section 2A-211) the lessee shall notify the lessor or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation; and the burden is on the lessee to establish any default. (4) If a lessee is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which a lessor or a supplier is answerable over, the following apply: The lessee may give the lessor or the supplier, or both, written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the person notified may come in and defend and that if the person notified does not do so that person will be bound in any action against that person by the lessee by any determination of fact common to the two litigations, then unless the person notified after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend that person is so bound. The lessor or the supplier may demand in writing that the lessee turn over control of the litigation including settlement if the claim is one for infringement or the like (Section 2A-211) or else be barred from any remedy over. If the demand states that the lessor or the supplier agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the lessee after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the lessee is so barred. (5) Subsections (3) and (4) apply to any obligation of a lessee to hold the lessor or the supplier harmless against infringement or the like (Section 2A-211). Chapter 249 841 842 Chapter 249 \u00a72A-517. REVOCATION OF ACCEPTANCE OF GOODS. (1) A lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to the lessee if the lessee has accepted it: except in the case of a finance lease, on the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or without discovery of the nonconformity if the lessee's acceptance was reasonably induced either by the lessor's assurances or, except in the case of a finance lease, by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance. (2) Except in the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, a lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit if the lessor defaults under the lease contract and the default substantially impairs the value of that lot or commercial unit to the lessee. (3) If the lease agreement so provides, the lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit because of other defaults by the lessor. (4) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by the nonconformity. Revocation is not effective until the lessee notifies the lessor. (5) A lessee who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if the lessee had rejected them. \u00a72A-518. COVER, SUBST/TUTE GOODS. After a default by a lessor under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-598(1), or, if agreed, after other default by the lessor, the lessee may cover by making any purchase or lease of or contract to purchase or lease goods in substitution for those due from the lessor. Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (Section 2A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (Sections 1-102(3) and 2A-503), if a lessee's cover is by a lease agreement substantially similar to the original lease agreement and the new lease agreement is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the lessee may recover from the lessor as damages (I) the present value, as of the date of the commencement of the term of the new lease agreement, of the rent under the new lease agreement applicable to that period of the new lease term which is comparable to the then remaining term of the original lease agreement minus the present value as of the same date of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement, and (ii) any incidental or consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default. If a lessee's cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under subsection (2), or is by purchase or otherwise, the lessee may recover from the lessor as if the lessee had elected not to cover and Section 2A-519 governs. \u00a72A-519. LESSEE'S DAMAGES FOR NON-DELIVERY, REPUDIATION, DEFAULT, AND BREACH OF WARRANTY IN REGARD TO ACCEPTED GOODS. (I) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (Section 2A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (Subsection 1-102(3) and Section 2A-503), if a lessee elects not to cover or a lessee elects to cover and the cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under Section 2A-518(2), or is by purchase or otherwise, the measure of damages for non-delivery or repudiation by the lessor or for rejection or revocation of acceptance by the lessee is the present value, as of the date of the default, of the then market rent minus the present value as of the same date of the original rent, computed for the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default. ., Market rent is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival. Except as otherwise agreed, if the lessee has accepted goods and given notification (Section 2A-516(3)), the measure of damages for non-conforming tender or delivery or other default by a lessor is the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the lessor's default as determined in any manner that is reasonable together with Incidental- and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default. Except as otherwise agreed, the measure of damages for breach of warranty is the present value at the time and place of acceptance of the difference between the value of the use of the goods accepted and the value if they had been as warranted for the lease term, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default or breach of warranty. \u00a72A-520. LESSEE'S INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. Incidental damages resulting from a lessor's default include expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation, and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected or goods the acceptance of which is justifiably revoked, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses, or commissions in connection with effecting cover, and any other reasonable expense incident to the default. Consequential damages resulting from a lessor's default include: any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the lessor at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise; and injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty. \u00a72A-521. LESSEE'S RIGHT TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OR REPLEVIN. Specific performance may be decreed if the goods are unique or in other proper circumstances. A decree for specific performance may include any terms and conditions as to payment of the rent, damages, or other relief that the court deems just. A lessee has a right of replevin, detinue, sequestration, claim and delivery, or the like for goods identified to the lease contract if after reasonable effort the lessee is unable to effect cover for those goods or the circumstances reasonably indicate that the effort will be unavailing. \u00a72A-522. LESSEE'S RIGHT TO GOODS ON LESSOR'S INSOLVENCY. Subject to subsection (2) and even though the goods have not been shipped, a lessee who has paid a part or all of the rent and security for goods identified to a lease contract (Section 2A-217) on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of the rent and security due under the lease contract may recover the goods identified from the lessor if the lessor becomes insolvent within 10 days after receipt of the first installment of rent and security. A lessee acquires the right to recover goods identified to a lease contract only if they conform to the lease contract. C. DEFAULT BY LESSEE \u00a72A-523. LESSOR'S REMEDIES. (1) If a lessee wrongfully rejects or revokes acceptance of goods or fails to make a payment when due or repudiates with respect to a part or the whole, then, with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to all of the goods if under an installment lease contract the value of the whole lease contract Chapter 249 843 844 Chapter 249 is substantially impaired (Section 2A-510), the lessee is in default under the lease contract and the lessor may: cancel the lease contract (Section 2A-505(1)); proceed respecting goods not identified to the lease contract (Section 2A-524); withhold delivery of the goods and take possession of goods previously delivered (section 2A-525); stop delivery of the goods by any bailee (Section 2A-526); dispose of the goods and recover damages (Section 2A-527), or retain the goods and recover damages (Section 2A-528), or in a proper case recover rent (Section 2A-529); exercise any other rights or pursue any other remedies provided in the lease contract. (2) If a lessor does not fully exercise a right or obtain a remedy to which the lessor is entitled under subsection (1), the lessor may recover the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the lessee's default as determined in any reasonable manner, together with incidental damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default. (3)If a lessee is otherwise in default under a lease contract, the lessor may exercise the rights and pursue the remedies provided in the lease contract, which may include a right to cancel the lease. In addition, unless otherwise provided in the lease contract: if the default substantially impairs the value of the lease contract to the lessor, the lessor Tay exercise the rights and pursue the remedies provided in subsections (1) or (2); or if the default does not substantially impair the value of the lease contract to the lessor, the lessor may recover as provided in subsection (2). \u00a72A-524. LESSOR'S RIGHT TO IDENTIFY GOODS TO LEASE CONTRACT. (1) After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or Section 2A-523(3)(a) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, the lessor may: identify to the lease contract conforming goods not already identified if at the time the lessor learned of the default they were in the lessor's or the supplier's possession or control; and dispose of goods (Section 2A-527(1)) that demonstrably have been intended for the particular lease contract even though those goods are unfinished. (2) If the goods are unfinished, In the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment for the purposes of avoiding loss and of effective realization, an aggrieved lessor or the supplier may either complete manufacture and wholly identify the goods to the lease contract or cease manufacture and lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of the goods for scrap or salvage value or proceed in any other reasonable manner. \u00a72A-525. LESSOR'S RIGHT TO POSSESSION OF GOODS. If a lessor discovers the lessee to be insolvent, the lessor may refuse to deliver the goods. After a default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or 2A-523(3)(a) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, the lessor has the right to take possession of the goods. If the lease contract so provides, the lessor may require the lessee to assemble the goods and make them available to the lessor at a place to be designated by the lessor which is reasonably convenient to both parties. Without removal, the lessor may render unusable any goods employed in trade or business, and may dispose of goods on the lessee's premises (Section 2A-527). 49 Chapter 249 845 (3) The lessor may proceed under subsection (2) without judicial process if it can be done without breach of the peace or the lessor may proceed by action. \u00a72A-526. LESSOR'S STOPPAGE OF DELIVERY IN TRANSIT OR OTHERWISE. (1) A lessor may stop delivery of goods in the possession of a carrier or other bailee if the lessor discovers the lessee to be insolvent and may stop delivery of carload, truckload, planeload, or larger shipments of express or freight if the lessee repudiates or fails to make a payment due before delivery, whether for rent, security, or otherwise under the lease contract, or for any other reason the lessor has a right to withhold or take possession of the goods. (2) In pursuing its remedies under subsection (1), the lessor may stop delivery until: receipt of the goods by the lessee; acknowledgment to the lessee by any bailee of the goods, except a carrier, that the bailee holds the goods for the lessee; or such an acknowledgment to the lessee by a carrier via reshipment or as warehouseman. (3) (a) To stop delivery, a lessor shall so notify as to enable the bailee by reasonable diligence to prevent delivery of the goods. After notification, the bailee shall hold and deliver the goods according to the directions of the lessor, but the lessor is liable to the bailee for any ensuring charges or damages. A carrier who has issued a nonnegotiable bill of lading is not obliged to obey a notification to stop received from a person other than the consignor. \u00a72A-527. LESSOR'S RIGHTS TO DISPOSE OF GOODS. After a default by a lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or 2A-523(3)(a) or after the lessor refuses to deliver or takes possession of goods (Section 2A-525 or 2A-526), or, if agreed, after other default by a lessee, the lessor may dispose of the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof by lease, sale, or otherwise. Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (Section 2A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (Subsection 1-102(3) and Section 2A-503), if the disposition is by lease agreement substantially similar to the original lease agreement and the new lease agreement is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of the commencement of the term of the new lease agreement, (ii) the present value, as of the same date, of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value, as of the same date, of the rent under the new lease agreement applicable to that period of the new lease term which is comparable to the then remaining term of the original lease agreement, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default. If the lessor's disposition is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under subsection (2), or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee as if the lessor had elected not to dispose of the goods and Section 2A-528 governs. A subsequent buyer or lessee who buys or leases from the lessor in good faith for value as a result of a disposition under this section takes the goods free of the original lease contract and any rights of the original lessee even though the lessor fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this Article. The lessor is not accountable to the lessee for any profit made on any disposition. A lessee who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked Chapter 249 acceptance shall account to the lessor for any excess over the amount of the lessee's security interest (Section 2A-508(5)). \u00a72A-528. LESSOR'S DAMAGES FOR NON-ACCEPTANCE, FAILURE TO PAY, REPUDIATION, OR OTHER DEFAULT. Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (Section 2A-504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (Subsection 1-102(3) and Section 2A-503), if a lessor elects to retain the goods or a lessor elects to dispose of the goods and the disposition is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under Section 2A-527(2), or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages for a default of the type described in Section 2A-523(1) or 2A-523(3)(a), or, if agreed, for other default of the lessee, (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of default if the lessee has never taken possession of the goods, or, if the lessee has taken possession of the goods, as of the date the lessor repossesses the goods or an earlier date on which the lessee makes a tender of the goods to the lessor, (ii) the present value as of the date determined under clause (i) of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value as of the same date of the market rent at the place where the goods are located computed for the same lease term, and (iii) any Incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default. If the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) is inadequate to put a lessor in as good a position as performance would have, the measure of damages is the present value of the profit, including reasonable overhead, the lessor would have made from full performance by the lessee, together with any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of disposition. \u00a72A-529. LESSOR'S ACTION FOR THE RENT. (1) After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section 2A-523.(l) or 2A-523(3)(a) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, if the lessor complies with subsection (2), the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages: for goods accepted by the lessee and not repossessed by or tendered to the lessor, and for conforming goods lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after risk of loss passes to the lessee (Section 2A-219), (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, (ii) the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default; and for goods identified to the lease contract if the lessor is unable after reasonable effort to dispose of them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that effort will be unavailing, (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, (ii) the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and (iii) any incidental damages allowed under Section 2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default. (2) Except as provided in subsection (3), the lessor shall hold for the lessee for the remaining lease term of the lease agreement any goods that have been identified to the lease contract and are in the lessor's control. (3) The lessor may dispose of the goods at any time before collection of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection (1). If the disposition is before the end of the remaining lease term of the lease agreement, the lessor's recovery against the lessee for damages is governed by Section 2A-527 or Section 2A-528, and the lessor will cause an appropriate credit to be provided against a judgment for damages to the extent that the amount of the judgment exceeds the recovery available pursuant to Section 2A-527 or 2A-528. Payment of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection (1) entitles the lessee to the use and possession of the goods not then disposed of for the remaining lease term of and in accordance with the lease agreement. After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in Section2A-523(1) or Section 2A-523(3)(a) or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, a lessor who is held not entitled to rent under this section must nevertheless by awarded damages for non-acceptance under Section 2A-527 or Section 2A-528. \u00a72A-530. LESSOR'S INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. Incidental damages to an aggrieved lessor include any commercially reasonable charges, expenses, or commissions incurred in stopping delivery, in the transportation, care and custody of goods after the lessee's default, in connection with return or disposition of the goods, or otherwise resulting from the default. \u00a72A-531. STANDING TO SUE THIRD PARTIES FOR INJURY TO GOODS. Cl) If a third party so deals with goods that have been identified to a lease contract as to cause actionable injury to a party to the lease contract (a) the lessor has a right of action against the third party, and (b) the lessee also has a right of action against the third party if the lessee: (i) has a security interest in the goods; has an insurable interest in the goods; or bears the risk of loss under the lease contract or has since the injury assumed that risk as against the lessor and the goods have been converted or destroyed. If at the time of the injury the party plaintiff did not bear the risk of loss as against the other party to the lease contract and there is no arrangement between them for disposition of the recovery, his suit or settlement, subject to his own interest, is as a fiduciary for the other party to the lease contract. Either party with the consent of the other may sue for the benefit of whom It may concern. \u00a72A-532. LESSOR'S RIGHTS TO RESIDUAL INTEREST. In addition to any other recovery permitted by this Article or other law, the lessor may recover from the lessee an amount that will fully compensate the lessor for any loss of or damage to the lessor's residual interest in the goods caused by the default of the lessee. SECTION 2. Amend Section 1-105, Subtitle I, Title 6 of the Delaware Code by striking said Section in Its entirety, and substituting in lieu thereof the following: \u00a71-105. TERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF THE ACT; PARTIES' POWER TO CHOOSE APPLICABLE LAW Except as provided hereafter in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and also to another state or nation the parties may agree that the law either of this state or of such other state or nation shall govern their rights and duties. Failing such agreement this Act applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state. Where one of the following provisions of this Act specifies the applicable law, that provision governs and a contrary agreement is effective only to the extent permitted by the law (including the conflict of laws rules) so specified: Rights of creditors against sold goods. Section 2-402. Applicability of the Article on Leases. Sections 2A-105 and 2A-106. Chapter 249 847 848 Chapter 249 Applicability of the Article on Bank Deposits and Collections. Section 4-102. Bulk transfers subject to the Article on Bulk Transfers. Section 6-102. Applicability of the Article on Investment Securities. Section 8-106. Perfection provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions. Section 9-103. SECTION 3. Amend Subsection 1-201(37), Subtitle I, Title 6 of the Delaware Code by striking said Subsection in its entirety and substituting in lieu thereof the following: \u00a71-201(37). GENERAL DEFINITIONS: \"SECURITY INTEREST\" (37) \"Security interest\" means an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation. The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer (Section 2-401) is limited in effect to a reservation of a \"security interest\". The term also includes any interest of a buyer of accounts or chattel paper which is subject to Article 9. The special property Interest of a buyer of goods on identification of those goods to a contract for sale under Section 2-401 is not a \"security interest\", but a buyer may also acquire a \"security interest\", by complying with Article 9. Unless a consignment is intended as security, reservation of title thereunder is not a \"security interest\" but a consignment in any event is subject to the provisions on consignment sales (Section 2-326). Whether a transaction creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case; however: (a) a transaction creates a security interest if the consideration the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease not subject to termination by the lessee, and the original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods, the lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods, the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement, or the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement. (b) A transaction does not create a security interest merely because it provides that the present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into, the lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods, or agrees to pay taxes, insurance, filing, recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs with respect to the goods, the lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods, the lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal at the time the option is to be performed, or (v) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed. (c) For purposes of this subsection (37): Additional consideration is not nominal if (A) when the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option Is to be performed, or (8) when the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to be performed. Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee's reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement If the option is not exercised; \"Reasonably predictable\" and \"remaining economic life of the goods\" are to be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into; and \"Present value\" means the amount as of a date certain of one or more sums payable in the future, discounted to the date certain. The discount is determined by the interest rate specified by the parties if the rate is not manifestly unreasonable at the time the transaction is entered into; otherwise, the discount is determined by a commercially reasonable rate that takes into account the facts and circumstances of each case at the time the transaction was entered into. SECTION 4. Amend Section 9-113, Subtitle I, Title 6 of the Delaware Code by striking said Section in Its entirety and substituting In lieu thereof the following: \u00a79-113. SECURITY INTERESTS ARISING UNDER ARTICLE ON SALES OR UNDER ARTICLE ON LEASES A security interest arising solely under the Article on Sales (Article 2) or the Article on Leases (Article 2A) is subject to the provisions of this Article except that to the extent that and so long as the debtor does not have or does not lawfully obtain possession of the goods no security agreement is necessary to make the security interest enforceable; and no filing is required to perfect the security interest; and the rights of the secured party on default by the debtor are governed (i) by the Article on Sales (Article 2) in the case of a security interest arising solely under such Article or (ii) by the Article on Leases (Article 2A) in the case of a security interest arising solely under such Article. SECTION 5. Amend Subsection 9-318(4), Subtitle I, Title 6 of the Delaware Code by striking said Subsection in its entirety and substituting in lieu thereof the following: \u00a79-318(4) TERM PROHIBITING ASSIGNMENT INEFFECTIVE.

Regulation of Public Carriers. t , Chapter 255 855 The Authority shall make and impose charges and fees for filing, copying, inspection and other services rendered pursuant to the powers granted by this chapter or in accordance with such rules and regulations as it may from time to time adopt. The Authority shall, with the approval of the Secretary, prepare proposed rules and regulations governing the responsibilities of the public carriers it regulates. The rules and regulations shall be adopted at a public hearing following public notice. The rules and regulations as adopted, and as they may be from time to time amended by the Authority, shall have the effect of law and shall remain in power and force until the same are amended or repealed by the Authority. (c)(1) The Authority shall grant, upon an applicant's proof of qualification as set forth in subsection (d) hereof, a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Such certificate shall authorize the certificate holder to operate motor vehicles for hire in public transportation. The certificate shall authorize the number of vehicles the certificate holder may operate, which number may be increased by subsequent application, in the Authority's discretion, and may contain restrictions or conditions related to such items as, but not limited to, geographic areas of operation, bonding, safety and maintenance, insurance, quality control and unfair competition; provided, however, that each holder of any such certificate, or of a successor 'grandfather' certificate of public convenience and necessity obtained under subsection (c)(2) of Section 8 of Chapter 125, Volume 62 of the Laws of Delaware, may not be limited to operate fewer vehicles than were in such holder's authorized fleet of taxicab vehicles on December 31, 1991. The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (b) hereof shall provide that a certificate holder may request that the Authority divide the certificate into as many certificates of public convenience and necessity as there are authorized vehicles. The certificate resulting from a division of the original certificate shall authorize the operation of only one vehicle per certificate. Each certificate of public convenience and necessity shall be a franchise and create a proprietary interest owned by the certificate holder, subject, however, to suspension or revocation by the Authority upon a showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the certificate holder is knowingly operating or knowingly permitting operation of a vehicle, or the business authorized by the certificate, in disregard or violation of State law, the rules and regulations and/or applicable practices and orders of the Authority. The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (b) hereof shall provide that the Authority shall issue to each certificate holder a medallion or other identifying insignia, and that this medallion or other identifying insignia shall be physically affixed to the top of the hood of the taxicab vehicle operated under that certificate. The rules and flgulations also shall provide that the certificate holder may sell and assign each certificate, vehicle, medallion or other identifying insignia to another or others to operate in the taxicab business under such sold or assigned certificate. If the certificate holder replaces the vehicle identified by the medallion or insignia, the certificate holder, with the approval of the Authority, shall affix the medallion or other identifying insignia to the vehicle replacing the former vehicle. No person AO purchases a certificate of public convenience and necessity from a certificate holder as authorized by subsection (c)(3) may commence operations as a public carrier without having first obtained from the Authority a certificate of compliance. The Authority will issue a certificate of compliance when the purchaser of a certificate of public convenience and necessity provides evidence to the Authority to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that purchaser has complied with Section 1802(e) (1)(8), (C) and (D) and is of good moral character as specified in Section 1802 (e)(1). By its rules and practices, or by order, the Authority shall provide for authority to management, maintenance and dispatching companies and organizations (i) to manage parts or all of the operations and businesses of certificated taxicab companies and operators, (ii) to maintain and repair taxicab vehicles for such companies and operators, and/or (iii) to provide radio dispatching of taxicab vehicles for such 856 Chapter 255 certificated taxicab companies and operators, pursuant to contractual arrangements made between such management, maintenance and dispatching companies and organizations, on the one hand, and, on the other, such certificated taxicab companies and operators. The Authority shall have power to void any contracts and services of any such management, maintenance and dispatching company or organization upon proper and adequate proof of knowing and repeated noncompliance by such company with State law and/or the rules, regulations, practices and orders of the Authority. The Authority may, by its rules and regulations, authorize a holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate the public carrier business thereunder with vehicles leased by such holder to non-employee independent contractor drivers who will operate such vehicles as such drivers under the authorization of said certificate of public convenience and necessity, provided, however, that the holder of the certificate of public convenience and necessity shall remain responsible for the proper operation and maintenance of said vehicles in said public carrier business and for the compliance with all laws, rules, regulations, practices, and applicable orders and provided further, that such non-employee independent contractor drivers do not thereby become public carriers and do not thereby have any rights under this title as a public carrier. The Authority may, by its rules and regulations, authorize a system of restricted certification where deemed to be appropriated and only in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Authority shall determine. The Authority shall have the power to void any leases and/or suspend or revoke the certificate of public convenience and necessity of any holder thereof upon proper and adequate proof of knowing and repeated noncompliance by such certificate holder or its lessees with such laws, rules, regulations, practices, and orders. The Authority may issue a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity upon satisfaction of the following terms and conditions and such other terms and conditions imposed by the Authority: (1) No public carrier shall commence any new operations, or continue any existing operations, without having first obtained from the Authority a certificate of public convenience and necessity and having paid the registration fee therefor. Any public carrier which holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Authority on the date this section becomes effective shall be deemed to have an existing certificate of public convenience and necessity as contemplated herein and may continue such operations authorized by the existing certificate of public convenience and necessity. The Authority may, after notice and a hearing, impose such terms and conditions upon the certificate as may be required by the public convenience and necessity. The application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall be verified and contain a certification by the applicant that notice of his application has been sent to existing public carriers. In addition, the applicant shall be of good moral character, as shall be evidenced by exhibiting compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and shall not have been convicted of a felonious or infamous crime involving fraud or deceit. The Authority shall require the applicant for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the following: That his or its proposed operations will serve a useful public purpose, a useful public necessity, and a useful public convenience responsive to a public demand. That the applicant, as to its proposed service and/or operations, has sufficient financial ability to compensate members of the public for injuries to person or property which they may sustain from acts or failures to act of the public carrier. To this end, the Authority may require that an applicant post a bond to secure its performance for the first two years of its operation in this State. That, as to the proposed service and/or operations, the applicant has complied with all applicable motor vehicle laws of the State of Delaware, including but not limited to sub-chapter VI of Chapter 21 of Title 21 of the Delaware Code, as the same may be Chapter 255 857 amended and that the applicant will otherwise ensure that its vehicles are safely operated and maintained. D. That, as to the proposed service and/or operations, the applicant is covered by and with a public liability and property damage policy or policies issued by a company licensed to conduct insurance business in the State of Delaware with coverages in the amounts specified in this section. If the Authority finds that the applicant has proven by a preponderance of the evidence subsections A. through D. of section 1802(e)(1), a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall be issued, unless an existing public carrier or a member of the public can prove by a preponderance of evidence that the applicant's operation will have a significant adverse impact on the public health and safety or an adverse impact on existing carriers such as to impair their ability to serve the public. For the purposes of this section a preponderance of the evidence means evidence which is of greater weight or more convincing than the evidence which is offered in opposition to it. The burden of proof of significant adverse impact is on the intervenor. Any public carrier operating without a certificate of public convenience shall, upon such a finding by the Authority, be liable for the payment of a penalty in an amount not to exceed $500 per day of operation for the first such finding, and not to exceed $1,000 per day for the second or subsequent such findings. An action alleging failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall include an action alleging a continuing offense and the penalty contemplated herein shall be assessed for each day of operations in which a violation is proven. Whenever the Authority, pursuant to its duties under this chapter, shall investigate the operations, services, rates, charges, accounting records, or practices of any public carrier, including a public carrier operating without having received a certificate of public convenience and necessity, and shall hold a hearing in connection therewith, such public carrier shall be charged with and pay such portion of the expenses of the Authority, and the compensation and expenses of its agents, representatives, consultants, and employees as is reasonably attributable to such investigation, provided that notice of the intent to so charge the public carrier shall be given to the public carrier as soon as the Authority makes such intent. This provision shall not apply to the compensation of the full-time employees of the Authority. The Authority shall have the power to subpoena such records and witnesses as it may require to carry on an investigation pursuant to this chapter. In order to maintain and foster the effective regulation of public carriers under this title, public carriers subject to regulation of the Authority shall bear the expense of regulation by means of an assessment measured by the annual gross revenue of such public carriers. This assessment shall be in addition to all other fees and charges imposed by the Authority pursuant to this title. Such assessment shall be in the amount equal to the product of .002 (2 mills) multiplied by the public carrier's gross operating revenue for each of the State's fiscal years. Whenever a public carrier commences operations on a date other than July 1, so that it has not operated for a full fiscal year prior to the date its assessment is calculated, such carrier's assessment shall be prorated, based on the portion of the fiscal year during which the carrier operated. On or before October 1 of each year, each public carrier subject to this title shall file with the Authority an annual gross revenue return. Forms for such returns and amended returns shall be devised and supplied by the Authority. (1) All returns and the accompanying fees submitted to the Authority by a public carrier, as provided in this section, shall be sworn to by an appropriate officer of the public carrier. The Authority may audit each such return submitted and may take such measures as are necessary to ascertain the correctness of the returns submitted, and to require the correction of incorrect returns. All returns will be used for the regulatory purposes set out in this section, and shall not be open to 858 Chapter 255 public inspection under federal or state Freedom of Information statutes and shall be precluded from discovery or inspection as a privileged business record, except as oillerwise provided by law. In default of compliance with this section, the public carrier shall be subject to the penalties provided in subsection (m) below. Each payment of the assessment imposed by this section is due by midnight of the date specified. Late filings will be subject to payment of a late fee to be determined by the Authority in its Regulations. If a public carrier has failed to pay or has underpaid the proper amount, it shall pay a penalty to the Authority of 11/4 of the amount due for each month or fraction thereof that such amount remains unpaid. The Authority may enforce the collection of any delinquent payments by any legal action or other manner by which the collection of debts due the State may be enforced under the laws of this State. There is hereby maintained within the Authority a special fund designated as the Delaware Transportation Authority Regulatory Revolving Fund, which shall continue to be used in the operation of the Authority in the performance of the various regulatory functions and duties required of it by law. (1) All fees, licenses, assessments and other charges collected by the Authority pursuant to this title shall be deposited in the Delaware Transportation Authority Regulatory Revolving Fund to be used by the Authority as provided above, subject to annual appropriations by the General Assembly for salaries and other routine operating expenses of the Authority. All penalties or fines assessed and collected by the Authority shall be deposited in said Fund to be used only for such purposes as described in this chapter. In default of compliance with this chapter, the rules and regulations, or any order of the Authority when the same becomes effective, the public carrier shall be subject to (1) a penalty of up to $500 per day for every day during which such default continues, to be recovered in an action in the name of the State; and (2) the suspension, for a duration not to exceed one year, or revocation of the public carrier's certificate of public convenience and necessity. The observance of the rules and regulations and orders of the Authority may be compelled by mandamus or injunction. Within 10 days of receiving notice that it is in default of compliance, the public carrier may appeal to the Authority for a hearing. Should the Authority, after such hearing, determine that the public carrier remains in default of compliance, the public carrier may appeal to the Superior Court. Such an appeal will be on the record only and shall be taken as provided in Rule 72 of the Superior Court Civil Rules. The burden of proof of any such appeal is on the public carrier. Whoever knowingly performs, commits or does, or participates in performing, committing or doing, or knowingly causes, participates or joins with others in causing any public carrier to do, perform, or commit, or advises, solicits, persuades or knowingly instructs, directs or orders any officer, agent or employee of any public carrier to perform, commit or do any act or thing prohibited by this chapter shall be fined not more than $2,000 or imprisoned not more than 6 months or both. (0) The Authority is authorized to hire sufficient staff to carry out this chapter subject only to the funding granted by the General Assembly. The Authority shall prescribe by rule, regulation, or order minimum amounts and kinds of insurance which shall be carried by public carriers, provided that no public carrier shall be permitted to operate as such unless and until each and all of its vehicles transporting passengers shall be covered by and with a public liability and property damage insurance policy or policies issued by an insurance company authorized to do business in the State of Delaware in the minimum amounts of $100,000 per person per accident for personal injury or death and $50,000 per accident for property damage. The Authority shall have jurisdiction to review, investigate, conduct hearings, revise and approve all rates, fares, tariffs, or changes imposed or sought to be imposed upon the public in accordance with the following: Chapter 255 859 Every public carrier shall file with the Authority complete schedules of every classification of fares or rates charged by it for service offered in this State. A current copy of all rates, fares or tariffs in effect shall be kept available for inspection by the public at the business office of the carrier and in or on each vehicle used by the public carrier in performing its services. Every application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall include a proposed rate schedule shall be approved by the Authority prior to its granting the certificate to the applicant. Rates, fares, tariffs, or charges of each public carrier may be based upon the public carrier's operating ratio or by reference to the rate base of the carrier, a fair rate of return for the carrier and the revenues and expenses of the carrier. The Authority shall have access, upon reasonable notice, to all records, books and documents of a public carrier which the Authority deems relevant in enabling it to act upon rates, fares, tariffs, and charges of the carrier, including records, books and documents in the custody of a third party. No public carrier shall make, impose, or exact any unjust or unreasonable or unduly preferential or unjustly discriminatory individual or joint rate or fare for any service supplied by it within this State. No public carrier shall put into effect any new rate or fare except after 30 days' notice to the Authority, which notice shall plainly state the new rate or fare and the time such new rate or fare will go into effect. The public carrier shall also post a notice of the new rate or fare at its place of business 30 days prior to the intended effective date of such new rate or fare. All proposed new rates or fares shall be published at least one a week for two consecutive weeks during the 30-day period in a newspaper of county wide circulation in each county in which the public carrier holds itself out to operate, in a form approved by the authority. The Authority may, for good cause shown, permit temporary changes in fares to take effect without requiring the 30 day notice, provided, however, that such temporary changes shall be in effect for only so long as the request for same shall state. Any such temporary change shall be clearly posted at the public carrier's place of business and in each of its vehicles. The Authority may, either upon complaint or upon its own initiative, hold a hearing concerning the lawfulness of a rate or fare charged by a public carrier. Such hearing shall be scheduled 20 days after written notice to the public carrier and after notice of such hearing is published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which such carrier operates. The hearing will be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 211. C. ch. 101. The Authority may, after notice and a hearing, in writing, fix just and reasonable individual rates or fares, joint rates or fares, charges or schedules thereof, as well as commutation, mileage, and other special rates or fares, which shall be imposed, observed, and followed thereafter by any public carrier affected by such order. An order entered in accordance with this subsection shall be effective 30 days following the date the order is issued, unless the Authority, in its discretion, makes the order effective at an earlier date. In any hearing to determine the lawfulness of a rate, fare, or charge imposed by the public carrier, the burden of proof that the rate, fare, or charge is lawful is on the public carrier. The standard of review utilized by the Authority to determine if any rate, fare, tariff or charges whether proposed or approved is lawful is whether said rate, fare, tariff or charge is reasonable and in accord with the public and the financial obligation of the public carrier. Upon review by the Authority of all surrounding circumstances.\". Section 9.

To foster economic development in this State, responsible and reasonable investment in and development of telecommunications systems employing advanced technology shall be encouraged as an integral part of the State's infrastructure. The availability of customer choices among a continuously developing variety of telecommunications services shall be encouraged. The growth of competitive markets for the provision of telecommunications services shall be encouraged and, where they exist or develop in the future, the availability, price, terms of service and quality should be determined by such competitive markets. \u00a7703. Commission Authority To create an environment which permits the pursuit of the policy declared herein, the General Assembly finds and declares that: In a competitive marketplace, some utility regulation may be necessary in protecting the public interest. However, where competition helps promote efficiency in the use of resources, deployment of technology or fosters productivity and innovation, such competition shall be authorized and encouraged by the Commission. Where competitive market pressures are inadequate for regulation of price, as well as availability and terms of service for particular telecommunications services, the Commission is authorized and encouraged to develop and implement alternate methods of regulation which will encourage the providers of such services to take advantage of technological advances and efficiencies. The Commission is authorized and encouraged to respond to the changing technology and structure of the telecommunications industry by modifying its regulation of telecommunications services where such modifications will foster the universal availability of basic telecommunications services; protect the public interest; promote efficiency in public and private resource allocation or encourage economic development. Such authorized modifications include, but are not limited to, such regulatory features as: incentive regulation, earnings sharing, categorization of services for the purposes of pricing, price caps, price indexing, ranges of authorized returns, detariffing and deregulation. In conjunction with alternative methods 862 Chapter 258 of regulation, the Commission is encouraged to consider appropriate safeguards to (a) protect customers of service which the Commission has not found to be competitive and (b) protect the further development of competition In the state. The Commission is specifically authorized to depart from rate base, rate of return regulation.\" Approved June 10, 1992.

'Infant means any child who is less than six (6) months of age. 'Licensed agency' means any agency granted a license by the Department to place children for adoption.

'Presumed father' means any man who is assumed to be the father of a child in accordance with Chapter 8 of this title. \u00a71102. Jurisdiction and Venue The Family Court shall have 3urisdiction of proceedings under this chapter to terminate parental rights.

Chapter 276 897 (c) Whenever the Family Court shall assume jurisdiction for the purposes of this chapter, it shall be deemed to have retained jurisdiction for the purpose of proceeding under Chapter 9 of this Title relating to adoption. \u00a71103. Grounds for Termination of Parental Rights (a) The procedure for termination of parental rights for the purpose of adoption or, if a suitable adoption plan cannot be effected, for the purpose of providing for the care of the child by some other plan which may or may not contemplate the continued possibility of eventual adoption, may be initiated whenever it appears to be in the child's best interest and that one or more of the following grounds exist: The parent or parents of a child, or the person or persons or organization holding parental rights over such child, desires to relinquish such parental rights for the purpose of adoption; The child has been abandoned; or The parent or parents of the child or any person or persons holding parental rights over such child are found by the Court to be mentally incompetent and, from evidence of two qualified psychiatrists selected by the court, found to be unable to discharge parental responsibilities in the foreseeable future. The court shall appoint a licensed attorney as guardian Ad litAM to represent the alleged incompetent in the proceeding; or The parent or parents of a child are convicted of a felony in which this child is a victim or which involves harm to the child; or The parent or parents of the child, or any person or persons holding parental rights over such child, are not able, or have failed, to plan adequately for the child's physical needs or his mental and emotional health and development and; a. In the case of a child in the care of the Department or licensed agency: The child has been in the care of the Department or licensed agency for a period of one year, or for a period of six months in the case of a child who comes into care as an infant, or there is a history of previous placement or placements of this child; or a history of neglect, abuse or lack of care of this child or other children by this parent; or the parent has been convicted of a felony involving the child; or the parent is incapable of discharging parental responsibilities because of extended or repeated incarceration, except that the Court shall consider post-conviction conduct of the parent or parents. The conditions which led to the child's placement, or similar conditions of a harmful nature, continue to exist and there appears to be little likelihood that these conditions will be remedied at an early date which would enable the parent to discharge parental responsibilities so that the child can be returned to the parent in the near future. b. In the case of a child in the home of a stepparent or blood relative: The child has resided in the home of the stepparent or blood relative for a period of at least one year, or for a period of six months in the case of an infant; and The Court finds the non-custodial parent or parents incapable of discharging parental responsibilities, and that there appears to be little likelihood such parent or parents will be able to discharge such parental responsibilities in the near future. (b) Unless adoption is contemplated, the termination of one parent's rights by the other parent shall not be granted if the effect will be to 898 Chapter 276 leave only one parent holding parental rights, unless the court shall find the continuation of the rights to be terminated will be harmful to the child.

Advisory Council on Career and Vocational Education 30.4 30.5 (b)(1) Salaries of designated positions in Section 10(a) of this Act shall have no further increase applied by any other section of this Act except as provided in Section 10(b)(11), Section 10(b)(iii), Section 10(b)(iv), Section 10(d) or Section 10(f). The salaries contained in Section 10(a) of this Act for the Kent County Prothonotary and the Sussex County Prothonotary shall remain in effect until such time as the current term expires or the position becomes vacant. Upon expiration of the current term or when a vacancy occurs, the State Personnel Director, the Budget Director and the Controller General shall determine an evaluated pay range for the position based on a Position Classification Questionnaire (PCQ) approved by the President Judge of the Superior Court. If the elected incumbent is appointed, the salary in effect shall remain at the current level or be brought to the minimum of the evaluated pay range, whichever is greater. If the appointee is other than the elected incumbent, compensation shall be set according to Sections 10(b)(iii) and (iv) of this Act. If a position in Section 10(a) becomes vacant during the fiscal year and the scheduled salary associated with a vacant position is below the position's evaluated midpoint and the appointing authority determines that a suitable replacement cannot be recruited and hired for the compensation provided under this Section, the appointing authority may submit a request to the State Personnel Director to increase the salary up to the evaluated midpoint. If the scheduled salary associated with a vacant position is above the position's evaluated midpoint, the appointing authority shall justify to the State Personnel Director why the salary of a proposed replacement should be kept above the evaluated midpoint. If adequate justification cannot be provided, the starting salary shall be decreased as appropriate and may be set lower than the evaluated midpoint depending upon the qualifications of the proposed incumbent. In reviewing requests made pursuant to this paragraph, the State Personnel Director shall provide an analysis of the request and shall solicit the advice and written consent of the Budget Director and the Controller General. Regardless of the provisions of this Act, any state employee who is offered a promotional opportunity to become a Division Level Manager and who at the time such offer Is made, is being paid a salary that equals or exceeds the salary for the Division Level Manager position as established by this Section of this Act, shall be eligible for a five percent promotional salary increase. This eligibility shall be conditioned on a determination that the duties and responsibilities of the Division Level Manager position are at least one paygrade higher than the position proposed to be vacated based on a comparison of equivalent value. For the purpose of this paragraph, the equivalent value of one paygrade is defined as a seven percent difference in the constant fiscal year dollar value of the evaluated pay range midpoint of the Division Level Manager position compared to the position that the employee is vacating. If an employee is offered an appointment to a Division Level Manager position that has an equivalent value equal to or less than the paygrade assigned to the position the employee is vacating, the employee may retain his/her current salary, provided that it does not exceed the evaluated pay range midpoint, or the current salary of the Division Level Manager position, whichever is greater. Effective May 1, 1993, the Office of State Personnel shall submit to the Joint Finance Committee a listing of employees designated in Section 10(a). The listing shall indicate for each position the number of points applicable for Fiscal Year 1993 and the number of points of any recommended changes for any position for Fiscal Year 1994. Effective January 19, 1993, the annual salary for the Governor shall be increased to $95.0 pursuant to the Delaware Compensation Commission Final Report dated January 1, 1989. The report has the force and effect of law since it was not rejected in full by the General Assembly prior to February 1, 1989. Amend Title 29, Chapter 33, Section 3304, Delaware Code by deleting the date \"February 1, 1989\" and substituting in lieu thereof the phrase \"the 1st day of February following submission.\" The salaries contained in Section 10(a) of this Act may be increased according to the recommendations of the Delaware Compensation Commission Report as contained in Title 29, Chapter 33, Delaware Code, as amended in this Act.

In the event that there are no similar positions in the Merit System, the State Personnel Director shall establish an exempt position classification only for the purpose of assigning a salary or wage rate to said position. On or before August 15, 1992, the State Personnel Director shall publish a list of exempt positions and the comparable Merit System class and/or paygrade for each position. In addition, such listing shall show the name of the incumbent, if the position is filled, and shall show the statutory citation which authorizes the establishment of the exempt position(s). The State Personnel Director shall provide copies of such listing to members of the Joint Finance Committee and the Controller General. No exempt employee shall be hired until said list is published. No reclassification of exempt employee, otherwise permitted under Delaware law, shall become effective unless and until a new position is placed on the comparability list. In order to permit the development of the comparability list, state agencies shall provide to the State Personnel Director job descriptions of all exempt positions and position classification questionnaires describing the duties and responsibilities of each of the positions. The certification of comparability by the State Personnel Director shall not be withheld unreasonably. Those 980 Chapter 290 positions assigned on a list of comparability that are assigned a comparable class and/or paygrade in the Merit System shall be paid in accordance with Sections 8(c) and (d) of this Act and Merit System Rules 13.0110 and 5.0900 through 5.0931; no other salary increases shall be given to such employees unless specifically authorized in this Act. (II) Positions authorized by this Act in accordance with Title 29, Section 5903(5) shall retain the paygrade comparability authorized by Volume 68, Chapter 84, Laws of Delaware, formerly House Bill No. 350, Seetion 11. Any changes in paygrade comparability must be approved by the Personnel Director, Budget Director and Controller General. The salary of employees whose salary in effect as of June 30, 1992, is below the minimum salary of the assigned paygrade of the pay plan shall be raised to the minimum salary. This adjustment shall be made after the implementation of the general increase contained in Section 8(d)(1). Notwithstanding any other provision of the Delaware Law or this Act to the contrary, civilian employees of the Delaware National Guard shall be compensated at a salary and wage rate established by the Federal Civil Service Commission. Merit rules 5.0900 through 5.0931 and the applicable appeal rights provided in Title 29, Section 5915, Delaware Code, shall apply retroactively to any employee who was an incumbent in a merit comparable position that was reviewed for class/paygrade comparability with an effective date of July 1, 1990 or July 1, 1991. Section 12. The payment of hazardous duty pay to selected casual/seasonal employees by the Department of Correction and the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families has been provided in accordance with all applicable statutes. Section 13. Any employee eligible for termination pay, whose regular pay was from special funds, shall have termination pay paid from special funds. If the employee's regular pay is from both General Funds and special funds, termination pay shall be on a pro rata basis. The Intent of this Section is that if any school district charges their local share to Division III - Equalization Funds, that for termination pay purposes only, these funds are considered special funds. Exceptions to this method of payment must have the approval of the Budget Director and Controller General. All agencies shall absorb termination pay within the appropriations set forth in Section 1 of this Act. Section 14. All agencies or schools receiving federal funds must transfer to the Budget Office three-tenths or five-tenths of one percent, respectively, of the federal funds received to a special fund account known as the \"Federal Audit Set-Aside Account\".

Further, when heating and cooling systems permit, administrative areas of such facilities should be operated at the temperatures stated in this section. Additionally, any room or area that houses computer mainframe equipment or other equipment that requires precise climate controlled conditions in order to operate efficiently shall also be exempt. These actions are necessary in order to allow the state to reduce its annual energy consumption and to ensure that each agency can cover its energy needs within the appropriation contained in Section 1 of this Act. Section 18. Section 1 of this Act provides funding for a state employee pension rate of 10.60 percent. The components of the rate are approximately 6.25 percent for the pension liability and 4.35 percent for the retiree health insurance liability.

(a) Section 1 of this Act provides an appropriation of $2,830.7 to Public Education, Pupil Transportation (95-04-01) for Non-Public School Transportation Reimbursements. This appropriation shall be allocated for qualifying non-public, non-profit schools, based on the procedure adopted by the Joint Finance Committee on April 16, 1981. (b) Transportation funds for public school districts during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, shall be allocated and shall not exceed $35,928.2, according to bus contract or district transportation formula, as adopted by the State Board of Education on July 23, 1987, subject to the following amendments and procedural modifications: (1) The per gallon price used to calculate the gasoline allowance shall be based on the state contract bid price for unleaded gasoline plus $.07 per gallon for districts and plus $.28 per gallon for contractors. For districts and contractors north of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, the per gallon price shall be based on delivery to a large-sized tank (5,000 or more gallons). In the case of contractors located south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, the per gallon price shall be based on delivery to a small-sized tank (275 - 1,900 gallons). Upon determination by the State Board of Education that a contractor located North of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and operating five or fewer buses does not have existing storage capacity in the large tank range, the per gallon price shall be based on the smaller tank size. During Chapter 290 1021 Fiscal Year 1993, the Department of Public Instruction is authorized to continue to calculate gasoline price adjustments for contractors based on a published price of gasoline. The source of this price must be agreed upon by the State Budget Director and Controller General and will be used as a proxy for fluctuations in the state bid price had a fixed price not been set. Adjustments will be made according to existing State Board of Education regulations. The Fiscal Year 1993 operating allowance will not be adjusted for inflation. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, the allowable cost of a new bus purchased by a contractor shall be the Fiscal Year 1992 state bid price for new buses minus three percent for salvage value, plus 10 percent to account for dealer charges and profits not reflected in the state bid price due to the higher number of buses being purchased and the lag time between the ordering and delivery. The State Board of Education shall continue to utilize the procedures developed in Fiscal Year 1989 for determining the allowable cost for any size bus that it did not bid in Fiscal Year 1992. In addition to the procedure for establishing the allowable cost of a new bus specified above, the State Board of Education is requested to structure its bids for buses in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, in such a manner that public school bus contractors will be permitted to purchase buses from the successful lower bidder at the same price as the State of Delaware. If a contractor elects to purchase a bus at the bid price, that bid price minus 3 percent for salvage value will be the allowable cost in subsequent reimbursements to the contractor. The formula rate for reimbursing public school bus contractors for the cost of liability Insurance shall be determined by the State Board of Education in consultation with the Insurance Commissioner based on the data available on April 30 of the previous fiscal year. The State Board of Education shall amend its transportation formula to permit replacement of a vehicle which has operated 100,000 school-related miles and is seven model-years old or a vehicle which has operated 150,000 school-related miles regardless of the age of the vehicle. The State Board of Education is authorized to amend its formula to allow the purchase of diesel-powered buses as the minimum standard in those sizes where gasoline-powered buses are no longer available. Except as specified in the Section, or for changes in the price of gasoline, or for the adjustments of those items changed by state or federal laws, the State Board of Education shall not change the transportation formula unless the change has been authorized by the General Assembly and an appropriation therefore has been made by the General Assembly. An account called the Transportation Incentive Fund shall be established for each school district in the state which has a district-operated pupil transportation system. When the State Board of Education approves the district-operated pupil transportation funding allocation for a school district and initiates the transfer of state funds to the district transportation account, an amount equivalent to ten percent of the district's prior year net allocation for district-operated pupil transportation shall be placed into the district's Transportation Incentive Fund account. Into the district's current year district-operated pupil transportation account shall be placed the difference between the current year district-operated pupil transportation allocation and the amount placed into the district's Transportation Incentive Fund account. Funds in the Transportation Incentive Fund account may be transferred at any time to the district transportation account. On June 1, 1993, any balance remaining in the Transportation Incentive Fund account may be transferred to Division II - All Other Costs if the district so chooses based on a projected year-end transportation surplus. In no case shall district transportation cost overruns be reimbursed with state funds if a transfer identified in the previous sentence has been made. If pupil transportation savings cannot be realized, up to the full balance in the Transportation Incentive Fund account may be transferred to the school district's transportation account.

Other provisions on Handicap (1) For purposes of this chapter, discrimination on the basis of handicap also includes a refusal to permit, at the expense of the handicapped person, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises; except that, in the case of a rental, the landlord may where it is reasonable to do so condition permission for a modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted; a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommoda tions may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; a failure to design and construct or alter those two categories of multifamily dwellings specified at the end of this subparagraph in such a manner that- the dwellings have at least one building entrance on an accessible route, unless it is impractical to do so because of the terrain or unusual characteristics of the site; with respect to dwellings with a building entrance on an accessible route: (aa) the public use and common use portions of such dwellings are readily accessible to and usable by hand- icapped persons; (bb) all the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises within such dwellings are sufficiently wide to allow passage by handicapped persons in wheelchairs; and (cc) all premises within such dwellings contain the following features of adaptive design: an accessible route into and through the dwelling; light switches, electrical outlets, thermos- tats, and other environmental controls in accessible locations; reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and usable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual in a wheelchair can maneuver about the space and make use of the facilities. 1072 Chapter 311 This subparagraph (C) applies to the following two categories of covered multifamily dwellings: covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after the effective date of this Act, and covered multifamily dwellings after one year from the effective date of this Act, undergoing alterations costing fifty percent or more of the replacement cost of the building unless to do so is structurally impracticable; or (D) to make an inquiry to determine whether an applicant for a dwelling, a person intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented or made available, or any person associated with that person, has a handicap or to make inquiry as to the nature or severity of a handicap of such a person. However, this paragraph does not prohibit the following inquiries, provided these inquiries are made of all applicants, whether or not they have handicaps: Inquiry into an applicant's ability to meet the requirements of ownership or tenancy; Inquiry to determine whether an applicant is qualified for a dwelling available only to persons with a particular type of handicap; Inquiry to determine whether an applicant for a dwelling is qualified for a priority available to persons with handicaps or to persons with a particular type of handicap; or Inquiry to determine whether an applicant for a dwelling is a current illegal user of a controlled substance. (2) Compliance with the appropriate requirements of the American National Standard for buildings and facilities providing accessibility and usability for physically handicapped people (commonly cited as \"ANSI A117.1\") suffices to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (1)(C)(ii)(cc). (3) (A) If an agency or a political subdivision of the State has incorporated into its laws the requirements set forth in paragraph (1)(C), compliance with such laws shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of that paragraph. The State or a political subdivision thereof with a building code may review and approve newly constructed covered multifamily dwellings for the purpose of making determinations as to whether the design and construction requirements of paragraph (1)(C) are met. The Commission shall encourage, but may not require, any agency or political subdivision of the State to Include in their existing procedures for the review and approval of newly constructed covered multifamily dwellings, determinations as to whether the design and construction of such dwellings are consistent with paragraph (1)(C), and may provide technical assistance to the State, political subdivisions thereof and other persons to implement the requirements of paragraph (1)(C). (0) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the Commission to review or approve the plans, designs or construction of any covered multifamily dwellings, to determine whether the design and construction of such dwellings are consistent with the requirements of paragraph (1)(C). (4) (A) Nothing in paragraph (5) shall be construed to affect the authority and responsibility of the Commission to receive and process complaints or otherwise engage in enforcement activities under this chapter. (B) Determinations by an agency or a political subdivision of the State under paragraphs (3)(A) and (B) shall not be conclusive in enforcement proceedings under this chapter. Li (5) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to invalidate or limit any law of the State or political subdivision thereof, that requires dwellings to be designed and constructed in a manner that affords handicapped persons greater access than is required by this chapter. (g) Nothing in this section requires that a dwelling be made available to a handicapped individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others. \u00a74604.

Nothing in this chapter limits the applicability of any reasonable local, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling as long as they are applied to all occupants and do not operate to discriminate or have the effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, creed, sex, marital status, familial status, age or handicap.

An 'involved insurer' includes an insurer which either acquires or is acquired, is affiliated with an acquirer or acquired or is the result of a merger. B. Scope. Except as exempted in Paragraph (2) of this subsection, this section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state. This Section shall not apply to the following: Chapter 325 (a) An acquisition subject to approval or disapproval by the Commissioner pursuant to Section 5003; (b) A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes so long as such securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in any insurance market in this state. If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control under Section 5001(C), it is not solely for investment purposes unless the Commissioner of the insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and such disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary Commissioner to the Commissioner of this state; (c) The acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if pre-acquisition notification is filed with the Commissioner in accordance with Subsection 5003.1(C)(1) thirty days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition. However, such pre-acquisition notification is not required for exclusion from this Section if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this Section by any other subparagraph of Section 5003.1(B)(2); (d) The acquisition of already affiliated persons; (e) An acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition, In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed five percent of the total market, There would be no increase in any market share, or In no market would -The combined market share of the involved insurers exceeds twelve percent of the total market, and -The market share increases by more than two percent of the total market. For the purpose of this Subparagraph (2)(e), a market means direct written insurance premium in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state; (f) An acquisition for which a pre-acquisition notification would be required pursuant to this Section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business; (g) An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary Commissioner affirmatively finds that such insurer is in failing condition; there is a lack of feasible alternative to improving such condition; the public benefits of improving such insurer's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; and such findings are communicated by the domiciliary Commissioner to the Commissioner of this state. C. Pre-acquisition Notification, Waiting Period. An acquisition covered by Subsection 5003.1(B) may be subject to an order pursuant to Subsection 5003.1(E) unless the acquiring person files a pre-acquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The acquired person may file a pre-acquisition notification. The Commissioner shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under this Subsection in the same manner as provided in Section 5007 of this Chapter. (1) The pre-acquisition notification shall be in such form and contain such information as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners relating to those markets which, under Subsection 5003.1(B)(2)(e), cause the acquisition not to be exempted from the provisions of this Section. The Commissioner may require such additional material and information as he deems necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive 1131 standard of Subsection 5003.1(D). The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of such person indicating his or her ability to render an informed opinion. (2) The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt of the Commissioner of a pre-acquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after the date of such receipt, or termination of the waiting period by the Commissioner. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the Commissioner on a one-time basis may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after receipt of such additional information by the Commissioner or termination of the waiting period by the Commissioner. D. Competitive Standard. The Commissioner may enter an order under Section 5003.1(E)(1) with respect to an acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly therein or if the insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with Subsection 5003.1(C). In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive standard of Paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commissioner shall consider the following: (a) Any acquisition covered under Subsection 5003.1(B) involving two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards If the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market: Insurer A Insurer B 4% 4% or more 10% 2% or more 15% 1% or more or, if the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following shares of the market: Insurer A Insurer B 5% 5% or more or more 15% 3% or more 19% 1% or more A highly concentrated market is one in which the share of the four largest insurers is seventy-five percent or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than two insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the two columns in the table is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in Paragraph (1) of this subsection. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the insurer with the largest share of the market shall be deemed to be Insurer A. (b) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market,from the two largest to the eight largest,has increased by seven percent or more of the market over a period of time extending from any base year five to ten years prior to the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. Any acquisition or merger covered under Subsection 5003.1(b) involving two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie 1132 Chapter 325 Chapter 325 1133 evidence of violation of the competitive standard in Paragraph (1) of this subsection if: There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market; One of the insurers involved is one of the Insurers in a grouping of such large insurers showing the requisite increase in the market share; and Another involved insurer's market is two percent or more. (c) For the purposes of Subsection 5003.1(0)(2): The term \"insurer\" Includes any company or group of companies under common management, ownership or control; The term \"market\" means the relevant product and geographical markets. In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the Commissioner shall give due consideration to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, such line being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by Insurers doing business in this state, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be this state. The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard rests upon the Commissioner. (d) Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard under Subparagraphs (2)(a) and (2)(b) of this subsection, the Commissioner may establish the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Even though an acquisition Is prima facie violative of the competitive standard under Subparagraphs (2)(a) and (2)(b) of this subsection, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination under this paragraph Include, but are not limited to, the following: market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry, and ease of entry and exit into the market. (3) An order may not be entered under Section 5003.1(E)(1) if: The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way, and the public benefits which would arise from such economies exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition; or The acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance, and the public benefits of such increase exceed the public benefits which would arise from not lessening competition. E. Orders and Penalties. (1)(a) If an acquisition violates the standards of this section, the Commissioner may enter an order Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation, or Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in this state. (b) Such an order shall not be entered unless (a) there is a hearing, (b) notice of such hearing is issued prior to the end of the waiting period and not less than fifteen days prior to the hearing, and (c) the hearing is 13.34 Chapter 325 concluded and the order is issued no later than sixty days after the end of the waiting period. Every order shall be accompanied by a written decision of the Commissioner setting forth his findings of fact and conclusions of law. An order entered under this paragraph shall not become final earlier than thirty days after it is issued, during which time the involved insurer may submit a plan to remedy the anticompetitive impact of the acquisition within a reasonable time. Based upon such plan or other information, the Commissioner shall specify the conditions, if any, under the time period during which the aspects of the acquisition causing a violation of the standards of this Section would be remedied and the order vacated or modified. An order pursuant to this paragraph shall not apply if the acquisition is not consummated. (2) Any person who violates a cease and desist order of the Commissioner under Paragraph (1) and while such order is in effect may, after notice and hearing and upon order of the Commissioner, be subject at the discretion of the Commissioner to any one or more of the following: A monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for every day of violation and/or Suspension or revocation of such person's license. (3) Any insurer or other person who fails to make any filing required by this Section, and who also fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with any such filing requirement, shall be subject to a fine of not more than $50,000.

The Commissioner shall disallow such a disclaimer only after furnishing all parties in interest with notice and opportunity to be heard and after making specific findings of fact to support such disallowance. Violations. The failure to file a registration statement or any summary of the registration statement thereto required by this Section within the time specified for such filing shall be a violation of this Section. Section 5005. Standards and Management of an Insurer Within a Holding Company System. A. Transactions Within a Holding Company System. (1) Transactions within a holding company system to which an insurer subject to registration is a party shall be subject to the following standards: The terms shall be fair and reasonable; Charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable; Expenses incurred and payment received shall be allocated to the Insurer in conformity with customary insurance accounting practices consistently applied; The books, accounts and records of each party to all such transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the nature and details of the transactions including such accounting information as is necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees to the respective parties; and The insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. (2) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and any person in its holding company system may not be entered into unless the insurer has notified the Commissioner in writing of its intention to enter into such transaction at least thirty days prior thereto, or such shorter period as the Commissioner may permit, and the Commissioner has not disapproved it within such period. Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, guarantees, or investments provided such transactions are equal to or exceed: a) with respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent of surplus as regards policyholders; b) with respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets: each as of the 31st day of December next preceding; Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate, where the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of credit to, to purchase assets of, or to make investments in, any affiliate of the insurer making such loans or extensions of credit provided such Chapter 325 1137 transactions are equal to or exceed: a) with respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurer's admitted assets or twenty-five percent% of surplus as regards policyholders; b) with respect to life Insurers, three percent of the insurer's admitted assets: each as of the 31st day of December next preceding; Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the Insurer's liabilities equals or exceeds five percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as of the 31st day of December next preceding, including those agreements which may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a non-affiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer and non-affiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the insurer; All management agreements, service contracts and all cost-sharing arrangements; and Any material transactions, specified by regulation, which the Commissioner determines may adversely affect the interests of the insurer's policyholders. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize or permit any transactions which, in the case of an insurer not a member of the same holding company system, would be otherwise contrary to law. A domestic insurer may not enter into transactions which are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the holding company system if the purpose of those separate transactions Is to avoid the statutory threshold amount and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the Commissioner determines that such separate transactions were entered into over any twelve month period for such purpose, he may exercise his authority under Section 10. The Commissioner, in reviewing transactions pursuant to Subsection (A) Paragraph 2, shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in Subsection (A) Paragraph 1 and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders. The Commissioner shall be notified within thirty days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds ten percent of such corporation's voting securities. B. Dividends and other Distributions. No domestic insurer shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until (1) thirty days after the Commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such payment, or (2) the Commissioner shall have approved such payment within such thirty-day period. For purposes of this Section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the greater of (1) ten percent of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the 31st day of December next preceding, or (2) the net gain from operations of such insurer, if such insurer is a life insurer, or the net income, if such insurer Is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the twelve-month period ending the 31st day of December next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon the Commissioner's approve/ thereof, and such a declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until (1) the 1138 Chapter 325 Commissioner has approved the payment of such a dividend or distribution or (2) the Commissioner has not disapproved such payment within the thirtyday period referred to above. C. Adequacy of Surplus. For purposes of this Chapter, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered: The size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and other appropriate criteria; The extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the several lines of insurance; The number and size of risks insured in each line of business; The extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risks; The nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program; The quality, diversification and liquidity of the Insurer's investment portfolio; The recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer's investment portfolio; The surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers; The adequacy of the insurer's reserves; and The quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The Commissioner may treat any such investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever in his judgment such investment so warrants. Section 5006. Examination Power of Commissioner. Subject to the limitation contained in this Section and in addition to the powers which the Commissioner has under Chapter 3 relating to the examination of insurers, the Commissioner shall also have the power to order any insurer registered under Sectton5004 to produce such records, books, or other information papers in the possession of the insurer or its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to ascertain the financial condition of such insurer or to determine compliance with this Chapter. In the event such insurer fails to comply with such order, the Commissioner shall have the power to examine such affiliates to obtain such information. Use of Consultants. The Commissioner may retain at the registered insurer's expense such attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts not otherwise a part of the Commissioner's staff as shall be reasonably necessary to assist in the conduct of the examination under Subsection (A) above. Any persons so retained shall be under the direction and control of the Commissioner and shall act in a purely advisory capacity. Expenses. Each registered insurer producing for examination records, books and papers pursuant to Subsection (A) above shall be liable for and shall pay the expense of such examination in accordance with Section 326 of this Title. Section 5007. Confidential Treatment All information, documents and copies thereof obtained by or disclosed to the Commissioner or any other person in the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant to Section 5006 and all information reported pursuant to Section 5004 and Section 5005, shall be given confidential treatment and shall not be subject to subpoena and shall not be made public by the Commissioner, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Chapter 325 1139 or any other person, except to insurance departments of other states, without the prior written consent of the insurer to which it pertains unless the Commissioner, after giving the insurer and its affiliates who would be affected thereby, notice and opportunity to be heard, determines that the interest of policyholders, shareholders or the public will be served by the publication thereof, in which event he may publish all or any part thereof in such manner as he may deem appropriate. Section 5008. Rules and Regulations The Commissioner may, upon notice and opportunity for all interested persons to be heard, issue such rules, regulations and orders as shall be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Chapter. Section 5009. Injunctions, Prohibitions Against Voting Securities, Sequestration of Voting Securities. Injunctions. Whenever it appears to the Commissioner that any insurer or any director, officer, employee or agent thereof has committed or is about to commit a violation of this Chapter or of any rule, regulation or order issued by the Commissioner hereunder, the Commissioner may apply to the Chancery Court for an order enjoining such insurer or such director, officer, employee or agent thereof from violating or continuing to violate this Chapter or any such rule, regulation or order, and for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the Insurer's policyholders, creditors and shareholders or the public may require. Voting of Securities; When Prohibited. No security which is the subject of any agreement or arrangement regarding acquisition, or which is acquired or to be acquired, in contravention of the provisions of this Chapter or of any rule, regulation or order issued by the Commissioner hereunder may be voted at any shareholder's meeting, or may be counted for quorum purposes, and any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though such securities were not issued and outstanding; but no action taken at any such meeting shall be invalidated by the voting of such securities, unless the action would materially affect control of the insurer or unless the courts of this State have so ordered. If an insurer or the Commissioner has reason to believe that any security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in contravention of the provisions of this Chapter or of any rule, regulation or order issued by the Commissioner hereunder; the insurer or the Commissioner may apply to the Chancery Court to enjoin any offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition made in contravention of Section 5003 or any rule, regulation or order issued by the Commissioner thereunder to enjoin the voting of any security so acquired, to void any vote of such security already cast at any meeting of shareholders and for such other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the insurer's policyholders, creditor and shareholders or the public may require. Sequestration of Voting Securities. In any case where a person has acquired or Is proposing to acquire any voting securities in violation of this Chapter or any rule, regulation or order issued by the Commissioner hereunder, the Chancery Court may, on such notice as the court deems appropriate, upon the application of the insurer or the Commissioner seize or sequester any voting securities of the insurer owned directly or indirectly by such person, and issue such order with respect thereto as may be appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this Chapter. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, for the purposes of this Chapter the sites of the ownership of the securities of domestic insurers shall be deemed to be in this State. Section 5010. Sanctions A. Any insurer failing, without just cause, to file any registration statement as required in this Article shall be required, after notice and hearing, to pay a penalty of $500.00 for each day's delay, to be recovered by the Commissioner of Insurance and the penalty so recovered shall be paid into the General Revenue Fund of this State. The maximum penalty under this section Is $25,000.00. The Commissioner may reduce the penalty if the 1140 Chapter 325 insurer demonstrates to the Commissioner that the imposition of the penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer. Every director or officer of an insurance holding company system who knowingly violates, participates in, or assents to, or who knowingly shall permit any of the officers or agents of the insurer to engage in transactions or make investments which have not been properly reported or submitted pursuant to Section 5004(A), 5005(A)(2), or (B), or which violate this Chapter, shall pay, in their individual capacity, a civil forfeiture of not more than $2,000.00 per violation, after notice and hearing before the Commissioner. In determining the amount of the civil forfeiture, the Commissioner shall take into account the appropriateness of the forfeiture with respect to the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, and such other matters as justice may require. Whenever it appears to the Commissioner that any insurer subject to this Act or any director, officer, employee or agent thereof has engaged in any transaction or entered into a contract which is subject to Section 5005 of this Chapter and which would not have been approved had such approval been requested, the Commissioner may order the insurer to cease and desist Immediately any further activity under that transaction or contract.

Any fines imposed shall be paid by the officer, director, or employee in his/her individual capacity. Section 5011. Receivership Whenever it appears to the Commissioner that any person has committed a violation of this Chapter which so impairs the financial condition of a domestic insurer as to threaten insolvency or make the further transaction of business by it hazardous to its policyholders, creditors, shareholders or the public, then the Commissioner may proceed as provided in Chapter 59 of this Title to take possessions of the property of such domestic insurer and to conduct the business thereof. Section 5012. Recovery If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a domestic insurer has been entered, the receiver appointed under such order shall have a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, (i) from any parent corporation or holding company or person or affiliate who otherwise controlled the insurer, the amount of distributions (other than distributions of shares of the same class of stock) paid by the insurer on its capital stock, or (ii) any payment in the form of a bonus, termination settlement or extraordinary lump sum salary adjustment made by the Insurer or its subsidiary(s) to a director, officer or employee, where the distribution or payment pursuant to (I) or (ii) is made at any time during the one year preceding the petition for liquidation, conservation or rehabilitation, as the case may be, subject to the limitations of Subsections (B), (C), and (0) of this section. No such distribution shall be recoverable If the parent or affiliate shows that when paid such distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that such distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. Any person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate at the time such distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions or payments under (A) such person received. Any person who otherwise controlled the insurer at the time such distributions were declared shall be liable up to the amount of distributions he would have received if they had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severely liable. The maximum amount recoverable under this subsection shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer and to reimburse any guaranty funds. To the extent that any person liable under Subsection (C) of this section is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay claims due from it pursuant to such paragraph, its parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it at the time the distribution was paid, shall be jointly and severely liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from such parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it.

(2) A health benefit plan shall waive any time period applicable to a preexisting condition exclusion or limitation period with respect to particular services for the period of time an individual was previously covered by qualifying previous coverage that provided benefits with respect to such services, provided that the qualifying previous coverage was continuous to a date not more than sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of the new coverage, excluding any waiting period applicable to the new plan. This paragraph does not preclude application of any waiting period applicable to all new enrollees under the health benefit plan. (3) A health benefit plan may either exclude coverage for late enrollees for eighteen (18) months or contain an eighteen-month preexisting condition exclusion; provided that if both a period of exclusion from coverage and a preexisting condition exclusion are applicable to a late enrollee, the combined period shall not exceed eighteen (18) months from the date the individual became eligible to enroll for coverage under the health benefit plan, except as provided In subsection (c)(1) of this section. (4) a. Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, requirements used by a small employer carrier in determining whether to provide coverage to a small employer, including requirements for minimum participation of eligible employees shall be applied uniformly among all small employers with the same number of eligible employees applying for coverage or receiving coverage from the small employer carrier. A small employer carrier may vary the application of minimum participation requirements and minimum employer contribution requirements only by the size of the small employer group. An employee who does not participate in the health benefit plan and who presents satisfactory evidence that he or she has coverage through a spouse shall not be counted by a small employer carrier with respect to number or percent participation requirements. A small employer carrier shall not increase any requirement for minimum employee participation or any requirement for minimum employer Chapter 340 contribution applicable to a small employer at any time after the small employer has contracted for coverage. (5) a. If a small employer carrier offers coverage to a small employer, the small employer carrier shall offer coverage to all of the eligible employees of a small employer and their dependents. A small employer carrier shall not offer coverage to only certain individuals in a small employer group or to only part of the group, except in the case of late enrollees as provided in subsection (c)(3) of this section. b. A small employer carrier shall not modify a basic or standard health benefit plan with respect to a small employer or any eligible employee or dependent through riders, endorsements or otherwise, to restrict or exclude coverage for certain diseases or medical conditions otherwise covered by the health benefit plan. (d)(1) A small employer carrier shall not be required to offer coverage or accept applications pursuant to subsection (a) of this section in the case of the following: To a small employer, where the small employer is not physically located in the carrier's established geographic service area; To an employee, when the employee does not work or reside within the carrier's established geographic service area; or Within an area where the small employer carrier reasonably anticipates, and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner, that it will not have the capacity within its established geographic service area to deliver service adequately to the members of such groups because of its obligations to existing group policyholders and enrollees. (2) A small employer carrier that cannot offer coverage pursuant to subsection (1)c of this subsection may not offer coverage in the applicable area to new cases of employer groups with more than twenty-five (25) eligible employees or to any small employer groups until the later of 180 days following each such refusal or the date on which the carrier notifies the commissioner that it has regained capacity to deliver services to small employer groups. (e) A small employer carrier shall not be required to provide coverage to its employers pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for any period of time for which the commissioner determines that requiring the acceptance of small employers in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section would place the small employer carrier in a financially impaired condition. \u00a77208. Notice of intent to operate as a risk-assuming carrier. (a) (1) Each small employer carrier desiring to operate as a risk-assuming carrier shall make application to the commissioner within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this chapter to operate as a risk-assuming carrier, pursuant to \u00a77209 of this title. The commissioner may permit a carrier to modify its status at any time for good cause shown. The commissioner shall establish an application process for small employer carriers seeking to change their status under this subsection. (b) A reinsuring carrier that applies and is approved to operate as a risk-assuming carrier shall not be permitted to continue to reinsure any health benefit plan with the program. Such a carrier shall pay a prorated assessment based upon business issued as a reinsuring carrier for any portion of the year that the business was reinsured. \u00a77209. Application to become a risk-assuming carrier. 1171 1172 Chapter 340 (a) A small employer carrier may apply to become a risk-assuming carrier by filing an application wittr the commissioner in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. (b) The commissioner shall consider the following factors in evaluating an application filed under subsection (a): The carrier's financial condition; The carrier's history or rating and underwriting small employer groups; The carrier's commitment to market fairly to all small employers in the state or its established geographic service area, as applicable; and The carrier's experience with managing the risk of small employer groups. The effect of approval and disapproval on the small employer insurance market and the Small Employer Carrier Reinsurance Program pursuant to \u00a77210 of this title. (c) The commissioner shall provide public notice of an application by a small employer carrier to be a risk-assuming carrier and shall provide at least a sixty-day period for public comment prior to making a decision on the application. (d) The commissioner may rescind the approval granted to a risk-assuming carrier under this section if the commissioner finds that: The carrier's financial condition will no longer support the assumption of risk from issuing coverage to small employers in compliance with \u00a77207 without the protection afforded by the program; The carrier has failed to market fairly to all small employers in the state or its established geographic service area, as applicable; or The carrier has failed to provide coverage to eligible small employers as required in \u00a77207 of this title. (e) A small employer carrier electing to be a risk-assuming carrier shall not be subject to the provisions of \u00a77210 of this title. \u00a77210. Small employer carrier reinsurance program.

In the event that the program becomes eligible for additional financing pursuant to subsection (1)(3) of this section, the board Chapter 340 1173 shall be expanded to include two (2) additional members who shall be appointed by the Governor. In selecting the additional members of the board, the Governor shall choose individuals who represent carriers who are not small employer carriers. The expansion of the board under this subsection shall continue for the period that the program continues to be eligible for additional financing under subsection (1)(3) of this section. The initial board members shall be appointed as follows: two (2) of the members to serve a term of (1) year; three (3) of the members to serve a term of two (2) years; and three (3) of the members to serve a term of three (3) years.

(e) Within 180 days after the appointment of the initial board, the board shall submit to the commissioner a plan of operation and thereafter any amendments thereto necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable and equitable administration of the program. The commissioner may, after notice and hearing, approve the plan of operation if the commissioner determines it to be suitable to assure the fair, reasonable and equitable administration of the program, and to provide for the sharing of program gains or losses on an equitable and proportionate basis in accordance with the provisions of this section. The plan of operation shall become effective upon written approval by the commissioner. (f) If the board fails to submit a suitable plan of operation within 180 days after its appointment, the commissioner shall, after notice and hearing, adopt and promulgate a temporary plan of operation. The commissioner shall amend or rescind any plan adopted under this subsection at the time a plan of operation is submitted by the board and approved by the commissioner. (g) The plan of operation shall: Establish procedures for handling and accounting of program assets and monies and for an annual fiscal reporting to the commissioner; Establish procedures for selecting an administering contractor and setting forth the powers and duties of the administering contractor; Establish procedures for reinsuring risks in accordance with the provisions of this section; Establish procedures for collecting assessments from reinsuring carriers to fund claims and administrative expenses incurred or estimated to be incurred by the program; and Provide for any additional matters necessary for the implementation and administration of the program. (h) The program shall have the general powers and authority granted under the laws of this state to insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and health services corporations licensed to transact business, except the power to issue health benefit plans directly to either groups or individuals. In addition thereto, the program shall have the specific authority to: (1) Enter into contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this chapter, including the authority, with the approval of the commissioner, to enter into contracts with similar programs of other states for the joint performance of common functions 1179 Chapter 340 or with persons or other organizations for the performance of administrative functions; Sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper to recover any assessments and penalties for, on behalf of, or against the program or any reinsuring carriers; Take any legal action necessary to avoid the payment of improper claims against the program; Define the health benefit plans for which reinsurance will be provided, and to issue reinsurance policies, in accordance with the requirements of this chapter; Establish rules, conditions and procedures for reinsuring risks under the program; Establish actuarial functions as appropriate for the operation of the program; Assess reinsuring carriers in accordance with the provisions of subsection (I) of this section, and to make advance interim assessments as may be reasonable and necessary for organizational and interim operating expenses.

Any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the program not in default shall be legal investments for carriers and may be carried as admitted assets; (i) A reinsuring carrier may reinsure with the program as provided for in this subsection: With respect to a basic health benefit plan or a standard health benefit plan, the program shall reinsure the level of coverage provided and, with respect to other plans, the program shall reinsure up to the level of coverage provided in a basic or standard health benefit plan. A small employer carrier may reinsure an entire employer group within sixty (60) days of the commencement of the group's coverage under a health benefit plan. A reinsuring carrier may reinsure an eligible employee or dependent within a period of sixty (60) days following the commencement of or next renewal after enactment hereof of coverage with the small employer. A newly eligible employee or dependent of the reinsured small employer may be reinsured within sixty (60) days of the commencement of his or her coverage. a. The program shall not reimburse a reinsuring carrier with respect to the claims of a reinsured employee or dependent until the carrier has incurred an initial level of claims for such employee or dependent of $5,000 in a calendar year for benefits covered by the program. In addition, the reinsuring carrier shall be responsible for ten percent (10%) of the next $50,000 of benefit payments during a calendar year and the program shall reinsure the remainder. A reinsuring carriers' liability under this subparagraph shall not exceed a maximum limit of $10,000 in any one calendar year with respect to any reinsured individual. Provided, however that the Board may establish higher retention levels, percentages of responsibility, and maximum limits with respect to the claims of a reinsured employee or dependent who was covered by the subject carrier prior to the enactment hereof. Chapter 340 1175 b. The board annually shall adjust the initial level of claims and the maximum limit to be retained by the carrier to reflect increases in costs and utilization within the standard market for health benefit plans within the state. The adjustment shall not be less than the annual change in the medical component of the \"Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers\" of the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, unless the board proposes and the commissioner approves a lower adjustment factor. A small employer carrier may terminate reinsurance with the program for one or more of the reinsured employees or dependents of a small employer on any anniversary of the health benefit plan. Premium rates charged for reinsurance by the program to a health maintenance organization that is federally qualified under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300c(c)(2)(A), and as such is subject to requirements that limit the amount of risk that may be ceded to the program that is more restrictive than those specified in paragraph (4) of this subsection, shall be reduced to reflect that portion of the risk above the amount set forth in paragraph (4) of this subsection, that may not be ceded to the program, if any. A reinsuring carrier shall apply all managed care and claims handling techniques, including utilization review, individual case management, preferred provider provisions, and other managed care provisions or methods of operation consistently with respect to reinsured and nonreinsured business. (j) (1) The board, as part of the plan of operation, shall establish a methodology for determining premium rates to be charged by the program for reinsuring small employers and individuals pursuant to this section. The methodology shall include a system for classification of small employers that reflects the types of case characteristics commonly used by small employer carriers in the state. The methodology shall provide for the development of base reinsurance premium rates which shall be multiplied by the factors set forth in paragraph (2) herein to determine the premium rates for the program. The base reinsurance premium rates shall be established by the board, subject to the approval of the commissioner, and shall be set at levels which reasonably approximate gross premiums charged to small employers by small employer carriers for health benefit plans with benefits similar to the standard health benefit plan (adjusted to reflect retention levels required under this chapter). (2) Premiums for the program shall be as follows: An entire small employer group may be reinsured for a rate that is one and onehalf (1.5) times the base reinsurance premium rate for the group established pursuant to this paragraph, or such rate with respect to groups covered by the subject carrier prior to the enactment hereof as the Board shall determine, but In no event less than the rate set forth above. An eligible employee or dependent may be reinsured for a rate that is five (5) times the base reinsurance premium rate for the individual established pursuant to this paragraph, or such rate with respect to employees or dependents covered by the subject carrier prior to the enactment herein as the board shall determine, but in no event less than the rate set forth above. (3) The board periodically shall review the methodology established under paragraph (1) of this subsection, including the system of classification and any rating factors, to assure that it reasonably reflects the claims experience of the program. The board may propose changes to the methodology which shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner. (4) The board may consider adjustments to the premium rates charged by the program to reflect the use of effective cost containment and managed care arrangements. (5) Within twentyfour (24) months following enactment of this chapter, the board shall report to the Delaware Health Care Commission concerning the effects of any variation of reinsurance premium rates, retention levels, percentages of responsibility or maximum limits with respect to claims of a reinsured employee, dependent or group who was covered by the subject carrier prior to the enactment hereof. The commission shall report to the General Assembly within 60 days of receipt of such report with its conclusions from such report and recommended changes, if any, to the statutory mechanism provided hereunder. (k) If a health benefit plan for a small employer is entirely or partially reinsured with the program, the premium charged to the small employer for any rating period for the coverage issued shall meet the requirements relating to premium rates set forth in \u00a77205 of this title. (1) (1) Prior to March 1 of each year, the board shall determine and report to the commissioner the program net loss for the previous calendar year, taking into account investment income and other appropriate gains and losses. (2) Any net loss for the year shall be recouped by assessments of reinsuring carriers. a. The board shall establish, as part of the plan of operation, a formula by which to make assessments against reinsuring carriers. The assessment formula shall be based on: (1) Each reinsuring carrier's share of the total premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from health benefit plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this state by reinsuring carriers; and (ii) Each reinsuring carrier's share of the premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from newly issued health benefit plans delivered or issued for delivery during the calendar year to small employers in this state by reinsuring carriers. b. The formula established pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this subsection shall not result in any reinsuring carrier having an assessment share that is less than fifty percent (50%) nor more than 150 percent of an amount which is based on the proportion of the reinsuring carrier's total premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from health benefit plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this state by reinsuring carriers to the total premiums earned in the preceding calendar year from health benefit plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this state by all reinsuring carriers. c. The board may, with approval of the commissioner, change the assessment formula established pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this subsection from time to time as appropriate. The board may provide for the shares of the assessment base attributable to total premium and to the previous year's premium to vary during a transition period. d. Subject to the approval of the commissioner, the board shall make an adjustment to the assessment formula for reinsuring carriers that are approved health maintenance organizations which are federally qualified under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300, et seq., to the extent, if any, that restrictions are placed on them that are not imposed on other small employer carriers. e. Premiums earned by a reinsuring carrier that are less than an amount determined by the board to justify the cost of assessment collection shall not be considered for purposes of determining assessments. (3) a. Prior to March 1 of each year, the board shall determine and file with the commissioner an estimate of the assessments 1176 Chapter 340 needed to fund the losses incurred by the program in the previous calendar year. If the board determines that the assessments needed to fund the losses incurred by the program in the previous calendar year will exceed the amount specified in subparagraph c of this subsection, the board shall evaluate the operation of the program and report its findings, including any recommendations for changes to the plan of operation, to the commissioner within ninety (90) days following the end of the calendar year in which the losses were incurred. The evaluation shall include an estimate of future assessments and consideration ofthe administrative costs of the program, the appropriateness of the premiums charged, the level of insurer retention under the program and costs of coverage for small employers. If the board fails to file a report with the commissioner within ninety (90) days following the end of the applicable calendar year, the commissioner may evaluate the operations of the program and implement such amendments to the plan of operation the commissioner deems necessary to reduce future losses and assessments. for any calendar year, the maximum assessment amount under this subparagraph is five percent (5%) of total premiums earned in the previous calendar year from health benefit plans delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this state by reinsuring carriers. (i) If assessments in each of two (2) consecutive calendar years exceed the amount specified in subparagraph c of this subsection, the program shall be eligible to receive additional financing as provided in item (ii) of this subparagraph. The additional funding provided for in item (I) of this subparagraph shall be obtained from assessments of health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and health service corporations as provided for in \u00a7707(a) of this title. The amount of additional financing to be provided to the program shall be equal to the amount by which total assessments in the preceding two (2) calendar years exceed five percent (5%) of total premiums earned during that period from small employers from health benefit plans delivered or issued for delivery in this state by reinsuring carriers. If the program has received additional financing in either of the two (2) previous calendar years pursuant to this provision, the amount of additional financing shall be subtracted from the amount of total assessments for the purpose of the calculation in the previous sentence. Additional financing received by the program pursuant to this subparagraph shall be distributed to reinsuring carriers in proportion to the assessments paid by such carriers over the previous two (2) calendar years. If assessments exceed net losses of the program, the excess may be held at interest and used by the board to offset future losses or to reduce program premiums. As used in this paragraph, 'future losses' includes reserves for incurred but not reported claims. Each reinsuring carrier's proportion of the assessment shall be determined annually by the board based on annual statements and other reports deemed necessary by the board and filed by the reinsuring carriers with the board. The plan of operation shall provide for the imposition of an interest penalty for late payment of assessments. A reinsuring carrier may seek from the commissioner a deferment from all or part of an assessment imposed by the board. The commissioner may defer all or part of the assessment of a reinsuring carrier if the commissioner determines that the payment of the assessment would place the reinsuring carrier in a 777.1. Chapter 340 1177 1178 Chapter 340 financially impaired condition. If all or part of an assessment against a reinsuring carrier is deferred the amount deferred shall be assessed against the other participating carriers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessment set forth in this subsection. The reinsuring carrier receiving the deferment shall remain liable to the program for the amount deferred and may be prohibited by the commissioner from reinsuring any individuals or groups with the program until such time as it pays the assessments, and may be relieved by the commissioner of the requirements of \u00a77205 of this title. Neither the participation in the program as reinsuring carriers, the establishment of rates, forms or procedures, nor any other joint or collective action required by this chapter shall be the basis of any legal action, criminal or civil liability, or penalty against the program or any of its reinsuring carriers either jointly or separately. The board, as part of the plan of operation, shall develop standards setting forth the manner and levels of compensation to be paid to producers for the sale of basic and standard health benefit plans. In establishing such standards, the board shall take into the consideration the need to assure the broad availability of coverages, the objectives of the program, the time and effort expended in placing the coverage, the need to provide on-going service to the small employer, the levels of compensation currently used in the industry and the overall costs of coverage to small employers selecting these plans. (0) The program shall be exempt from any and all state and local taxes. \u00a77211. Health benefit plan committee. The commissioner shall appoint a Health Benefit Plan Committee. The committee shall be composed of representatives of carriers, small employers and employees, health care providers and producers. The committee shall recommend the form and level of coverages to be made available by small employer carriers pursuant to \u00a77207 of this title. The committee shall recommend benefit levels, cost sharing levels, exclusions and limitations for the basic health benefit plan and the standard health benefit plan. The committee shall also design a basic health benefit plan and a standard health benefit plan which contain benefit and cost sharing levels that are consistent with the basic method of operation and the benefit plans of health maintenance organizations, including any restrictions imposed by federal law. (1) The plans recommended by the committee may include cost containment features such as: Utilization review of health care services, including review of medical necessity of hospital and physician services; Case management; Selective contracting with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers; Reasonable benefit differentials applicable to providers that participate or do not participate in arrangements using restricted network provisions; and Other managed care provisions. (2) The committee shall submit the health benefit plans described in subparagraph (1) of this subsection to the commissioner and the Delaware Health Care Commission for approval within 180 days after the appointment of the committee. \u00a77212. Periodic market evaluation. Chapter 340 1179 The board, in consultation with the committee, shall study and report at least every three (3) years to the commissioner on the effectiveness of this chapter. The report shall analyze the effectiveness of the chapter in promoting rate stability, product availability, and coverage affordability. The report may contain recommendations for actions to improve the overall effectiveness, efficiency and fairness of the small employer group health insurance marketplace. The report shall address whether carriers and producers are fairly and actively marketing or issuing health benefit plans to small employers in fulfillment of the purposes of the chapter. The report may contain recommendations for market conduct or other regulatory standards or action. \u00a77213. Waiver of certain state laws. No law requiring the coverage of a health care service or benefit, or requiring the reimbursement, utilization or inclusion of a specific category of licensed health care practitioner, shall apply to a basic health benefit plan delivered or issued for delivery to small employers in this state pursuant to this chapter. \u00a77214. Administrative procedures. The commissioner shall issue regulations in accordance with \u00a7314 of this title and 29 Del. C. Ch. 101, for the implementation and administration of this chapter. \u00a77215. Standards to assure fair marketing. (a) Each small employer carrier shall actively market health benefit plan coverage, including the basic and standard health benefit plans, to eligible small employers in the state. If a small employer carrier denies coverage to a small employer on the basis of the health status or claims experience of the small employer or its employees or dependents, the small employer carrier shall offer the small employer the opportunity to purchase a basic health benefit plan and a standard health benefit plan. (b) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, no small employer carrier or producer shall, directly or indirectly, engage In the following activities: Encouraging or directing small employers to refrain from filing an application for coverage with the small employer carrier because of the health status, claims experience, industry, occupation or geographic location of the small employer. Encouraging or directing small employers to seek coverage from another carrier because of the health status, claims experience, industry, occupation or geographic location of the small employer. (2) The provision of paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not apply with respect to information provided by a small employer carrier or producer to a small employer regarding the established geographic service area or a restricted network provision of a small employer carrier. (c) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, no small employer carrier shall, directly or indirectly, enter into any contract, agreement or arrangement with a producer that provides for or results in the compensation paid to a producer for the sale of a health benefit plan to be varied because of the health status, claims experience, industry, occupation or geographic area of the small employer. (d) A small employer carrier shall provide reasonable compensation, as provided under the plan of operation of the program, to a producer, if any, for the sale of a basic or standard health benefit plan. (e) No small employer carrier may terminate, fail to renew or limit its contract or agreement of representation with a producer for any reason related to the health status, claims experience, occupation or 1180 Chapter 340 geographic location of the small employers placed by the producer with the small employer carrier. No small employer carrier or producer may induce or otherwise encourage a small employer to separate or otherwise exclude an employee from health coverage or benefits provided in connection with the employee's employment. Denial by a small employer carrier of an application for coverage from a small employer shall be in writing and shall state the reason or reasons for the denial. The commissioner may establish regulations setting forth additional standards to provide for the fair marketing and board availability of health benefit plans to small employers in this state. (1) A violation of this section by a small employer carrier or a producer shall be an unfair trade practice under \u00a72303 and \u00a72304 of this title. (2) If a small employer carrier enters into a contract, agreement or other arrangement with a third-party administrator to provide administrative, marketing or other services related to the offering of health benefit plans to small employers in this state, the third-party administrator shall be subject to this section as if it were a small employer carrier. \u00a77216. Regulations; exceptions. (a) The commissioner may establish regulations to implement the provisions of this section and to assure that rating practices used by small employer carriers are consistent with the purposes of this chapter, including regulations that: Assure that differences in rates charged for health benefit plans by small employer carriers are reasonable and reflect objective differences in plan design (not including differences due to the nature of the groups assumed to select particular health benefit plans); and Prescribe the manner in which case characteristics may be used by small employer carriers. (b) The commissioner may suspend for a specified period the application of subsection (a)(1) of this section as to the premium rates applicable to one or more small employers included within a class of business of a small employer carrier for one or more rating periods upon a filing by the small employer carrier and a finding by the commissioner either that the suspension is reasonable in light of the financial condition of the small employer carrier or that the suspension would enhance the efficiency and fairness of the marketplace for small employer health insurance. \u00a77217. Disclosure of rating practices; certification of compliance. (a) In connection with the offering for sale of any health benefit plan to a small employer, a small employer carrier shall make a reasonable disclosure, as part of its solicitation and sales materials, of all of the following: The extent to which premium rates for a specified small employer are established or adjusted based upon the actual or expected variation in claims costs or actual or expected variation in health status of the employees of the small employer and their dependents; The provisions of the health benefit plan concerning the small employer carrier's right to change premium rates and the factors, other than claim experience that affect changes in premium rates; The provisions relating to renewability of policies and contract; and The provisions relating to any preexisting condition provision. Chapter 340 1181 Each small employer carrier shall maintain at its principal place of business a complete and detailed description of its rating practices and renewal underwriting practices, including information and documentation that demonstrate that its rating methods and practices are based upon commonly accepted actuarial assumptions and are in accordance with sound actuarial principles. Each small employer carrier shall file with the commissioner annually on or before March 15, an actuarial certification certifying that the carrier is in compliance with this chapter and that the rating methods of the small employer carrier are actuarially sound. Such certification shall be in a form and manner, and shall contain such information, as specified by the commissioner. A copy of the certification shall be retained by the small employer carrier at its principal place of business. A small employer carrier shall make information and documentation described in subsection b of this section available to the commissioner upon request. Except in cases of violations of this chapter, the Information shall be considered proprietary and trade secret Information and shall not be subject to disclosure by the commissioner to persons outside of the Department except as agreed to by the small employer carrier or as ordered by a court of competent jurisidiction.\" Section 2.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE: Section 1. Amend \u00a79901, Title 16 of the Delaware Code by adding thereto new subsections to read as follows: \"(e) The General Assembly further finds and declares that rational cost containment of health care costs is in the interests of all Delaware citizens. The General Assembly further finds and declares that since Delaware hospitals provide care to all citizens, regardless of their ability to pay, the costs of providing care to the uninsured and indigent are shifted to those who do pay. The General Assembly further finds and declares that the majority of Delawareans pay for these shifted costs, primarily through inflated insurance premiums. The General Assembly further finds and declares that in order for the Delaware Health Care Commission to carry out its duties in compliance with these findings a means of containing health care costs must be developed and implemented.\" Section 2.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE: Section 1. Amend Subchapter III, Chapter 5, Title 4 of the Delaware Code by adding a new section designated as \u00a7546 which shall read as follows: \"\u00a7546. Limit on Number of Retail Licenses. (a) The General Assembly finds that, in order for the Delaware Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission to maintain effective control of the importation, distribution, and sale of alcoholic liquor into and within this State, and in order to prevent geographical price fixing of alcoholic liquor at the retail level, there shall be a limitation placed on the number of retail licenses issued, held, controlled, or acquired directly or indirectly by one person. The General Assembly further finds that a limitation on the number of retail licenses held by one person is necessary to ensure a stable system for the lawful distribution of alcoholic liquor, serve the public need and convenience, and prevent the public harm associated with a monopoly of the retail alcoholic liquor trade by any person or group of persons, whether such licenses are held by a corporation, partnership, association, proprietorship, individual, or other entity. The General Assembly further finds that a reasonable restriction on the number of retail licenses held by one person will further the State's interest in maintaining a threetier system for the importation, distribution, and sale of alcoholic liquor by minimizing or limiting absentee ownership and the domination of retail establishments by suppliers, manufacturers, importers, or other economically powerful interests. Therefore, it is declared to be the public policy of this State that limitations, as hereinafter specified, be placed on the number of retail licenses that any person may at one time hold, directly or indirectly, and that the Commission shall actively supervise and enforce these limitations. The Commission shall refuse to grant a license for the sale of alcoholic liquor by any restaurant, taproom, hotel, store, or other establishment for consumption off the premises where sold if the Commission has substantial evidence that would reasonably support a belief that the applicant, or any of the applicant's directors, officers, or shareholders, or any of the applicant's partners, corporations, proprietorships, or other legal entities engaged in any undertaking, industry, or business is singularly, or in combination with the applicant, the holder of two (2) or more retail licenses, or has any financial, pecuniary, beneficial, management, supervisory, or other interest whatsoever, direct or indirect, and however small, in two (2) or more retail licenses; provided, however, that nothing herein shall require any person who, prior to April 1, 1992, acquired an interest in more than two (2) retail licenses to surrender, dispose of, or release their interest in any such license; nor shall anything herein affect such person's right to continue to hold, use, and renew any such license. For the purposes of this section, a person shall be deemed to acquire a financial, pecuniary, beneficial, management, supervisory, or other interest in a retail license to purchase and resell or dispense alcoholic liquor if such person or person's spouse or child under 21 years of age has either (i) any interest whatsoever, direct or indirect, and however small, as a director, officer, shareholder, partner, associate, employee, or member in any corporation, partnership, association, proprietorship, or other entity engaged in any undertaking, industry, or business which holds a retail license pursuant to this chapter, or (11) any authority whatsoever to supervise, manage, control, or direct the operation of the licensee's business, or to hire, terminate, or discipline its employees, or to issue any orders, policies, or directives concerning its Chapter 376 1217 business; provided, however, that any person whose relationship with the licensee is, as determined by the Commission, merely that of a bona fide lender, lending institution, secured party, or lienholder, or merely that of a bona fide landlord or lessor of real or personal property, shall not, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to acquire a financial, pecuniary, beneficial, management, supervisory, or other interest in such license. (d) The Commission may promulgate such rules and regulations with respect to the enforcement and furtherance of the objectives and provisions of this section as it may deem necessary, and all such rules and regulations that are not inconsistent with provisions of this Title and the Delaware Code shall have the force and effect of law.\" Section 2. Amend \u00a7561, Subchapter V. Chapter 5, Title 4 of the Delaware Code by adding a new subsection (e) which shall read as follows: \"(e) The Commission may cancel any retail license if it has reasonable grounds to believe that the license was granted in violation of \u00a7546(b) of this Title, or any rule enacted pursuant to \u00a7546(d) of this Title.\" Section 3. If any section, subsection, paragraph, or provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall- not affect other sections, subsections, paragraphs, provisions, or applications of this Act which can be given effect without the invalid section, subsection, paragraph, provision, or application, and to that end the provisions of this Act are declared to be severable.

Contributions iv beneficial owners. A contribution of a beneficial owner to the business trust may be in cash, property or services rendered, or a promissory note or other obligation to contribute cash or property or to perform services; provided, however, that a person may become a beneficial owner of a business trust and may receive a beneficial interest in a business trust without making a contribution or being obligated to make a contribution to the business trust. Except as provided in the governing instrument, a beneficial owner is obligated to the business trust to perform any promise to contribute cash, property or to perform services, even if the beneficial owner is unable to perform because of death, disability or any other reason. If a beneficial owner does not make the required contribution of property or services the beneficial owner is obligated at the option of the business trust to contribute cash equal to that portion of the agreed value (as stated in the records of the business trust) of the contribution that has not been made. The foregoing option shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights, including the right to specific performance, that the business trust may have against such beneficial owner under the governing instrument of applicable law. A governing instrument may provide that the interest of any beneficial owner who fails to make any contribution that he is obligated to make shall be subject to specific penalties for, or specified consequences of, such failure. Such penalty or consequence may take the form of reducing or eliminating the defaulting beneficial owner's proportionate interest in the business trust, subordinating his beneficial interest to that of nondefaulting beneficial owners, a forced sale of his beneficial interest, forfeiture of his beneficial interest, the lending by other beneficial owners of the amount necessary to meet his commitment, a fixing of the value of his beneficial interest by appraisal or by formula and redemption or sale of his beneficial interest at such value, or any other penalty or consequence.\" 1248 Chapter 404 Section 5.

Amend \u00a73804, Chapter 38, Title 12 of the Delaware Code by designating the current language in said section as subsection (a) and by adding new subsections (b) through (h) to read as follows: \"(b) A trustee of a business trust may be served with process in the manner prescribed in subsection (c) of this section in all civil actions or proceedings brought in the State of Delaware involving or relating to the activities of the business trust or a violation by a trustee of a duty to the business trust, or any beneficial owner, whether or not the trustee is a trustee at the time suit is commenced. Every resident or nonresident of the State of Delaware who accepts election or appointment or serves as a trustee of a business trust shall, by such acceptance or service, be deemed thereby to have consented to the appointment of the Delaware trustee or registered agent of such business trust required by \u00a73807 of this title (or, if there is none, the Secretary of State) as such person's agent upon whom service of process may be made as provided In this section. Such acceptance or service shall signify the consent of such trustee that any process when so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served upon such trustee within the State of Delaware and such appointment of such Delaware trustee or registered agent (or, if there is none, the Secretary of State) shall be irrevocable. Service of process shall be effected by serving the Delaware trustee or registered agent of such business trust required by \u00a73807 of this title (or, if there is none, the Secretary of State) with 1 copy of such process in the manner provided by law for service of writs of summons. In the event service is made under this subsection upon the Secretary of State, the plaintiff shall pay to the Secretary of State the sum of $50 for the use of the State of Delaware, which sum shall be taxed as part of the costs of the proceeding if the plaintiff shall prevail therein. In addition, the Prothonotary or the Register in Chancery of the court in which the civil action or proceeding is pending shall, within 7 days of such service, deposit in the United States mails, by registered mail, postage prepaid, true and attested copies of the process, together with a statement that service is being made pursuant to this section, addressed to the defendant at his address last known to and furnished by the party desiring to make such service. In any action in which any such trustee has been served with process as hereinafter provided, the time in which a defendant shall be required to appear and file a responsive pleading shall be computed from the date of mailing by the Prothonotary or the Register in Chancery as provided in subsection (c) of this section; provided, however, the court in which such action has been commenced may order such continuance or continuances as may be necessary to afford such trustee reasonable opportunity to defend the action. In the governing instrument of the business trust or other writing, a trustee may consent to be subject to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or arbitration in, a specified jurisdiction, or the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or the exclusivity of arbitration in, the State of Delaware, and to be served with legal process in the manner prescribed in such governing instrument of the business trust or other writing. Nothing herein contained limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner now or hereafter provided by law. This section is an extension of and not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal process upon nonresidents. The Court of Chancery and the Superior Court may make all necessary rules respecting the form of process, the manner of issuance and return thereof and such other rules which may be necessary to implement this section and are not inconsistent with this section. A partnership (whether .general or limited), corporation or other non-natural person formed or organized under the laws of any foreign country or other foreign jurisdiction or the laws of any state other than Chapter 404 1249 the State of Delaware shall not be deemed to be doing business in the State of Delaware solely be reason of its being a trustee of a business trust.\" Section 7.

A governing instrument may provide for the establishment of record dates with respect to allocations and distributions by a business trust.\" Section 9. Amend \u00a73806, Chapter 38, Title 12 of the Delaware Code by adding a new subsection (c) to read as follows: \"(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, a trustee has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to a business trust or to a beneficial owner, (1) any such trustee acting under a governing instrument shall not be liable to the business trust or to any such beneficial owner for the trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of such governing instrument, and (2) the trustee's duties and liabilities may be expanded or restricted by provisions in a governing instrument.\" Section 10. Amend \u00a73807(b), Chapter 38, Title 12 of the Delaware Code by deleting the word \"the\" as it appears immediately preceding the words \"issuance of beneficial interests\" as currently appearing therein and inserting in lieu thereof the words \"or within 180 days following the first\".

(a) In this Article: (1) \"Payment order\" means an instruction of a sender to a receiving bank, transmitted orally, electronically, or in writing, to pay, or to cause another bank to pay, a fixed or determinable amount of money to a beneficiary if: the instruction does not state a condition to payment to the beneficiary other than time of payment, the receiving bank is to be reimbursed by debiting an account of, or otherwise receiving payment from, the sender, and -- the instruction is transmitted by the sender directly to the receiving bank or to an agent, funds-transfer system, or communication system for transmittal to the receiving bank. (2) \"Beneficiary\" means the person to be paid by the beneficiary's bank. (3) \"Beneficiary's bank\" means the bank identified in a payment order in which an account of the beneficiary is to be credited pursuant to the order or which otherwise is to make payment to the beneficiary if the order does not provide for payment to an account. (4) \"Receiving bank\" means the bank to which the sender's instruction is addressed. (5) \"Sender\" means the person giving the instruction to the receiving bank. If an instruction complying with subsection (a)(1) is to make more than one payment to a beneficiary, the instruction is a separate payment order with respect to each payment. A payment order is issued when it is sent to the receiving bank. \u00a74A-104. FUNDS TRANSFER - DEFINITIONS. 1309 In this Article: \"Funds transfer\" means the series of transactions, beginning with the originator's payment order, made for the purpose of making payment to the beneficiary of the order. The term includes any payment order issued by the originator's bank or an intermediary bank intended to carry out the originator's payment order. A funds transfer is completed by acceptance by the beneficiary's bank of a payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary of the originator's payment order. \"Intermediary bank\" means a receiving bank other than the originator's bank or the beneficiary's bank. \"Originator\" means the sender of the first payment order in a funds transfer. \"Originator's bank\" means (i) the receiving bank to which the payment order of the originator is issued if the originator is not a bank, or (ii) the originator if the originator is a bank. \u00a74A-105. OTHER DEFINITIONS.

If a customer does not so designate an account, any account of the customer is an authorized account if payment of a payment order from that account is not inconsistent with a restriction on the use of that account. \"Bank\" means a person engaged in the business of banking and includes a savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union, and trust company. A branch or separate office of a bank is a separate bank for purposes of this Article. \"Customer\" means a person, including a bank, having an account with a bank or from whom a bank has agreed to receive payment orders. \"Funds-transfer business day\" of a receiving bank means the part of a day during which the receiving bank is open for the receipt, processing, and transmittal of payment orders and cancellations and amendments of payment orders. \"Funds-transfer system\" means a wire transfer network, automated clearing house, or other communication system of a clearing house or other association of banks through which a payment order by a bank may be transmitted to the bank to which the order is addressed. \"Good faith\" means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. \"Prove\" with respect to a fact means to meet the burden of establishing the fact (Section 1-201(8)).

TIME PAYMENT ORDER IS RECEIVED. The time of receipt of a payment order or communication cancelling or amending a payment order is determined by the rules applicable to receipt of a notice stated in Section 1-201(27). A receiving bank may fix a cut-off time or times on a funds-transfer business day for the receipt and processing of payment orders and communications cancelling or amending payment orders. Different cut-off times may apply to payment orders, cancellations, or amendments, or to different categories of payment orders, cancellations, or amendments. A cut-off time may apply to senders generally or different cut-off times may apply to different senders or categories of payment orders. If a payment order or communication cancelling or amending a payment order is received after the close of a funds-transfer business day or after the appropriate cut-off time on a funds-transfer business day, the receiving bank may treat the payment order or communication as received at the opening of the next funds-transfer business day. If this Article refers to an execution date or payment date or states a day on which a receiving bank is required to take action, and the date or day does not fall on a funds-transfer business day, the next day that is a funds-transfer business day is treated as the date or day stated, unless the contrary is stated in this Article. 1311 1312 Chapter 430 This Article does not apply to a funds transfer any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 (Title XX, Public Law 95-630, 92 Stat. 3728, 15 U.S.C. 51693 et seq.) as amended from time to time. PART 2. ISSUE AND ACCEPTANCE OF PAYMENT ORDER \u00a74A-201. SECURITY PROCEDURE. \"Security procedure\" means a procedure established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure. 54A-202. AUTHORIZED AND VERIFIED PAYMENT ORDERS. A payment order received by the receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is otherwise bound by it under the law of agency. If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i) the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required to follow an instruction that violates a written agreement with the customer or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the payment order is accepted. Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the security procedure chosen by the customer. The term \"sender\" in this Article includes the customer in whose name a payment order is issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (a), or it is effective as the order of the customer under subsection (b). This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders. Except as provided in this section and in Section 4A-203(a)(1), rights and obligations arising under this section or Section 4A-203 may not be varied by agreement. \u00a74A-203. UNENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN VERIFIED PAYMENT ORDERS. (a) If an accepted payment order is not, under Section 4A-202(a), an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective as an order of the customer pursuant to Section 4A-202(b), the following rules apply: (1) By express written agreement, the receiving bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order. (2) The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person (1) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the security procedure, or (ii) who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault. Information includes any access device, computer software, or the like. (b) This section applies to amendments of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders. \u00a74A-204. REFUND OF PAYMENT AND DUTY OF CUSTOMER TO REPORT WITH RESPECT TO UNAUTHORIZED PAYMENT ORDER. If a receiving bank accepts a payment order issued in the name of its customer as sender which is (i) not authorized and not effective as the order of the customer under Section 4A-202, or (11) not enforceable, in whole or in part, against the customer under Section 4A-203, the bank shall refund any payment of the payment order received from the customer to the extent the bank is not entitled to enforce payment and shall pay interest on the refundable amount calculated from the date the bank received payment to the date of the refund. However, the customer is not entitled to interest from the bank on the amount to be refunded if the customer fails to exercise ordinary care to determine that the order was not authorized by the customer and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding 90 days after the date the customer received notification from the bank that the order was accepted or that the customer's account was debited with respect to the order. The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the customer on account of a failure by the customer to give notification as stated in this section. Reasonable time under subsection (a) may be fixed by agreement as stated in Section 1-204(1), but the obligation of a receiving bank to refund payment as stated in subsection (a) may not otherwise be varied by agreement. \u00a74A-205. ERRONEOUS PAYMENT ORDERS. (a) If an accepted payment order was transmitted pursuant to a security procedure for the detection of error and the payment order (I) erroneously instructed payment to a beneficiary not intended by the sender, (11) erroneously instructed payment in an amount greater than the amount intended by the sender, or (111) was an erroneously transmitted duplicate of a payment order previously sent by the sender, the following rules apply: (I) If the sender proves that the sender or a person acting on behalf of the sender pursuant to Section 4A-206 complied with the security procedure and that the error would have been detected if the receiving bank had also complied, the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent stated in paragraphs (2) and (3). (2) If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of an erroneous payment order described in clause (I) or (111) of subsection (a), the sender is not obliged to pay the order and the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. (3) If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of a payment order described in clause (ii) of subsection (a), the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent the amount received by the beneficiary is greater than the amount intended by the sender. In that case, the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary the excess amount received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. Chapter 430 1313 1314 Chapter 430 If (i) the sender of an erroneous payment order described in subsection (a) is not obliged to pay all or part of the order, and (ii) the sender receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was accepted by the bank or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care, on the basis of information available to the sender, to discover the error with respect to the order and to advise the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time, not exceeding 90 days, after the bank's notification was received by the sender. If the bank proves that the sender failed to perform that duty, the sender is liable to the bank for the loss the bank proves it incurred as a result of the failure, but the liability of the sender may not exceed the amount of the sender's order. This section applies to amendments to payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders. \u00a74A-206. TRANSMISSION OF PAYMENT ORDER THROUGH FUNDS-TRANSFER OR OTHER COMMUNICATION SYSTEM. If a payment order addressed to a receiving bank is transmitted to a funds-transfer system or other third-party communication system for transmittal to the bank, the system is deemed to be an agent of the sender for the purpose of transmitting the payment order to the bank. If there is a discrepancy between the terms of the payment order transmitted to the system and the terms of the payment order transmitted by the system to the bank, the terms of the payment order of the sender are those transmitted by the system. This section does not apply to a funds-transfer system of the Federal Reserve Banks. This section applies to cancellations and amendments of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders. \u00a74A-207. MISDESCRIPTION OF BENEFICIARY. (a) Subject to subsection (b), if, in a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order and acceptance of the order cannot occur. (b) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the following rules apply: Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person. If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur. (c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) is accepted, (ii) the originator's payment order described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by number as permitted by subsection (b)(1), the following rules apply: If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order. If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank 15roves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates. (d) In a case governed by subsection (b)(1), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the amount paid may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as follows: (I) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (c), the originator has the right to recover. (2) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the originator's bank has the right to recover. \u00a74A-208. MISDESCRIPTION OF INTERMEDIARY BANK OR BENEFICIARY'S BANK. (a) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying number. The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order. (b) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank both by name and an identifying number if the name and number identify different persons. If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order. If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (b)(1), as though the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates. Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person. If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons, reliance on either the name or the number in Chapter 430 1315 executing the sender's payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in Section 4A-302(a)(1). \u00a7AA-209. ACCEPTANCE OF PAYMENT ORDER. (a) Subject to subsection (d), a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order when it executes the order, :b) Subject to subsections (c) and (d), a beneficiary's bank accepts a zaynen: otter at the earliest of the following times: il) when the bank (i) pays the beneficiary as stated in Section 4A-405(a) or 4A-405(b), or (ii) notifies the beneficiary of teceiot of the order or that the account of the beneficiary has cleen credited with respect to the order unless the notice indicates that the bank is rejecting the order or that funds with -aspect to the order may not be withdrawn or used until receipt of oarent from the sender of the order; :2) when the bank receives payment of the entire amount of the sencler's order pursuant to Section 4A-403(a)(1) or 4A-403(a)(2); or .2) the opening of the next funds-transfer business day of the tank following the payment date of the order if, at that time, the amount of the sender's order is fully covered by a withdrawable otedit balance in an authorized account of the sender or the bank has otherwise received full payment frog the sender, unless the orper was rejected before that time or is rejected within (i) one tour after that tine, or (ii) one hour after the opening of the net business day of the sender following the payment date if that tine is later.

If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is reduced accordingly. If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it are deemed rejected at the time the bank suspends payments. Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment order precludes a later acceptance of the order. \u00a74A-211. CANCELLATION AND AMENDMENT OF PAYMENT ORDER. (a) A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally, electronically, or in writing. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment. (b) Subject to subsection (a), a communication by the sender cancelling or amending a payment order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank accepts the payment order. (c) After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank. With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made. With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order, or because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer which resulted in the issuance of a payment order (i) that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender, (ii) that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator, or (iii) that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to receive from the originator.

(e) A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is canceled, the acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance. Amendment of a payment order is deemed to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and Issue of a new payment order in the amended form at the same time. (f) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or 1317 1316 Chapter 430 executing the sender's payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in Section 4A-302(a)(1). \u00a74A-209. ACCEPTANCE OF PAYMENT ORDER. (a) Subject to subsection (d), a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order when it executes the order, (b) Subject to subsections (c) and (d), a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order at the earliest of the following times: when the bank (i) pays the beneficiary as stated in Section 4A-405(a) or 4A-405(b), or (ii) notifies the beneficiary of receipt of the order or that the account of the beneficiary has been credited with respect to the order unless the notice indicates that the bank is rejecting the order or that funds with respect to the order may not be withdrawn or used until receipt of payment from the sender of the order; when the bank receives payment of the entire amount of the sender's order pursuant to Section 4A-403(a)(1) or 4A-403(a)(2); or the opening of the next funds-transfer business day of the bank following the payment date of the order if, at that time, the amount of the sender's order is fully covered by a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender or the bank has otherwise received full payment from the sender, unless the order was rejected before that time or is rejected within (i) one hour after that time, or (ii) one hour after the opening of the next business day of the sender following the payment date if that time is later.

REJECTION OF PAYMENT ORDER. A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing. A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it Indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order, (1) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable and (ii) any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means. This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to Section 4A-211(d) or the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day.

CANCELLATION AND AMENDMENT OF PAYMENT ORDER. (a) A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally, electronically, or in writing. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment. (b) Subject to subsection (a), a communication by the sender cancelling or amending a payment order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank accepts the payment order. (c) After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank. With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made. With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order, or because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer which resulted in the issuance of a payment order (i) that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender, (if) that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator, or (iii) that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to receive from the originator. If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. (d) An unaccepted payment order is canceled by operation of law at the close of the fifth funds-transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of the order. (e) A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is canceled, the acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance. Amendment of a payment order is deemed to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a new payment order in the amended form at the same time. (f) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or Chapter 430 1317 1318 Chapter 430 amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss and expenses, including reasonable attorney's feel, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment. A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order. A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with subsection (c)(2). \u00a74A-212. LIABILITY AND DUTY OF RECEIVING BANK REGARDING UNACCEPTED PAYMENT ORDER. If a receiving bank falls to accept a payment order that it is obliged by express agreement to accept, the bank is liable for breach of the agreement to the extent provided in the agreement or in this Article, but does not otherwise have any duty to accept a payment order or, before acceptance, to take any action, or refrain from taking action, with respect to the order except as provided in this Article or by express agreement. Liability based on acceptance arises only when acceptance occurs as stated in Section 4A-209, and liability is limited to that provided in this Article. A receiving bank is not the agent of the sender or beneficiary of the payment order it accepts, or of any other party to the funds transfer, and the bank owes no duty to any party to the funds transfer except as provided in this Article or by express agreement. PART 3. EXECUTION OF SENDER'S PAYMENT ORDER BY RECEIVING BANK \u00a74A-301. EXECUTION AND EXECUTION DATE. (a) A payment order is \"executed\" by the receiving bank when it issues a payment order intended to carry out the payment order received by the bank. A payment order received by the beneficiary's bank can be accepted but cannot be executed. (b) \"Execution date\" of a payment order means the day on which the receiving bank may properly issue a payment order in execution of the sender's order. The execution date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received. If the sender's instruction states a payment date, the execution date is the payment date or an earlier date on which execution is reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date. \u00a74A-302. OBLIGATIONS OF RECEIVING BANK IN EXECUTION OF PAYMENT ORDER. (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) through (d), if the receiving bank accepts a payment order pursuant to Section 4A-209 (a), the bank has the following obligations in executing the order: The receiving bank is obliged to issue, on the execution date, a payment order complying with the sender's order and to follow the sender's instructions concerning (i) any intermediary bank or funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer, or (ii) the means by which payment orders are to be transmitted in the funds transfer. If the originator's bank Issues a payment order to an intermediary bank, the originator's bank is obliged to instruct the intermediary bank according to the instruction of the originator. An intermediary bank in the funds transfer is similarly bound by an instruction given to it by the sender of the payment order it accepts. If the sender's instruction states that the funds transfer is to be carried out telephonically or by wire transfer or otherwise Indicates that the funds transfer is to be carried out by the most expeditious means, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order by the most expeditious available means, and to instruct any intermediary bank accordingly. If a sender's instruction states a payment date, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order at a time and by means reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date or as soon thereafter as is feasible. Unless otherwise instructed, a receiving bank executing a payment order may (1) use any funds-transfer system if use of that system is reasonable in the circumstances, and (it) issue a payment order to the beneficiary's bank or to an intermediary bank through which a payment order conforming to the sender's order can expeditiously be issued to the beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank exercises ordinary care in the selection of the intermediary bank. A receiving bank is not required to follow an instruction of the sender designating a funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer if the receiving bank, in good faith, determines that it is not feasible to follow the instruction or that following the instruction would unduly delay completion of the funds transfer. Unless subsection (a)(2) applies or the receiving bank is otherwise Instructed, the bank may execute a payment order by transmitting its payment order by first class mail or by any means reasonable in the circumstances. If the receiving bank is instructed to execute the sender's order by transmitting its payment order by a particular means, the receiving bank may issue its payment order by the means stated or by any means as expeditious as the means stated. Unless instructed by the sender, (1) the receiving bank may not obtain payment of its charges for services and expenses in connection with the execution of the sender's order by issuing a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the sender's order less the amount of the charges, and (11) may not instruct a subsequent receiving bank to obtain payment of its charges in the same manner. 4A-303. ERRONEOUS EXECUTION OF PAYMENT ORDER. A receiving bank that (i) executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount greater than the amount of the sender's order, or (11) issues a payment order in execution of the sender's order and then issues a duplicate order, is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under Section 4A-402(c) if that subsection is otherwise satisfied. The bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the erroneous order the excess payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. A receiving bank that executes the payment order of the sender by Issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under Section 4A-402(c) if ti) that subsection is otherwise satisfied and (11) the bank corrects its mistake by issuing an additional payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary of the sender's order. If the error is not corrected, the issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the order it accepted only to the extent of the amount of the erroneous order. This subsection does not apply if the receiving bank executes the sender's payment order by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order for the purpose of obtaining payment of its charges for services and expenses pursuant to instruction of the sender. If a receiving bank executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order to a beneficiary different from the beneficiary of the sender's order and the funds transfer is completed on the basis of that error, the sender of the payment order that was erroneously executed and all previous senders in the funds transfer are not obliged to pay the payment orders they issued. The issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the order the payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. 4A-304. DUTY OF SENDER TO REPORT ERRONEOUSLY EXECUTED PAYMENT ORDER. If the sender of a payment order that is erroneously executed as stated in Section 4A-303 receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was executed or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care to determine, on the basis of information available to the sender, that the order was erroneously executed and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time Chapter 430 1319 1320 Chapter 430 not exceeding 90 days after the notification from the bank was received by the sender. If the sender fails to perform that duty, the bank is not obliged to pay interest on any amount refundable to the sender under Section 4A-402(d) for the period before the bank learns of the execution error. The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the sender on account of a failure by the sender to perform the duty stated in this section. \u00a74A-305. LIABILITY FOR LATE OR IMPROPER EXECUTION OR FAILURE TO EXECUTE PAYMENT ORDER. (a) If a funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach of Section 4A-302 results in delay in payment to the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay Interest to either the originator or the beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (c), additional damages are not recoverable. (b) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of Section 4A-302 results in (i) noncompietion of the funds transfer, (ii) failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or (iii) issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the payment order of the originator, the bank is liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for incidental expenses and interest losses, to the extent not covered by subsection (a), resulting from the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection (c), additional damages are not recoverable. (c) In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (a) and (b), damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank. (d) If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order it was obliged by express agreement to execute, the receiving bank is liable to the sender for its expenses in the transaction and for incidental expenses and interest losses resulting from the failure to execute. Additional damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank, but are not otherwise recoverable. (e) Reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (a) or (b) is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim. If a claim is made for breach of an agreement under subsection (d) and the agreement does not provide for damages, reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim. (f) Except as stated in this section, the liability of a receiving bank under subsections (a) and (b) may not be varied by agreement. PART 4. PAYMENT \u00a74A-40l. PAYMENT DATE. \"Payment date\" of a payment order means the day on which the amount of the order is payable to the beneficiary by the beneficiary's bank. The payment date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received by the beneficiary's bank and, unless otherwise determined, is the. day the order is received by the beneficiary's bank. \u00a74A-402. OBLIGATION OF SENDER TO PAY RECEIVING BANK. This section is subject to Sections 4A-205 and 4A-207. With respect to a payment order issued to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the order, but payment is not due until the payment date of the order. This subsection is subject to subsection (e) and to Section 4A-303. With respect to a payment order issued to a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the receiving bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the sender's order. Payment by the sender is not due until the execution date of the sender's order. The obligation of that sender to pay its payment order is excused if the funds transfer is not completed by acceptance by the beneficiary's bank of a payment order instructing payment to the beneficiary of that sender's payment order. (d) If the sender of a payment order pays the order and was not obliged to pay all or part of the amount paid, the bank receiving payment is obliged to refund payment to the extent the sender was not obliged to pay. Except as provided in Sections 4A-204 and 4A-304, interest is payable on the refundable amount from the date of payment. (e) If a funds transfer is not completed as stated in subsection (c) and an intermediary bank is obliged to refund payment as stated in subsection (d) but is unable to do so because not permitted by applicable law or because the bank suspends payments, a sender in the funds transfer that executed a payment order in compliance with an instruction, as stated in Section 4A-302(a)(1), to route the funds transfer through that intermediary bank is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the payment order that it accepted. The first sender in the funds transfer that issued an Instruction requiring routing through that intermediary bank is subrogated to the right of the bank that paid the intermediary bank to refund as stated in subsection (d). (f) The right of the sender of a payment order to be excused from the obligation to pay the order as stated in subsection (c) or to receive refund under subsection (d) may not be varied by agreement. \u00a74A-403. PAYMENT BY SENDER TO RECEIVING BANK. (a) Payment of the sender's obligation under Section 4A-402 to pay the receiving bank occurs as follows: If the sender is a bank, payment occurs when the receiving bank receives final settlement of the obligation through a federal Reserve Bank or through a funds-transfer system. If the sender is a bank and the sender (i) credited an account of the receiving bank with the sender, or (ii) caused an account of the receiving bank in another bank to be credited, payment occurs when the credit is withdrawn or, if not withdrawn, at midnight of the day on which the credit is withdrawable and the receiving bank learns of that fact. If the receiving bank debits an account of the sender with the receiving bank, payment occurs when the debit is made to the extent the debit is covered by a withdrawable credit balance in the account. (b) If the sender and receiving bank are members of a funds-transfer system that nets obligations multilaterally among participants, the receiving bank receives final settlement when settlement is complete in accordance with the rules of the system. The obligation of the sender to pay the amount of a payment order transmitted through the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against the sender's obligation the right of the sender to receive payment from the receiving bank of the amount of any other payment order transmitted to the sender by the receiving bank through the funds-transfer system. The aggregate balance of obligations owed by each sender to each receiving bank in the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against that balance the aggregate balance of obligations owed to the sender by other members of the system. The aggregate balance is determined after the right of setoff stated in the second sentence of this subsection has been exercised. (c) If two banks transmit payment orders to each other under an agreement that settlement of the obligations of each bank to the other under Section 4A-402 will be made at the end of the day or other period, the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by one bank shall be set off against the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by the other bank. To the extent of the setoff, each bank has made payment to the other. Chapter 430 1321 1322 Chapter 430 (d) In a case not covered by subsection (a), the time when payment of the sender's obligation under Section 4A-402(b) or 4A-402(c) occurs is governed by applicable principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied. \u00a74A-404. OBLIGATION OF BENEFICIARY'S BANK TO PAY AND GIVE NOTICE TO BENEFICIARY. (a) Subject to Sections 4A-211(e), 4A-405(d), and 4A-405(e), if a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order, the bank is obliged to pay the amount of the order to the beneficiary of the order. Payment is due on the payment date of the order, but if acceptance occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank, payment is due on the next funds-transfer business day. If the bank refuses to pay after demand by the beneficiary and receipt of notice of particular circumstances that will give rise to consequential damages as a result of nonpayment, the beneficiary may recover damages resulting from the refusal to pay to the extent the bank had notice of the damages, unless the bank proves that it did not pay because of a reasonable doubt concerning the right of the beneficiary to payment. (b) If a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank instructs payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to notify the beneficiary of receipt of the order before midnight of the next funds-transfer business day following the payment date. If the payment order does not Instruct payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is required to notify the beneficiary only if notice is required by the order. Notice may be given by first class mail or any other means reasonable in the circumstances. If the bank fails to give the required notice, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the beneficiary on the amount of the payment order from the day notice should have been given until the day the beneficiary learned of receipt of the payment order by the bank. No other damages are recoverable. Reasonable attorney's fees are also recoverable if demand for interest is made and refused before an action Is brought on the claim. (c) The right of a beneficiary to receive payment and damages as stated in subsection (a) may not be varied by agreement or a funds-transfer system rule. The right of a beneficiary to be notified as stated in subsection (b) may be varied by agreement of the beneficiary or by a funds-transfer system rule If the beneficiary is notified of the rule before initiation of the funds transfer. \u00a74A-405. PAYMENT BY BENEFICIARY'S BANK TO BENEFICIARY. If the beneficiary's bank credits an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, payment of the bank's obligation under Section 4A-404(a) occurs when and to the extent (i) the beneficiary is notified of the right to withdraw the credit, (ii) the bank lawfully applies the credit to a debt of the beneficiary, or (iii) funds with respect to the order are otherwise made available to the beneficiary by the bank. If the beneficiary's bank does not credit an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, the time when payment of the bank's obligation under Section 4A-404(a) occurs is governed by principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied. Except as stated in subsections (d) and (e), if the beneficiary's bank pays the beneficiary of a payment order under a condition to payment or agreement of the beneficiary giving the bank the right to recover payment from the beneficiary if the bank does not receive payment of the order, the condition to payment or agreement is not enforceable. A funds-transfer system rule may provide that payments made to beneficiaries of funds transfers made through the system are provisional until receipt of payment by the beneficiary's bank of the payment order it accepted. A beneficiary's bank that makes a payment that is provisional under the rule is entitled to refund from the beneficiary if (i) the rule requires that both the beneficiary and the originator be given notice of the provisional nature of the payment before the funds transfer is initiated, (li) the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank and the originator's bank agreed to be bound by the rule, and Mil the beneficiary's bank did not receive payment of the payment order that it accepted. If the beneficiary is obliged to refund payment to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the payment order by the Chapter 430 1323 beneficiary's bank is nullified and no payment by the originator of the funds transfer to the beneficiary occurs under Section 4A-406. (e) This subsection applies to a funds transfer that includes a payment order transmitted over a funds-transfer system that (i) nets obligations multilaterally among participants, and (ii) has in effect a loss-sharing agreement among participants for the purpose of providing funds necessary to complete settlement of the obligations of one or more participants that do not meet their settlement obligations. If the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer accepts a payment order and the system falls to complete settlement pursuant to its rules with respect to any payment order in the funds transfer, (i) the acceptance by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance, (ii) the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover payment from the beneficiary, (iii) no payment by the originator to the beneficiary occurs under Section 4A-406, and (iv) subject to Section 4A-402(e), each sender in the funds transfer is excused from its obligation to pay its payment order under Section 4A-402(c) because the funds transfer has not been completed. \u00a74A-406. PAYMENT BY ORIGINATOR TO BENEFICIARY; DISCHARGE OF UNDERLYING OBLIGATION. (a) Subject to Sections 4A-211(e), 4A-405(d), and 4A-405(e), the originator of a funds transfer pays the beneficiary of the originator's payment order (i) at the time a payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary is accepted by the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer and (1i) In an amount equal to the amount of the order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, but not more than the amount of the originator's order. (b) If payment under subsection (a) is made to satisfy an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result from payment to the beneficiary of the same amount in money, unless (i) the payment under subsection (a) was made by a means prohibited by the contract of the beneficiary with respect to the obligation, (ii) the beneficiary, within a reasonable time after receiving notice of receipt of the order by the beneficiary's bank, notified the originator of the beneficiary's refusal of the payment, (iii) funds with respect to the order were not withdrawn by the beneficiary or applied to a debt of the beneficiary, and (iv) the beneficiary would suffer a loss that could reasonably have been avoided if payment had been made by a means complying with the contract. If payment by the originator does not result in discharge under this section, the originator is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to receive payment from the beneficiary's bank under Section 4A-404(a). (c) For the purpose of determining whether discharge of an obligation occurs under subsection (b), if the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the originator's payment order less charges of one or more receiving banks in the funds transfer, payment to the beneficiary is deemed to be in the amount of the originator's order unless upon demand by the beneficiary the originator does not pay the beneficiary the amount of the deducted charges. (d) Rights of the originator or of the beneficiary of a funds transfer under this section may be varied only by agreement of the originator and the beneficiary. PART 5. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS \u00a74A-501. VARIATION BY AGREEMENT AND EFFECT OF FUNDS-TRANSFER SYSTEM RULE. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the rights and obligations of a party to a funds transfer may be varied by agreement of the affected party. \"Funds-transfer system rule\" means a rule of an association of banks (i) governing transmission of payment orders by means of a funds-transfer system of the association or rights and obligations with respect to those orders, or (ii) to the extent the rule governs rights and obligations between banks that are parties to a funds transfer in which a Federal Reserve Bank, acting as an intermediary bank, sends a payment order to the beneficiary's bank. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a 1324 chapter 430 funds-transfer system rule governing rights and obligations between participating banks using the system may be effective even if the rule conflicts with this Article and indirectly affects another party to the funds transfer who does not consent to the rule. A funds-transfer system rule may also govern rights and obligations of parties other than participating banks using the system to the extent stated in Sections 4A-404(c), 4A-405(d), and 4A-507(c). \u00a74A-502, CREDITOR PROCESS SERVED ON RECEIVING BANK; SETOFF BY BENEFICIARY'S BANK. (a) As used in this section, \"creditor process\" means levy, attachment, garnishment, notice of lien, sequestration, or similar process issued by or on behalf of a creditor or other claimant with respect to an account. (b) This subsection applies to creditor process with respect to an authorized account of the sender of a payment order if the creditor process is served on the receiving bank. For the purpose of determining rights with respect to the creditor process, if the receiving bank accepts the payment order the balance in the authorized account is deemed to be reduced by the amount of the payment order to the extent the bank did not otherwise receive payment of the order, unless the creditor process is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank accepts the payment order. (c) If a beneficiary's bank has received a payment order for payment to the beneficiary's account in the bank, the following rules apply: The bank may credit the beneficiary's account. The amount credited may be set off against an obligation owed by the beneficiary to the bank or may be applied to satisfy creditor process served on the bank with respect to the account. The bank may credit the beneficiary's account and allow withdrawal of the amount credited unless creditor process with respect to the account is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act to prevent withdrawal. If creditor process with respect to the beneficiary's account has been served and the bank has had a reasonable opportunity to act on it, the bank may not reject the payment order except for a reason unrelated to the service of process. (d) Creditor process with respect to a payment by the originator to the beneficiary pursuant to a funds transfer may be served only on the beneficiary's bank with respect to the debt owed by that bank to the beneficiary. Any other bank served with the creditor process is not obliged to act with respect to the process. \u00a74A-503. INJUNCTION OR RESTRAINING ORDER WITH RESPECT TO FUNDS TRANSFER. For proper cause and in compliance with applicable law, a court may restrain (i) a person from issuing a payment order to initiate a funds transfer, (ii) an originator's bank from executing the payment order of the originator, or (iii) the beneficiary's bank from releasing funds to the beneficiary or the beneficiary from withdrawing the funds. A court may not otherwise restrain a person from issuing a payment order, paying or receiving payment of a payment order, or otherwise acting with respect to a funds transfer. \u00a74A-504. ORDER IN WHICH ITEMS AND PAYMENT ORDERS MAY BE CHARGED TO ACCOUNT; ORDER OF WITHDRAWALS FROM ACCOUNT. If a receiving bank has received more than one payment order of the sender or one or more payment orders and other items that are payable from the sender's account, the bank may charge the sender's account with respect to the various orders and Items in any sequence. In determining whether a credit to an account has been withdrawn by the holder of the account or applied to a debt of the holder of the account, credits first made to the account are first withdrawn or applied. I \u00a74A-505. PRECLUSION OF OBJECTION TO DEBIT OF CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT. If a receiving bank has received payment from its customer with respect to a payment order issued in the name of the customer as sender and accepted by the bank, and the customer received notification reasonably identifying the order, the customer is precluded from asserting that the bank is not entitled to retain the payment unless the customer notifies the bank of the customer's objection to the payment within one year after the notification was received by the customer. \u00a74A-506. RATE OF INTEREST. If, under this Article, a receiving bank is obliged to pay interest with respect to a payment order issued to the bank, the amount payable may be determined (i) by agreement of the sender and receiving bank, or (ii) by a funds-transfer system rule if the payment order is transmitted through a funds-transfer system. If the amount of interest is not determined by an agreement or rule as stated in subsection (a), the amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable Federal Funds rate by the amount on which interest is payable, and then multiplying the product by the number of days for which interest is payable. The applicable Federal Funds rate is the average of the Federal Funds rates published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for each of the days for which interest is payable divided by 360. The Federal Funds rate for any day on which a published rate is not available is the same as the published rate for the next preceding day for which there is a published rate. If a receiving bank that accepted a payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement on deposits of the receiving bank. \u00a74A-507. CHOICE OF LAW. (a) The following rules apply unless the affected parties otherwise agree or subsection (c) applies: The rights and obligations between the sender of a payment order and the receiving bank are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the receiving bank is located. The rights and obligations between the beneficiary's bank and the beneficiary are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located. The issue of when payment is made pursuant to a funds transfer by the originator to the beneficiary is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located. (b) If the parties described in each paragraph of subsection (a) have made an agreement selecting the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern rights and obligations between each other, the law of that jurisdiction governs those rights and obligations, whether or not the payment order or the funds transfer bears a reasonable relation to that jurisdiction. (c) A funds-transfer system rule may select the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern (i) rights and obligations between participating banks with respect to payment orders transmitted or processed through the system, or (ii) the rights and obligations of some or all parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out by means of the system. A choice of law made pursuant to clause (i) is binding on participating banks. A choice of law made pursuant to clause (ii) is binding on the originator, other sender, or a receiving bank having notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system when the originator, other sender, or receiving bank issued or accepted a payment order. The beneficiary of a funds transfer is bound by the choice of law if, when the funds transfer is initiated, the beneficiary has notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system. The law of a jurisdiction selected pursuant to this Chapter 430 1325 subsection may govern, whether or not that law bears a reasonable relation to the matter in issue. In the event of inconsistency between an agreement under subsection (b) and a choice-of-law rule under subsection (c), the agreement under subsection (b) prevails. If a funds transfer is made by use of more than one funds-transfer system and there is inconsistency between choice-of-law rules of the systems, the matter in issue is governed by the law of the selected jurisdiction that has the most significant relationship to the matter in issue.

Upon the filing of such certificate, the Secretary of State shall furnish to the registered agent a certified copy of the certificate under his hand and seal of office. Filing a certificate under this section shall be deemed to be an amendment of the certificate of formation of each limited liability company affected thereby and each such limited liability company shall not be required to take any further action with respect thereto, to amend its certificate of formation under \u00a718-202 of this chapter. Any registered agent filing a certificate under this section shall promptly, upon such filing, deliver a copy of any such certificate to each limited liability company affected thereby. The registered agent of 1 or more limited liability companies may resign and appoint a successor registered agent by paying a fee as set forth in \u00a718-1105(a)(2) of this chapter and filing a certificate with the Secretary of State, stating that it resigns and the name and address of the successor registered agent. There shall be attached to such certificate a statement executed by each affected limited liability company ratifying and approving such change of registered agent. Upon such filing, the successor registered agent shall become the registered agent of such limited liability companies as have ratified and approved such substitution and the successor registered agent's address, as stated in such certificate, shall become the address of each such limited liability company's registered office in the State of Delaware. The Secretary of State shall furnish to the successor registered agent a certified copy of the certificate of resignation. Filing of such certificate of resignation shall be deemed to be an amendment of the certificate of formation of each limited liability company affected thereby and each such limited liability company shall not be required to take any further action with respect thereto, to amend its certificate of formation under \u00a718-202 of this chapter. The registered agent of a limited liability company may resign without appointing a successor registered agent by paying a fee as set forth In \u00a718-1105(a)(2) of this chapter and filing a certificate with the Secretary of State stating that it resigns as registered agent for the limited liability company identified in the certificate, but such resignation shall not become effective until 120 days after the certificate is filed. There shall be attached to such certificate an affidavit of such registered agent, if an individual, or the president, a vice-president or the secretary thereof if a corporation, that at least 30 days prior to and on or about the date of the filing of said certificate, notices were sent by certified or registered mail to the limited liability company for which such registered agent is resigning as registered agent, at the principal office thereof within or outside the State of Delaware, if known to such registered agent or, if not, to the last known address of the attorney or other individual at whose request such registered agent was appointed for such limited liability company, of the resignation of such registered agent. After receipt of the notice of the resignation of its registered agent, the limited liability company for which such registered agent was acting shall obtain and designate a new registered agent, to take the place of the registered agent so resigning. If such limited liability company fails to obtain and designate a new registered agent as aforesaid prior to the expiration of the period of 120 days after the filing by the registered agent of the certificate of resignation, the certificate of formation of such limited liability company shall be deemed to be cancelled. After the resignation of the registered agent shall have become effective as provided in this section and if no new registered agent shall have been obtained and designated in the time and manner aforesaid, service of legal process against the limited liability company for which the resigned registered agent had been acting shall thereafter be upon the Secretary of State in accordance with \u00a718-105 of this chapter. \u00a718-105. Service of process on domestic limited liability companies. (a) Service of legal process upon any domestic limited liability company shall be made by delivering a copy personally to any manager of the limited liability company in the State of Delaware or the registered agent of the limited liability company in the State of Delaware, or by leaving it at the dwelling house or usual place of abode in the State of Delaware of any such manager or registered agent (if the registered agent be an individual), or at the registered office or other place of business of the limited liability company in the State of Delaware. If the registered agent be a corporation, service of process upon it as such may be made by serving, in the State of Delaware, a copy thereof on the president, vice-president, secretary, assistant secretary or any director of the corporate registered agent. Service by copy left at the dwelling house or usual place of abode of a manager or registered agent, or at the registered office or other place of business of the limited liability company in the State of Delaware, to be effective, must be delivered thereat at least 6 days before the return date of the process, and in the presence of an adult person, and the officer serving the process shall distinctly state the manner of service in his return thereto. Process returnable forthwith must be delivered personally to the manager or registered agent. (b) In case the officer whose duty it is to serve legal process cannot by due diligence serve the process in any manner provided for by subsection (a) of this section, it shall be lawful to serve the process against the limited liability company upon the Secretary of State, and such service shall be as effectual for all intents and purposes as if made in any of the ways provided for in subsection (a) hereof. In the event that service is effected through the Secretary of State in accordance with this subsection, the Secretary of State shall forthwith notify the limited liability company by letter, certified mail, return receipt requested, directed to the limited liability company at its address as it appears on the records relating to such limited liability company on file with the Secretary of State or, if no such address appears, at its last registered office. Such letter shall enclose a copy of the process and any other papers served on the Secretary of State pursuant to this subsection. It shall be the duty of the plaintiff in the event of such service to serve process and any other papers in duplicate, to notify the Secretary of State that service is being effected pursuant to this subsection, and to pay the Secretary of State the sum of $50 for the use of the State of Delaware, which sum shall be taxed as part of the costs in the proceeding if the plaintiff shall prevail therein. The Secretary of State shall maintain an alphabetical record of any such service setting forth the name of the plaintiff and defendant, the title, docket number and nature of the proceeding in which process has been served upon him, the fact that service has been effected pursuant to this subsection, the return date thereof, and the day and hour when the service was made. The Secretary of State shall not be required to retain such information for a period longer than 5 years from his receipt of the service of process. \u00a718-106. Nature of business permitted; powers. A limited liability company may carry on any lawful business, purpose or activity with the exception of the business of granting policies of insurance, or assuming insurance risks or banking as defined in \u00a7126 of Title 8. A limited liability company shall possess and may exercise all the powers and privileges granted by this chapter or by any other law or by its limited liability company agreement, together with any powers incidental thereto, so far as such powers and privileges are necessary or convenient to the conduct, promotion or attainment of the business, purposes or activities of the limited liability company. \u00a718-107. Business transactions of member or manager with the limited liability company. Except as provided in a limited liability company agreement, a member or manager may lend money to, borrow money from, act as a surety, guarantor or endorser for, guarantee or assume one or more specific obligations of, provide collateral for, and transact other business with a limited liability company and, subject to other applicable law, has the same rights and obligations with respect to any such matter as a person who is not a member or manager. \u00a718-108. Indemnification. Chapter 434 1333 Subject to such standards and restrictions, if any, as are set forth in its limited liability company agre,ement, a limited liability company may, and shall have the power to, indemnify and hold harmless any member or manager or other person from and against any and all claims and demands whatsoever. \u00a718-109. Service of process on managers and liquidating trustees. A manager or a liquidating trustee of a limited liability company may be served with process in the manner prescribed in this section in all civil actions or proceedings brought in the State of Delaware involving or relating to the business of the limited liability company or a violation by the manager or the liquidating trustee of a duty to the limited liability company, or any member of the limited liability company, whether or not the manager or the liquidating trustee is a manager or a liquidating trustee at the time suit is commenced. A manager's or a liquidating trustee's serving as such constitutes such person's consent to the appointment of the registered agent of the limited liability company (or, if there is none, the Secretary of State) as such person's agent upon whom service of process may be made as provided in this section. Such service as a manager or a liquidating trustee shall signify the consent of such manager or liquidating trustee that any process when so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served upon such manager or liquidating trustee within the State of Delaware and such appointment of the registered agent (or, if there is none, the Secretary of State) shall be irrevocable. Service of process shall be effected by serving the registered agent (or, if there is none, the Secretary of State) with 1 copy of such process in the manner provided by law for service of writs of summons. In the event service is made under this subsection upon the Secretary of State, the plaintiff shall pay to the Secretary of State the sum of $50 for the use of the State of Delaware, which sum shall be taxed as part of the costs of the proceeding if the plaintiff shall prevail therein. In addition, the Prothonotary or the Register in Chancery of the court in which the civil action or proceeding is pending shall, within 7 days of such service, deposit in the United States mails, by registered mail, postage prepaid, true and attested copies of the process, together with a statement that service is being made pursuant to this section, addressed to such manager or liquidating trustee at the registered office of the limited liability company and at his address last known to the party desiring to make such service. In any action in which any such manager or liquidating trustee has been served with process as hereinabove provided, the time in which a defendant shall be required to appear and file a responsive pleading shall be computed from the date of mailing by the Prothonotary or the Register in Chancery as provided in subsection (b) of this section; however, the court in which such action has been commenced may order such continuance or continuances as may be necessary to afford such manager or liquidating trustee reasonable opportunity to defend the action. In a written limited liability company agreement or other writing, a manager or member may consent to be subject to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or arbitration in, a specified jurisdiction, or the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of, or the exclusivity of arbitration in, the State of Delaware, and to be served with legal process in the manner prescribed in such limited liability company agreement or other writing. Nothing herein contained limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner now or hereafter provided by law. This section is an extension of and not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal process upon nonresidents. The Court of Chancery and the Superior Court may make all necessary rules respecting the form of process, the manner of issuance and return thereof and such other rules which may be necessary to implement this section and are not inconsistent with this section. Subchapter II. Formation; Certificate of Formation \u00a718-201. Certificate of formation. 1334 Chapter 434 Chapter 434 (a) In order to form a limited liability company, 1 or more authorized persons must execute a certificate of formation. The certificate of formation shall be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State and set forth: The name of the limited liability company; The address of the registered office and the name and address of the registered agent for service of process required to be maintained by \u00a718-104 of this chapter; If the limited liability company is to have a specific date of dissolution, the latest date on which the limited liability company is to dissolve; and Any other matters the members determine to include therein. (b) A limited liability company is formed at the time of the filing of the initial certificate of formation in the Office of the Secretary of State or at any later date or time specified in the certificate of formation if, in either case, there has been substantial compliance with the requirements of this section. A limited liability company formed under this chapter shall be a separate legal entity, the existence of which as a separate legal entity shall continue until cancellation of the limited liability company's certificate of formation. (c) The filing of the certificate of formation in the Office of the Secretary of State shall make it unnecessary to file any other documents under Chapter 31 of this title. \u00a718-202. Amendment to certificate of formation. (a) A certificate of formation is amended by filing a certificate of amendment thereto in the Office of the Secretary of State. The certificate of amendment shall set forth: The name of the limited liability company; and The amendment to the certificate of formation. (b) A manager or, if there is no manager, then any member who becomes aware that any statement in a certificate of formation was false when made, or that any matter described has changed making the certificate of formation false in any material respect, shall promptly amend the certificate of formation. (c) A certificate of formation may be amended at any time for any other proper purpose. (d) Unless otherwise provided in this chapter or unless a later effective date or time (which shall be a date or time certain) is provided for in the certificate of amendment, a certificate of amendment shall be effective at the time of its filing with the Secretary of State. \u00a718-203. Cancellation of certificate. A certificate of formation shall be cancelled upon the dissolution and the completion of winding up of a limited liability company, or at any other time there are less than 2 members, or as provided in \u00a718-104(d) of this chapter, or upon the filing of a certificate of merger or consolidation if the limited liability company is not the surviving or resulting entity in a merger or consolidation. A certificate of cancellation shall be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State to accomplish the cancellation of a certificate of formation upon the dissolution and the completion of winding up of a limited liability company or at any other time there are not 2 members and shall set forth: The name of the limited liability company; The date of filing of its certificate of formation; The reason for filing the certificate of cancellation; 1335 1336 Chapter 434 The future effective date or time (which shall be a date or time certain) of cancellation if it is not to be effective upon the filing of the certificate; and Any other information the person filing the certificate of cancellation determines. \u00a718-204. Execution. Each certificate required by this subchapter to be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State shall be executed by 1 or more authorized persons. Unless otherwise provided in a limited liability company agreement, any person may sign any certificate or amendment thereof or enter into a limited liability company agreement or amendment thereof by an agent, including an attorney-in-fact. An authorization, including a power of attorney, to sign any certificate or amendment thereof or to enter into a limited liability company agreement or amendment thereof need not be in writing, need not be sworn to, verified or acknowledged, and need not be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State, but if in writing, must be retained by the limited liability company. The execution of a certificate by an authorized person constitutes an oath or affirmation, under the penalties of perjury in the third degree, that, to the best of the authorized person's knowledge and belief, the facts stated therein are true. \u00a718-205. Execution, amendment or cancellation by judicial order. If a person required to execute a certificate required by this subchapter fails or refuses to do so, any other person who is adversely affected by the failure or refusal may petition the Court of Chancery to direct the execution of the certificate. If the Court finds that the execution of the certificate is proper and that any person so designated has failed or refused to execute the certificate, it shall order the Secretary of State to record an appropriate certificate. If a person required to execute a limited liability company agreement or amendment thereof fails or refuses to do so, any other person who is adversely affected by the failure or refusal may petition the Court of Chancery to direct the execution of the limited liability company agreement or amendment thereof. If the Court finds that the limited liability company agreement or amendment thereof should be executed and that any person required to execute the limited liability company agreement or amendment thereof has failed or refused to do so, it shall enter an order granting appropriate relief. \u00a718-206. Filing. (a) The original signed copy of the certificate of formation and of any certificates of amendment or cancellation (or of any judicial decree of amendment or cancellation), and of any certificate of merger or consolidation and of any restated certificate shall be delivered to the Secretary of State. A person who executes a certificate as an agent or fiduciary need not exhibit evidence of his authority as a prerequisite to filing. Any signature on any certificate authorized to be filed with the Secretary of State under any provision of this chapter may be a facsimile. Unless the Secretary of State finds that any certificate does not conform to law, upon receipt of all filing fees required by law he shall: Certify that the certificate of formation, the certificate of amendment, the certificate of cancellation (or of any judicial decree of amendment or cancellation), the certificate of merger or consolidation or the restated certificate has been filed in his office by endorsing upon the original certificate the word \"Filed\", and the date and hour of the filing. This endorsement is conclusive of the date and time of its filing in the absence of actual fraud; File and index the endorsed certificate; and Chapter 434 1337 (3) Prepare and return to the person who filed it or his representative a copy of the original signed instrument, similarly endorsed, and shall certify such copy as a true copy of the original signed instrument. Upon the filing of a certificate of amendment (or judicial decree of amendment) or restated certificate in the Office of the Secretary of State, or upon the future effective date or time of a certificate of amendment (or judicial decree thereof) or restated certificate, as provided for therein, the certificate of formation shall be amended or restated as set forth therein. Upon the filing of a certificate of cancellation (or a judicial decree thereof), or a certificate of merger or consolidation which acts as a certificate of cancellation, or upon the future effective date or time of a certificate of cancellation (or a judicial decree thereof) or of a certificate of merger or consolidation which acts as a certificate of cancellation, as provided for therein, or as specified in \u00a718-104(d) of this chapter, the certificate of formation is cancelled. A fee as set forth in \u00a718-1105(a)(3) of this chapter shall be paid at the time of the filing of a certificate of formation, a certificate of amendment, a certificate of cancellation, a certificate of merger or consolidation or a restated certificate. A fee as set forth in \u00a718-1105(a)(4) of this chapter shall be paid for a certified copy of any paper on file as provided for by this chapter, and a fee as set forth in \u00a718-1105(a)(5) of this chapter shall be paid for each page copied. \u00a718-207. Notice. The fact that a certificate of formation is on file in the Office of the Secretary of State is notice that the entity formed in connection with the filing of the certificate of formation is a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware and is notice of all other facts set forth therein which are required to be set forth in a certificate of formation by \u00a718-201(a)(1) and (2) of this chapter. \u00a718-208. Restated certificate. A limited liability company may, whenever desired, integrate into a single instrument all of the provisions of its certificate of formation which are then in effect and operative as a result of there having theretofore been filed with the Secretary of State 1 or more certificates or other instruments pursuant to any of the sections referred to in this subchapter and It may at the same time also further amend its certificate of formation by adopting a restated certificate of formation. If a restated certificate of formation merely restates and integrates but does not further amend the initial certificate of formation, as theretofore amended or supplemented by any instrument that was executed and filed pursuant to any of the sections in this subchapter, it shall be specifically designated in its heading as a \"Restated Certificate of Formation\" together with such other words as the limited liability company may deem appropriate and shall be executed by an authorized person and filed as provided in \u00a718-206 of this chapter in the Office of the Secretary of State. If a restated certificate restates and integrates and also further amends in any respect the certificate of formation, as theretofore amended or supplemented, it shall be specifically designated in its heading as an \"Amended and Restated Certificate of Formation\" together with such other words as the limited liability company may deem appropriate and shall be executed by at least 1 authorized person, and filed as provided in \u00a718-206 of this chapter in the Office of the Secretary of State. A restated certificate of formation shall state, either in its heading or in an introductory paragraph, the limited liability company's present name, and, if it has been changed, the name under which it was originally filed, and the date of filing of its original certificate of formation with the Secretary of State, and the future effective date or time (which shall be a date or time certain) of the restated certificate if it is not to be effective upon the filing of the restated certificate. A restated certificate shall also state that it was duly executed and is being filed in accordance with this section. If a restated certificate only restates and integrates and does not further amend a limited liability company's certificate of formation as theretofore amended or supplemented and there is no discrepancy between those provisions and the restated certificate, it shall state that fact as well. Upon the filing of a restated certificate of formation with the Secretary of State, or upon the future effective date or time of a restated certificate of formation as provided for therein, the initial certificate of formation, as theretofore amended or supplemented, shall be superseded; thenceforth, the restated certificate of formation, including any further amendment or changes made thereby, shall be the certificate of formation of the limited liability company, but the original effective date of formation shall remain unchanged. Any amendment or change effected in connection with the restatement and integration of the certificate of formation shall be subject to any other provision of this chapter, not inconsistent with this section, which would apply if a separate certificate of amendment were filed to effect such amendment or change. \u00a718-209. Merger and consolidation. As used in this section, \"other business entity\" means a corporation, or a business trust or association, a real estate investment trust, a common-law trust, or any other unincorporated business, including a partnership (whether general or limited), and a foreign limited liability company, but excluding a domestic limited liability company. Pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, a domestic limited liability company may merge or consolidate with or into 1 or more domestic limited liability companies or other business entities formed or organized under the laws of the State of Delaware or any other state or the United States or any foreign country or other foreign jurisdiction, with such domestic limited liability company or other business entity as the agreement shall provide being the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity. Unless otherwise provided in the limited liability company agreement, a merger or consolidation shall be approved by each domestic limited liability company which Is to merge or consolidate by the members or, if there is more than one class or group of members, then by each class or group of members, in either case, by members who own more than 50 percent of the then current percentage or other interest in the profits of the domestic limited liability company owned by all of the members or by the members in each class or group, as appropriate. In connection with a merger or consolidation hereunder, rights or securities of, or interests in, a. domestic limited liability company or other business entity which is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity or, in addition to or in lieu thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, a domestic limited liability company or other business entity which is not the surviving or resulting limited liability company or other business entity in the merger or consolidation. Notwithstanding prior approval, an agreement of merger or consolidation may be terminated or amended pursuant to a provision for such termination or amendment contained in the agreement of merger or consolidation. If a domestic limited liability company is merging or consolidating under this section, the domestic limited liability company or other business entity surviving or resulting in or from the merger or consolidation shall file a certificate of merger or consolidation in the Office of the Secretary of State. The certificate of merger or consolidation shall state: The name and jurisdiction of formation or organization of each of the domestic limited liability companies or other business entities which is to merge or consolidate; That an agreement of merger or consolidation has been approved and executed by each of the domestic limited liability companies or other business entitles which is to merge or consolidate; 1338 Chapter 434 Chapter 434 1339 The name of the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity; The future effective date or time (which shall be a date or time certain) of the merger or consolidation if it is not to be effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger or consolidation; That the agreement of merger or consolidation is on file at a place of business of the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity, and shall state the address thereof; That a copy of the agreement of merger or consolidation will be furnished by the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity, on request and without cost, to any member of any domestic limited liability company or any person holding an interest in any other business entity which is to merge or consolidate; and If the surviving or resulting entity is not a domestic limited liability company, or a corporation or limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, or a business trust organized under 12 Del C., Ch. 38, a statement that such surviving or resulting other business entity agrees that it may be served with process in the State of Delaware in any action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any obligation of any domestic limited liability company which is to merge or consolidate, Irrevocably appointing the Secretary of State as its agent to accept service of process in any such action, suit or proceeding and specifying the address to which a copy of such process shall be mailed to it by the Secretary of State. In the event of service hereunder upon the Secretary of State, the procedures set forth in \u00a718-911(c) of this chapter shall be applicable, except that the plaintiff in any such action, suit or proceeding shall furnish the Secretary of State with the address specified in the certificate of merger or consolidation provided for in this section and any other address which the plaintiff may elect to furnish, together with copies of such process as required by the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State shall notify such surviving or resulting other business entity at all such addresses furnished by the plaintiff in accordance with the procedures set forth in \u00a718-911(c) of this chapter. Unless a future effective date or time is provided in a certificate of merger or consolidation, in which event a merger or consolidation shall be effective at any such future effective date or time, a merger or consolidation shall be effective upon the filing in the Office of the Secretary of State of a certificate of merger or consolidation. A certificate of merger or consolidation shall act as a certificate of cancellation for a domestic limited liability company which is not the surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation. An agreement of merger or consolidation approved in accordance with subsection (b) of this section may (1) effect any amendment to the limited liability company agreement or (2) effect the adoption of a new limited liability company agreement, for a limited liability company if it is the surviving or resulting limited liability company in the merger or consolidation. Any amendment to a limited liability company agreement or adoption of a new limited liability company agreement made pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger or consolidation: The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit the accomplishment of a merger or of any of the matters referred to herein by any other means provided for in a limited liability company agreement or other agreement or as otherwise permitted by law, Including that the limited liability company agreement of any constituent limited liability company to the merger or consolidation (including a limited liability company formed for the purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation) shall be the limited liability company agreement of the surviving or resulting limited liability company. When any merger or consolidation shall have become effective under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the State of Delaware, all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the domestic limited liability companies and other business entities that have merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to any of said domestic limited liability companies and other business entities, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to each of such domestic limited liability companies and other business entities, shall be vested in the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity, and shall thereafter be the property of the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity as they were of each of the domestic limited liability companies and other business entities that have merged or consolidated, and the title to any real property vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the State of Delaware, in any of such domestic limited liability companies and other business entities, shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of this chapter; but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any of said domestic limited liability companies and other business entities shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of the said domestic limited liability companies and other business entities that have merged or consolidated shall thenceforth attach to the surviving or resulting domestic limited liability company or other business entity, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it. Unless otherwise agreed, a merger or consolidation of a domestic limited liability company, including a domestic limited liability company which is not the surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation, shall not require such domestic limited liability company to wind up its affairs under \u00a718-803 of this chapter or pay its liabilities and distribute its assets under \u00a718-804 of this chapter. Subchapter III. Members \u00a718-301. Admission of members. (a) In connection with the formation of a limited liability company, a person acquiring a limited liability company interest is admitted as a member of the limited liability company upon the later to occur of: The formation of the limited liability company; or The time provided in and upon compliance with the limited liability company agreement or, if the limited liability company agreement does not so provide, when the person's admission is reflected in the records of the limited liability company. (b) After the formation of a limited liability company, a person acquiring a limited liability company interest is admitted as a member of the limited liability company: In the case of a person acquiring a limited liability company interest directly from the limited liability company, at the time provided in and upon compliance with the limited liability company agreement or, if the limited liability company agreement does not so provide, upon the consent of all members and when the person's admission is reflected in the records of the limited liability company; or In the case of an assignee of a limited liability company interest, as provided in \u00a718-704(a) of this chapter and at the time provided in and upon compliance with the limited liability company agreement or, if the limited liability company agreement does not so provide, when any such person's permitted admission is reflected in the records of the limited liability company. (c) A person may be admitted to a limited liability company as a member of the limited liability company and may receive a limited liability company interest in the limited liability company without making a contribution or being obligated to make a contribution to the limited liability company. \u00a718-302. Classes and voting. (a) A limited liability company agreement may provide for classes or groups of members having such relative rights, powers and duties as the limited liability company agreement may provide, and may make provision for the future creation in the manner provided in the limited liability company agreement of additional classes or groups of members having such relative rights, powers and duties as may from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties senior to existing classes and groups of members. A 1340 Chapter 434 Chapter 434 1341 limited liability company agreement may provide for the taking of an action, including the amendment of the limited liability company agreement, without the vote or approval of any member or class or group of members, including an action to create under the provisions of the limited liability company agreement a class or group of limited liability company interests that was not previously outstanding. A limited liability company agreement may grant to all or certain Identified members or a specified class or group of the members the right to vote separately or with all or any class or group of the members or managers, on any matter. Voting by members may be on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, group or any other basis. A limited liability company agreement which grants a right to vote may set forth provisions relating to notice of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be voted on by any members, waiver of any such notice, action by consent without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or by proxy, or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right to vote. \u00a718-303. Liability to third parties.

Amend Chapter 50, Title 29 of the Delaware Code, by adding a new Subchapter IIB, which shall read as follows: \"Subchapter IIB. HUMAN INVESTMENT AND PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. \u00a75039. Declaration of Policy The General Assembly of the State of Delaware recognizes that a successful economic development effort is critical to the long term viability of our state. It further recognizes that the majority of the economic development benefits and increases in jobs will come from the businesses that are currently in the state. It is therefore crucial that the state, through its economic development program, meets the needs of those businesses in an ever changing work place. Once of the critical needs for business is a welltrained and welleducated work force. As the pool of younger workers shrinks, business must turn more to women, minorities, and senior citizens to fill those jobs. This labor group brings great potential for productivity, but also special needs (such as child care, elder care, flexible work times, and retraining). The General Assembly, therefore, intends through this Subchapter to address this situation by establishing, in the Delaware Development Office, a Human Investment and Partnership Program, whose responsibility will be to assist Delaware businesses to better utilize that work force talent. With the help of businesses who have successfully dealt with many of these issues and others in the community who have facilitated such activities, the Delaware Development Office will provide that assistance to Delaware businesses. \u00a75040. Establishment of the Human Investment and Partnership Program There is hereby established a Human Investment and Partnership Program within the Delaware Development Office whose purpose is to provide assistance to Delaware businesses in order for them to better utilize the talent pool of women, minorities, and senior citizens. \u00a75041. Responsibilities and Function of the Human Investment and Partnership Program The Human Investment and Partnership Program shall have the following responsibilities and functions: Assist Delaware businesses in tapping the work force of women, minorities, and senior citizens; Work with Delaware businesses and others in the community who have been successful in addressing the issues so crucial to that work force: child care, elder care, flexible worktime, retraining, etc. Provide training and awareness programs for Delaware businesses on the issues and benefits of bringing women, minorities, and senior citizens into the workplace. Assist Delaware businesses in overcoming obstacles to fully utilizing the work force of women, minorities, and senior citizens. \u00a75042.

Nine of the members shall be from the community and shall include representatives from: 1) large and small businesses that have had success with programs that are essential for women, minorities, and senior citizens to be part of the work force, such as child care, elder care, flexible work times, and re-training; 2) the legal community who have had experience with work-place issues; and 3) the higher education community who have had experience with economic development activities in the state of Delaware. There shall also be a representative from the Department of Labor, the Division of Social Services, the State Jobs Training Coordinating Council, and the Division of Aging appointed by the Governor to serve on this Council. The duties of the Council shall include, but not be limited to the following: I. Assist the Delaware Development Office and Department of Labor in advising other Delaware businesses in the implementation of programs to facilitate the entry of women, minorities, and senior citizens into the work place. 2. Assist the Delaware Development Office and Department of Labor in offering training and awareness programs for Delaware businesses. The terms of the community members shall be staggered. Of the initial appointments, 3 appointees shall serve for a term of one year, 3 appointees shall serve for a term of two years, and 3 appointees shall serve for a term of 3 years. Subsequent appointees or re-appointees shall serve for a term of 3 years, except that any appointment made to replace an appointee for reasons other than expiration of term shall only be appointed to finish the remainder of the replaced appointee's term.

WHEREAS, 851. of Delaware's public school students ride buses to and from school and the cost of public school transportation accounts for $1 out of every $12 state dollars spent on education; and WHEREAS, nationally the average percentage of public school students transported is about 551.; and WHEREAS, the basic formulas for the reimbursement of school bus contractors and school districts which operate their own buses have been in place since 1978 and have from time to time been recalibrated and adjusted for inflation; and WHEREAS, the current reimbursement formulas were developed for gasoline-powered buses and not diesel-powered buses which are becoming increasingly common in Delaware; and WHEREAS, there has been an increase in the number of bus contracts held by large contactors operating 5 or more routes; and WHEREAS, the current contracts permit a contractor to terminate service each year within 30 days of final approval of the State's operating budget for that fiscal year, effectively giving schools about 30 days notice that they must replace a contractor who intends to terminate service; and WHEREAS, current State law permits assignment of school bus contracts without competitive bidding but another statute prohibits State employees or their immediate family members from entering into contracts for services unless those contracts result from competitive bidding; and WHEREAS, there has from time to time been a shortage of school bus drivers in some parts of the State, a condition which may be further aggravated by the new federal requirements relating to licensing of commercial operators including school bus drivers; and WHEREAS, in the FY 91 Budget Act, the General Assembly authorized the Department of Public Instruction to begin a project to computerize school bus scheduling so that the utilization of school buses can be optimized thereby reducing the number of school buses that are needed to safely transport Delaware's school children; and WHEREAS, the State spends approximately $2.8 million a year to partially defer the costs of transportation incurred by parents of students attending non-public schools. WHEREAS, unlike public school transportation, the non-public transportation program permits reimbursement to parents whose children are transported by private conveyance as well as those who ride non-public, school-operated buses; and WHEREAS, school bus safety is a continuing concern of the General Assembly and the Governor of the State of Delaware; and WHEREAS, parents continue to be concerned about the amount of time some students spend on the buses and about the impact of bus schedules on the starting and closing times of some schools; and WHEREAS, it is the intent of this resolution to cause a thorough and comprehensive examination of school transportation issues to be undertaken for the purpose of developing recommendations as to how the current levels of funding can be more efficiently and effectively allocated for transportation Chapter 455 1397 services or reallocated for the benefit of classroom education and to assure that transportation related disruptions of the education process are minimized. NOW, THEREFORE: BE IT RESOLVED that the Senate and House of Representatives of the 136th General Assembly concludes that the high cost of pupil transportation necessitates that this appropriation be managed in a manner that maximizes the funding available for classroom education without compromising the safety, efficiency, or viability of the transportation system. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the 136th General Assembly of the State of Delaware that a Task Force on School Transportation is hereby established to review and make recommendations on the following issues related to school transportation and others that the Task Force may deem appropriate: 1 Formulas or methods of reimbursement of sthool bus contractors and school districts which operate their own buses including variations that may be considered in order to distinguish between gasolinepowered and dieselpowered buses; Terms of school bus contracts, particularly as they relate to termination of contracts either by the school district or the contactor; Conflicts in current statutes that require bidding if the contract is awarded to a State employee but which exclude school bus contracts from the bid laws; Shortages of school bus drivers and the impact of the new federal commercial driver's license; The possibility that transportation costs could be reduced if a public transit option system was established for older students in areas served by the existing public transportation system; An examination of the policy issues relating to the nonpublic transportation methodology; School bus safety issues, including unique hazards; School bus scheduling issues; BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Task Force on School Transportation shall be composed of the following members: A member of the State Board of Education who shall serve as chairperson and who shall be appointed by the President of the State Board of Education; One member of the Senate appointed by the Senate Pro Tempore; One member of the House of Representatives appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives; The State Budget Director or a designee appointed by the Budget Director; The Controller General or a designee appointed by the Controller General; A local school district superintendent appointed by the Chief School Officers Association; A representative of the Delaware Administration for Regional Transit, appointed by the Secretary of Transportation.
