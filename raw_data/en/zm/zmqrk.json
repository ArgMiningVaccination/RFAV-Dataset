Natural Sugar Quartz Crystal Geode for Blessings and High Vibrations These sparkling quartz geodes are each a one-of-a-kind with varying point sizes, facet shapes, and unique characteristics. Quartz is a powerhouse do-it-all crystal. If you are ever unsure of what crystal to use, you can never go wrong with quartz! It is a wonderful energy amplifier and cleanser. Spiritually, it may raise your energy to the highest vibration available to you. This master stone also amplifies clarity of purpose. Known as the \"granddaddy\" of healing crystals, quartz balances all of the chakras as it contains all the colors in the light spectrum. It can amplify the energy of any other crystal you are working with, and provides energy and direction in your life. These geodes are perfectly sized for tabletop display. Depending on the size of the individual clusters, these geodes are sometimes known as Snow or White Sugar Quartz, due to the fine sugar-like formations. These crystals in particular are good when working on knowledge, wisdom, and benevolence to others. Some consider this a crystal of blessings, as pure as the falling snow. Self-reflection is excellent with this crystal. Every geode is different in size, shape, and texture. The photos only give an indication of what the geodes look like.
