DVMetrics assumes no liability, and each user assumes full risk, responsibility, and liability,related to its use of the DVMetrics service and data. See the Terms of Use for further details.FARROWSURE GOLD BZoetisParvovirus FarrowSure GOLD B is for vaccination of healthy breeding swine as an aid in preventing reproductive failure caused byporcine parvovirus (PPV), erysipelas icterohaemorrhagiae, and L. pomona. An 18-week duration of immunity following vaccination has been demonstrated againsterysipelas. FarrowSure GOLD B is a liquid preparation of porcine parvovirus grown on an established porcine cell line, a serum-free, clarified E.rhusiopathiae culture, and whole cell cultures of the 6 Leptospira serovars identified above. The antigens have been chemically inactivated andadjuvanted with 2 adjuvants, including to enhance the immune response.DISEASE DESCRIPTION: PPV and Leptospira are common agents of reproductive loss in swine. While infection with either of these pathogens mayproduce subclinical disease, infection with PPV during pregnancy may result in fetal resorption, fetal mummification and stillbirths. Infection by Leptospiraduring the second half of pregnancy may cause abortions and stillbirths; late-term abortions are the most important economic effect of leptospirosis.Leptospirosis caused by any of the serovars represented here cannot be clinically differentiated. Abortions may also occur in sows infected with E.rhusiopathiae during pregnancy.SAFETY AND EFFICACY: The safety of FarrowSure GOLD B was demonstrated under field conditions in approximately 1,340 sows and gilts receivingsingle or multiple doses. No serious systemic or allergic reactions were observed following vaccination.Efficacy of the fractions of FarrowSure GOLD B was demonstrated in controlled challenge-of-immunity and immunogenicity tests. Additionally, duration-of-immunity studies demonstrated that FarrowSure GOLD B protected pigs against E. rhusiopathiae challenge 18 weeks after the second vaccination.DIRECTIONS:General Directions: Shake well. Aseptically administer 2 mL intramuscularly.Primary Vaccination: Healthy swine should receive 2 doses 3-5 weeks apart with the second dose administered 2-4 weeks prior to breeding. Healthygilts, however, should receive the second dose as near as possible to 14 days prior to breeding.Revaccination: Revaccination with a single dose is recommended prior to subsequent breedings. Boars should be revaccinated semiannually.Good animal husbandry and herd health management practices should be employed.PRECAUTIONS:Store at 2\u00b0-7\u00b0C. Prolonged exposure to higher temperatures may adversely affect potency. Do not freeze.Use entire contents when first opened.Sterilized syringes and needles should be used to administer this vaccine.Do not vaccinate within 21 days before slaughter.Contains gentamicin as preservative.Transient injection site swelling and/or inappetance may occur following vaccination.As with many vaccines, anaphylaxis may occur after use. Initial antidote of epinephrine is recommended and should be followed with appropriatesupportive therapy.This product has been shown to be efficacious in healthy animals. A protective immune response may not be elicited if animals are incubating aninfectious disease, are malnourished or parasitized, are stressed due to shipment or environmental conditions, are otherwise immunocompromised, orthe vaccine is not administered in accordance with label directions.Technical inquiries should be directed to Zoetis Inc.

INTRODUCTION IVOMEC (ivermectin) is an injectable parasiticide for cattle and swine. One low-volume dose effectively treats and controls the following internal and external parasites that may impair the health of cattle and swine: gastrointestinal roundworms (including inhibited Ostertagia ostertagi in cattle; and gastrointestinal roundworms, lungworms, lice, and mange mites of swine. Discovered and developed by scientists from Merck Research Laboratories, ivermectin is a novel chemical entity. Its convenience, broad-spectrum efficacy, and safety margin make IVOMEC Injection a unique product for parasite control of cattle and swine. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION Ivermectin is derived from the avermectins, a family of potent, broadspectrum antiparasitic agents isolated from fermentation of Streptomyces avermitilis. IVOMEC Injection is a clear, ready-to-use, sterile glycol, q.s. ad 100%. IVOMEC Injection is formulated to deliver the recommended dose level of 200 mcg ivermectin/kilogram of body weight in cattle when given subcutaneously at the rate of 1 mL/110 lb (50 kg). In Swine, IVOMEC Injection is formulated to deliver the recommended dose level of 300 mcg ivermectin/kilogram body weight when given subcutaneously in the neck at the rate of 1 mL per 75 lb (33 kg). MODE OF ACTION Ivermectin is a member of the macrocyclic lactone class of endectocides which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligandgated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.

Animals should be appropriately restrained to achieve the proper route of administration. Use of a 16-gauge, 1/2 to 3/4\" needle is suggested. Inject under the loose skin in front of or behind the shoulder (see illustration). When using the 200, 500 or 1000 mL pack size, use only automatic syringe equipment. Use sterile equipment and sanitize the injection site by applying a suitable disinfectant. Clean, properly disinfected needles should be used to reduce the potential for injection site infections. No special handling or protective clothing is necessary. Swine: IVOMEC (ivermectin) Injection is to be given subcutaneously in the neck. Animals should be appropriately restrained to achieve the proper route of administration. Use of a 16- or 18-gauge needle is suggested for sows and boars, while an 18-or 20-gauge needle may be appropriate for young animals. Inject under the skin, immediately behind the ear (see illustration). When using the 200 mL, 500 mL or 1000 mL pack size, use only automatic syringe equipment. As with any injection, sterile equipment should be used. The injection site should be cleaned and disinfected with alcohol before injection. The rubber stopper should also be disinfected with alcohol to prevent contamination of the contents. Mild and transient pain reactions may be seen in some swine following subcutaneous administration. Recommended Treatment Program Swine: At the time of initiating any parasite control program, it is important to treat all breeding animals in the herd. After the initial treatment, use IVOMEC Injection regularly as follows: BREEDING ANIMALS Sows: Treat prior to farrowing, preferably 7-14 days before, to minimize infection of piglets. Gilts: Treat 7-14 days prior to breeding. Treat 7-14 days prior to farrowing. Boars: Frequency and need for treatments are dependent upon exposure. Treat at least two times a year. FEEDER PIGS (Weaners/Growers/Finishers) All weaner/feeder pigs should be treated before placement in clean quarters. Pigs exposed to contaminated soil or pasture may need retreatment if reinfection occurs. NOTE:\u00aeCompendium of Veterinary Products - IVOMEC\u00ae 3 of 5 12/21/2021, 12:10 PM(1) IVOMEC Injection has a persistent drug level sufficient to control mite infestations throughout the egg to adult life cycle. However, since the ivermectin effect is not immediate, care must be taken to prevent reinfestation from exposure to untreated animals or contaminated facilities. Generally, pigs should not be moved to clean quarters or exposed to uninfested pigs for approximately one week after treatment. Sows should betreated at least one week before farrowing to minimize transfer of mites to newborn baby pigs.(2) Louse eggs are unaffected by IVOMEC Injection and may require up to three weeks to hatch. Louse infestations developing from hatching eggs may require retreatment. (3) Consult a veterinarian for aid in the diagnosis and control of internal and external parasites of swine. Special Minor Use Reindeer: For the treatment and control of warbles (Oedemagena tarandi) in reindeer, inject 200 micrograms ivermectin per kilogram of body weight, subcutaneously. Follow use directions for cattle as described under ADMINISTRATION. American Bison: For the treatment and control of grubs (Hypoderma bovis) in American bison, inject 200 micrograms ivermectin per kilogram of body weight, subcutaneously. Follow use directions for cattle as described under ADMINISTRATION. RESIDUE WARNING: Do not treat reindeer or American bison within 8 weeks (56 days) of slaughter. WARNING NOT FOR USE IN HUMANS. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains more detailed occupational safety information. To report adverse effects, obtain an MSDS or for assistance, contact Merial at 1-888-637-4251. RESIDUE WARNING: Do not treat cattle within 35 days of slaughter. Because a withdrawal time in milk has not been established, do not use in female dairy cattle of breeding age. A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal. Do not treat swine within 18 days of slaughter. PRECAUTIONS Transitory discomfort has been observed in some cattle following subcutaneous administration. A low incidence of soft tissue swelling at the injection site has been observed. These reactions have disappeared without treatment. For cattle, divide doses greater than 10 mL between two injection sites to reduce occasional discomfort or site reaction. Use sterile equipment and sanitize the injection site by applying a suitable disinfectant. Clean, properly disinfected needles should be used to reduce the potential for injection site infections. Observe cattle for injection site reactions. Reactions may be due to clostridial infection and should be aggressively treated with appropriate antibiotics. If injection site infections are suspected, consult your veterinarian. This product is not for intravenous or intramuscular use. Protect product from light. IVOMEC Injection for Cattle and Swine has been developed specifically for use in cattle, swine, reindeer, and American bison only. This product should not be used in other animal species as severe adverse reactions, including fatalities in dogs, may result. Restricted Drug (California) - use only as directed. When to Treat Cattle with Grubs IVOMEC effectively controls all stages of cattle grubs. However, proper timing of treatment is important. For most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible after the end of the heel fly (warble fly) season. Destruction of Hypoderma larvae (cattle grubs) at the period when these grubs are in vital areas may cause undesirable host-parasite reactions including the possibility of fatalities. Killing Hypoderma lineatum when it is in the tissue surrounding the esophagus (gullet) may cause salivation and bloat; killing H. bovis when it is in the vertebral canal may cause staggering or paralysis. These reactions are not specific to treatment with IVOMEC, but can occur with any successful treatment of grubs. Cattle should be treated either before or after these stages of grub development. Consult your veterinarian concerning the proper time for treatment. Cattle treated with IVOMEC after the end of the heel fly season may be retreated with IVOMEC during the winter for internal parasites, mange mites, or sucking lice without danger of grub-related reactions. A planned parasite control program is recommended. Environmental Safety Studies indicate that when ivermectin comes in contact with soil, it readily and tightly binds to the soil and becomes inactive over time. Free ivermectin may adversely affect fish and certain aquatic organisms. Do not permit water runoff from feed lots to enter lakes, streams or ponds. Do not contaminate water by direct application or by improper disposal of drug containers. Dispose of containers in an approved landfill or by incineration. As with other avermectins, ivermectin is excreted in the dung of treated animals and can inhibit the reproduction and growth of pest and beneficial insects that use dung as a source of food and for reproduction. The magnitude and duration of such effects are species and life-cycle specific. When used according to label directions, the product is not expected to have an adverse impact on populations of dung-dependent insects.

DURAMYCIN 72-200 Durvet (oxytetracycline) 200 mg/mL ANTIBIOTIC Each mL contains 200 mg of oxytetracycline base as amphoteric oxytetracycline. For use in beef cattle; dairy cattle; calves, including preruminating (veal) calves; and swine. For animal use only. Read Entire Package Insert Carefully Before Using This Product. Duramycin 72-200 (oxytetracycline) is a sterile, ready-to-use solution for the administration of the broad-spectrum antibiotic oxytetracycline by injection. Duramycin 72-200 does not require refrigeration; however, it is recommended that it be stored at 59\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F (15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C). The antibiotic activity of oxytetracycline is not appreciably diminished in the presence of body fluids, serum, or exudates. CAUTION: When administered to cattle, muscle discoloration may necessitate trimming of the injection site(s) and surrounding tissues during the dressing procedure. WARNINGS: Discontinue treatment at least 28 days prior to slaughter of cattle and swine. Milk taken from animals during treatment and for 96 hours after the last treatment must not be used for food. Rapid intravenous administration may result in animal collapse. Oxytetracycline should be administered intravenously slowly over a period of at least 5 minutes. PRECAUTIONS: Exceeding the highest recommended dosage level of drug per lb of body weight per day, administering more than the recommended number of treatments, and/or exceeding 10 mL intramuscularly or subcutaneously per injection site in adult beef and dairy cattle, and 5 mL intramuscularly per injection site in adult swine, may result in antibiotic residues beyond the withdrawal period. Consult your veterinarian prior to administering this product in order to determine the proper treatment required in the event of an adverse reaction. At the first sign of any adverse reaction, discontinue use of the product and seek the advice of your veterinarian. Some of the reactions may be attributed either to anaphylaxis (an allergic reaction) or to cardiovascular collapse of unknown cause. Shortly after injection, treated animals may have transient hemoglobinuria resulting in darkened urine. As with all antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. A lack of response by the treated animal, or the development of new signs, may suggest that an overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms has occurred. If any of these conditions occur, consult your veterinarian. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving Duramycin 72-200 in conjunction with penicillin. ADVERSE REACTIONS: Reports of adverse reactions associated with oxytetracycline administration include injection site swelling, restlessness, ataxia, trembling, swelling of eyelids, ears, muzzle, anus and vulva (or scrotum and sheath in males), respiratory abnormalities (labored breathing), frothing at the mouth, collapse and possibly death. Some of these reactions may be attributed to anaphylaxis (an allergic reaction) or to cardiovascular collapse of unknown cause. To report suspected adverse drug events, for technical assistance or to obtain a copy of the Safety Data Sheet (SDS), contact Norbrook at 1-866-591-5777. For additional information about adverse drug experience reporting for animal drugs, contact FDA at 1-888-FDA-VETS or online at www.fda.gov/reportanimalae. STORAGE: Store at 59\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F (15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C). Keep from freezing. For 100 mL size: Use within 60 days of first puncture and puncture a maximum of 36 times. For 250 mL and 500 mL sizes: Use within 60 days of first puncture and puncture a maximum of 36 times. If using a needle or draw-off spike larger than 16 gauge, discard any remaining product immediately after use. CARE OF SICK ANIMALS:Compendium of Veterinary Products - Duramycin 72-200 (DURVET, INC.) https://valleyvet.cvpservice.com/product/view/basic/1084050?route=pro... 1 of 5 12/21/2021, 12:09 PMThe use of antibiotics in the management of diseases is based on an accurate diagnosis and an adequate course of treatment. When properly used in the treatment of diseases caused by oxytetracycline-susceptible organisms, most animals that have been treated with Duramycin 72-200 show a noticeable improvement within 24-48 hours. It is recommended that the diagnosis and treatment of animal diseases be carried out by a veterinarian. Since many diseases look alike but require different types of treatment, the use of professional veterinary and laboratory services can reduce treatment time, costs, and needless losses. Good housing, sanitation, and nutrition are important in the maintenance of healthy animals, and are essential in the treatment of diseased animals. INDICATIONS: Duramycin 72-200 is intended for use in the treatment of the following diseases in beef cattle; dairy cattle; calves, including preruminating (veal) calves; due to oxytetracycline-susceptible organisms: Cattle: Duramycin 72-200 is indicated in the treatment of pneumonia and shipping fever complex associated with Pasteurella spp. and Haemophilus spp.; infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (pink eye) caused by Moraxella bovis; foot rot and diphtheria caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum; bacterial enteritis (scours) caused by Actinobacillus lignieresii; leptospirosis caused by Leptospirapomona; and wound infections and acute metritis caused by strains of staphylococci and streptococci organisms sensitive to oxytetracycline. Swine: Duramycin 72-200 indicated in the enteritis (scours, colibacillosis) caused by Escherichia coli; Leptospira pomona. In sows, Duramycin 72-200 is indicated as an aid in the control of infectious enteritis (baby pig scours, colibacillosis) in coli. to be intramuscular, subcutaneous (SC, under the skin) or intravenous injection to beef cattle; dairy cattle; and calves, including preruminating (veal) calves. A single dosage of 9 mg of Duramycin 72-200 per lb of body weight administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously is recommended in the treatment of the following conditions: (1) bacterial pneumonia caused by Pasteurella spp. (shipping fever) in calves and yearlings, where retreatment is impractical due to husbandry conditions, such as cattle on range, or where repeated restraint is inadvisable. (2) infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (pink eye) caused by Moraxella bovis.

DIRECTIONS FOR USE: Duramycin 72-200 is intended for use in the treatment of disease due to oxytetracycline-susceptible organisms in beef cattle; dairy cattle; calves, including preruminating (veal) calves; and swine. A thoroughly cleaned, sterile needle and syringe should be used for each injection (needles and syringes may be sterilized by boiling in water for 15 minutes). In cold weather, Duramycin 72-200 should be warmed to room temperature before administration to animals. Before withdrawing the solution from the bottle, disinfect the rubber cap on the bottle with suitable disinfectant, such as 70% alcohol. The injection site should be similarly cleaned with the disinfectant. Needles of 16-18 gauge and 1-1 1/2 inches long are adequate for intramuscular and subcutaneous injections. Needles 2-3 inches are recommended for intravenous use. Intramuscular Administration: Intramuscular injections in swine should be made by directing the needle of suitable gauge and length into the fleshy part of a thick muscle in the neck region; avoid blood vessels and major nerves. Before injecting the solution, pull back gently on the plunger. If blood appears in the syringe, a blood vessel has been entered; withdraw the needle and select a different site. No more than 10 mL should be injected intramuscularly at any one site in adult beef and dairy cattle, and not more than 5 mL should be injected at any one site in adult swine; rotate injection sites for each succeeding treatment. The volume administered per injection site should be reduced according to age and body size so that 1-2 mL per site is injected in small calves. Subcutaneous Administration:Compendium of Veterinary Products - Duramycin 3 of 5 12/21/2021, 12:09 PMSubcutaneous injections in beef cattle, dairy cattle, and calves, including preruminating (veal) calves, should be made by directing the needle of suitable gauge and length through the loose folds of the neck skin in front of the shoulder. Care should be taken to ensure that the tip of the needle has penetrated the skin but is not lodged in muscle. Before injecting the solution, pull back gently on the plunger. If blood appears in the syringe, a blood vessel has been entered; withdraw the needle and select a different site. The solution should be injected slowly into the area between the skin and muscles. No more than 10 mL should be injected subcutaneously at any one site in adult beef and dairy cattle; rotate injection sites for each succeeding treatment. The volume administered per injection site should be reduced according to age and body size so that 1-2 mL per site is injected in small calves. Intravenous Administration: Duramycin 72-200 may be administered intravenously to beef and dairy cattle. As with all highly concentrated materials, Duramycin 72-200 should be administered slowly by the intravenous route. Preparation of the Animal for Injection: 1. Approximate the location of vein. The jugular vein runs in the jugular groove on each side of the neck from the angle of the jaw to just above the brisket and slightly above and to the side of the windpipe (see Fig. I). 2. Restraint. A stanchion or chute is ideal for restraining the animal. With a halter, rope, or cattle leader (nose tongs), pull the animal's head aroundthe side of the stanchion, cattle chute, or post in such a manner to form a bow in the neck (see Fig. II), then snub the head securely to preventmovement. By forming the bow in the neck, the outside curvature of the bow tends to expose the jugular vein and make it easily accessible. Caution: Avoid restraining the animal with a tight rope or halter around the throat or upper neck which might impede blood flow. Animals that are down present no problem so far as restraint is concerned. 3. Clip hair in area where injection is to be made (over the vein in the upper third of the neck). Clean and disinfect the skin with alcohol or othersuitable antiseptic. Entering the Vein and Making the Injection: 1. Raise the vein. This is accomplished by tying the choke rope tightly around the neck close to the shoulder. The rope should be tied in such a waythat it will not come loose and so that it can be untied quickly by pulling the loose end (see Fig. II). In thick-necked animals, a block of wood placedin the jugular groove between the rope and the hide will help considerably in applying the desired pressure at the right point. The vein is a softflexible tube through which blood flows back to the heart. Under ordinary conditions it cannot be seen or felt with the fingers. When the flow ofblood is blocked at the base of the neck by the choke rope, the vein becomes enlarged and rigid because of the back pressure. If the choke rope is sufficiently tight, the vein stands out and can be easily seen and felt in thin-necked animals. As a further check in identifying the vein, tap it withthe fingers in front of the choke rope. Pulsations that can be seen or felt with the fingers in front of the point being tapped will confirm the fact thatthe vein is properly distended. It is impossible to put the needle into the vein unless it is distended. Experienced operators are able to raise thevein simply by hand pressure, but the use of a choke rope is more certain.2. Inserting the needle. This involves 3 distinct steps. First, insert the needle through the hide. Second, insert the needle into the vein. This may require 2 or 3 attempts before the vein is entered. The vein has a tendency to roll away from the point of the needle, especially if the needle is notsharp. The vein can be steadied with the thumb and finger of one hand. With the other hand, the needle point is placed directly over the vein,slanting it so that its direction is along the length of the vein, either toward the head or toward the heart. Properly positioned this way, a quick thrustof the needle will be followed by a spurt of blood through the needle, which indicates that the vein has been entered. Third, once in the vein, the needle should be inserted along the length of the vein all the way to the hub, exercising caution to see that the needle does not penetrate the opposite side of the vein. Continuous steady flow of blood through the needle indicates that the needle is still in the vein. If blood does not flow continuously, the needle is out of the vein (or clogged) and another attempt must be made. If difficulty is encountered, it may be advisable to usethe vein on the other side of the neck.3. While the needle is being placed in proper position in the vein, an assistant should get the medication ready so that the injection can be startedwithout delay after the vein has been entered.4. Making the injection. With the needle in position as indicated by continuous flow of blood, release the choke rope by a quick pull on the free end.This is essential - the medication cannot flow into the vein while it is blocked. Immediately connect the syringe containing Duramycin 72-200 to theneedle and slowly depress the plunger. If there is resistance to depression of the plunger, this indicates that the needle has slipped out of the vein (or is clogged) and the procedure will have to be repeated. Watch for any swelling under the skin near the needle, which would indicate that the medication is not going into the vein. Should this occur, it is best to try the vein on the opposite side of the neck. 5. Removing the needle. When injection is complete, remove needle with straight pull. Then apply pressure over area of injection momentarily to control any bleeding through needle puncture, using cotton soaked in alcohol or other suitable antiseptic. Not for Human Use.
