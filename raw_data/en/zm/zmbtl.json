Meditation exercises fortify and enrich the nervous system. However, even the most enthusiastic meditators require a healthy diet and good brain chemistry. Meditation enhances the production of many hormones, but to do so, an array of minerals, amino acids, and vitamins are required. For this reason, the effectiveness of meditation can be boosted if the condition of the neuromodulators is improved. It is no secret that the quality of the foods we consume decreases every year. According to an analysis of government tables published in the Compendium of Foods, a steak in 2002 had half the iron of its counterpart in 1940 thanks to changes in animal diets. Remember the adage \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away?\" The calcium content of one medium apple has dropped by nearly half over the past 80 years, according to the Nutrition Security Institute's research. This suggests that we do not always get the micronutrients and vitamins we need. Without these vital elements, the body's ability to synthesize amino acids is impaired. Our body produces about twelve of twenty basic amino acids, but, unfortunately, the elements needed to create them are often missing. The Advanced Mind Institute's neuro-acoustic programs stimulate the production of various hormones, which is why they are so effective. Sometimes, however, the body lacks the necessary neurotransmitters. It is for this reason that the programs' effectiveness may not be optimal for all: Depending on the state of their nervous system, some people get better results than others. Neurotransmitters, also known as chemical messengers, are endogenous chemicals [originating or growing from within] that enable neurotransmission. They transmit signals across a chemical synapse, such as a neuromuscular junction, from one neuron (nerve cell) to another \"target\" neuron, muscle cell, or gland cell. We have compiled a list of the most important amino acids that will boost the effectiveness of neuroacoustic programs and conducted studies which confirm that, in some cases, the effectiveness of The Advanced Mind Institute's neuroacoustic programs increases when combined with these supplements. These amino acids can significantly enhance our programs' effectiveness by strengthening your nervous system and endowing it with all the necessary \"bricks\" (neurotransmitters) that enable your brain to respond more actively to neuro-acoustic stimulation. Hence, your results will improve. Although the five most effective amino acids listed below have no contraindications, we recommend that you carefully read the literature and instructions and consult with your physician before adding them to your diet. You can find more detailed information on the Web. While most people do not experience any side effects from these supplements, exercising caution is paramount. They are: L-Theanine This is probably the best supplement to take when using neuroacoustic meditation programs. It does not have contraindications, except for personal drug sensitivity. L-Theanine, is an amino acid analogue of the proteinogenic amino acids L-glutamate and L-glutamine and is found primarily in particular plant and fungal species. It was discovered as a constituent of green tea in 1949 and in 1950 was isolated from gyokuro leaves. Theanine provides a unique brothy or savory (umami) flavor to green tea infusions. This supplement can be used with any Advanced Mind Institute meditation program, since it improves nervous system functioning and enhances the neuroacoustic effect of our programs. 5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan) The second most effective supplement is 5-HTP. It has a few contraindications. This supplement can be used in combination with meditation programs containing alpha- theta- and delta- rhythms. For beta and gamma stimulation, L-theanine would work best. Use it for delta rhythms, before going to bed. If you have trouble sleeping, use this supplement in combination with any Delta meditation. 5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan) is a chemical by-product of the protein building block L-tryptophan. It is also produced commercially from the seeds of an African plant known as Griffonia simplicifolia. 5-HTP is used for sleep disorders such as insomnia, depression, anxiety, migraine and tension-type headaches, fibromyalgia, obesity, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), seizure disorder, and Parkinson's disease. How does it work? 5-HTP works in the brain and central nervous system by increasing the production of the chemical serotonin. Serotonin can affect sleep, appetite, temperature, sexual behavior, and pain sensation. Since 5-HTP increases the synthesis of serotonin, it is used for several diseases where serotonin is believed to play an important role including depression, insomnia, obesity, and many other conditions. L-Tryptophan The third most effective supplement is L-tryptophan. It can be combined with any neuroacoustic programs by Advanced Mind Institute, but it will be especially useful when combined with beta- and gamma-rhythms meditations. This does not mean that it cannot be used with other programs. L-tryptophan is an amino acid. Amino acids are protein building blocks. L-tryptophan is called an \"essential\" amino acid because the body can't make it. It must be acquired from food. People use L-tryptophan for some mental health disorders, to help quit smoking, for athletic performance, and for emotional symptoms in people with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also concern that using L-tryptophan might cause a condition called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS). How does it work? L-tryptophan is naturally found in animal and plant proteins. L-tryptophan is considered an essential amino acid because our bodies can't make it. It is important for the development and functioning of many organs in the body. After absorbing L-tryptophan from food, our bodies convert it to 5-HTP (5-hyrdoxytryptophan), and then to serotonin, melatonin, and vitamin B6 (nicotinamide). Serotonin is a hormone that transmits signals between nerve cells. It also causes blood vessels to narrow. Changes in the level of serotonin in the brain can alter mood. Melatonin is important for sleep and vitamin B6 is essential for energy metabolism. L-Glutamine This supplement can be used with any Advanced Mind Institute neuroacoustic meditation programs. Glutamine is an amino acid (a building block for proteins), found naturally in the body. Glutamine is used to counter some of the side effects of medical treatments. For example, it is used for side effects of cancerchemotherapy including diarrhea, pain and swelling inside the mouth (mucositis), nerve pain (neuropathy), and muscle and joint pains caused by the cancer drug Taxol. Glutamine is also used to protect the immune system and digestive system in people undergoing radiochemotherapy for cancer of the esophagus. Additionally, glutamine is used for improving recovery after bone marrow transplant or bowel surgery, increasing well-being in people who have suffered traumatic injuries, and preventing infections in critically ill people. Some people use glutamine for digestive system conditions such as stomach ulcers, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. It is also used for depression, moodiness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and enhancing exercise performance. People who have HIV (AIDS) sometimes use glutamine to prevent weight loss (HIV wasting). Glutamine is also used for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a urinary condition called cystinuria, sickle cell anemia, and for alcohol withdrawal support. Glutamine powder can be ordered through most wholesale drug suppliers. Glutamine for commercial use is made by a fermentation process using bacteria that produce glutamine. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) This supplement can be used with any Advanced Mind Institute neuroacoustic meditation programs. GABA is a chemical that is made in the brain. GABA is taken by mouth for relieving anxiety, improving mood, reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and treating attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is also used for promoting lean muscle growth, burning fat, stabilizing blood pressure, and relieving pain. GABA is used under the tongue for increasing the sense of well-being, relieving injuries, improving exercise tolerance, decreasing body fat, and increasing lean body weight. "}
