Then you'll appreciate this one! I always try to avoid cleaning products with long lists of nasty chemical compounds, many of which are known to be hazardous to our health and well being. I've had it with all the false advertising and marketing that tries to manipulate me into believing that we need a whole cupboard full of different cleaning sprays, creams, liquids and powders full of harsh, toxic, chemical compounds in order to have a clean, healthy home. Really? Nonsense. More and more people are rediscovering the simple truth that our homes can be cleaned top to bottom with just a few natural, non-toxic ingredients like white vinegar, baking soda, lemon juice, borax and essential oils. Most of these ingredients are easy to get, super cheap, and YES, THEY REALLY WORK! If you're like me, you'd rather be inhaling something healthy and beneficial for your body and the environment every time you clean instead of ammonia and other harsh chemicals. Ever think about what's left behind on your kitchen countertops and other surfaces you, your family, friends and pets come into contact with after you've cleaned that could be absorbed through your skin or ingested? If you've answered yes to any of the above, and are ready to make a change, here's a great, all purpose, natural household cleaner recipe I've created at [Buhbli Organics](https://www.facebook.com/buhbliorganics/?fref=mentions) that I think you'll truly love and appreciate. It's simple, easy to prepare, affordable, totally non-toxic and really works well on just about everything including glass, windows, countertops, stovetops, bathrooms, you name it! Plus, you get the uplifting, therapeutic benefits of organic essential oils of lavender, lemon and orange every time you use it. Enjoy and celebrate the positive difference you're making!
