The plant has existed since 270 million years ago, and it has been cultivated in China since 2600 BC. In other words, it has existed before the Ice Age. Some Gingko trees even survived the atomic blast at Hiroshima in 1945. A single ginkgo tree can live as long as 1,000 years and grow to a height of 120 feet. It has short branches with fan-shaped leaves and produces inedible stinky fruits (that contain edible inner seeds). In many Eastern cultures, the Gingko tree is considered to be a sacred tree as it is seen as a symbol of resilience, health and longevity. Ginkgo Seed is an excellent herbal supplement and source of antioxidants, and it is famous for its effects on conditions related to poor memory such as dementia caused by poor circulation. Due to its numerous health benefits, the Chinese have been using Ginkgo seeds for many decades for both culinary and medicinal purposes. In [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/traditional-chinese-medicine/)), Ginkgo Seeds belong to the category of 'Herbs that stabilize and bind'. Such herbs are used for treating abnormal discharges and displacement of organs, which include conditions such as diarrhea, discharges from the vagina, penis or rectum. However, these herbs can only treat symptoms. They should not be used to treat any underlying deficiency. Neutral in nature, Ginkgo Seeds do not really affect the yin-yang balance in your body. With a bitter and sweet taste, Ginkgo Seeds tend to have a cleansing action on the body by clearing Heat, drying Dampness, and promoting elimination via urination or bowel movements. It also tends to slow down acute reactions and detoxify the body. Ginkgo Seeds also replenish our qi and blood, which has a tonic effect on the body. As interpreted from the taste, Ginkgo Seeds target the Lungs, which are thought to be a key part of the production chain for qi and the body fluids.

Today, they are used to treat more lung and throat-related conditions such as [strep throat](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/respiratory-health/strep-throat-symptoms/) and [lymphoma](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/energy-and-immunity/swollen-lymph-nodes/). Ginkgo Seed can stop coughing and expel phlegm. This herb can tackle Dampness in our body to regulate phlegm, so it is often used to treat phlegmatic dyspnea (shortness of breath) and cough.

This means that it may be applied towards the treatment of diseases related to poor circulation.
