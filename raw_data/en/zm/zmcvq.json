By paying close attention to the interactions of all the systems of the body as a whole, as well as the mind, spirit and emotions, we can improve physical health and wellness. Having optimal health is about the ability to balance all aspects of a person. Thus holistic medicine helps improve health by addressing the whole. Integrative medicine combines the best of western medicine with the best of the holistic, naturopathic approach. The term functional medicine is also used, which describes a new way of looking at healthcare. By looking at the whole person, and using alternative medicines like herbs, nutraceutical supplements, acupuncture and joint injections, integrative medicine specialists can improve outcomes beyond that which would be achieved with standard modern medicine alone. While an integrative practitioner may still diagnose a specific health-related problem similar to a traditional doctor, the treatment approach is usually much more comprehensive. Integrative medicine can help with a variety of health-related issues including both physical and psychological. Examples of Integrative Medicine Many people find integrative medicine beneficial for both emotional and physical pain. Conditions that can be improved with this type of treatment include chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, anxiety, generalized pain, aging and a wide variety of chronic diseases. Holistic medical treatments employed at our clinic can include treatments such as acupuncture, dietary supplements and dietary changes, herbal medicines, and IV therapy. Treatments will vary by the condition and the individual patient, and may be used in conjunction with modern medical approaches when needed. Chelation therapy removes heavy metals and harmful minerals from the body. With high levels of heavy metals, the body is at risk for poor cognition, kidney disease, heart disease and thyroid-related conditions. Chelation therapy is a highly effective treatment when used for lead poisoning or extracting harmful metals. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid is one medicine that can be effectively used in chelation treatment, administered via IV therapy. This substance latches onto heavy metals like lead and allows them to be removed from the body. Ozone therapy mixes the ozone molecule with your blood outside the body then reinfuses the blood back into your body. This is used to treat infections, autoimmune conditions and heart disease. The benefits of this therapy include stimulation of the immune system, as well as improving energy production, and stimulating the production of antioxidants. Integrative cancer treatment at Vitality Integrative Medicine adds evidence-based non-toxic and low-toxicity treatments for cancer. Treatments are chosen that a. fight cancer cells, b. may improve the efficacy of conventional medicine and treatment, and c. may decrease the risk of side effects. These treatments include oral supplements, off-label pharmaceuticals and IV therapies such as high dose vitamin C. Testosterone therapy helps those with low testosterone who may experience a change in mood, energy and physical well-being. A skilled practitioner can help men who suffer from low testosterone so they can regain sex drive and energy while reducing the risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Prolozone injections can help reduce pain in the musculoskeletal system. The injected molecule used is made from oxygen and called \"ozone\". With combined nutrients, prolozone is added to help regenerate the area so that pain and inflammation can be minimized. Knee injuries, muscle tendonitis, neuromas and arthritis can all be treated with this specific type of injection. For those who are looking to treat the entire body, integrative medicine incorporates not just physical well-being, but spiritual and emotional health as well. From acupuncture and IV vitamins to hormonal therapy, there are many different treatments to consider. Balancing all aspects of the mind, body and soul has been a time-tested way of healing throughout a lifetime. "}
