Come and get it!\" -Dr. Michelle Brannick, ND, DC \"I came to you with pain, acute fatigue, extreme levels of acid indigestion, unable to sleep... My regular GI doctor put me on Prilosec 2 years ago and wanted me to continue taking it even though the acid just got worse... six days after starting your treatment plan all the pain was gone and I was sleeping again!... I can't thank you enough. You're a miracle worker!\" M.Z. \"A few years ago I discovered I had arthritis. I started having a difficult time with everyday activities, even getting out of bed was a huge struggle... I was given 4 different types of medication, along with weekly injections... My arthritis continued to progress and I felt that I would be this way forever...I am so grateful to the doctors at Brannick Clinic for giving me my youth and ability to jump out of bed back to me. They have helped change me from a sad, negative person to a happy and positive one. \" A.F. Our Services \"I like Dr. Brannick because she stopped my allergies. I don't sneeze anymore. I can go outside and play in the summer and I can play with dogs and cats and not sneeze and I don't get a running nose! \" C.C. age 9 \"I feel really good and I'm completely off the drugs. I have no gout symptoms and I've actually started jogging, something that was completely unthinkable just a few months ago. Plus, I'm 62 and in your 60s, especially for men, it's kind of unusual to build muscle mass, but I've noticed I actually lift more weight, about 25% more, than ever before. "}
