Patients can visit [beaumont.org/savemyshot](/covid-vaccine) to add their name to the \"Save My Shot\" list. A free myBeaumontChart account is required. Previously, Beaumont used a randomized process to invite patients who met the state's vaccination criteria and had a [myBeaumontChart](/my-beaumont-chart). However, now that more vaccine is available in numerous locations, health system leaders are able to transition to an opt-in waiting list program. Effective immediately: anyone who wants to get vaccinated at Beaumont must have a myBeaumontChart account and add his or her name to the \" [Save My Shot](/covid-vaccine)\" list. Beaumont will follow the state guidelines on prioritizing patients for the vaccine and will send email invites in the order in which people registered, as supply allows. \"We are so proud to have administered more than 170,000 doses of the vaccine so far. We are ready and willing to do more if additional vaccine doses become available to us,\" Beaumont Health Chief Operating Office Carolyn Wilson said. \"So many people have asked us if we would start a waiting list. We hope this new process will be welcomed by our patients and families.\" Beaumont will continue to open appointments on a weekly basis based upon how many doses the health system receives from the state. Anyone age 16 or older can complete the form on Beaumont's website to be added to the waiting list. For patients age 16 or 17, the government has only approved the Pfizer vaccine. Beaumont will only be able to accommodate 16 and 17-year-old patients at the [Beaumont Service Center](https://www.beaumont.org/locations/beaumont-service-center) in Southfield or the [Beaumont Hospital, Troy](https://www.beaumont.org/locations/beaumont-hospital-troy) vaccine clinic. State and federal guidelines change regularly. When patients meet the state and federal guidelines, and Beaumont has vaccine available, they will be invited to schedule an appointment in the order in which they registered. "}
