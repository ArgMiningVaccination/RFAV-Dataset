She's working on a grant-funded research project about corrective feedback in teaching English writing, and is being mentored by associate professor Ehren Pflugfelder. She's been sitting in on his graduate seminar on contemporary rhetoric theory, and joins us from Chengdu, where she teaches in the School of Foreign Languages at the Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. I asked Sandy about her experience in Corvallis so far, and wanted to share some of her thoughts in her own words: \"This is my first visit to the U.S., and SWLF has given me the warmest welcome I can ever imagine. Everybody is super nice to me, which is awesome. I got the opportunity of visiting some classes that I'm interested in, and have been constantly impressed by the amiability and erudition of teachers, the enthusiasm and preoccupation of students, and the vivacity of the classrooms. The campus is such an attraction, too. I enjoy spending a day in the library and taking casual pictures when I walk on campus. The environment is gorgeous and the spring here is divine. This is going to be a great experience. Even if there are still 8 months for me to stay, I already can imagine how I'm going to miss this place when I go back.\" Yes, they will leave us eventually to return to their home countries, but, for now, Pawe and Sandy are still here, and everything is the better for it.
