Your heart will be healthier if you get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night. Sleep reduces stress levels: The increase in stress hormones increases the level of inflammation in your body, which creates a greater risk for heart-related conditions, as well as cancer and diabetes. Sleep reduces inflammation: Light exposure reduces melatonin levels, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin is thought to protect against cancer, as it appears to suppress the growth of tumors. Sleep improves your memory: Lack of sleep often leads to memory problems with facts, faces, lessons, or even conversations. Sleeping well eliminates these difficulties because, as you sleep, your brain is busy organizing and correlating memories. One of the great benefits of sleep is that it allows your brain to better process new experiences and knowledge, increasing your understanding and retention.

Avoid Caffeine, Alcohol, Nicotine, and Chemicals that Interfere with Sleep: All coffee lover knows caffeine is a stimulant that can keep you awake. So avoid caffeine for 4 to 6 hours before bedtime. Similarly, smokers should stay away from using tobacco products too close to bedtime. Go to Sleep When You are really Tired: Struggling to fall asleep just leads to frustration. If you're not asleep even after 20 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room, and do something relaxing, like reading or listening to music until you are tired enough to sleep. Create Comfortable sleep inducing environment: A quiet, dark, and cool environment can help promote sound sleep. Use heavy curtains, blackout shades, or an eye mask to block light. Keep the temperature of your room comfortably cool. Keeping computers, TVs, and work materials out of the room will strengthen the mental association between your bedroom and sleep. Your mattress and pillow can contribute to better sleep. If you share your bed, make sure there's enough room for two. If you have children or pets, try to set limits on how often they sleep with you. Try to go to sleep and get up at the same time every day: This helps set your body's internal clock and optimize the quality of your sleep.
