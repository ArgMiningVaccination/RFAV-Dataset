EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report , commissioned by the Division of Public Health (DPH), details the results of an assessment of the health needs of residents of the state of Delaware. The Delaware Public Health Institute (DPHI), a private, non -profit public health organization , conducted the needs assessment from April to November 2016 to identif y local and statewide trends for the identification and prioritization of strategies that address critical health needs. Specifically, this report will assist in the revision of Delaware's State Health Improvement Plan ( DE SHIP) . The DE SHIP was c reated to provide an ongoing, systematic, coordinated, quality improvement process in the state. To accomplish this goal, the DE SHIP utilizes a collaborative planning process bolstered by a strategic planning framework that incorporates the perspectives of stakeholders , resources, accountability, structure, and direction. The nationally recognized Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) process, developed by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, was selected t o guide the initiative. METHODS Data were collected through a series of four assessments in accordance with the MAPP framework. The four MAPP assessments and their sources are as follows: The Forces of Change Assessment collected information on the exter nal factors, trends, and events that affect the health of Delaware residents and Delaware's public health system. The sources of information analyzed for this assessment include a brainstorming activity at a semi -annual event (April 2016) and a follow - up o nline survey of 40 SHIP coalition members. The Local Public Health System Assessment collected information on the components, activities, competencies, and capacities of Delaware's public health system as well as how essential public health services are b eing provided in communities throughout the state. The sources of information analyzed for this assessment include key informant telephone interviews with 16 leaders in the community. The Community Themes and Strengths Assessment collected information on community issues and concerns, and perceptions about quality of life. The sources of information analyzed for this assessment include t wo community meetings in northern and southern Delaware of 24 residents and public service professionals. The Com munity Health Status Assessment compiled information on current health status in Delaware based on specific, evidence -based measures. The data sources compiled for this assessment include DPHI's Community Health Data Base, 2015 Delaware Household Health Survey; Nemours' 2014 Delaware Survey of Children's Health (DSCH); the 2010 -2014 American Community Survey; and Delaware vital statistics on births and deaths (2009 -2013) . State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Data in this report are presented at the state and county levels, as well as seven smaller areas of analysis. These seven regions are based on key demographic differences that shape health outcomes that are more accurately understood at the local level. In addition, national benchmarks (ex. Healthy People 2020) for critical health measures for comparison are included whenever possible. For region definitions, see Appendix A . KEY FINDINGS All results were compiled and analyzed collectively to paint a complete picture of Delaware's health. This comprehensive process yielded the following four top -level priority areas of focus: 1. CHRONIC DISEASE , specifically, heart disease, diabetes, and asthma 2. MATERNAL AND CHILD H EALTH , specifically: teen pregnancy, premature births, and low birth weight 3. SUBSTANCE USE/MISUSE , specifically: the opioid epidemic, accidental overdose, and smoking /e-cigarette use 4. MENTAL HEALTH , specifically: mental health diagnoses (especially in youth), suicide/suicidal ideations, and impact of trauma. See Section IX of this report for detailed key findings and supportive analys is. RECOMMENDATIONS The following recommendations are based on an analysis and extraction of key aspects of the data and subsequent strategic planning of the ship revision committee. Policy - system - environmental approach to all goals Use a \"health in all policies\" approach. Use a social marketing approach. Address social determinants of health. 1. CHRONIC DISEASE Given the scope of the problem, chronic disease needs to be addressed on a statewide scale. However, the mode of intervention can be targeted at the community level based on the risk factors specific to those populations. Adults in Dover and the Surrounding Area, and the Remainder of Sussex County should explore targeted interventions around healthy diet, and specifically, sugar -sweetened beverage consumption, to reduce high rates of diabetes and obesity. Increasing access to recreational spaces in Kent and Sussex counties for physical activity is a recommended focus to reduce chronic disease in these areas. Residents in Center City Wilmington, specifically youth, could benefit from more safe havens to run and play through the enhancement of existing outdoor spaces. Reduce obesity to reduce heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes by promoting healthy diet and exercise. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Reduce lung disease - asthma, lung cancer, and Chronic Obstructive Pulm onary Disorder (C OPD ). Increase access to healthy foods to reduce h eart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Improve the built environment to promote walking, biking, etc. Increase access to community health workers and care coordination to improve chronic disease outcomes. Promote access to remote patient monitoring for patients with chronic conditions. Increase focused effort s to make \"the healthy choice the easy choice.\" o Review existing policies (multi -level) -Sugar sweetened beverage tax, policies, and agriculture subsidies. o DPH should review language in contracts to push culture , such as all contracts requiring vendors to provide healthy eating options. Increase access to dental care by increasing the number of Medicaid dental providers Increase access to primary care by increasing the number of primary care physicians. 2. MATERNAL AND CHILD HE ALTH Efforts to address maternal and child health concerns should be targeted to teens and adolescents in Center City Wilmington, as well as Dover and the Surrounding Area, and the Remainder of Sussex Co unty to the west of the Beaches region. Education and cost of care are recommended areas of focus in Center City Wilmington and Dove r and the Surrounding Area; the Remainder of Sussex County would benefit from increased access to preventive services. Embed education in school settings for girls and boys for preconc eption and interconception care by: o Influencing school boards, the Department of Education, and others that create curriculum for middle and high schools. o Including p arenting as part of health education in schools. o Adopting g raduated levels for education in schools . 3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS A statewide effort is nee ded to address substance use disorder . Specifically, increasing substance use disorder treatment programs and resources should be a priority in all areas of the state. Prescription monitoring and proper disposal of unused prescription medications could be an area of interest in Sussex County , given widespread prescription drug coverage and overdose rates, particularly in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches region. New Castle and Kent Counties could benefit from a focus on early detection and supportive resources for persons State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 struggling with addiction and their loved ones, given the high rate of adults with a current substance use disorder having a household/family history of addiction. Reduce tobacco and tobacco substitute use. Reduce substance use. o Implement statewide p ublic media campaign to address substance use stigma. o Work with Healthy Neighborhoods to incorporate community -based solutions to substance use, particularly the opioid epidemic. o Provide u niversal education for any practitioners in the field around identification of substance use disorder and trauma -informed care. 4. MENTAL HEAL TH High rates of suicide and suicidal/self -harm thoughts exist with low rates of mental health diagnoses across the state. This is a testament to the need for improved mental health screening, detection, and early intervention in order to identify the risk factors for suicide and reduce violent death rates . Trauma across the lifespan, including violence, is a key influence on emotional health and well -being that can be targeted based on the community profile. For example, homicide and the collapse of the family unit should be explored further in the City of Wilmington as it relates to mental health, while victims of abuse and neglect should be a priority in the Dover and the Surrounding Area . Exposure to volatile household environments is a key issue in the Remainder of Kent County. Improve access to behavioral/mental health services. o Provide every school with a trained mental health provider (i.e . behavioral health consultants etc.) o Increase pay for mental health providers to alleviate shortages. o Expand access to mental health services by increasing number of mental health providers. See Section IX of this report for detailed conclusions and recommendations. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 II. INTRODUCTION PURPOSE The 2017 State Health Needs Assessment (SHNA) summarize s the results of an assessment of the health status and unmet health care needs of Delaware residents . The purpose of the needs assessment is to identify and prioritize community health needs so the state can develop strategies and implementation plans that benefit the public , and assist in revising Delaware's State Health Improvement Plan ( DE SHIP) . The Delaware Public Health Institute (DPHI) , a private non -profit public health agency , conducted the needs assessment . This Introduction includes : The SHIP process and framework A description of the previous health assessment A definition of the c ommunity assessed in the report. SHIP PROCESS AND FRA MEWORK The goal of Delaware's first State Health Improvement Plan (DE SHIP) was to provide an ongoing, systematic, coordinated, quality improvement process in the state . To accomplish this goal, the DE SHIP utilizes a collaborative planning process bolstered by a strategic plan ning framework that incorporates the perspectives, re sources, accountability, structure and direction of the process. The nationally recognized Mobilizing for Action throug h Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) process , developed by the National Association of County and City Health Officials , was selected to gu ide the initiative (Figure 1) . Inherent in the MAPP process is the integra l role of state stakeholders in conceptualizing the plan and selecting it s action goals. The MAPP framework divides the health improvement pro cess into six phases which align with d eliverables for the Delaware SHIP (Table 1). Each phase builds on the information gathered in the previous phases . The three steps of Plan, Implement, and Evaluate can be performed repeatedly in a continuous quality improvement model. The mission of the Delaware SHIP is to continually address core health issues in the state of Delaware through a collaborative network of stakeholders dedicated to shared visions for the improvement of population health.

Action Cycle Source: National Association of County & City Health Officials and the Delaware Public Health Institute . State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 PREVIOUS HEALTH ASSESSMENT The process of developing the first statewide SHIP began in 2011 -2012 . The process was to assess the health status of Delawareans in a systematic, o rganized, and collaborative manner and increase coordination and communication across organizational silos, while addressing core issues identified for action by the community . DPH contracted with APS Healthcare to provide services that included data col lection and analysis, report preparation, materials development, gr oup facilitation, and planning . DPH invited the participation and input of stakeholders with a wide range of health -related expertise and from each of the three Delaware counties . Stakeh older input was gathered through meetings and periodically through online surveys, and was captured in the S HIP vision statement and in a series of three assessments . The assessments integrated information from stakeholder perceptions and multiple outside sources on health and quality of life in Delaware; risky behaviors and assets of healthy communities; key health indicators; and external factors and events that contribute to the health of Delawareans. Existing data sets were used from diverse sources su ch as the Delaware Health Statistics Center, the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Sur vey (BRFSS) . Together, this information provided qualitative and quantitative data that served as the basis for identifying strategic issues and, ultimately, to two goals to focus the first -round action plan: To ens ure an infrastructure necessary to increase the adoption of healt hy eating and a ctive living To improve access to mental health and substance abuse services and supports, including prevention, early intervention, and treatment, for all Delawareans. The SHIP Coalition made progress in key areas during the implement ation of the strateg ic action plans . The action plans meet a set of prioritized nee ds identified in the 2012 report . (For details, visi t the SHIP resources webpage at www.delawarephi.org ). These prioritized needs are: Sustain able chronic disease prevention Health resource availability Educatio n and health workforce training Mental and behavioral health supports Colla boration across multiple health care sectors . This current Delaware health assessment builds upon these previously identified needs and priorities using more recent data from many of the same aforeme ntioned sources and additional local and statewide sources . Planning for the n ext round of SHIP bega n in early 2017, using these f indings to revise goals and strategies . State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 COMMUNITY DEFINITION Delaware includes all communities withi n New Cas tle, Kent, and Sussex counties . Specific region s are highlighted and titled based on their unique demographic profiles . Within New Castle County: o Center City Wilmington o Remain ing G reater Wilmington Area o Remain ing New Castle County. Within Kent County: o Dover and the Surrounding Area o Remain ing Kent County. Within Sussex County: o Northeast and Southeast Beaches (coastal communities) o Remaining Sussex County. The s even new ZIP Code -based regions are residential areas within the counties . Four ZIP Code s (19938, 19950, 19963 and 19977) cross county borders in a non -trivial manner (i.e . not over 99 % of the population resides in one county according to the U.S. Census) . Therefore, each of tho se four ZIP Code s appears in the definition of two ZIP Code -based regions . Survey respondents and birth and death certificate cases within these ZIP Code s were assigned a region based on county of residence. Delaware Region ZIP Code Definition Center City Wilmington /Wilmington City 19801, 19802, 19805, 2017 . The community for purposes of this needs assessment is defined as the residents of the three -county state of Delaware (Pop. 917,060). State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 III. OVERVIEW OF ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND METHOD OLOGY A community or state health improvement plan is critical for developing policies and defining actions to t arget efforts that promote health. To ensure the goals and strategies within the plan are aligned with the ever -changing health landscape in our state and our communities, an assessment and revision plan was developed and approved by the SHIP subcommittee in May 2015. These plans detail a continual, long -term, systematic effort to address public health problems on the basis of a state health assessment and a state health improvement process. Consistent with the three -year timeline, Phase s 1 and 2 began in early 2016, when 15 coalition members began discussing a new vision of health for Delaware . Following the completion of a visioning questionnaire, brainstorming exercise , and follow -up discussion, the group devised a draft vision statement that reflected common values which was shared with the entire coalition for additional comments and feedback. The new SHIP vision statement was finalized in April 2016 , and serves as an instrumental component of the planning, strategizing , and implementation of the revised SHIP. During Phase 3 of the MAPP process , DPHI focused efforts on the assessment process which consisted of five steps: 1. Defining the community 2. Identifying existing primary and secondary data and data needs 3. Collecting primary and secondary data 4. Analyzi ng data 5. Preparing a written narrative report. DPHI conducted four assessments from April to November 2016, obtaining both primary and secondary and quantitative and qualitative data in accordance with the MAPP framework . The results, analyzed and combined for this report , are: 1. The Forces of Change Assessment 2. Local Public Health System Assessment 3. Community Themes and Strengths Assessment 4. Community Health Status Assessment Obtaining information from multiple sources, known as triangulation, helps provide context for information and allows researchers to identify results which are consistent across more than one data source. See Appendix K for a more detailed description of assessment methodology. VISION STATEMENT \"An integrated culture of health in which holistic wellness is collectively valued, promoted, and prioritized across sectors, systems, and services in a manner that fosters equitable opportunities for health for all Delawareans, leading to improved health outcomes.\" State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 IV. MAPP ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Forces of Change Assessment The Forces of Change Assessment identifies the external factors, trends, and events that affect the health of Dela ware residents and the Delaware public health system . In this assessment, seven categories of forces - economic, environmental, ethical, legal/ political, scientific, social, and te chnological - were examined to comprehensively answer th e following questions: (1) What is occurring or might occur that affects the health of our community or the local public health system? (2) What specific threats and/or opportunities are generated by these occurrences? Forty stakeholders consisting of SHIP coalition and community members identified eight categories of forces that influence Delaware's health system and community health . Each participant was asked to indicate their top three forces from the original list of 27 . Table 2 deta ils the forces deemed the most influential a nd prominent forces in Delaware . See Appendix L for a more detailed description of these findings. Sections IV through VII include qualitative and quantitative data findings collected for four individual MAPP assessments. However, based on limitations associated with drawing conclusions from any singular source of information, data from all sources should be looked at comprehensively to ensure implications are based on a complete understanding of the needs.

MAPP ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Local Public Health System Assessment The local public health system refers to all organizations and entities within the community that contribute to the public's health . The Lo cal Public Health System A ssessment answers two questions: (1) What are the components, activities, competencies, and capacities of our local public health system ? (2) How are essential public health services being provided in our community? The assessment instrument asks Key Inf ormants to measure their awareness on a scale of one to five , of how well the loc al public health system is achieving a set of 10 essential standards . Sixteen Key Informants were recruited to respond to the assessment instrument in a structured telephone interview . (See Appendix I for the Key Informant Interview Instrument .) Key Infor mants were recruited from Delaware public health officials, health care providers, health systems, behavioral health providers, funders, and advocacy organizations . Each interview conducted in September, 2016 lasted between 30 and 45 minutes . (Appendix H ) Information from the interviews was analyzed for similarities and differences in each optimal standards area, and mean scores were calcul ated for each of the 10 essential standards rated by the Key Informants. Figure 2 shows the organizational affilia tion of the 16 Key Informants . All but one of the Key Informants represented agencies tha t provided state wide services. The most common organizational affiliation was nonprofit, with m ore than one -third (36 %) of Key Informant representation. This was closely followed by health care providers (29 %). Health care administrators (7%) were the least common.

Organizational Affiliation of Key Informants, Delaware, 2016State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT RESULTS OVERALL P ERFORMANCE How aware overall are Key Informants of the 10 Essential Public Health Services (EPHS)? Table 3 shows the cumulative and mean score s that the 16 Key Informants gave to each of the 10 EPHSs . Each e ssential service was scored on a scale of one to f ive, with \"1\" being \"not at all aware \" and \"5\" being \"very aware \" (Table 3). Table 3. Awareness Scoring for the Ten Essential Public Health Services , Delaware, 2016 Total Score Mean Score 1 Monitor Health Status to Identify Community Health Problems 55 3.9 2 Diagnose and Investigate Health Problems and Health Hazards 53 3.8 3 Inform, Educate, and Empower People about Health Issues 56 4.0 4 Mobilize Community Partnerships to Identify and Solve Health Problems 53 3.8 5 Develop Policies and Plans that Support Individual and Community Health Efforts 51 3.6 6 Enforce Laws and Regulations that Protect Health and Ensure Safety 48 3.4 7 Link People to Needed Per sonal Health Services and Ensure the Provision of Health care when Otherwise Unavailable 56 4.0 8 Ensure a Competent Public and Personal Health care Workforce 48 3.7 9 Evaluate Effectiveness, Accessibility, and Quality of Personal and Population -Based Health Services 53 3.8 10 Research for New Insights and Innovative Solutions to Health Problems 48 3.4 Source: DPHI Local Public Health System Assessment, 2016 Each EPHS score is a composite value determined by the scores giv en to that activity by the 16 Key Informants . These scores range from a minimum value of 48 to a maximum of 56. The mean scores for each of the 10 EPHSs represent the average score given to each EPHS by the Key Informants . These mean scores range from 3.4 to 4.0, on a scale of one to five. Overall, Key Informants were most aware that the Delaware' s public health system conducted activities that inform, educate, and empower people about health issues (56, mean 4.0) , as well as the public health system 's work to link people to needed personal health s ervices and to ensure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable (56, mean 4.0) . Key Informants were least aware about the public health system 's work in three areas: 1. Enforcing laws and regulations that protect hea lth and ensure safety (48, 3.4) 2. Ensuring a competent public and personal health care workforce (48, 3.7) 3. Researc hing new insights and innovative soluti ons to health problems 48 (3.4) . State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES Essential Public Health Service #1: Monitor Health Status to Identify and Solve Community Health Problems. Source: DPHI Key Informant Interviews, 2016 The majority of Key Informants (50%) scored their awareness of public health monitoring activities as a \"4\" on a scale of one to five, with \"5\" being the highest level of awareness, and \"1\" being the lowest. What works well at the state and local level to monitor h ealth status? One of the 16 Key Informants pointed out that Delaware is a small state, which makes thoro ugh community health assessments much more manageable. Another felt that there are many invested players and organizations across the state that help inform the health monitoring work of the public health system. Two Key Informants mentioned that there a re strong communication networks among organizations, and that this communication ability is used to create networks of key people and services that can work together to monitor health status. In addition, health care providers in the state have access to many statewide data sets that can be used for health monitoring, such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) , the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS ), Kids Count, the Adult Tobacco Survey, the Delaware Public Institute Household Health Su rvey, the County Health Rankings, and the Delaware Health Tracker. These data can be compiled to identify benchmarks across time and at single points in time both statewide and locally, which is very helpful in public health monitoring and assessment. He alth screenings for infectious diseases and environmental hazards also work well for monitoring public health status. 01475029 0% 10% Informants' Awareness of the Public Health System's Ability to Monitor Health Status, Delaware, 2016 *Key Informants scored their awareness of public health monitoring activities on a scale of one to five, with \"5\" being the highest level of awareness, and \"1\" being the lowest. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 What are gaps or areas for improvement? Although Delaware is a small state, one Key Informant remarked that integrating the different s ources of information that are used for monitoring health status is not done well. In addition, another Key Informant reported that technology and information systems are not advanced sufficiently to monitor progress and identify any longitudinal improvem ents. A third Key Informant found it difficult to monitor needs at the local levels of geography due to lower population densities, particularly in Sussex County. \"While Delaware is small, we don't do a good job of integrating the different sources of information or data that come from the various organizations.\" What is the primary reason these gaps are not filled?

All of the Key Informants who answered this question reported that DPH does an excellent job in tracking communicable diseases, maintaining registries, and investigating foodborne illnesses and major illness e pidemics. The state notification system works well in collaborating with the state laboratory. Once the problem is identified, the state addresses it in a comprehens ive fashion across populations. What are gaps or areas for improvement? Although one Key Informant found no gaps or areas for improvement, other Key Informants found gaps or areas for improvement in the state's performance in investigating public health hazards. Two Key Informants remarked that a more centralized, comprehensive, and accessibl e resource listing and point of care testing are needed. Another Key Informant reported that many primary care physicians are not aware of local trends in infectious diseases, the existing resources, their duty to report, and the required standard of care .

Several Key Informants commented that there is now more cooperation among the health care systems, the State health department, and its varying divisions than previous ly. The state health system encourages different entities to work together, creating more collaboration and teamwork. The state also creates more partnerships with educational faith -based non -profits and community groups. This helps to do a better job o f disseminating information on services those groups can provide. Particular methods of communicating with the public that are working well are web -based resources, social media, and billboards. State services are very visible throughout Delaware. \"The s tate services are very active throughout the state. They are in the schools. They are in the health care systems. They are visible.

Two Key Informants felt that the official state website has such a vast array of services that it is difficult to navigate, and that the website content could be more personalized to help the consumer or advocate navigate more easily to services they need. In addition, one Key Informant felt that there was not enough consumer buy -in to create empowerment, and another reported that the State needs to do a better job of empowering citizens through information sharing by meeting people where they live, work, and play, perhaps t hrough employ ers.

What works well at the state and local level to mobilize community partnerships to iden tify and solve health problems? Two Key Informants mentioned that t he State Innovation Model (SIM) health improvement grant process has led to more engagement to mobilize community partnerships to solve health problems, especially at the local level, where the state is able to pull many focused partnerships together. \"The Division of Public Health is good at bringing people together, and they have to because the resources are limited. They bring them in early in the process of making the plans for the intervention. This creates buy in.

State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 What are gaps or areas for improvement? According to five Key Informants, there are several specific areas for improvement in mobilizing community partnerships to identify and solve health problems. First, stakeholders must put aside their own priorities in order to develop a streamlined approach to recognizing and solving health problems. The social determinants of health should be included in any collaborative approach to solving health problems. The state must develop an infrastructure to ensure that these partnerships are sustainable. Another Key Informant felt that the ability to show results is key to obtaining funding to continue in mobilizing more community partnerships.

Fourteen percent rated their awareness as a four, and 21% rated it as a three. What works well at the state and local level to de velop policies and plans that support individual and c ommunity health efforts? Five Key Informants felt that the Department of Health and Social Services Secretary, legislative body, elected officials, and state health leaders in Delaware are very accessib le, sensitive, and quick to act on issues that public health providers and advocates feel are important. This works well at both the state and local levels to develop plans that support community health efforts. Because Delaware is a small state, there i s a lot of opportunity for state health leaders and officials to communicate on health planning and resolve problems quickly. Also, one Key Informant remarked that Delaware has strong advocates in the state legislature for underserved populations and issues that impact access to care. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 What are gaps or areas for improvement? One Key Informant remarked that there is room for improvement in systemic health planning that relies on appropriate data, develops and tracks measurable health objectives, and establishes strategies and actions to guide community health improvement. Anot her Key Informant recommended more public meetings and informational sessions to help the public understand the Health and Social Services Department policy and statewide health efforts. Another felt that the state should encourage more collaboration betw een people who are policy and program officials and direct service workers to better support policies and programs that work in practice.

What are gaps or areas for improvement? Three Key Informants felt that there is insufficient education or support to help the community accept safety laws and regulations. The Key Informants believe t here is uncertainty regarding who enforces the law, and the Division of Public Health does not see it as their responsibility to police what they legislate, except for sanitation and nutrition. In addition, there should be more funding for dissemination to the p ublic, and a single resource that lists the regulations related to public health and who enforces them.

In particular, raising public awareness of services and increasing partnership between the public, private, and voluntary sectors were each mentioned by a Key Informant. According to one Key Informant , care coordinators in hospitals have been working very well with state leaders, state programs, discharge planners, social workers, and emergency departments.

Several Key Informants felt that progress could still be made in coordinating efforts between providers of mental health, physical health, and substance abuse services. \"While there is a significant effort to be more inclusive and have more parity in he alth care, the vast array of health issues that are being addressed require a constant need for reminders to include mental health and addiction in these c ollaborations and discussions.\" One Key Informant wrote that this is also an opportunity for the stat e to incentivize increasing the capacity of primary care providers to provide underserved populations with behavioral health services along with primary care.

Key Informants agreed that there is a significant amount of attention being paid toward developing the heal th care workforce in Delaw are. The state has identified this as a priority and has reached out to community organizations to determine how they can work together to ensure that education and continuing education are available. However, one Key Informant remarked that there is reco gnition that there are challenges to recruiting physicians, in particular. Although the State Innovation Model ( SIM) grant has been helpful in increasing the public health workforce, health c are institutions are the drivers behind recruitment, a ccording t o one Key Informant. One area that needs improvement is the supply of psychiatrists and licensed clinical social workers. This Key Informant felt that the absence of a medical school in Delaware is a challenge, and that hospitals and behavioral health pro viders should enhance residency training programs and affiliate with major medical schools in neighboring states, such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey , and Maryland, to draw more interns and of the Public Health System's Ability to Ensure a Competent Workforce, Delaware, 2016 *Key Informants scored their awareness of the public health system's ability to ensure a competent workforce on a scale of one to five, with \"5\" being the highest level of awareness, and \"1\" being the lowest.State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 What are gaps or areas for improvement? Gaps and ar eas for improvement include training of acute care hospital staff beyond the minimum that is required, because it is so expensive to send staff out of the hospital during working hours.

According to four Key Informants, the state does a fantastic job in evaluating its programs, particularly with diabetes, cancer, and tobacco control. Evaluations are written into all statewide grants. The state also reaches out to stakehold ers to participate in planning. What are gaps or areas for improvement? Although Key Informants felt that the state does good evaluations of its programs, a statewide structure to guide evaluation quality is lacking. In addition, there is no aggregation of data across the state, and there are many different data collection systems and few common data sets. Two Key Informants commented that Delaware needs to get more public partici pation in evaluations to get a robust picture, and then to share the outcomes with the community consistently.

Another Key Informant felt that DPH was n ot doing enough research. What are gaps or areas for improvement? Gaps in researching innovative public health solutions include a lack of funding to do pilot programs and a lack of political will to make changes or rethink what is already being done. Ano ther area for improvement is the lack of rigor in the research, which may be due to the fact that there is no direct connection to a large university or research institution. 1414211436 0% 10% 20% 30% 40%12345Awareness of the Public Health System's Ability to Research Innovative Solutions to Health Problems, Delaware, 2016 *Key Informant s scored their awareness of the public health system's ability to research innovative solutions to health problems on a scale of one to five, with \"5\" being the highest level of awareness, and \"1\" being the lowest.

MAPP ASSESSMENT FINDINGS Community Themes and Strengths Assessment The Community Themes and Strengths Ass essment (CTSA) addresses three questions: (1) \"What is important to o ur community?\" (2) \"How is quality of l ife perceived in our community?\" (3) \"What assets do we have that can be use d to improve community health? \" This assessment results in a strong understanding of community issues and concerns, perceptions about quality of life, and a map of community assets . (See Appendix J for the Community Meeting Facilitator Guide .) NORTHERN DELAWARE MEETING On October 27 , 2016, DPHI staff conducted a community meeting of northern Delaware residents and pr ofessionals . The meeting was conducted in -person at the Bear -Glasgow Family YMCA. The meeting summary follows. MOST PREVALENT HEALT H CONDITIONS Poverty, lack of education, substance abuse, physical inactivity, and unhealthy eating are the most prominent health problems impacting residents a cross n orthern De laware . Many of these issues were mentioned consistently throughout the discussion outlined in this section . QUALITY OF LIFE Participants were asked to gauge the quality of life in t heir communities, as well as any related community char acteristics . The majority of the participants ra ted overall quality of life in n orthern Delaware to be \"average ,\" noting this is highly dependent on where someone lives in the region . One participant stated , \"[New Castle County] has some of the richest people [in the stat e] and some of the poorest people . Distribution of resources s hould be considerate of that.\" A positive aspect of living in n orthern Delaware is the abundance of available resources , as compared to Kent and Sussex counties . However, participants cite a lack of alignment, cohesiveness, and collaboration that is contributing to the ineffective allocation and util ization of these resources. \"I don't know what [resources] are out there, and I don't know what I can get to.\" State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Economic opportunity has been im pacted across the boa rd. \"Chrysler pulled out . Banks are consolidating . Every move from any one major company can have a tremendous effect because it is such a small state.\" Job opportunities, especially those with competitive salaries and good benefits, are scarce . Those that put effort into their education are out of options once they enter the workforce . Howe ver, there are areas where people are finding this to be less of an issue: \"The level of access to quality employment does vary by geog raphic location in this region and across the state.\" Child care costs have risen considerably and welfare requirements have changed, forcing parents into minimum wage jobs with negative repercussions . Working mothers are only living on a few hundred doll ars a month at their low -paying jo bs after child care costs . Child care systems are now at the front line of shaping our children's lives, and children are not bei ng supervised in the same way. \"We took the motherhood out of the kids.\" Overall, participan ts felt that the level of opportunity for individuals and groups to achieve a good quality of life differs by community . \"If health is of value to your community that dictates what is available... such as events, programs, organized runs, etc.\" In New Castl e County, phy sical health is valued and resources are accessible , with the exception of are as in Center C ity Wilmington , noted one participant. Residents of Center C ity Wilmington , single mothers, and the disabled are considered especially vul nerable, havi ng the lowest rated opportunity for good quality of life in the region, according to participants. \"We are not creating programs that meet these people where they are, offering things they want to use . Something as simple as changing the name of an event to something more appealing to that culture, population group, or community can change how many people come.\" Participants were asked to discuss their opinions on the health care system in n orthern Delaware . The majority of participants said resources are available to them, but they are unaware of the true scope of these resources. Henrietta Johnson Medical Center is still trying to reach people decades later: \"We have people that live right next door to us and still don't know we are there.\" Participants felt m oney is not always the biggest barrier to acces sing services . They way Henrietta Johnson offers many of their services for free, but not enough people are aware of this . \"It boils down to education.. . the resources are everywhere and they are more than enough but the question is, are people using them?\" State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Despite new coverage for millions under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), participants cite that cost is still an issue . \"It is over the roof ,\" stated one participant. \"The co -pay to have a cr own put on in the U.S . is more expensive than the cost of the entire procedure in another country ,\" they explained . Participants cited the need for an emphasis on prevention . Residents are not com fortable with using new preven tive services, and providers are not being reimbursed to perform extra prevention steps during patient visits . \"Obamacare was supposed to get people to use primary care physicians more often, but instead it has pushed people to emergency departments...So, we [physicians] aren't ther e when our patients need us. Educating people about what is available and making them feel comfortable to utilize the servic es is necessary going forward.\" Participants noted primary gaps in health care exist in both mental/behavioral health and dent al care: \"We need more resources to address mental and emotional health . It will save a lot of burden down the road to focus on early intervention.\" \"Dental referrals and services are unsatisfactory, as well as the ability to pay for them . There are no programs out there for people who don't have insurance.\" Even when the programs do exist, they often do not ha ve the funding to provide care. Participants at the community meeting discussed the pros a nd cons of raising children in northern Delaware . Unanimously, the public school system is the leading 'con' to raising children in this region . Many participants who were born and raised in Delaware considered movin g to Pennsylvania solely for its schoo l systems . \"The big elephant in the room is that the public school system in Delaware is not giving children a competitive advantage . Your only option is charter, parochi al, or private schools... or mov e to Pennsylvania . People are making that decision in utero .\" One participant referred back to a policy change years ago that allowed s outhern Delaware to pull out of the real estate multiple listin g system (MLS) which adversely and disproportionately affected the school systems in New Castle County . The 'pros' to raising children in this region include: the close proximity to the University of Delaware campus for fun family activities; school programs that address important issues such as domestic violence; and the ability to expose families to a wide varie ty of experiences in one place. \"It's a good pla ce to raise a family; you can customize your experience, if you will . It is more family -nurturing than ot her surrounding environments.\" State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Delaware is also considered a great place to grow old, according to participants: \"Delaware is a great place to age in place . My network is actually 10 years older than me but they are so much fun . I actually look to the 55+ to see what they are doing and if I can join . They are having a blast.\" \"We have good programs in place . The state provides a lot of good progra mming from nursing homes to assisted living to just supporting individuals living in their homes.\" Despite a larger visual presence and new appreciation of older adults in Delaware, participants feel there are still gaps in culture and awareness of resour ces. One participant stated, \"There is no responsibility on the kids to take care of the parents, compared to other cultures.\" They feel m ore discussion needs to center around how we can engage p eople and make this important to their families as well . Many older adults move to Delaware to retire and do not have family nearby to help them age in place . Participants believe t hese individuals are not aware of all the programs and resources available to them that can still provide them with this option . The majority of participants perceive safety as an issue no matter where one lives . One participant stated, \"Safety now is just a different animal . I think as a nation we all have to agree that we don't feel safe . Our kids are going through lock -down d rills. Workplaces are being put through active shooter training . It's a reality . And, I think we are making the link, and that link is mental health.\" \"The media makes a big difference . You never hear anything good anymore . Maybe that kind of thing s ells, but it creates a level of uneasiness ,\" said another . Another noted that social media is sometimes the only way to get information when incidents are \"swept under the rug \" for economic reasons . To this end, it is important to consider that without social media platforms decades ago, it is impossible to compare the prevalence of violence in the media now versus then . Another topic emerged regarding the idea of muted sensitivity . One participant stated: \"If something happens at the mall, we care because we go to the mall . Every day there is a shooting in Wilmington, but we hear about it so much that it doesn't even sell anymore . We don't even stop to think what it really means . There is a mut ed sensitivity here... but all of the violence is still affecting the psyche and it's coming out in a different way and that is why we are seeing so many mental health issues.\" State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Overall, participants agree d that residents in n orthern Delaware and across th e country are more aware of issues of violence and safety due to increased exposure via text alerts, social media, and television . They say perpetual awareness has made them more careful about things . \"It has changed our trust.\" Participants discussed su pport networks in the region for those under stress . Engagement emerged as a fundamental factor in accessing networks available to residents . \"Engagement and education are important . There could be things that exist , but if you aren't aware they are out there it will not matter.\" If an individual is a part of a group , such as a religious church/parish or community organization, they are considered surrounded by support through virtue of that group . Therefore, someone who is more isolated is not going to have the sam e support during times of need. Vulnerable populations with limited access to supportive networks include the L esbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning (LGB TQ) community; and minors. One participant stated, \"LGBTQ, Latinos, and immigrant groups are small but they are there and it is hard to find resources for them . It is also hard to find other groups to partner with to create those types of resources and sup portive environments as well.\" \"I think there are [resources] that are there for those 30 and older . For young people, they don't know how to access the help, and because they are a minor the system is set up in such a way that they have to go through an adult to do it . They are extremely vulnerable,\" said another. IMPROVING OUTCOMES Residents' perceived importance of making their comm unity a better place varies by ZIP Code , according to participants at the community meeting . \"The value of appearance is more suburban culture . As long as things look great on the outside, there is no focus on what goes on when the garage door closes and the front door shuts . On the other hand, parents that live in urban communities are not worrying about what is being built where and if it will disturb the appearance of the community . Instead, the best thing they can do with the resources they have is pull their children inside and keep them safe . This impacts levels of physical activity, as well a s interpersonal rela tionships.\" State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 The majority of participants agreed that the most important factors for achieving and maintaining a healthy community are community safety, strong collaborative efforts, and bi-directional communication between professionals and the community . \"We need to really listen to what the community says they need instead of telling them what they need . Transparency is key to keeping the community involved along the way.\" The importance of community empowerment, an organized infrastructure, and cultural competency beyond ethnicity , were also noted . \"Nothing is more frustrating than trying to help someone and not knowing how to ,\" stated one meeting participant when stressing the need for a culturally compe tent work -force. Consensus emerged thro ughout the meeting around the idea of forming organized resource centers and networks that can : mobilize community organizations , build stronger families , and provide consistent support . \"We need linkages . We need an understanding of how funding works and what the funding provides access for . We are not teaching sustainability . Until we teach people and the community to sustain programs themselves, and meet them where they are, we cannot create or maintain change.\" SOUTHERN DELAWARE MEETING On October 28, 2016, DPHI staff conducted a community meeting of southern Delaware residents and pr ofessionals . The meeting was conducted in -person at the Eden Hill Medical Center in Dover, D elaware . The meeting summary follows. MOST PREVALENT HEALTH C ONDITIONS According to community m eeting participants, the most prevalent health conditions impacting resident s across southern Delaware are d iabetes, obesity, mental health conditions , and substance abuse . The majority of participants indicated that smok ing cigarettes and other forms of tobacco use (e .g. vapin g) is a growing problem across southern Delaware . Several meeting participants noted that teen pregna ncy is also a growing concern. Many participants mentioned that mental health services are not ava ilable to many children and young a dults across southern Delaware. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 The majority of participants, however, mentioned that southern Delaware has many basic resources for older adults but more attention has to be placed on issues related to multigenerational families and the needs of caregivers . As stated by community meeting participants: \"Obesity . Biggest challenge is lack of walkability or bike -ability . Kent County is really dependent on car transportation , and I think that contributes to a lot of what the others already said.\" \"Tobacco is big . I see more use of vape and chew . Many (homeless population) are [smoking] 1.5-2 packs a day.\" \"The services for young children in mental health are almost nonexistent in Kent County . Those providers that can do it have such long waiting lists. Again, I am a fa mily nurse practitioner and I see children as young as age six . There ar e not enough providers, nurse practitioner s, psychologist s, or psychiatrists that will see children . The ones that will have very high payments and it just doesn't meet the need s of children in Kent County at all.\" Some participants noted that preven tive services are not readily available to help residents identify health needs . As stated by one community meeting participant: \"Preventive services are needed to keep people upst ream from participating in high -risk behaviors. \"Access to services and care [is needed] for everyone . Access to care can be a barrier for anyone . [Even] private insurance clients cannot access certain care . Or those with public insurance or no insurance can't access other types of care . There are a lot of public type initiatives, but those with private insurance do not have the ability to pay the copay for those . \" Many community meeting participants noted that substance use and abuse is a growing problem across southern Delaware . In fact, participants noted that h eroin use has greatly increased over the past several years . Community meeting participants also noted that a better drug surveillance system for tracking prescription drug use and abuse would help to understand the substance abuse problem and to identify ways to address the issue . As noted by community meeting participants: \"If we had a better surveillance system, then we would have a better understanding of what is happening and that would be helpful.\" State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 \"Guidelines for Prescription Monitoring Program: prescri bers must report narcotics [prescribed in the ] past 7 days, but some are not recorded ( i.e. those getting prescriptions from a clinic) . That does a disservice to the prescribers because we don't know if people are in treatment for substance abuse unless they tell us . \" BARRIERS TO CARE Community meeting participants discussed barriers to care for residents of southern Delaware . Participants noted that many barriers to care across southern Delaware are believed to be related to the social determina nts of health and access to health care . The majority of parti cipants mentioned that to create healthy communities , it is important to address the whole person . As sta ted by one meeting participant: \"Social determinant s of health account for more of our health than medical services . When we think about the public health system, most people don't think of those things (affordable housing, economic growth) . When we think about a healthy community, all of those things co ntribute to health . These are fundamental things that will sustain health over time.\" Overall, c ommunit y meeting participants stated that they thought southern Delaware was worse off than surrounding areas . Participants mentioned that it is very difficult for southern Dela ware residents to obtain a full -time job with benefits at a livable wage . It was thought that southern Delaware needs to enhance its existing workforce development programs to encourage re sidents to stay in the area . As stated by community meeting participants: \"The job market in Kent County is a big problem . There are a lot of retail stores, m inimum wage jobs, and lots of part time jobs with no benefits . This along with high rent is not good . \" \"Even if the jobs were there, do our people get an adequate skills set for the business community? If we are not producing a competent workforce in our public education system or colleges, they won't come in economically based on the workforce . We are not creating a workforce . If we are not producing the individuals, those businesses won't come in . This is statewide . There is a serious issue with in Wilmington, Su ssex County, and Dover . \" State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 QUALITY OF LIFE The majority of participants thought that the quality of life in southern Delaware was just average . It was also noted that for many southern Delaware residents , the current health system does not meet the needs of many residents . Overall, c ommunity mee ting participants noted that there is a lack of accessibility to health care across southern Delaware and there is a lack of health education or knowledge about what is available . As stated by community meeting participants: \"We have some really great prog rams here in Kent and Delaware . Kudos to Westside, they do a great job of being a medical home for people . But when it comes to mental health services, substance abuse, and transition of care, there is more we could be doing . As a clinician , I know ho spital systems are trying their best to navigate and not have readmission s for certain types of [diagnoses] . However , we have a lot of room for growth to meet population goals.\" \"Accessibility and lack of information ... We have misinformation on what's available . People go to the ER for a cold and that involves mega bucks for something that could have been handled elsewhere. \" \"For peop le without insurance, they can go to urgent care . It's not really a misuse of the system; it's the only system they have.\" It was mentioned that the ACA is a mixed bag when it comes to providing care to residents in southern Delaware , and that there is room for improvement in the current health care system . Some participants noted that there is a shortage of phy sicians, dentists , and mental health providers . It was also noted that there is a sho rtage of providers who accept medical assistance and that some people cannot pay high annual deductibles for care . Some of these people are leaving southern Delaware to obtain their care and traveling to Philadelphia . As stated by several community meeting participants: \"It's a mixed bag . If you're low income you can get on Medicaid or a hefty subsidy and get a good policy . If you have a higher income or are undocumented , it's not helpful at all . If you're of average income, unless your employer pays your insurance, the co -pays and deductibles are so high it's not of much value unless you really get sick . It's a safety net policy. \" State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 \"I'm not an all or one p erson when it comes to the Affordable Care Act . There are good benefits, but room for improvement . To give an example, one patient of mine was on Medicaid, but when the ACA came out, being a single mom making less than $30,000 a year, she was made to pay for ACA coverage . And then could not afford the monthly premium . That's the doughnut hole, like with Medicare . So, yes, it's great, but there is a group of patients that are not receiving insurance . They would rather pay the tax penalty, than pay the monthly premium.\" Many community meeting participants mentioned that a strong formal education system is thought to be la cking in southern Delaware in general , and young adults are believed to be not ready for college . \"Kids will graduate high school with a pretty good GPA, but then go to Del Tech and have to take remedial classes . There is some disconnect because high schools say they are a B student, but when they go to college they are not ready.\" Participants mentioned that better communication an d collaboration among organizations is needed to build a stronger infrastructure across southern Delaware and to use scar ce resources in a more targeted and effective way . As stated by several community meeting pa rticipants: \"I don't think we can give eno ugh accolades to the strength of collaboration . We need to start rising above the negatives and collaborating [on] our strengths . \" State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 VII.

State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY The health of a community can be assessed by comparing birth outcomes, self -reported healt h status and health conditions, communicable disease rates, self -reported health concerns and perceptions, and mortality rates to statewide indicators and Healthy People 2020 goals for the nation. This section examines (2009 -2013) birth, (2009 -2013) mort ality, and (2009 -2013) morbidity data from the Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center for Delaware's three counties and the seven smaller regions within these counties. (Appendix D.) BIRTH OUTCOMES Birth outcomes include low birth weight, premature birth, and infant mortality. They are an important measure of the health of the baby, the amount and quality of prenatal care, and the health of the mother. Fertility rates, in particular among adolescents, are associated with health ou tcomes of the child and mother. FERTILITY RATES In 2013, there are 11,096 births to women ages 15 -44 living in Delaware ( Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center , 2013). The general fertility rate fo r 2013 is 62 per 1,000 women age 15 -44. The five -year general fertility rate in Sussex County (72 per 1,000 women age 15 - 44) is the highest fertility rate among Delaware women. Conversely, the New Castle County five -year general fertility rate (58.5 per 1,000 women age 15 -44) is lowest among the three counties, but represents the highest number of births among the counties (6,653). Among the smaller assessment areas, the Remainder of Sussex County has the highest five -year general fertility rate (79 per 1 ,000 women age 15 -44) followed by Center City Wilmington (77 per 1,000 women age 15 -44) and the Remainder of Kent County (69 per 1,000 women age 15 -44). The Remainder of New Castle County has the lowest five -year general fertility rate (52 per 1,000 women age 15 -44) followed by the Northeast and Southeast Beaches (57.5 per 1,000 women age 15 -44), and the Remainder of Greater Wilmington Area (60 per 1,000 women age 15 -44). State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Infants born to teenagers have been associated with a number of negative birth outcomes, including prematurity and low birth weight, making it an important outcome to track. Source: Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center, 2009 -2013. The five-year general fertility rate for women ages 15 -17 living in Delaware is 14 per 1,000 women. The lowest five -year general fertility rate for adolescent women in Delaware's three counties is in New Castle County (13.5 per 1,000 women age 15 -17). Among t he smaller assessment areas, Center City Wilmington has the highest five - year general fertility rates for adolescent women (40 per 1,000 women age 15 -17). This is followed by the Remainder of Sussex County (21 per 1,000 women age 15 - 17), where the fertili ty rate is nearly half of the rate observed in Center City Wilmington. The Remainder of Greater Wilmington Area has the lowest five -year general fertility rate for women age 15 -17 (7 per 1,000 women). 40 7918 13 1221 14 051015202530354045 Wilmington BeachesSussex RemainderDERate per 1,000 WomenFigure 26.

State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 LOW BIRTHWEIGHT Low birth weight infants (<2,500 gram s or 5 lb., 8 oz.) are at greater risk of dying within the first year of life than infants of normal birth weight. In Delaware, the five -year average percentage of low birth weight is 8.5% ( Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center , 2009 -2013). This rate does not meet the Healthy People 2020 target goal (7.8 %). New Castle County has the highest five -year average percentage of low birth weight births (9%). Among the small assessment areas, Center C ity Wilmington has the highest five - year average percentage of low birth -weight births (12%), followed by Dover and the Surrounding Area (9%). The lowest five -year average percentage of low birth weight births among the smaller assessment areas is in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area (7%). PREMATURE BIRTHS From 2009 -2013 in Delaware, the five -year average percentage of premature births (gest ational age < 37 weeks) is 14% .1 This does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 11.4% premature births. New Castle County has a slightly higher five -year average percentage of premature births (15% of all live births) than either Kent (13% of all live births) or Sussex (12% of all live births) counties. Among the small assessment areas, the highest five -year average percentage of premature births is seen in Center City Wilmington (19% of all live births), followed by the Remainder of New Castle County (14% of all live births). The Northeast and Southeast Beaches area has the lowest five -year average rate of pr emature birth among the smaller assessment areas (9% of all live births), followed by the Remainder of Greater Wilmington Area (12% of all live births). 1 Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center, 2009 - 2013.

Delaware (40 per 100,000 population) also does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goals for stroke of 35 per 100,000 population. Other categorizations of Cause o f Death in Delaware include (excluding cancer type) : accidental drug overdose (13 per 100,000 population ); suicide (12 per 100,000 population ); motor vehicle crashes (12 per 100,000 population ); homicide ( six per 100,000 population); and HIV/AIDS ( four per 100,000 population) (Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center, 2009 -2013). New Castle, Kent, and Sussex Counties Among Delaware's three counties, Kent County has the highest five -year age -adjust ed mortality rate of deaths from all causes (806 per 100,000 population), and Sussex County has the lowest (718 per 100,000 population).1 The five -year age -adjusted mortality rate of deaths from all causes in New Castle County (746 per 100,000 population) is lower than the rate for Kent County (806 per 100,000 population). Five-year age -adjusted mortality rates for specific causes across the state's three counties tend to be highest in Kent County, followed by New Castle County. Sussex County generally has the lowest cause -specific mortality rates in the state. None of the three counties meets the Healthy People 2020 goals for mortality rates for coronary heart disease (103 per 100,000 population) and suicide (10 per 100,000 population).

Health Status* of Adults 18+ by County, Delaware, 2015The overwhelming majority of adults in the state of Delaware describe their health as excellent, very good, or good. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 The percentage of adults in Delaware's three counties in excellent, very good, or good health varies from a low of 77% (Kent County) to a high of 86% (New Castle County) (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) . Within the three counties, Kent County (23%) has the highest percentage of adults in fair or poor health. This represents ~32,400 adults. o Kent County (77%) does not meet the Healthy People 202 0 goal for health status (79.8% in excellent, very good, or good health). New Castle County (14%; representing ~60,800 adults) has the lowest percentage of adults in fair or poor health. Adults living in Dover and the Surrounding Area (24%) are more likely to be in fair or poor health than adults in Delaware as a whole (17 %), or in any of the other six smaller Delaware assessment areas . The adults living in the R emainder of the Greater Wilmington Area (9%) are least likely to be in fair or poor health.1 Children's Health Status In Delaware, the overwhelming majority of children (96 %, 95% CI : 94.8, 97.2) are in excellent, very good, or good health (Nemours' Delaware S urvey of Children's Health, 2014).2 (Appendix F.) However, 4%, (95% CI : 2.8, 5.2 ) of children are in fair or poor health. o Kent County (3%) has the smallest percentage of children in fair or poor health, followed by New Castle and Sussex counties (both 4%). o In the City of Wilmington, 3% of children are in fair or poor health. In compa rison, 4% of children in New Castle County excluding Wilmington are in fair or poor health. Throughout the state, one in nine children (11%, 95% CI : 8.5-12.9) age 0 -17 has a chronic medical, behavioral, or other health condition. New Castle County excludi ng the City of Wilmington (12%) has the highest percentage of children with a chronic condition. Three other areas have a slightly lower percentage (10% percent): Kent and Sussex counties and the City of Wilmington (Nemours' Delaware Survey of Children's Health, 2014).3 1 DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015. 2 Nemour s, Delawa re Survey of Children's Health . Accessed 10/26/2017. 3 DSCH, 2014 . State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 SPECIFIC HEALTH CONDITIONS The following section examines selected chronic health conditions, and selected mental and behavioral health conditions that require ongoing care and management. Examples of chronic health conditions include hig h blood pressure, diabetes, and asthma. Examples of chronic mental and behavioral health conditions include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders , and addictive behaviors (Mayo Clinic, 2017).1 Hypertension More than 360,000 Americ an deaths in 2013 included high blood pressure as a primary or contributing cause (CDC, 2017).2 That represents approximately 1,000 deaths each day . High blood pressure increases the risk of dangerous health conditions, including: First heart attack First stroke Chronic heart failure Kidney disease. One of every three U.S. adults (29 % or 75 million adults) has high blood pressure.3 According to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 35 % of adults in Delaware have been told they have high blood pressure by a doctor, nurse or other health professional (Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 2015).4 DPHI's Delaware Household Health Survey (2015) found 33% (95% CI : 30.5-35.0) of adults in Delaware have high blood pressure, which is close to BRFSS. To better understand how Delaware compares to the age -adjusted Healthy People 2020 goal, DPHI produced an age -adjusted rate5 which showed 29% (95% CI : 26.4-30.7 of adults in Delaware with high blood pressure. This percentage does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 26.9% . Adults in Kent County (31%) are slightly more likely to have high blood pressure than adults in Sussex (30%) or New Castle (27.5%) counties (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). 1 Mayo Clinic.

State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Among the small assessment areas in the state, adults in the Remainder of Sussex County and Center City Wilmington have the highest percentage (both 33%) of adults with high blood pressure , representing ~39,400 and ~31,800 adults, respectively (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) . These percentages do not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 26.9%. Dover and the Surrounding Area and Remaining Kent County (b oth 31%), and the Northe ast and Southeast Beaches (27%) also do not meet this goal (26.9%). Among Delaware adults with high blood pressure, nearly one in five, or 19% (95% CI : 15.6- 22.3), do not take their ribed blood pressure medication , represen ting ~44,600 adults.1 One -in-five adults with high blood pressure in New Castle County (20%) do not take their blood p ressure medication. They are the least likely to take their blood pressure medication among adults in all three counties. Nearly one -quarter of adults with high blood pressure in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area and the Remainder of the Greater Wilmington Area (24% for both) are least likely to take their blood pressure medication, compared to individuals with hypertension in the other smaller assessment areas. o In contrast, adults in Dover and the Surrounding Area and the Remainder of Sussex County (13.5%) are least likely to not take their high blood pressure medication. In addition, 10 % (95% CI : 7.8-12.8) of Delaware adults were told that their blood pressure is not under control at their most recent appointment. Kent County adults (13%) are more likely to have uncontrolled high blood pressure than adults in the other two counties (both 9%). Across the small assessment area s, adults in the Remainder of Kent County (14%) are most likely not to have their blood pressure under control; adults in the Remainder of the Greater Wilmington Area (6%) are most likely to have their blood pressure under control. 1 DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Heart Disease About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year - this represents one in every four deaths (CDC, 2017).1 Nationally, heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. More than one -half of the deaths due to heart di sease in 2009 were among men. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About one -half of Americans (47%) have at least one of these three risk factors. Other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can increase the risk of heart disease, including: Diabetes Overweight and obesity Poor diet Physical inactivity Excessive alcohol use ( CDC , 2017) .2 In Delaware, one in 10 adults (10%, 95% CI : 8.4-11.1) has been diagnosed with heart disease. This represents ~70,200 adults (Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). Within the small assessment regions, Dover and the Surrounding Area and the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area have the highest percentage of adults with heart disease (both 14%). The Remainder o f New Castle County has the lowest rate of heart disease (7%).

Other complications of diabetes may include increased suscep tibility to other diseases, loss of mobility with aging, depression, and pregnancy problems (NIDDK , 2017).1 Thirteen percent [95% CI : 11.8-15.0) of Delaware adults have been diagnosed with diabetes ( DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). This stati stic is very close to what the BRFSS reported (12%) in 2015 ( Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Behavioral Risk Factor Surv eillance System (BFRSS), 2015). Both of these sources indicate Delaware has a higher percentage than the U.S. as a whole (9.3 %) (CDC, 2014 ).2 Kent County (17%; representing ~23,800 adults) has the highest percentage of persons with diabet es among the three Delaware counties, followed by Sussex (14%) and New Castle counties (12%). Dover and the Surrounding Area (18%) has the highest percentage of adult s with diabet es among the seven small assessment areas, followed by the Remainder of Kent and Remainder of Sussex counties (both 16%), and Center City Wilmington (15%). Asthma In adults, asthma is a chronic condition that often leads to missed days from work and, in extreme cases, death. Ongoing monitoring and treatment are critical, but many people with asthma do not follow treatment plans due to the cost of prescriptions or sid e effects of the medication (NHLBI , 2016).3 Adults According to the BRFSS, 14% of Delaware adults have been diagnosed with asthma.4 This statistic coincides with Household Health Survey5 data (14%, 95% CI : 12.3-15.7) and is nearly twice the percentage of adults with asthma in the U.S. (7.4 %) (CDC, 2016).6 Among Delaware 's three counties , Kent County (17%) has the highest percentage of 1 National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases. https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health - information/diabetes/causes .

Minimizin g the impact of sensory imp airm ents is therefore important (NCHS , 2016).1 Of 65 and older, 15%, 95% CI : 11.5-18.3) have difficulty hearing even with a hearing aid, and 11%, 95% CI : 8.1-13.9) have problems seeing with glasses (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). This represents ~24,300 older adults in the state with a hearing impairment and ~17,800 older adults with a visual impairment. New Castle County (12.5%) has the highest per centage of adults (65+) with a visual impairment in the state, followed by Sussex (10%) and Kent (8%) counties. Kent County (18%) also has the highest percentage of adults (65+) with a hearing impairment, and New Castle County has the lowest (12%).

These differences may be related to factors such as the economic structure of the population. 1 National Center for Health Statistics: Sensory Impairment in Americans Aged 70 and Over. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db31.pdf .

Visual impairments range from a high of 14% in both Center City Wilmington and the Remainder of the Greater Wilmington Area, to a low of 6% in the Remainder of Kent County. Hearing impairments ran ge from a low of 5% in the Remainder of New Castle County to a high of 25% in the Remainder of Sussex County. In the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area in Sussex County, the percentage of adults with a hearing impairment (9%) or vision impairment (7%) is much lower than the Remainder of Sussex County, where 25% of adults are hearing impaire d and 13% are visually impaired (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). 15259211451915 11137610101414 0 10 20 30 40DESussex RemainderDover and Surrounding AreaNCC RemainderGWA RemainderWilmington City Percent Vision Impairment Hearing Impairment 1Respondent has difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses. 2Respondent has difficulty hearing, even when wearing a hearing aid. *See region definitions in Appendix A.Figure 37.

It affects how people think, feel, and act . It also helps determine how a person handle s stress, relate s to others, and make s choices . Good m ental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood an d adolesce nce through adulth ood. Behavioral health promotes well- being by preventing , or intervening , in mental illness such as depression or anxiety. It also aims to preven t and intervene in substance use disorders and other addictions (MentalHealth.gov , 2017 ).1 STRESS High levels of stress are known to negat ively affect physical health. Over time, continued strain on the body from routine stress may lead to serious health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety di sorder, and other illnesses (NIMH, 2017 ).2 The majo rity of adult Delawareans (54%) did not report a high level of stress in the past year (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). However, 46%, 95% CI : 43.5-48.4) were highly stressed in the past 12 months. This r epresents ~328,300 adults.3 Adults in Kent County (51%) had the highest stress levels among residents of the three counties, followed by New Castle (46%) and Sussex (42%) counties. Across the small assessment areas, the percentage of adults with high stress levels ranged from a low of 34% in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area to a high of 52% in the Remainder of Kent County. 1 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Mental Health. https://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics/what -is-mental -health/index.html .

State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 MENTAL ILLNESS The mentally ill are defined as individuals with a mental health disorder with serious functional impairment which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities. This does not include substance use disorders ( NIMH, 201 5).1 Data from the Delaware Household Health Survey on mental health conditions were gathered by asking the following questions: (Have you/has he/has she) ever been diagnosed with any mental health condition, including clinical depression, anxiety disorder , or bipolar disorder? (Are you/is he/is she) currently receiving treatment for this mental health condition? What is the primary reason (you are/he i s/ she is) not receiving treatment for this mental health condition? Overall, 17% (95% CI : 15.2-18.9) of Delaware adults have been diagnosed with a mental health condition, representing ~123,300 adults (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). Nati onally, an estimated one in five U.S. adults (18.5% ) have a mental illness in a given year (NIMH , 201 5).2 Adults in Kent County (21%) are more likely to have been diagnosed with a mental illness than adults in New Castle County (17%). o Adults in Sussex County have the lowest rate of mental illness (13%), representing ~21,800 adults. Center City Wilmington and the Remainder of Kent County (both 22%) have the highest percentage of adults diagnosed with a mental illness among the small assessment areas. o The Northeast and Southeast Beaches area (10.5%) has the lowest percentage of mentally ill adults, one -half the percentage in Center City Wilmington and the Remainder of Kent County (both 22%). Of the 17% of Delawareans diagnosed with mental illness, more tha n one -third (37%, 95% CI: 31.7-43.5), representing ~46,000 adults) are not currently receiving treatment for their condition.3 The primary reason given by a majority of adults diagnosed with mental illness for not receiving treatment (50.5%) is that the y perceive the condition to no longer be a problem, or they believe that treatment is not necessary (Figure 38). 1 National Institute of Ment al Health: Any Mental Illness (AMI) a mong U.S. Adults among U.S. Adults, 2015. 3 DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015.

Sussex County (42%) has the highest percentage of adults currently not receiving treatment for their mental illness across the three counties in the state, and New Castle County the lowest (36%) (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). Sussex County (58%) has the highest percentage of those who believe that treatment is not neces sary, compared to 47% of adults in New Castle County. Among the small assessment areas in the state, the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area and the Remainder of the Greater Wilmington Area have the highest percentage of adults with mental illness who are currently not receiving treatment (both 45%). The Remainder of New Castle County (31%) has the lowest percentage of adults currently not receiving treatment. Center City Wilmington has the lowest percentage of adults who do not believe they need treatment (38%), compared to the Remaining Greater Wilmington Area, which has the highest percentage (65%) who do not believe treatment is necessary.1 1 DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015. 3740454035314539 1715112220161422 0 20 40 60 80DESussex RemainderDover and Surrounding AreaNCC RemainderGWA RemainderWilmington City Percent Diagnosed with mental health condition Not receiving treatment 1EVER diagnosed with any mental health condition, including clinical depression, anxiety disorder or bipolar disorder. 2Of those diagnosed with a mental health condition, CURRENTLY [not] receiving treatment. *See region definitions in Appendix A.Figure 38.

In addition, p eople who suffer from addiction to drugs or alcohol often have one or more accompanying medical issues, which may include lung or cardiovascular disease, stroke, canc er, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B and C, and mental health disorders (NIDA, 2017 ).1 Data from the Delaware Household Health Survey on substance use disorders were gathered by asking the following questions: Have you ever been told by a peer, a friend, or a loved one that you HAVE or HAD a substance abuse problem? (This includes alcohol or any other drug.) Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you HAVE or HAD a substance abuse problem? (This includes alcohol or any other drug.) Are y ou currently, or have you ever , received any form of treatment for this substance abuse problem? (This includes counseling, therapy, inpatient/outpatient rehabilitation programs, etc.) What is the primary reason you are not in, or did not seek , treatment? One in 10 Delawareans (10 %, 95% CI : 9.0-12.1) has had a substance use problem at some time in their life. This represents ~75,300 adults (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). The percentage of adults who have ever had a substance use problem v aries slightly across Delaware's three counties: Kent (12%), New Castle (11%), and Sussex County (8%). Across the small assessment areas, the percentage of adults who have had a substance use problem ranges from a low of 6% in the Remaining Greater Wilmin gton Area, to a high of 15% in Center City Wilmington. Of Delawareans who have ever had a substance use problem (10%), 43% (95% CI : 35.4- 51.2) report that they have not ever received treatment.2 Of the 43% that have not received treatment, slightly more than half ( 55%) believe that they do not need treatment or do not think they have a problem. 1 National Institute on Drug Abuse: Addiction and Health. https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs - .

Each category is further divided into multiple subcategories . The ACE score, a total sum of the different categories of ACEs reported by participants, is used to assess cumulative childhood stress . Study find ings repeatedly reveal a relationship between ACEs and negative health and well-being o utcomes across the life course. The greater the trauma experienced, the poorer the health outcome. As the number of ACEs increases , so does the risk of the following health problems, among others (Figure 40 ) (CDC, 2017 ).2 Figure 40 .

Nationally, one in eight adults (12.5%) have an ACEs score of four or more, while nearly two-thirds (63.9%) have experie nced one or more ACEs (CDC, 2017 ).1 Delaware Adults who have experienced four or more ACEs are slightly more common in Delaware than in the United States as a whole (DPHI Delaware Household Hea lth Survey, 2015) (CDC, 2017). A score of four or more ACEs indicates moderate to severe adverse childhood experiences. In Delaware, 13.4% (95% CI : 11.8-15.2) of adults (representing ~98,100 adults ) have experienced four or more ACEs, compared to 12.5% of adults nationally. Just over half (55%, 95% CI : 52.7-57.7) of adults (representing ~404,000 adults) have experienced one or more ACEs, compared to 63.9% of adults nationally. 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Kaiser ACE Study. https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/about.html . Accessed 10/26/2017. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 The 2015 ACEs scores for Delaware can be broken down into the three different ACEs components: 1. One -quarter (25%, 95% CI : 23.3-27.7) of Delawareans have experienced ' any type of abuse ' (verbal abuse or fear of harm and physical or sexual abuse). 2. Sixteen point five percent (95% CI : 14.7-18.5) have experienced ' any type of neglect ' (emotional or physical neglect or parents separated or divorced). 3. One -third (33%, 95% CI : 30.4-35.1) have experienced ' any type of household challenge ' (witness to physical domestic violence; live d with a person who abused drugs or alcohol; household member with a mental illness or suicidal thoughts; and household member went to prison). In addition to experiencing the ACEs events, 11% (95% CI : 9.5-12.7) of Delawareans were often , or very often , discriminated against based on race or ethnicity as a child, and 6% (95% CI : 4.6-7.1) were bullied all or most of the time by peers while growing up (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) .

State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 ACCESS AND BARRIERS TO CARE \"Too many Americans go without needed preventive care, often because of financial barriers. Even families with insurance may be deterred by co -payments and deductibles from getting cancer screenings, immunizations for their children and themselves, and well-baby check -ups that they need to keep their families healthy.\" (CDC, 2017) .1 ECONOMIC Cost is a substantial barrier to health care for many Delawareans. For example, one in 10 Delaware adults (10 %, 95% CI : 8.5-11.4), representing ~71,900 adults ) did not get needed health care in the past year due to the cost. This does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 4.2 % (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) . Within Delaware, adults in New Castle County (11 %) were more likely to forgo needed health care last year due to cost than adults in Kent and Sussex (both 9 %) counties. Among Delaware's small assessment areas, Center City Wilmington (14 %; representing ~12,100 adults) has the highest percentage of adults who did not seek care last year due to cos t, and the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area has the lowest (5 %), nearly one -third of the percentage in Center City Wilmington. o These results do not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 4.2 %. In addition, 14.5% (95% CI : 12.8-16.4) of Delawareans could not afford to fill a prescription in the past year due to cost. This does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 2.8 %.2 Among Delaware's three counties, adults in Sussex County (16 %) were most likely to forgo a needed prescription due to cost, followed by New Castle and Kent counties (both 14 %). Both Center City Wilmington and the Remainder of Sussex County (17 %) have the highest percentage among the small assessment areas of adults who did not fill a needed prescription in the pas t year due to cost. 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Preventive Health Care. https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommu nication/ToolsTemplates/EntertainmentEd/Tips/PreventiveHealth.html . Accessed 10/26/2017. 2 DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015. Healthy People 2020 Goals for Access to Care Reduce the proportion of individuals who are unable to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary medical care, dental care or prescription medicines to 9 % overall (4.2 % for medical care, 5 % for dental care and 2.8 % for prescription medications). Increase the proportion of the population with health insurance to 100 %. Increase the proportion of persons with a usual primary care provider to 83.9 %. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 o This represents ~14,900 adults in Center City Wilmington and 17,000 in the Remainder of Sussex County. o These results do not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 2.8 %. The cost of transportation, and other transportation problems, is also a barrier to care for many Delawareans. Nine percent (95% CI : 7.5-10.2) of adults in Delaware did not see a doctor in the past year d ue to transportation problems. This represents ne arly ~64,000 adults (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) . The same percentage of adults in New Castle County (9 %) experience transportation barriers to health care as in the state as a whole. Transportation is a slightly greater barrier to adults in Kent County (10 %), and less of a barrier to adults in Sussex County (7 %) than for adults statewide (9 %). Among the small assessment areas, adults in Center City Wilmington (16% , representing ~14,400 adults) and Dover and the Surrounding Area (15% , representing ~9,300 adults) are most likely to forgo a visit to a doctor's office due to transportation problems ,1 while adults in the Remainder of the Greater Wilmington Area (4%) are least likely. HEALTH INSURANCE STA TUS Health insurance makes a differe nce in whether , when , and where people get necessary medical care and, ultimately, h ow healthy people are. The following information on the uninsured are derived from The Henry J . Kaiser Family Foundation (2013 ). 2 Uninsured adults are far more likely th an those with insura nce to postpone or forgo health care altogether . The consequences can be severe, particularly when preventable conditions go undetected. Uninsured people are far more likely than those with insurance to report problems getting needed medical care. Rising health care costs have made health care less affordable over time, particularly for uninsured people . Uninsured people are less likely than those with coverage to receive timely preventive care . Silent health problems, such as hypertension and diabetes, often go undetec ted without routine check -ups. Uninsured patients are also less likely to receive necessary follow -up screenings after abnormal cancer tests. Consequently, uninsured patients have increased risk of being diagnosed in later stages of diseases, including cancer; and they have higher mortality rates than those with health insurance.3 1 DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015. 2 Kaiser Family Foundation: How Does Lack of Insurance Affect Access 3 Kaiser Family Foundation: How Does Lack of Insurance Affect Access State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Delaware While the overwhelming majori ty of adults ages 18 -64 in Delaware (92 %) have health insurance, a substantial number do not (Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 2015). Approximately 45,400 adults age s 18-64 do not have health insurance. This represents 8 % (95% CI : 6.7-9.8) of adults ages 18 -64 statewide (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). The primary reason given by nearly two in five adults for not having health insurance (38 %) is that the cos t is too high. The majority of insured Delaware adults' age s 18-64 (59 %) are insured through their place of work, school, or union.1 Other sources of health insurance coverage for insured adults age s 18-64 include: o Independently purchased without subsidies (48 %) o Medicaid (20 %) o CHAMPUS, TRICARE, or CHAMP -VA (6 %) o Some other association (29 %). Adults age s 65 and over who are insured through Medicare (34%) include: o Medicare A, that pays for hospitalization (94%) o Medicare B, that pays for physician visits (92%) o Medicare C, or Medicare Advantage, that covers co -pays and deductibles (12%) o o Medicare D, for medication (53.5%). Approximately 14% (95% CI: 12.2 - 15.7) of Delaware adults looked into purchasing insurance through the Healthcare Marketplace ( ChooseHealthDE .com ) since it opened in 2013. This represents ~37,700 adults.2Of those adults who looked into purchasing a plan through the Healthcare Marketplace, more than one -third (38%, 95% CI: 31.7 -45.1) enrolled in a plan and two -thirds In Kent, New Castle, and Sussex Counties , the percentage of uninsured adults ages 18 -64 varies slightly across Delaware's three counties, from a high of 11% in Sussex Coun ty to a low of 6% in Kent County. Eight percent of adults are uninsured in New Castle County (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) . The percentage of adults who cite cost as the primary reason for being uninsured ranges from a high of 47% in Sus sex County to a low of 34% in New Castle County. In Kent County, cost is the primary reason for 39% of adults. 1 Respondent(s) may have more than one source of insurance coverage. These percentages should not be interpreted as mutually exclusive (100 percent). 2 DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 The majority of adults ages 18 -64 in New Castle (62.5%) and Kent (58%) counties are insured through their work, school, or union. Fewer adult s in Sussex County (49%) are insured through these payers than in the other two counties.1 Other sources of insurance coverage include Medicare for those 65 and over. o The percentage of adults insured through Medicare Parts A, B, and C does not vary greatly across the state's three counties. o Coverage for Medicare Part D for medication varies from a high of 59% in New Castle County, followed by Kent (48%) and Sussex (47%) counties. Medicaid enrollment is highest in Kent County (24%), followed by New Castle (19%), and Sussex (18%) counties. New Castle County had the highest percentage (14.5%) of adults in Delaware who looked into purchasing health insurance through the Healthcare Marketplace (ChooseHealthDE.com ) since it opened in 2013. Kent County had the lowest (11%).2 Of those who looked into purchasing health insurance through the Healthcare Marketplace, Sussex County (47%) had the highest percentage of adults who enrolled in a plan. New Castle County enrolled 37%, and Kent County, 30%. Many Delawareans who looked into purchasing insurance through that website found it somewhat or very difficult to find an affordable plan, including: o Seventy -five percent in Sussex County o Sixty-four percent in New Castle Cou nty o Sixty-one point five percent in Kent County. Small Assessment Areas Among Delaware's small assessment areas, Center City Wilmington (13%, representing ~9,200 adults) has the highest percentage of uninsured adults ages 18 -64. This does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 0% uninsured.3 In comparison, Dover and the Surrounding Area (5%) have the lowest percentage of uninsured adults. 1 DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015. 2 DE HHS, 2015. 3 DE HHS, 2015.

High cost was the primary reason cited by the residents of most of the small assessment areas for not purchasing insurance (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) . More than two -thirds of adults in Dover and the Surrounding Area (68%) believed that the cost of insurance was too high, and a major ity in the Remainder of Sussex County (55%) cited the same reason. The primary reason for not purchasing insurance differed in the Remainder of Kent County and the Northeast and Southeast Beaches areas. In five of the seven small assessment areas, the maj ority of adults were insured through their work, school, or union.1 However, in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area, only 45% were insured through these payers. o Instead, 56% of residents of this area were insured through Medicare. Coverage through Medicare Part B was very similar across the seven small assessment areas, but participation in Medicare Parts C and D varied.2 Participation in Part C, or Medicare Advantage, ranged from a low of 7% in the Remainder of Kent County to a high of 21% in Cent er City Wilmington. 1 DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015. 2 DE HHS, 2015. 81210756713 0 5 10 15 20 25DESussex RemainderNE & SE RemainderDover and Surrounding Percent *See region definitions in Appendix A.Figure 44.

Adults 18+ who Ever Used the Healthcare Marketplace1by Small Assessment Area*, Delaware, 2015State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 PRIMARY CARE Having a regular source of primary care is important because people who have a regular source of care are more likely to seek care when they are sick , compared wi th those who do not (MLS, 2014 ).1 The Healthy People 2020 goal is for 83.9 % of adults to have a primary care provider for when they are sick or have a health question. In Delaware, 15 % (95% CI: 13.2-16.9) of adults age 18 and over do not have a regular source of primary care (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). This represents ~108,800 adults in the state, and meets the goal for Healthy People 2020 (16.1 %). Across Delaware's thre e counties, adults in Kent County (17 %) are least li kely to have a source of regular care. This does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal (16.1%) . o Adults in Sussex County (14 %, representing ~22,700 adults) are most likely to have a source of regular ca re. Across small assessment areas, adults in Dover and the Surrounding Area (20.5%) and Center City Wilmington (17%) are least likely to have a regular source of care compared to the other small regions and Delaware as a whole. Both of these areas do not m eet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 16.1%. o Adults in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches (12%) are the most likely to have a regular source of care.

Adults 18+ with No Regular Source of Care by Small Assessment Area*, Delaware, 2015State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Primary care settings can include private physician's offices, hospital clinics, Federally Qualified Health Centers and other free or low cost clinics, urgent care centers, retail clinics, and hospital emergency rooms. In Delaware, the overwhelming majori ty (82%) of survey respondents cite a private physician's office as their regular source of care (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). However, a ccording to the Primary Care Health Needs Assessment (2015)1, all of Kent and Sussex Counties and por tions of New Castle County are federally designated shortage areas for primary care, meaning they meet or exceed the federal definition of 3 ,500 to 1 ratio of persons per physician. Interestingly, while S ussex County (84 %) has the highest percentage of ad ults who report having a private physician as their regular source of care, they are two times more likely to cite primary care as the top service need in their region , compared to Kent and New Castle counties (5%, compared to 2% in Kent and New Castle).2 In Delaware's small assessment areas, the percentage of adults using a private physician's office for care varies more than across the counties, ranging from a high of 88% in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches (204 - 1,250 persons per PCP) area (204 -1,250 persons per PCP) to a low of 76% in Center City Wilmington (4,001 - 8,210 persons per PCP). 3 DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for developmental delays and disabilities during regu lar well -child doctor visits. Additional screening might be needed if a child is at high risk of developmental problems due to preterm birth, low birth weight , or other reasons. Many children with developmental delays are not being identified as early a s possible . As a result, these children must wait to get the help they need to do well in social and educational settings , including in school (CDC, 2017 ).4 In Delaware, more than one -quarter of adults (28.5%, 95% CI : 24.3-33.0) are not familiar with developmental screenings for children (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). 1 Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health: Delaware Primary Care Health Needs Assessment (2015). http://www.dhss.delaware.gov/dph/hsm/files/depchealthneedsassessment2015.pdf .

State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Adults in New Castle County (29.5%) are slightly less likely than Delawareans overall to be familiar with children's developmental screenings. Among the seven smaller area s in the state, adults in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area are most likely not to be familiar with developmental screenings, and adults in the Remainder of Sussex County are least likely not to be familiar with these screenings (45% versus 22%). Of Delawareans familiar with developmental screenings, one in nine (11%, 95% CI : 7.6- 14.9) have a child/children living in the household who did not receive a developmental screening. This represents ~16,300 children who could possibly have unidentified developmental delays (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) . Among Delaware's three counties, the percentage of children who did not receive a screening is very similar to Delaware as a whole, except that only 8% of children in Sussex County did not r eceive a developmental screening. Across the seven small assessment areas, children in Center City Wilmington (14%) are most likely not to receive a developmental screening, and children in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area (4%) are least likely to miss a developmental screening. Of those children that did receive a developmental screening(s), 7% (95% CI : 4.1-10.4) of parents/guardians believe that they were not very, or not at all, beneficial to the child's health.1 Kent County adults (8.5%) are slightly more likely among adults in Delaware's three counties to believe screening(s) are not very, or not at all, beneficial, compared to adults in Sussex (7%) and New Castle (6%) counties. Across the seven small assessment areas, adults were most likely to believe that screening(s) are not very, or not at all, beneficial in the Remainder of the Greater Wilmington Area (10%), and least likely to find them not beneficial in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area (2%). 1 DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 PREVENT ATIVE CARE Primary care providers (PCPs) play an important role in providing prevent ative care to protect the health and safet y of the communities they serve (ODPHP, 2017 ).1 HEALTH CARE PROVIDER VISIT Adults Nationally, 17 % of adults did not have contact with a health pr ofessional in the past year (NCHS, 2017 ).2 In Delaware, nearly one in four adults (24 %) did not visit a health care provider in the past year for a routine check -up (Delaware Health and Social Services, Divis ion of Public Health, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 2015) . Thirteen percent of adult Delawareans ( 95% CI : 11.3-14.8), representing ~93,000 adults , did not visit a health care provider at all (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2 015). Kent County adults (16%) are less likely to have visited a health care provider in the past year than adults in New Castle (13%) or Sussex (11%) counties.3 Across the small assessment areas in the state, adults in the Remainder of Kent County (18% ) are most likely not to have visited a health care provider in the past year, and adults in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area (7%) are the least likely not to have had a visit. Children In Delaware, children are more likely to visit a health provid er regularly than adults. For example, only 5% (95% CI : 3.4-6.4) of children in Delaware did not see a physician in the past 12 months, compared to 13% of adults (Nemours' Delaware Survey of Children's Health, 2014) . Within Delaware, children in New Castle County (4%) and the rest of New Castle County excluding Wilmington (4%) , are the least likely not to have had a health care provider visit in the past year, followed by the City of Wilmington (5%), Sussex County (5%) , and Kent County (6.5%). 1 Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.

People who lack access to preventive dental services and dental treatment have higher rates of oral diseases . Delaware adults are less likely to vi sit the dentist than to see a health care provider (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). For example, more than one -third of Delawareans (35%, 95% CI : 32.2-37.0) did not visit a dentist in the past year; this represents more than one quarter million adults. In the U.S., 62% of adults did not see a dentist in the past year (NCHS, 2017 ).1 Kent County adults (39%) are most likely not to have seen a dentist in the past year, followed by adults in Sussex (38%) and New Castle (32%) counties. Among t he small assessment areas, adults in Center City Wilmington and the Remainder of Sussex County (both 45%), are most likely not to have seen a dentist in the past year. o The Northeast and Southeast Beaches area (27%) has the lowest percentage of adults who did not have an annual dental visit. BLOOD PRESSURE SCREE NINGS Health screenings are an important element of preventive care . Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, followed by cancer . High blood pressure affects approximately one in three adults in the United Sta tes, and only about half of these adults have it under control (CDC, 2017).2 Screening is effective in identifying risk factors for heart disease, including high blood pressure, and some types of cancers in early, often in highly treatable stages (CDC, 2017).3 Blood pressure screening is the most common health screening accessed by Delawareans (91%) .3 Only 9% (95% CI : 7.5-10.5) were not screened for hypertension in the past year; this represents ~64,200 adults (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). Adults 18 and over in New Castle (10%) and Kent (9%) counties are more likely not to have had this screening than adults in Sussex County (6%). 1 National Center for Health Statistics: Oral and Dental Health. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/dental.htm .

Colorectal cancer screening saves lives. Screening can find precancerous polyps (abnormal growths in the colon or rectum) that can be removed before turning into cancer. Screening also helps find colorectal c ancer at an early stage, when treatment often leads to a cure (CDC, 2017 ).1 Source: DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015 . Regular screenings beginning at age 50 are recommended to prevent colorectal cancer (U.S. PSTF, 2017 ).2 However, one -quarter of adults age 50 and over in Delaware (24.5%, 95% CI : 21.8-27.4) have not had a colonoscopy in the past 10 years (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). This represents ~90,000 adults age 50 and over in the state. Adults in New Castle County (27 %) are more likely not to have had a colonoscopy in the past 10 years than adults in Kent or Sussex counties (both 22 %). Among the seven small assessment areas, adults in the Remainder of New Castle County (28 %) are more likely not to have had a screening than adults in the other small assessment areas. 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Colorectal Cancer. https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/index.htm .

Adults 18+ with No Health Screening in the Recommended Time by County, Delaware, 2015State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 PSA OR RECTAL TESTS FOR PROSTATE CANCER The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that men make an informed decision with their health care provider about whether to be screened fo r prostate cancer. The decision should be made after getting information about the uncertainties, risks, and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening. Men should not be screened unless they have received this information. The discussion about scr eening should occur at age 50 for men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and are expected t o live at least 10 more years. After this discussion, men who want to be screened should be tested with the prostate -specific antigen (PSA) blood test. The digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be done as a part of screening (ACS, 2017 ).1 In Delaware, nearly one -half of men age 50 and over (47%, 95% CI : 42.7-52.0) did not have a PSA test or rectal exam for prostate cancer in the past year (DPHI Delaware Househ old Health Survey, 2015). This represents nearly ~91,000 men. The percentage of men age 40 and over who did not have this screening is relatively the same across Delaware's three counties: 48% in New Castle; 45% in Kent; and 47% in Sussex. Across the sev en small assessment areas, the percentage of men age 40 and over who have not had a PSA test or rectal exam for prostate cancer in the past year ranges from a low of one -third (33%) in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches area to a high of 59.5% in the Rem ainder of Sussex County.

Two screening tests can help prevent cervical cancer or find it early. The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for pre -cancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately. The HPV test looks for the Human Papilloma Virus that can cause these cell c hanges. The Pap test is recommended for all women between the ag es of 21 and 65 years (CDC, 2017 ).1 In Delaware, 12%, (95%, CI: 9.2-14.0) of women ages 21 to 65 (age -adjusted) , have not received a Pap test in the past three years (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). This represents over ~36,000 women in the state, and does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 7%. Kent County women (15%) are least likely to have had a Pap test in the past three years, compared to women in New Castle and Suss ex counties (both 11%). Among the small assessment areas in Delaware, women in Center City Wilmington (7%) are least likely not to have had a timely Pap smear. In comparison to Center City Wilmington, women in the Remainder of Kent County (16%) were mor e than twice as likely not to have had a Pap smear in the past three years. MAMMOGRAMS The U.S. Preventive Service Task Force recommends mammograms every two years for women age s 50-74 to screen for breast cancer.2 In Delaware, 18 % (95% CI : 14.9-22.2) of women age s 50-74 have not had a mammogram in the past two years; this represents ~28,800 women.3 Delaware meets the Healthy People 2020 goal of 18.9 % of women not receiving mammograms in this time period. However, in Kent (20 %) and New Castle (19 %) counties, the Healthy People 2020 goal is not met, but the difference is only about 1%. 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Gynecologic Cancers. https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm .

State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 EXERCISE ADULTS The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults (ages 18 -64) get 2.5 hours of moderate aerobic physical activity each week.1 In Delaware, 41 % (95% CI : 38.2-43.1) of adults exercise fewer than three days per week (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015). This represents ~294,300 adults. Across the three counties in the state, Kent County adults (45 %) are most likely to exercise fewer than three days per week, followed by adults in Sussex County (43%) and New Castle County (38 %). o These percentages do not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 32.6 %. In the seven small assessment areas, the percentage of adults who exercise less than three days per week ranges fro m a high of 46 % in the Remainder of Kent County to a low of 36.5% in Center City Wilmington. o None of the smaller assessment areas meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 32.3 %.

Adults 18+ who Exercise Less than the Recommended Three Times per Week1by Small Assessment Area*, Delaware, 2015State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 The primary reason given by adults in Delaware for not exercising is that it takes too much time (49% ) (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) . Lack of time was the reason given by 54 % of adults in New Castle County, followed by 44 % of adults in Kent County and 41 % of Sussex County adults. Lack of time was also the primary reason given by the majority of adults in the Remainder of New Castle County (57 %) and the Greater Wilmington Area (52 %). o Lack of time was the primary reason for not exercising given by 32 % of Northeast and Southeast Beaches area residents. CHILDREN Forty -five percent (95% CI : 40.9-49.3) of Delaware children age s 2 to 17 do not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of moderate -to-vigorous exercise for 60 minutes or more every day (Nemours' Delaware Survey of Children's Health, 2014). In Susse x County and New Castle County excluding the City of Wilmington, 44 % of children do not meet this goal. In Kent County , 46% of children do not get enough exercise. In the City of Wilmington, 50 % of children do not meet this goal - the highest percentage among the six regions in Delaware.

SMOKING According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)1, cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, causing more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States. This is nearly one in five deaths. Smokers are more likely than non -smokers to develop heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer. Smoking is estimated to increase the risk: For coronary heart disease, by two to four times For stroke, by two to four times Of men developing lung cancer, by 25 times Of women developing lung can cer, by 25.7 times Smoking diminishes overall health, increases absenteeism from work, and increases health care utilization and cost (CDC, 2017 ).2 In Delaware, the number of smokers has been on a steady decline for the past decade. Percentages fell from 23% in 2000 to 17% in 2010. According to the most recent data from 2015, 19% (95% CI : 16.7-20.8) of Delaware adults currently smoke cigarettes, representing ~133,000 adult smokers (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey) . This exceeds the Healthy People 2020 goal of 12%. 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Smoking & To bacco Use. https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm .

In comparison, women in Dover and the Surrounding Area (80%) were least likely to say they did not plan to become pregnant. Source: DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015. Statewide, the birth control pill is the most popular form of primary contracepti on among Delaware women who do not plan to become pregnant in the next year; it is used by one-third (32.5%, 95% CI : 26.5-39.2) of Delaware women.1 Sterilization is the next most common primary form of contracepti on, favored by 10% of Delaware women.

An additional 11.5% said they didn't need LARCs, but did not give a specific reason. o Among the three counties, women in Kent County (15%) are most likely to say they do not use LARCs because they do not want to, or are not interested. o Women in New Castle County are most likely to say they want to avoid negative side effects (9%), or they use or prefer another birth control method (10%) than women in other counties. 1 DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 SOCIAL CAPITAL AND NEIGHBORHOOD The fabric of a community and the community p ool of human resources available to it are often called its \"social capital.\" This term refers to the individual and communal time and energy that is available for such things as community improvement, social networking, civic engagement, personal recreat ion, and other activities that create social bonds between individuals and groups. Circumstances that prevent or limit the availability of social capital for a community and its members can have a negative effect on the health and we ll-being of the communi ty members. These negative effects on health and well -being can , in turn , have negative effects on the community as a whole. Data from the 2015 DPHI Delaware Survey show that the majority of residents across Delaware believe that their neighbors can be tr usted; only 12 % (95% CI : 10.6-13.9) of Delawareans do not believe that they can tru st their neighbors.

State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 VIII. EXISTING HEALTH CARE RESOURCES As part of the SHNA, DPHI staff completed an asset map of the health and human services available across Delaware. DPHI staff used the Delaware 2 -1-1 Human Service Referral and Community Resource Directory to develop this asset map. Created by the Unite d Way of Delaware, Delaware 2 -1-1 is free and online. It provides one central resource for access to health and human service organizations across Delaware. DPHI complemented the directory's information by exam ining additional resources and conducting a comprehensive web search. The information gathered shows that Delaware is rich with health and human service resources. The Resource Lists in Appendix M depict the various categories of health and human ser vice assets available for free or at low cost to residents in each county. Delaware is home to four hospitals in New Castle, one hospital in Kent with branches in both Dover, and Milford, and two hospitals in Sussex County. In terms of additional heal th and human services available, the Resource Lists in Appendix M show the breakdown of health centers, dental facilities, senior services, mental/behavioral health and substance abuse treatment, urgent care centers , and food assets and other social servic es within each county. The Resource List s also show that New Castle County is home to the majority of resources in each category of service. Of all the counties, New Castle County has the most urgent care centers, health centers, hospitals, mental health /behavioral health/substance abuse resources, and other social services. Interestingly, food assets, including food pantries and farmers' markets, were plentiful in each county, with the majority located in New Castle County, followed by Sussex and Kent c ounties. Agencies that provide services specifically for older adults and dental care are revealed as potential areas of need. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 IX. KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS PRIORITIES All results were compiled and analyzed collectively to paint a complete picture of Delaware's health. This comprehensive process yielded the following four top -level priority areas of focus and their risk factors: 1. CHRONIC DISEASE CORONARY HEART DISEA SE DIABETES ASTHMA Chronic diseases and condition s - such as heart disease, type -2 diabetes, and asthma - are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems.1 The statewide five -year age -adjusted mortality rate for coronary heart d isease (123 per 100,000 population) does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 103 per 100,000 population. The percentage of Delaware adults ever diagnosed with diabetes (13 %, 95% CI: 11.8-15.0) is higher than in the U.S. as a whole (9.3 %) (CDC, 2017) .2 The percentage of asthma diagnoses in Delaware adults (14 %, 95% CI : 12.3-15.7) and children (17 %, 95% CI : 14.5-20.3) are nearly twice the national averages (7.4 % and 9 %, respectively) (CDC, 2016).3 (Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center, 2009 -2013) (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) (Nemours' Delaware Survey of Children's Health, 2014) The percentage of adults with hypertension i n Delaware (29 %, 95% CI : 26.4- 30.7) does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 26.9 %. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a primary, modifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease.4 To this end, data on hypertension is often used, in combina tion of other variables, as a strong and consistent predictor of the development of heart disease.5 For example, while Dover and the 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/ov erview/index.htm .

According to parental perception, children in New Castle County are most likely to be in fair or poor health (4.3 %). These data vary at the local level. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Surrounding Area and the Northeast and Southeast Beaches have the highest percentage of heart disease diagnoses (both 14 %), they are among the least likely to have high blood pressure, with the Remainder of Sussex County and the City of Wilmington ranking the highest (both 33 %). This suggests that heart disease management and treatment could be a primary focus of intervention in Dover and the Surrounding Area and the Northeast and Southeast Beaches, while preventative efforts might be better targeted toward the Remainder of Sussex County and the City of Wilmington to decrease future heart disease diagnoses in those areas. (DPH I Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes, among other serious health problems. One -third (33 %, 95% CI : 30.7-35.8) of Delaware adults age 20 and o lder (age -adjusted) are obese, which does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal (30.6 %) in any region, except the Remaining Greater Wilmington Area (24 %) of New Castle County. This includes communities in the surrounding metropolitan area of Wilmington ou tside of center city. In general, Delaware children tend to be less obese than adults, but overall, one -fifth (21 %, 95% CI : 17.6-24.2) of children ages 2 -17 are obese, which exceeds the national average (17 %) but also exceeds the average for all the stat e's regions. (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) (Nemours' Delaware Survey of Children's Health, 2014) There are many risk factors for obesity, some which can be changed, such as lifestyle habits and environments. For example, adults in Dover and the Surrounding Area (18 %) and the Remainder of Sussex County (16 %) have the highest percentages of diabetes and obesity (37.1 % and 37.9 %, respectively). Interestingly, adults in these two regions are also most likely to consume more than the recommended amount of sugary sweet beverages per day (67 % and 62 %, respectively), a risk factor of both conditions. In addition, adults in Remaining Kent County (46 %), Northeast and Southeast Beaches (45%), Dover and the Surrounding Area (44 %), and Remaining Sussex C ounty (42 %) are the top four sub -groups least likely to get the recommended physical activity per week . They are also least likely to have a park or outdoor space in their neighborhood for recreation (44 %, 36%, 35%, and 45 %, respectively). Access, howeve r, is only a part of the problem. In fact, while residents in Center City Wilmington have access to more parks and outdoor space than any other community in the state (90 %), one -fifth of adults (21.2 %) and one -quarter of children (25 %) do not feel safe vi siting these locations during the day. This could explain why children in Wilmington are least likely to get the recommended amount of physical activity each day (50 %), despite access to recreational spaces. (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) (Nemours' Delaware Survey of Children's Health, 2014) Obesity is also the most common asthma co -morbidity.1 In Delaware, adults living in Dover and the Surrounding Area (21 %), Remaining Sussex County, and the Northeast and Southeast Beaches (both 15 %) are m ost likely to be diagnosed with asthma, and have the highest percentages of obesity (37.1 %, 37.9 %, and 38.3 %, respectively). This trend is not observed in children; children in the City of Wilmington have a much higher 1 Baffi CW, Winnica DE, Holguin F. Asthma and obesity: mechanisms and clini cal implications. Asthma Res Pract. 2015;1:1. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 percentage of asthma (25 %) than child ren in any other region, but the lowest rate of obesity (17 %). While various stakeholders cited concerns associated with pollution, deteriorating infrastructure, and a lack of safe and affordable housing, more information is needed to understand the impact of these factors on asthma prevalence, and the impact asthma has on overall health and chronic disease in Delaware. (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) (Nemours' Delaware Survey of Children's Health, 2014) 2. MATERNAL AND CHIL D HEALTH TEEN PREGNANCY PREMATURE BIRTHS LOW BIRTH WEIGHT Infants born to teenagers have been associated with a number of negative birth outcomes, including prematurity and low birth weight, making it an important outcome to track. From 2009 -2013 in Delaware, the five -year average percentage of premature births (gestational age < 37 weeks) is 14 % (Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center). This does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 11.4 % prematur e births. Further, the five -year average percentage of low birth weight births is 8.5 % (Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center, 2009 -2013). This rate does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal (7 .8%). (Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center, 2009 -2013) Center City Wilmington has the highest five -year fertility rate for adolescent women (40 per 1,000 women age 15 -17). This is followed by t he Remainder of Sussex County (21 per 1,000 women age 15 -17), where the fertility rate is nearly one -half of the rate observed in Center City Wilmington. In addition, Center City Wilmington has the highest five -year average percentage of premature births ( 15% of all live births) and low birth weight births (12%). Dover and the Surrounding Area has the third highest rate of teen pregnancy (65 per 1,000 women age 15 -17) behind Center City Wilmington and Remaining Sussex County. Notably, the Remainder of Sussex County and Dover and the Surrounding Area are the top three sub -areas in premature (14 % and 13 %) and low birth weight (8 % and 9%) births in Delaware, respectively. (Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Stat istics Center, 2009 -2013) Nearly two in five females (18 -45) in Center City Wilmington and Dover and the Surrounding Area who do not plan on getting pregnant in the next year do not use contraceptives (38 % and 39 %, respectively). These are among the highes t percentages in the state. Adults in Center City Wilmington (17 %) and Dover and Surrounding Area (21 %) are most likely to not have a regular source of care, and are the only two regions in the state that do not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 16 %. Children in Kent County are least likely to have visited a health care professional for preventive care in the past year (7 %). Adults in Center City Wilmington (14 %), the Remainder of Sussex County (12 %), and Dover and the Surrounding Area (11 %) are least l ikely to seek care, and least likely to fill a prescription, due to cost (17.2 %, 16.9 %, and 14.3 %, respectively). None of these percentages meet the Healthy People 2020 goals of 4.2 % of adults unable to obtain medical care and of 2.8 % of adults unable to fill a prescription due to cost (no regions State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 meet these goals). Adults in Sussex County were most likely to cite primary care as the top service need in their community (5 %). The Remainder of Sussex County has the highest percentage of live births to women receiving late or no prenatal care (44 %). Adults in Center City Wilmington (13 %) and the Remainder of Sussex County (12 %) are least likely to have health insurance coverage; this does not meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 100 % insured. More research i s needed to better understand how access to care and adult contraceptive behaviors influence maternal and child health outcomes in the state, but the common issues reported across these three regions are worth noting.

SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER OPIOID EPIDEMIC ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE SMOKING/E -CIGARETTE USE Substance use and addiction may lead to accidental or intentional death in many cases. In addition, people who suffer from addiction to drugs or alcohol often have one or more accompanying medical issues, which may include cardio vascular disease and mental disorders, among others (drugabuse.gov, 2016).1 The opioid epidemic is increasing rapidly in the state of Delaware, according to the majority of government officials , health experts and practitioners , educators , first responders , and community members. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015) estimates that 7% of Americans have a substance use disorder. In Delaware, 10 % of adults have been told that they have or had a substance use problem. The percentage of adults wi th a substance use problem in the City of Wilmington (15 %), Remainder of Kent County (12 %), Dover and the Surrounding Area (11.4 %), and the Remainder of New Castle County (11.3 %) are higher than for the state and for the nation as a whole. In addition, a dults in the Remainder of Kent (27.5 %), Dover and the Surrounding Area (27 %), and Center City Wilmington (23 %) are most likely to have lived with a person who had a drug or alcohol use disorder while growing up. (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015 ) In Delaware, d rug overdose deaths (13 per 100,000 population) exceed the five -year age-adjusted mortality rate of deaths from suicide (12 per 100,000 population), motor vehicle crashes (12 per 100,000 population), homicide (6 per 100,000 population), and HIV/AIDS (4 per 100,000 population) (Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center, 2009 -2013). Adults in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches region are the least likely to seek treatment for a reported substance use disorder (57%) and have the second highest accidental drug overdose mortality rate (15.7 per 100,000 population) after the Remainder of Kent County (16.9 per 100,000 population). Interestingly, adults in the N ortheast and S outheast Beaches region are most likely to have insurance for prescription medications (89 %). The sizeable older adult population there could be the driving factor behind this statistic; however, it emphasizes the need to study how prescription medication coverage impacts the availability of prescription opioids as a mechanism of overdose deaths. (Delaware Health and Social 1 National Institute on Drug Abuse: Addition and Health. Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center, 2009 -2013) (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) According to the CDC (2016), cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States (480,000 deaths annually). Although the percentage of adult smokers has steadily declin ed in Delaware for over a decade, most recent data indicate a 2% increas e from 17 % in 2010 to 19 % in 2015. All regions across the state exceed the Healthy People 2020 goal of 12 %. Further, according to the CDC's Adult Tobacco Survey, 2.6% of U.S. adults used e -cigarettes in the past month, compared to 6 % of Delaware adults. Mo re information is needed to better understand the relationship between e - cigarettes and cigarette smoking. However, the highest percentage of cigarette smokers and the highest percentage of e -cigarette users are found in the same three regions : Dover and the Surrounding Area, the Remainder of Sussex, and Center City Wilmington. (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNO SES SUICIDE/IDEATIONS IMPACT OF TRAUMA Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well -being. It is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood because it affects how we think, feel and act, as well as how we handle stress, relate to others , and make choices.1 While the percentage of Delaware adults with mental health diagnoses (17%, 95% CI : 15.2-18.9) is lower than the national average (25 % ), the adult suicide rate and percentage of adults with suicidal/self -harm thoughts are eviden t areas of concern that could point to underlying issues of access for screening, early detection, and necessary treatment. For example, none of the three counties meet the Healthy People 2020 goals for suicide mortality rates (10 per 100,000 population). Five percent (95% CI : 3.9-6.1) of Delaware adults report having had suicidal or self -harm thoughts in the past year, which is higher than the national average of 3.9 % (CDC, 2016).2 Further, adults living in regions who indicated mental health and psychi atric care as the top unmet needs in their community had the highest rates of suicide mortality (Northeast and Southeast Beaches and Remainder of Sussex County). Interestingly, adults in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches region are the least likely to b e diagnosed with a mental health condition (10.5 %) and are most likely to not be in treatment for a mental health condition (45 %). However, they are most likely to cite mental health and psychiatric care as the top unmet service needs in their community a nd have the second highest suicide mortality rate (13 per 100,000 population) in the state behind the Remainder of Kent County (14 per 100,000 population). Concerns over the increase in mental health diagnoses in youth was a recurring theme that emerged fr om key informant interviews, community meetings , and coalition surveys; however, more information is needed to accurately assess the scope of the issue within this age group. 1 U.S. National Library of Medicine: Mental Disorders. https://medlineplus.gov/mentaldisorders.html . Accessed 10/26/2017. 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Suicide: Facts at a Glance. http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/Suicide -DataSheet -a.pdf . Accessed 10/26/2017. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) (Delaware Health and Social Service s, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center, 2009 -2013) Prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral health disorders focuses on addressing known risk factors such as exposure to trauma in children and adults. Traumatic adverse even ts in childhood influence health and well -being throughout life, from conception to death, which makes them very important to identify and treat as early as possible. A score of four or more Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) indicates moderate to severe adverse childhood experiences (CDC, 2016).1 Adults who have experienced four or more ACEs are more common in Delaware (13.4 %, 95% CI : 11.8-15.2) than in the United States as a whole (12.5 %) (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) (CDC, 2017). Residents in Kent County (13 %) were most likely to report growing up with a family member who was suicidal or mentally ill, followed by New Cast le County (12.8 %) and Sussex County (8.6 %) residents, respectively. This same pattern is observed when looking at cu rrent mental health diagnoses: Kent County adults are most likely to have a mental health diagnosis (21 %), followed by New Castle (17 %) and Sussex (13 %) count y adults . Overall, adults in Dover and the Surrounding Area within Kent County recall experiencing different forms of abuse (verbal, physical, and neglect) most often in their childhood . Adults in the Remainder of Kent most often report challenging household environments such as addiction, poor mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence in their childhood. Adults in Center City Wilmington are most likely to report traumas related to the breakdown of the family unit through incarceration and/or divorce in their childhood - which can contribute to generational poverty. (DPHI Delawa re Household Health Survey, 2015) Stakeholders from across the state expressed concerns over violence - specifically, the frequency with which violence occurs in certain communities, as well as the implications associated with new channels of exposure. The re is a consensus that technology has further increased exposure to these traumas, amplifying the magnitude of psychological effects in new ways that are not completely understood. For example, the City of Wilmington has a homicide rate nearly five times h igher than any other region (23.5 per 100,000 population) and residents that are 20 % to 40 % more likely to witness violence in their community (73 %). Yet, the percentage of adults with a mental health diagnosis in Center City Wilmington is approximately th e same as in the Remainder of Kent County (both 22 %) and just slightly higher than in Dover and the Surrounding Area (20 %). While more research is needed to understand the relationship between violence and mental health, key trends emerged across all thre e of these regions that are worth noting. The highest percentage of adults with mental health diagnoses are in the City of Wilmington, Dover and Surrounding Area, and the Remainder of Kent County. Adults in these same regions are also most likely to repo rt high levels of stress, mistrust in neighbors, safety concerns associated with visiting parks and outdoor spaces in their neighborhoods, and frequent bullying and discrimination. More information is needed to conceptualize the relationship between expos ure to violent crime and social -emotional 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Kaiser ACE Study. https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/about.html .

(Delaware Health and Social Services, Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center, 2009 -2013) (DPHI Delaware Household Health Survey, 2015) State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The following conclusions and recommendations are based on an analysis and extraction of key aspects of the data and subsequent strategic planning by the SHIP Revision Committee. For detailed recommendations, information on alignment and readiness, as well as examples of evidence -based practices, see the 2017 SHIP Recommendations Report . CHRONIC DISEASE Given the scope of the problem, chronic disease needs to be addressed on a statewide scale. However, the mode of intervention can be targeted at the community level based on the risk factors specific to those populations. Adults in Dover and the Surrounding Area, and the Remainder of Sussex County should explore targeted interventions around hea lthy diet, and specifically, sugary -sweet beverage consumption, to reduce high rates of diabetes and obesity. Increasing access to recreational spaces in Kent and Sussex counties for physical activity is a recommended focus to reduce chronic disease in th ese areas. Residents in Center City Wilmington, specifically youth, could benefit from more safe havens to run and play through the enhancement of existing outdoor spaces. Chronic Disease Interventions REDUCE OBESITY TO RE DUCE HEART DISEASE, HYPERTENSION, AND DIABETES BY PROMOTIN G HEALTHY DIET AND E XERCISE. INCREASE ACCESS TO H EALTHY FOODS TO REDU CE HEART DISEASE, HYPERTENSION, AND DI ABETES IMPROVE THE BUILT EN VIRONMENT TO PROMOTE WALKING, BIKING, ETC. PROMOTE ACCESS TO RE MOTE PATIENT MONITOR ING FOR PATIE NTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITI ONS. INCREASE ACCESS TO C OMMUNITY HEALTH WORK ERS AND CARE COORDINATION TO IMPR OVE CHRONIC DISEASE OUTCOMES. REDUCE CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE - ASTHMA, LUNG CANCER, AND COPD. REVIEW EXISTING POLICIES - MAKE THE HEALTHY CHO ICE THE EASY CHO ICE. Overal l, Kent and Sussex Counties have more unfavorable disease outcomes, but limited availability of services and supports, while New Castle County has adequate access to services and supports, but residents cannot afford to and/or do not feel safe enough to us e them. These challenges are observed at particularly higher rates in the region of Center City Wilmington than in the remaining areas of New Castle County. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 MATERNAL AND CHILD H EALTH Efforts to address maternal and child health concerns should be targeted to adolescents in Center City Wilmington, as well as Dover and the Surrounding Area, and the Remainder of Sussex County to the west of the Beaches regi on. Education and cost of care are recommended areas of focus in Center City Wilmington and Dover and the Surrounding Area; the Remainder of Sussex County would benefit from increased access to preventive services. Maternal and Child Health Interventions EMBED H EALTH EDUCATION IN S CHOOLS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER A statewide effort is needed to address substance use disorders . Prescription monitoring and proper disposal of unused prescription medications could be an area of interest in Sussex County , given widespread prescription drug coverage and overdose rates, particularly in the Northeast and Southeast Beaches region. New Castle and Kent Counties could benefit from a focus on early detection and supportive resources for addicts and their loved one s, given the high rate of adults with a current substance use problem having a household/family history of addiction. All regions need increased resources for treatment. Substance Use Disorder Interventions REDUCE TOBACCO AND T OBACCO SUBSTITUTE US E REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE O PUBLIC MEDIA CAMPAIG N TO ADDRESS SUBSTAN CE USE DISORDER STIGMA ON A STATEWID E BASIS ALIGN WITH HEALTHY NEIGHBORHOOD S (COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTIONS, OPIOID EP IDEMIC) UNIVERSAL EDUCATION FOR ANY PRACTITIONER S IN THE FIELD AROUND IDENTIFICATIO N OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORD ER AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 MENTAL HEALTH High rates of suicide and suicidal/self -harm thoughts exist with low rates of mental health diagnoses across the state. This is a testament to the need for improved mental health screening, detection, and early intervention in order to identify the risk factors for suicide and reduce the number of these deaths. Trauma across the lifespan, including violence, is a key influence on emotional health and well -being that can be targeted based on the community profile. For example, the impact of homicide and the collapse of the family unit should be explored further in the City of Wilmington as it relates to mental health . V ictims of abuse and neglect should be a priority in the Dover and the Surrounding Area and exposure to volatile household environments is key in the Remainder of Kent County. Mental Health Interventions PLACE A MENTAL HEALT H PROVIDER IN EVERY SCHOOL INCREASE PAY FOR MEN TAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TO ALLEVIATE SHORTAGES The SHIP Coalition should review these new priority areas and strategic issues to determine how well they align with existing programs in Delaware, whether they are perceived as a need by the community, and whether there is support for funding any or all of the evi denced -based programs that are recommended by the SHIP , or the state or local governments. Many of the existing strategic issues that were identified are already being addressed in Delaware. However, they may not be using evidence -based practices or may lack funding to address these issues comprehensively. This may require more cooperation between agencies to break down \"silos,\" such as those between mental and physical health. In addressing the final draft of the new DE SHIP Plan in 2018, stakeholders should consider each of these strategic issues when deciding which top priority goals to advance .

Statistical significance is influenced both by the degree of percentage difference and by sample size . With larger sample sizes, smaller percentage differences have a greater chance of becoming statistically significant . The level of statistical significance (.05, .01, and . 001) indicates the likelihood of obta ining the percentage difference of at least that magnitude, given the overall percentage, by chance .

State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 APPENDIX J: COMMUNITY MEETING FACILITATOR GUIDE State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 COMMUNITY MEETING FA CILITATOR GUIDE INTRODUCTION Good afternoon. My name is _______ and this is my colleague ______. We are here from t he Delaware Public Health Institute. We are a private, non -profit public health institute that works to improve the health of Delawareans. PURPOSE Thank you for coming to this focus group. A focus group is a relaxed discussion. Please feel free to ask q uestions or get up to stretch or use the bathroom. We are here today to talk about the health care strengths and unmet needs of your community within your county. DPHI has partnered with the Delaware Division of Public Health to manage Delaware's compre hensive quality assessment and improvement activities, in support of the State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP). An important element of that effort is your perceptions of the quality of life in your county including health status, what the strengths are of the health care system, and whet her there are any unmet needs. We are not here to share information, or to give you our opinions. Your perceptions are what matter. There are no right or wrong; desirable or undesirable answers. You can disagree with each other, and you can change your mind. I would like you to feel comfortable saying what you really think and how you really feel. PROCEDURE ______ (colleague) will be taking notes and tape recording the discussion so that I do not miss anything you have to say. Individual responses are anonymous, and will not be shared with your organization, or the public. Aggregate (i.e. group) results will be included in the statewide needs assessment report, available in 2017. I want this to be a group discussion, so f eel free to respond to me and to other members in the group without waiting to be called on. However, I would appreciate it if only one person did talk at a time. The discussion will last approximately one hour. There is a lot we want to discuss, so at tim es I may move us along a bit. HEALTH CARE STRENGTH S AND UNMET NEEDS 1) Let's start by everyone sharing their name, how long they've lived in ____ county, and the #1 health issue or health problem they feel is most important in their community (i.e., problems related to aging such as arthritis or hearing/vision loss, child abuse/neglect, diabetes, high blood pressure, domestic violence, cancers, homicide, mental health problems, suicide, infant death, infectious disease, dental problems, teenag e pregnancy, etc.). 2) In the same fashion, I'd like each of you to name one \"risk\" behavior you feel is most or important or contributing the most to unfa vorable health outcomes in your community (i.e., alcohol abuse, poor eating habits, dropping out of school, racism, drug abuse, refusing immunizations, tobacco use, unsafe sex, not abiding by child safety laws, etc.). 3) Lastly, I'd like each of you to name one factor you feel is most important for achieving/maintaining a healthy community (i.e., low crime/safe neighborhoods, good schools, parks and recreation, clean environment, affordable housing, strong family life, healthy behaviors and lifestyles, excellent race relations, low death and disease rates, religious or spiritual values, access to health care, etc.). State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 COMMUNITY MEETING FA CILITATOR GUIDE (CON T.) QUALITY OF LIFE Next, I am going to ask you some questions about health and quality of life in this county. These questions will be open to the room to respond. 1) What is the quali ty of life in this county? What characteristics of the community make it so? (Consider your sense of safety, well -being, participation in community life and associations, etc.) 2) How satisfied or unsatisfied are you with the health care system in the co mmunity? Why? (Consider access, cost, availability, quality, options in health care, etc.) [IOM, 1997] 3) For those of you who have children, what are the pros and cons of raising children in thi s comm unity? (Consider school quality, day care, after scho ol programs, recreation, etc.) 4) What are the pros and cons of growing older in this community? (Consider older adult -friendly housing, transportation to medical services, churches, shopping; older adult day programs, social support for older adults livi ng alone, meals on wheels, etc.) 5) How much economic opportunity is there in the community? What types of economic opportunity are there? What types are missing? (Consider locally owned and operated businesses, jobs with career growth, job training/high er education opportunities, affordable housing, reasonable commute, etc.) 6) What are your perceptions of the level of safety in the community? (Consider residents' perceptions of safety in the home, the workplace, schools, playgrounds, parks, or the mall. Do neighbors know and trust one another? Do they look out for one another?) 7) How extensive are the networks of support for individuals and families during times of stress and need (neighbors, support groups, faith community outreach, agencies, and org anizations)? 8) What level of opportunity do individuals and groups have to achieving health and a good quality of life? Would you say the level of opportunity differs or is the same across all individuals and communities? (If differ) In what ways? 9) What is the perceived importance of residents \u2014 individually and collectively \u2014 about making their community a better place to live? 10) What primary asset or resource does this county need but currently does not have (enough of) that could address an impo rtant unmet need/needs of its residents?

State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 APPENDIX K: HEALTH ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND METHODOLOGYState Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Health Assessment Process and Methodology The five steps in the health assessment process were: 1. Defining the community 2. Identifying existing primary and secondary data and data needs 3. Collecting primary and secondary data 4. Analyzing data 5. Preparing a written narrative report. Additional geographic specific da ta are supplied in the Appendices to allow Delawareans to further target community health needs . The data acquisition and analysis, community meetings, key informant interviews, and information gaps are described in more detail below. DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS Both primary and secondary and quantitative and qualitative data were obtained and analyzed for this needs assessment. Obtaining information from multiple sources, known as triangulation, helps provide context for information and allows resear chers to identify results which are consistent across more than one data source. The data collection and analysis methods used for this needs assessment are described below, beginning with the MAPP assessment process. MAPP ASSESSMENTS A community or state health improvement plan is critical for developing policies and defining actions to target efforts that promote health. It should define the vision for the health of the community through a collaborative process. To ensu re the goals and strategies within the plan are aligned with the ever -changing health landscape in our state and our communities, an assessment and revision plan was developed and approved by the SHIP subcommittee in May 2015. These plans detail a contin ual, long -term, systematic effort to address public health problems on the basis of a state health assessment and a state health improvement process. Consistent with the three -year timeline, Phases 1 and 2 began in early 2016, when 15 coalition members b egan discussing a new vision of health for Delaware. The vision statement is based on the common values that emerged from brainstorming and discussion, a visioning questionnaire (January 2016), a follow -up VISION STATEMENT \"An integrated culture of health in which holistic wellness is collectively valued, promoted, and prioritized across sectors, systems, and services in a manner that fosters equitable opportunities for health for all Delawareans, leading to improved health outcomes.\" State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 conference call (March 2016), and coalition inpu t at the SHIP's s emi-annual event (April 2016). This vision statement is an instrumental piece in guiding the coalition through the planning, strategizing, and action phases of the revised SHIP in 2017. During Phase 3 of the MAPP process DPHI conducted four assessments from April to November 2016. The results, analyzed and combined for this report, are: 1. The Forces of Change Assessment 2. Local Public Health System Assessment 3. Community Themes and Strengths Assessment 4. Community Health Status Assessment These assessments are based on the MAPP framework, a process used to develop SHIP and created by the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO). They are described in more detail in the next sections. Forces o f Change Assessment The Forces of Change Assessment identifies the external factors, trends, and events that affect the health of Delaware residents and the Delaware public health system . In this assessment, seven categories of forces - economic, environmental, ethical, legal/political, scientific, social, and technological - were meticulously examined to comprehensively answer two questions: (1) What is occurring , or might occur , that affects the health of our community or the local public health system ? (2) What specific threats and/or opportunities are generated by these occurrences? The SHIP coalition, a diverse group of community and public health leaders, met in April 2016 to launch the assessment. During this meeting, a brainstorm ing session and discussion reviewed important forces and the threats and opportuniti es associated with each force. Eighteen coal ition members divided into two smaller groups and were asked to identify the top forces that they believe will most impact the health of Delawar e communities and their public health system s. Responses were collected and used to develop a follow -up online survey with the community via Survey Monkey that was fielded from May to July 2016. Twenty -two respondents answered questions to further establish the forces identified during the initial d iscussion, and to identify the threats and opportunities associated with each force . The forces identified here , and the results of the other three assessments , will serve as the foundation for \"I dentifying Strategic Issues ,\" the next step in the MAPP process . State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Local Public Health System Assessment The local public health system refers to all organizations and entities within the community that contribute to the public's health . The Local Public Health System A ssessment answers the questions: (1) What are the components, activities, competencies, and capacities of our local public health system? (2) How are essential public health services being provided in our community? The assessment collected data using a m odified National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP) assessment instrument. The assessment instrument asks Key Informants how aware they are, on a scale of one to five, of the local public health system's provision of a set of 10 essentia l activities (Figure K-1). Each of these essential activities include between two and four model standards that describe key aspects of an optimally performing public health system. Each model standard is followed by assessment questions that serve as me asures of performance (MAPP , 2008).1 Sixteen Key Informants were recruited to respond to the assessment instrument in a structured telephone interview. Key Informants were recruited from among Delaware public health officials, health care providers, health systems, behavioral health provider s, funders, and advocacy organizations. Interviews lasted between 30 and 45 minutes. Information from the interviews was analyzed for similarities and differences in each assessment area. Mean scores were calculated for each assessment area rated by the Key Informants. This process assessed the 10 Essential Public Health Services . Figure K -1.

Essential Public Health Services describe the public health activities that all communities should undertake and serve as the framework for the NPHPS instruments. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Community Themes and Strengths Assessment The Community Themes and Strengths As sessment answers the questions: (1) What is important to our community? (2) How is quality of life p erceived in our community? (3) What assets do we have that can be used to improve community he alth? This assessment resu lts in a strong understanding of community issues and concerns, perceptions about quality of life, and a map of community assets. Two community meetings were held on October 27 , 2016 (Bear -Glasgow YMCA) and October 28 , 2016 (Eden Hill Medical Center) to ca pture perspectives of residents and professionals who live and work in the southern and northern regions of Delaware. A set of questions developed by DPHI staff and approved by DPH guided the discussion about quality of life and health concerns . Twelve participants attended each of the community meetings, which lasted approximately 1\u00bd hours . The community meeting s were recorded and transcribed to highlight the major findings from the discussion s and to capture possible areas of improvement for each re gion. Community Health Status Assessment The Community Health Status Assessment (CHSA) answers the questions: (1) How healthy are our residents? (2) What does the health status of our community look like? The results of the CHSA provide the community with an understanding of the community's health status and ensure that the community's priorities include specific health status issues (e.g., high lung cancer rates or low immunization rates). The steps involved in the CHSA are: 1. Prepare for the CHSA by establ ishing a subcommittee and planning how the CHSA steps will be undertaken. 2. Collect data for the core indicators on the CHSA indicator list . Review previous assessment efforts and build from these as needed. 3. Select additional data indicators to explore i ssues important to the community . Identify additional data indicators by reviewing the list of extended indicators or by developing local ly relevant indicators. Collect data for the additional indicators. 4. Organize and analyze data and present them in understandable charts and graphs . 5. Establish a system to monitor the indicators over time . Modify or add to the indicators periodically, as new information arises from other phases of MAPP. 6. Identify challenges and opportunities related to health stat us that should be considered when determining strategic issues during the next phase. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 DATA SOURCES Data collected and analyzed for this CHSA include: American Community Survey (ACS) (2010 -2014) Delaware vital statistics on births and deaths ( 2009 -2013 ) Nemours' Delaw are Survey of Children's Health (DSCH) (2014) DPHI's Delaware Household Health Survey (2015). These data sources are described in more detail below. AMERICAN COMMUNITY S URVEY This report includes data from the American Community Survey on t he characteristics of Delaware residents for the years 2010 -2014. The ACS is an ongoing survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census that provides vital information on a yearly basis about U.S. residents. For each of the regional Census variables, as well as the C ensus and Vital Statistics data utilized as denominators for the calculation of birth and mortality rates, data were based on ZIP Code approximations, known as ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA). DELAWARE VITAL S TATISTICS The most recent information on births, birth outcomes, and deaths for Delaware residents was obtained from the Division of Public Health, Delaware Health Statistics Center (DHSC). Five-year (2009 -2013) annualized average rates for natality and mortality were calculated b y DPHI and m ortality rates were age -adjusted using the Direct Method and the 2000 U.S . Standard P opulation. DELAWARE SURVEY OF C HILDREN'S HEALTH The DSCH , sponsored by Nemours Health and Prevention Services , is a comprehensive health surveillance instrument for Delaware children from birth through 17 years . Using parent -reported data, the DSCH provides informat ion regarding children's overall health and health care , weight status, healthy living, and the family and neighborhoo d environment . Nemours conducted the DSCH in 2006, 2008, 2011, and most recently , in 2014 . The 2014 DSCH was conducted from July 2014 to May 2015 by telephone, including cell phones . The final data set contains data for 2,657 Del aware households with chi ldren State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 DELAWARE HOUSEHOLD H EALTH SURVEY DPHI's 2015 Delaware Household Health Survey (DE HHS) questionnaire examines health status and the utilization of, and access to, health care among adults residing in the state of Delaware. The DE HHS is modeled on Public Health Management Corporation's successful Southeastern Pennsylvania Hous ehold Health Survey that has been con ducted biannually since 1983, expanding to 10,000 h ouseholds across five counties in 1994. It is utilized by o ver 300 members and affiliates. The survey was conducted through tel ephone interviews with persons 18 years of age and older living in 2,609 households in Delaware. Within each selected household with more than one eligible adult, the Last Birthday Method was used to select the adult who last had a birthday as the respon dent for the interview (with the exception of the cell phone sample). A total of 1,310 (50%) cell phone interviews were conducted wit h adults in the state. Cell phone respondents received the same survey questionnaire as landline respondents. Survey devel opment was a collaborative process. Partnering agencies represent multiple sector s across the state, including: g overnment, health care systems, nonprofits, educational institutions, community organizations, and associations . The survey includes many questions that were administered and tested in national and local health surveys, including: National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) The California Women's Health Survey The Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University) The Survey on Childhood Obesity (Kaiser Family Foundation/San Jose Mercury News). Households in four regions in Delaware were selected to guarantee representation from all geographic sub -areas and from all population subgroups. These areas included: Kent County (n=579), Sussex County (n=728), the Greater Wilmington Area (n=667), and the Remainder of New Castle County (n=635). The survey u sed a disproportionate st ratified sampling plan to attain 100 interviews in each of the following ZIP Code s: 19801, 19802, 19805, 19934, 1995 6, 19960, and 19973. At least 40 interviews were conducted in ZIP Codes 19706 and 19941. A total of 2,609 interviews were conducted with adults age 18 and over residing in the state of Delaware. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 The Delaware Household Health S urvey was ad ministered for DPHI by SSRS, Inc. , a research firm in Media, PA, betwe en August and November, 2015. The final sample of interviews is representative of th e population in each of the four regions so the results can be generalized to the populations of these regions. DATA ANALYSIS Data collected for this CHSA was analyzed using the Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS). Frequency distributions were produced for variables for several geographic sub -areas to identify and describe differences and similarities in outcomes. To objectively identify and prioritize unmet needs, tests of significance were conducted as well. These compared the state results to the results for Delaware's three counties to each other and to the seven small assessment areas. In addition, to make prop er adjustments for the sampling design and weighting, SPSS Complex Samples procedure was utilized to produce accurate standard errors for the calculation of confidence intervals and statistical hypothesis testing. W hen ranking ordering counties and regions by percentages, the wid th of the confidence intervals should be noted, as the greater the degree to which the confidence intervals overlap, one can be less sure that there is actually a difference between the counties or region in the wider population. Quantitative data for the three counties and the seven small assessment areas were compared to United States health objectives from Healthy People 2020 and to data collected for Delaware from the CDC's 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. Age-adjusted percent ages were calculated to match Healthy People 2020 methodology where appropriate. ZIP CODE TABULATION AREAS (ZCTA) For census -based regional data, the Census Bureau approximated actual Zip Codes by what they refer to as ZCTA's , or Z IP Code tab ulation areas. ZCTA's are close but not exact approximations of ZIP Code s, based on 2010 Census block assignments . Both ZIP Code s and their census -based ZCTA approximations pose some dilemmas whe n assigning data to one of the seven ZIP Code -based regions, whic h were designed to fall within c ounty boundaries, as four ZIP Codes have a non -trivial (over 1% population) in a second county based on the \"2010 ZCTA to County Relationship \" file provided by the Census Bureau . Acquiring the ZIP Code (or ZCT A)/County boundary crossing is not a proble m for Household Health Survey, b irth, and m ortality data, as these data sources have both a ZIP Code and county listed for each respondent. However, it is problematic for U.S. Census data as ZC TA data are not bro ken down by c ounty in the ACS tables. Nevertheless , with the known distribution of the 2010 ZCTA population in these c ounties, we were able to proportionally allocate all c ensus variables utilize d in tables to the appropriate c ounty . State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 The proportio nal distribution is: 19938: 92.5% of the ZCTA assigned to Remaining Kent and 7.5 to Remaining New Castle 19977: 81.8% assigned to Remaining Kent and 18.9 % to Remaining New Castle 19950: 20.9 % assigned to Remaining Kent and 79.1 % to Remaining Sussex 19963: 40.9% assigned to Remaining Kent and 59.1 % to Remaining Sussex. This procedure results in Regional ZIP Code defined totals within c ounties that are very close to, but not exact , replicas of, actual c ounty totals for the variables in question. For the mortality and some natality (birth rates) data that required Census -based denominators, the most recent census data available were not preferred owing to the date range of vital data (2009 -2013). Since one year county data and state -level data were availabl e from t he ACS, DPHI took data from the midpoint year, 2011, for county - based tables. Only five -year aggregations were provided by the ACS for ZCTA breakdowns, and thus the matching 2009 -2013 ACS ZCTA data were used as vital denominators for the respective ZIP Code defined regions. CONFIDENCE INTERVALS For all Household Health Survey -based tables and g raphs, a 95% confidence interval (CI) around each estimated percentage is displayed. One can also apply the 95% CI to the projected number by taking the margin of error (one -half of the confidence interval), multiplying it by the projected number, and then adding and subtracting that number from the projected number. Household Health Survey projected numbers, estima ted percentages, and 95% CI are provided for health conditions and related factors. Numbers that are projected and corresponding percentages are based on a computer -intensive weighting methodology (\" iterative proportional fitting\"). This procedure, long utilized by PHMC and more recently implemented by BRFSS, is designed to closely match age/sex/race/poverty estimates for 2015 based on data provided by Claritas, Inc. Benchmarks that get matched are based on two regions in New Castle County (Greater Wilmin gton area and Remainder of New Castle), Kent County , and Sussex County. This weighting adjustment methodology enables the survey sample to more closely approximate a random sample, in that it reduces the impact of over - and under -representation by demograp hic sectors that were more or less likely to participate in the survey. To counter -balance the statistical repercussions of larger variances due to a fairly slight lack of equal likelihood of every adult in Delaware being initially contacted for participat ion, as well as the applied weighting adjustments for unequal demographic participation in the survey, a SPSS Complex Samples procedure was applied. This procedure enables more accurate confidence intervals to be constructed around percentage estimates and population projections, and allows statistical hypothesis State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 testing to be more valid. Although the statistical methodology is involved, in essence, a reduced sample size is calculated making confidence intervals wider and the prospects of obtaining signifi cance harder than if the original sample size was utilized without proper adjustment. For other data sources, confidence intervals were also constructed, based on slightly different statistical applications. The DSCH data from Nemours utilized the Stati stical Analysis System (SAS) with some minor differences in calculation, and confidence intervals for age -adjusted mortality rates were obtained from the DHSC, who applied two formulas depending on number of deaths as prescribed by the CDC in their Nationa l Vital Statistic's Reports.1 Confidence intervals for another mortality variable: infant mortality, that by definition is not age -adjust ed, was also produced by DHSC. AGE DISTRIBUTION The year 2000 U.S. Standard Population is the national age distributi on per one million persons based on the U.S. 2000 Census. This distribution is used to standardize mortality rates so that regions with older and younger populations are unaffected (via age - adjustment) by their particular age distribution. Age -adjusted de ath rates are preferred to crude death rates (deaths per 100,000 population ) because many causes of death are impacted by age, making crude rate comparisons across regions, or the same region over time, difficult to interpret. When an age -adjusted death r ate is compared across regions and/or over time, changes are not due to the impact of age, but are what they would be if the regional population was age - distributed as it was nationally in 2000. When regional populations are much older than the 2000 natio nal distribution, and a particular cause of death is much more likely to occur at an older age, the age -adjusted death rate will be substantially lower than the crude death rate, and vice -versa. The denominators for all 2009 -2013 mortality rates and for 20 09-2013 fertility rates for ages 15 -44 and 15 -17 were obtained from 2011 ACS county and state estimates and 2009 -2013 5 year average regional (ZCTA -based) estimates . 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: National Vital Statistics Reports. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04.pdf . Accessed 10/26/2 017. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 APPENDIX L: FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENTState Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Forces of Change Assessment The Forces of Change Assessment identifies the external factors, trends, and events that affect the health of Dela ware residents and the Delaware public health system . In this assessment, seven categories of forces - economic, environmental, ethical, legal/ political, scientific, social, and te chnological - were examined to comprehensively answer th e following questions: (3) What is occurring or might occur that affects the health of our community or the local public health system? (4) What specific threats and/or opportunities are generated by these occurrences? Forty stakeholders consisting of SHIP coalition and community members identified eight categories of forces that influence Delaware's health system and community health . Participants were asked to individually list their top three forces from the original list of 27. Table 2 details the forces deemed the most influential a nd prominent forces in Delaware. ECONOMIC Poverty and poor health worldwide are inextricably li nked (Health Poverty Action, 2016).1 Respondents named generational poverty to be among the top three most influential forces impacting Delaware's health . The majority of participants included economic factors in th eir lists, with lack of good paying job s listed as the most commonly named force (n=35). Other influential economic forces include funding implications of the 2016 election(s), inadequate affordable housing, and insufficient industry/employer diversity in the state . Generational poverty occu rs in families where at least two generations are born into poverty (Urban Ventures, 2016).2 In the United States, the official poverty thresholds are set by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Those with moderate and high incomes are healthier, on average , than those with low incomes . For every age group and on most health indicators, the poor are less healthy than the near poor and non - poor . Many factors influence health, i ncluding access to medical care (University of Wisconsin, 2016).3 Unins ured individu als often cannot pay for health care and instead rely on social services or hospital emergency rooms. Individuals without health insurance face substantial barriers to receiving adequat e care, which ultimately affect their overall life experi ences , as compared to individuals who are insured for most of their lives. (See Delaware poverty rates in S ection VII of this report.) 1 Health Poverty Action: Poverty -about -poverty/ Accessed 10/26/2017. 3 Institute for Research on Poverty: Reduc ing Health Disparities by Poverty Status. https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/policybriefs/pdfs/PB4 -ProvenPoliciesToReduceHealthDisparities.pdf . Accessed 10/26/2017. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 Generational poverty can threaten the well -being of Delawareans for years to come . According to one stakeholder, \"If generational poverty is not interrupted, the cycle of poor education, poor job prospects, and dependency will hobble our economy and undermine our culture.\" Another participant cited racism as an underlying threat , causing a \"disproportionate amount of pe ople of color being sent to prisons.\" Opportunities expected to have an encouraging effect on overall health are increasing the availability of low cost Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs), connecting communities with the knowledge and resources to \"live in the know,\" and building stronger communities . Accounting for economic forces that affect the local communit y will be a vital element in developing a sound revised state health improvement plan. ENVIRONMENTAL The surroundings in which people li ve, work, and play affect their health . Stakeholders identified a number of forces in the environment , including neighborhood a nd community violence, deteriorating infrastructure, and pollution . Respondents named community violence among the top three m ost influential forces impacting Delaware's health, and all partici pants indicated that violence i s a major concern in their communities . In recent years, c ommunity violence has increased, with a nearly 45 % increase in the number of shootings from 2011 -2013 (DE DHHS, 2016)1 and 154 shooting victims in 2013 alone . When compared to the rest of the nation, the state's homicide rate was reported to be as high as fourth overall (DE DHHS, 2016).2 One partici pant referenced the e ffect violence have on othe r health beh aviors, stating, \"People are afraid to leave the house,\" which can also be related to a lack of exercise in at -risk neighborhoods . There is opportunity in harnessing community moral e and \"getting everyone to rally around something good.\" More opportunities prevail on the disinvestment in urban areas, the impact of trauma, using predictive analytics to identify risk factors early on, and increasing efforts to develop programs that combat violence . Many of the identified forces blur categorical boundaries . For example, the lack of jobs paying higher wages is leading directly to bad choices , such as the \"underground economy\" (i.e., drug dealing), cites one stakeholder, which in turn is contributing to \"increased community violence.\" This is a t estament to the holistic mindset ne cessary for strategic planning. 1 National Center for Injury Prevention, Division of Violence Prevention: Elevated Rates of Urban Firearm Violence and Opportuniti es for Prevention -Wilmington, DE. http://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/cdcfinalreport.pdf . Accessed 10/26/2017. 2 National Center for Injury Prevention, Division of Violence Prevention: Elevated Rat es of Urban Firearm Violence and Opportunities for Prevention -Wilmington, DE. http://dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/cdcfinalreport.pdf . Accessed 10/26/2017. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 ETHICAL Ethical factors, such as health equity, are important to heighten our understanding of how health care ethics impact s many forces of change . Health inequity was identified as th e leading force of change in this category . According to the CDC , health equity is achieved when every person has the opportunity to \"attain his or her full health potential\" and no one is \"disadvantaged from achieving this potential because of social po sition or other socially determined circumstances.\" (CDC, 2016).1 Health inequities lead to differences in length of life, quality of life, rates of disease, disability, death, severity of disease, and access to treatment . Low health equity threatens acc ess to care for the poor; limits access to capable and culturally competent providers; increases focus on health ou tcomes rather than their origin; and leads to a continuation of health disparities in certain at -risk populations . The Affordable Care Act (ACA) increased opportunities for many to get the care they need, but others still cannot afford the high deductibles, according to one participant . The landscape of health , and the way we view care , has changed greatly since the ACA was implemented. Sinc e 2013, over 37,000 Delawareans gained insurance through the ACA by enrolling in a Marketplace plan. This has increased funding opportunities for programs that address the social determinants of health . The majority of stakeholders recognized this as a k ey area of focus during the revision of goals and strategies . LEGAL AND POLITICAL Legal and political forces are highly interconnected , given that health care legislation is the subject of much political activity. About 30 participants identified politi cally motivated priorities and resource allocation as an influential force of change . Other legal/political forces cited included public disenfranchisement from the government and political system, immigrat ion status, and, in 2017 , the anticipated legalization of marijuana in Delaware\" . Over the past several years, health care has remained a highly charged political issue . With the recent election of a new president, health care legislation will likely continue to change . A disenfranchised gover nment with politically motivated priorities and allocation of resources may also greatly impact how communities deliver services to their residents , according to participants . During the brainstorming session, stakeholders articulated that funding based o n relationships rather than efficacy continues to threaten health outcomes across Delaware . In addition, increased health care spending has greatly reduced available state and federal funds. However, \"sustained improvements cannot be made in health care alone,\" indicated one participant. \"There is opportunity to promote health across all policies.\" Transparency (i.e., how dollars are being spent/program outcomes) emerged as a theme in both groups as a method to build rapport, and increase reciprocal com munication and awareness of what is needed to achieve reform . 1 Centers for Disease Control and Preventi on: Health Equity. https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/healthequity/ . Accessed 10/26/2017. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 SCIENTIFIC Scientific advances in medical research and practice have the ability to impact individual and community health , but ensuring access to these advances can often be an issue . About half of the stakeholders agreed there is a lack of translation al research , limiting the use of evidence -based practice and new and responsive techniques in health care settings . Research on evidence -based medicine continues to grow and inform improved de livery of care . Comparative effectiveness studies also provide scientific evidence of the best medical procedures an d interventions. One stakeholder mentioned the need to expand careers that translate scientific knowledge into user -friendly terms, which would be especially useful in less well -funded systems such as mental health and addiction . Opening a medical school in the state is also a long -term goal that came up in these discussions . Limited primary care and mental health providers, and changes i n the health care system , were also cited as scientific forces . Current SHIP strategies have put supports in place to expand the future behavioral health workforce, such as working with secondary and higher education program s to develop curriculums that r espond to the growing need . However, stakeholders believe these efforts should remain on the agenda and continue to expand into other areas . Focusing on more targeted investments for higher pay, as well as specific career incentives , were discussed as po tential strategic foc i. One participant said the switch from grant funding to unit billing has posed a challenge in the behavioral health system . Creating incentives to improve the coordination of care as people move about the health care system (i.e., Triple Aim) is an opportunity to address this. SOCIAL A social force of change can be any societal element with the potential to influence people and their culture. Among the 27 forces named by stakeholders, nine forces were in the social category . The most com mon social forces named were addi ction/opioid dependency (n=30); increased menta l health diagnoses in youth (30); the aging population (20); increased e-cigarette (\"vaping\") use (15); and increasing non -English speaking populations (15 ). Other s mentioned were: 1) t he prison pipeline; 2) p oor collaboration between systems; 3) i ncreased pressure on educational institutions to address social/health issues; and 4) t he impact of trauma across the lifespan. Overd oses from prescription opioids are a driving factor in the 15 -year increase in opioid overdose deaths . Since 1999, the amount of prescription opioids sold in the U.S . nearly quadrupled , yet there has not been an overall change in the amoun t of pain that Americans report (Chang, Daubresse, Kruszewski, et al., 2014).1 This greater availability of opioid (and other) prescribed drugs has been accompanied by alarming increases in the negative consequences related to their abuse . Stakeholders cite a \"lack of a n 1 Daubresse M, Chang H, Yu Y, Viswanathan S, et al. Ambulatory diagnosis and treatment of nonmalignan t pain in the United States, 2000 - 2010. Medical Care 2013; 51(10): 870 -878. State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 organized, comprehensive plan\" to address these issues in the state . Participants see opportunity in education, the 2016 creation of a prescription drug action committee, and the use of a prescription moni toring program to identify high -risk prescribers . Over-prescribing is also affecting our youth . One stakeholder states, \"There is way too much anti -depression and anxiety medication being prescribed for the young.\" Much discussion focused on the influx of teens and adolescents going to school nurse s/school - based health centers s eeking mental health diagnoses and counseling . Schools across the state are overwhelmed and have nowher e to turn. One participant stated: \"Young people are vulnerable to exposure to adversity in childhood, the breakdown of the family structure, social media, cyber bullying, teen pregnancy, and community decay in urban settings .\" These childhood traumas can cause lasting health effects into adulthood if they are not properly addressed . There are opportunities to invest in p revention to reduce the burden of trauma and mental health, and to build resiliency and work skills . More supports are needed in schools to address these issues with early intervention , and to prevent teen suicide. Since t hese same themes and ideas were reiterated during the 2016 assessment process , they were therefore deemed necessary to consider during the 2017 strategic planning process. This is an excerpt from the 2012 For ces of Change Assessment Report: \"The health of the state will be affected as the social and economic demographics of Delaware change over time. Committee members cited that the state's growing elderly population will likely require more specialized care, such as hospice nurses, assisted living facilities, and transportation assist ance. Addressing the needs of this growing population may require changes and restructuring of the current state public health system. Delaware will also need to address widening health disparities between racial groups for chronic health problems such a s obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. With changing demographics and a widening gap between the socioeconomic and racial groups, more programs will need to focus on decreasing the disparity.\" Social forces can great ly impact community a nd individual hea lth. Collaborations and partnerships with community groups can extend services and reach underserved populations . State Health Needs Assessment, Delaware, 2017 TECHNOLOGICAL Technological advances serve as another force that affects the health of Delaware communities . Access to communication tec hnology , such as smart phones, wireless tablets, and laptops , changes how people work together and get information . Stakeholders noted that the reliance on technology can have ramifications such as information bias, de -personalization, cyber bullying, and sedentary lifestyles. However, participants believed that with the right strategies, public health practitioners can leverage these platforms in positive ways. Opportunities include: pushing more health education through technology platforms frequented by children; extending the reach of good public health messaging; and using social media to engage communities and make personal connections on a larger scale.
