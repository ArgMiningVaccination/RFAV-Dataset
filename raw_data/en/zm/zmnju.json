He takes the time to explain things to us and help us understand how our daughter is doing and the improvements her heart has made. My wife really likes him and will continue seeing him in the future to continue the care of our daughter. Dr. Chan also is also very kind to our daughter. When your child is in the hospital, you worry she is no longer a child and being a baby. Dr. Chan takes the time to talk to her and comment on her toys and decorations. Those little things mean so much to a parent whose baby is in the hospital. Our baby is still just a baby and Dr. Chan gets that. He's a very nice man and that matters to parents. - Dr. Chan has helped us understand the complexity of our daughter's CHD and has shown his dedication for doing whatever is necessary to making her life better. His knowledge and professional character is demonstrated at every visit to his clinic as well as every time he spends at our daughter's bed while she recovers in ICU. Dr. Chan is a valuable team member here at Seattle Children's Hospital. - - Manuscripts in Refereed Journals - Chan T, Kim J, Minich LL, Pinto NM, Waitzman NJSurgical volume, hospital quality, and hospitalization cost in congenital heart surgery in the United States. 25099030 Pediatric Cardiology, 2015 Jan. : 36(1)205-13 - Chan T, Lion KC, Mangione-Smith RRacial Disparities in Failure-to-Rescue among Children Undergoing Congenital Heart Surgery. 25556012 The Journal of Pediatrics, 2014 Dec 30 - Chan T, Pinto NM, Bratton SLRacial and insurance disparities in hospital mortality for children undergoing congenital heart surgery. 22349675 Pediatric Cardiology, 2012 Oct. : 33(7)1026-39 - Chan T, Thiagarajan RR, Frank D, Bratton SLSurvival after extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in infants and children with heart disease. 18954640 The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, 2008 Oct. : 136(4)984-92 Other Publications - Chan T, Klassen TPIn children with idiopathic short stature, what advantage does administering recombinant growth hormone have over observation in final adult height? 20019827 Paediatrics and Child Health, 2003 Nov. : 8(9)569-70 PMCID:PMC2794321 - Chan T, Klassen TPIn children with asthma who are currently using inhaled corticosteroids, are antileukotrienes more effective than placebo in improving clinical outcomes?: Part A. 20019952 Paediatrics & child health, 2003 Sept. : 8(7)445-6 PMCID:PMC2791655 - Radman, M; Chan, TFontan Physiology Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Handbook - - Presentations Title Event Location Date Race is an Independent Risk Factor for Mortality During Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Respiratory Support Society for Critical Care Medicine 44th Critical Care Congress Phoenix, AZ Jan. 2015 Racial Variations in Pre-ECMO Status Do Not Influence Outcomes in Neonates Requiring Respiratory ECMO Support Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting San Diego, CA Apr 26, 2015 Pre-Transplant Ventricular Assist Device Utilization Varies By Hospital Environment International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 35th Annual Meeting and Scientific Sessions Nice, France Apr 17, 2015 Insurance, Race and Hospital Mortality Following Congenital Heart Surgery Pediatric Academic Societies Annual Meeting Vancouver, BC May 2010 Racial Disparities in Failure-to-Rescue in Children Undergoing Congenital Heart Surgery in the USA Society for Critical Care Medicine 43rd Critical Care Congress San Francisco, CA Jan. 2014 Race is Associated with Mortality in Patients Undergoing Extracorporeal Cardiac Support Society of Thoracic Surgeons 51st Annual Meeting San Diego, CA Jan 26, 2015 Complex Chronic Conditions Among Children Undergoing Cardiac Surgery Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting Vancouver, BC.
