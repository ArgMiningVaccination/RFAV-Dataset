The objective of the Convention is to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and its compounds. It provides guidance on all activities and actions that assenting nations should progressively adopt and implement in the long run quest to eliminate both direct and indirect exposure of both humans and the environment to mercury. The Minamata Convention on Mercury was adopted by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on 10 October 2013 in Japan and was opened for signature thereafter. Uganda assented to the Minamata Convention and it is under obligation to implement all the activities and actions set forth by the Convention. However, to meet her obligations, it is essential that the country has; Inventory of mercury sources, adequate policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks and capacities to guide the implementation process. With funding from GEF, the Government of Uganda has been implementing the Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) to determine the national requirements and needs of the convention for its implementation. The purpose of the MIA is to strengthen national decision-making toward ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury and build national capacity towards implementation of future obligations. The other objective of the MIA is derived from Article 30 (paragraph 4) of the Minamata Convention which states that, \"Each State or regional economic integration organization is encouraged to transmit to the Secretariat at the time of its ratification, acceptance, approval or accession of the Convention information on its measures to implement the Convention\". Under the Convention, assenting countries are obliged to develop and implement strategies and best practices that minimize and eliminate human and environmental exposure to mercury. With funding from UNEP through GEF, National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has conducted a Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) project to strengthen national decision making towards ratification of the Minamata Convention and build capacity towards implementation of future provisions. This report, therefore, provides the results of the Minamata Initial Assessment. It also reviews the ability and capacity of existing domestic legislations and institutions to implement the Minamata Convention on Mercury that prescribes elimination where feasible and otherwise minimize exposure of humans and environment; and, identifies gaps that current legislations and institutions do not address and makes suggestions on how these gaps could be bridged if Uganda is to meet the targets set by the Convention. It is my hope that that this Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report meets the expectations of all Ugandans and stakeholders who will be involved in the different programmes and activities to ensure the implementation of the Convention's obligations. HON. CHEPTORIS SAM MINISTER OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENT HON. CHEPTORIS SAMNational Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report ivACKNOWLEDGEMENT The preparation of the Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report was a concerted effort involving a number of stakeholders including, Min- istries, Departments, Agencies, Civil Society Organisations and Private Sector. With funding from UNEP through GEF, National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) conducted a Minamata Initial Assess- ment (MIA) project to strengthen national decision making towards ratification of the Minamata Convention and build capacity towards implementation of future provisions. Mercury's unique characteristics and availability as a material through- out the ages has allowed it to be widely used in many products and applications. The report therefore highlights the results of the Mi- namata Initial Assessment. It also reviews the ability and capacity of existing domestic legislations and institutions to implement the Minamata Convention that prescribes elimination where feasible and otherwise minimise exposure of humans and environment; and, identi- fies gaps that current legislations and institutions do not address and makes suggestions on how these gaps could be bridged if Uganda is to meet the targets set by the Convention. It is my hope that this Report will go a long way in guiding the users appreciate and apprehend strategic planning and decision making in line with mercury undertakings to ensure sustainable development.

Uganda has signed the treaty, but has not ratified it yet. The objective of the Minamata Convention on Mercury is to protect the human health and the environment from the anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. The treaty calls for its Parties to set up and implement a number of regulatory and policy measures to control the supply and trade of mercury and/or its compounds, including certain specific sources of mercury such as primary mining, mercury-added products such as dental amalgams, various measurement equipment, fluorescent bulbs and, manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are used, as well as artisanal and small scale gold mining. In addition, the Convention requires its parties to control air emissions, water and land releases of mercury and/or its compounds by establishing measures that include one or more of the following, as appropriate; Release limit values, use of BAT and BEP, multi-pollutant control strategy that will deliver co-benefits for control of mercury releases and alternative measures to reduce releases from relevant sources. It also contains provisions on the environmentally sound interim storage of mercury and on mercury wastes, contaminated sites, public health and information dissemination aspects. Mercury has a wide range of industrial and chemical applications. Despite its wide applicability, mercury is a highly toxic element which can result into fatalities if exposed to humans and the environment. Under the Convention, assenting countries are obliged to develop and implement strategies and best practices that minimize and eliminate human and environmental exposure to mercury. With funding from UNEP through GEF, National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) - Uganda has conducted a Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) project to strengthen national decision making towards ratification of the Minamata Convention and build capacity towards implementation of future provisions. The project had the following objectives; a) Establishing of a coordination mechanism and organisation of the process. b) Assessing of the national infrastructure and capacity for the management of mercury, including na- tional legislation. c) Developing of a mercury inventory using the UNEP mercury toolkit and strategies to identify and assess mercury contaminated sites. d) Identifying of challenges, needs and opportunities to implement the Minamata convention on Mer- cury. e) Preparing, validating of the National MIA report and implementation of awareness raising activities and dissemination of results. This report, therefore, provides the results of the Minamata Initial Assessment in Uganda. Mercury Inventory, Sources and Stockpiles United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) toolkit for quantification of mercury emissions and releases has been used to estimate quantities of mercury from all anthropogenic sources. Assessment results reveal a total mercury output of 31,087 kg/y. In Uganda, the major source of mercury emissions and releases is primary metal production (gold extraction with mercury amalgamation processes) as shown Table 1 below.National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 1Table 1: Total mercury output Source category Calculated Hg output, Kg/y Air WaterLand By-prod- ucts General wasteSector spec metal pro- duction12,138 3,333 3,027 - - 0.1 18,498 60 Waste incineration and burning5,308 - - - -13.7 5,322 17 Production of recycled metals (\"secondary met - al production\")12 - 13 - 12 - 37 0 Intentional use of Con - sumer products1,192 1051,241 - 2,220 - 4,758 15 Waste deposition 114 300 939 - 5857.8 1,469 1 Extraction and use of fuels/ energy sources952 - - - - 0.3 952 3 Other intentional product/processes44 173 51 8.6 146 85.8 508 2 Crematoria and cemeteries 1 - 362 - - - 363 1 Production of other minerals 165 - - 70.7 - - 236 1 SUM OF QUANTIFIED RE - LEASES19,926 3,719 4,770 79 2,436 158 31,087 100 Mercury can neither be created nor destroyed; all the mercury released is absorbed or deposited into release pathways. The main pathway for mercury released from point and non-point sources is air (atmosphere) followed by water (marine and freshwater bodies, including via waste water systems), land, general waste, and sectors specific waste disposal respectively as shown in Figure 1 below. Another important pathway is \"by-products and impurities\" in which case mercury flows back into the market through by-products and mercury containing products. Figure 1: Mercury output pathways Specifically, gold (and silver) extraction with mercury amalgamation processes; Batteries with mercury; Informal waste burning; biomass fired and heat production (including charcoal production) and informal dumping of general waste make the largest contributions to mercury emissions (into air). Similarly, gold (and silver) extraction with mercury amalgamation processes is the principal contributor National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 2of mercury releases (water and land). The other prominent contributors of mercury releases are; Waste water treatment; Informal dumping of waste; Cosmetics and related products; Dental amalgam fillings; Manometers and laboratory chemicals and equipment with mercury. Policy, Regulatory and Institutional Framework This report analyses both the policy and institutional framework in respect to effective management of mercury supply, trade, use, and disposal. The assessment findings show no existing stand-alone laws for mercury management currently in place in Uganda. However, there are enabling laws that facilitate mercury management with a broad focus on preventing human and environmental exposure to haz - ardous and toxic chemicals. As such, these laws may be subject to selective interpretation. Similarly, the assessment reveals that there is no single institution with an overall mandate to regulate mercury supply, trade and use. There are a number of institutions directly involved in regulation of chemicals and standards and as such are indirectly involved in mercury regulation. It is further revealed that there is no formal coordination mechanism existing between the various stakeholders and institutions; this poses significant challenges to effective regulation of mercury use as individual and arbitrary efforts seldom result into broader gains at national level. The regulatory (policy) and institutional (capacity) recommendations for effective implementation of the Minamata Convention are summarized in Table 2 below.

The objective of the Convention is to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and its compounds. It provides guidance on all activities and actions2 that assenting nations should progressively adopt and implement in the long run quest to eliminate both direct and indirect exposure of both humans and the environment to mercury. Uganda assented to the Minamata Convention and it is under obligation to implement all the activities and actions set forth by the Convention. However, to meet her obligations, it is essential that the coun- try has; Inventory of mercury sources, adequate policy, regulatory and institutional frameworks and capacities to guide the implementation process. With funding from GEF, the Government of Uganda has been implementing the Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) to determine the national requirements and needs of the convention for its implementation. The purpose of the MIA is to strengthen national de- cision-making toward ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury and build national capacity towards implementation of future obligations. The other objective of the MIA is derived from Article 30 (paragraph 4) of the Minamata Convention which states that \"Each State or regional economic integra- tion organization is encouraged to transmit to the Secretariat at the time of its ratification, acceptance, approval or accession of the Convention information on its measures to implement the Convention.\" Uganda's jurisprudence has no specific policy and legal framework on the management and regulation of mercury use, supply, trade and disposal. Nevertheless, guidance can be drawn from a number of domestic legislations. However, these are not exhaustive and may fail to provide guidance on activities and actions specific to mercury management. This MIA therefore reviews the ability and capacity of existing domestic legislations and institutions to implement the Minamata Convention that prescribes elimination where feasible and otherwise mini- mise exposure of humans and environment. It also identifies gaps that current legislations and institu- tions do not address and makes suggestions on how these gaps could be bridged if Uganda is to meet the targets set by the Convention. Specifically, the MIA was guided by three (3) main objectives; 1) To undertake a mercury inventory in the country; 2) To determine existing policy and regulatory gaps to implementation of Uganda's obligation under the convention; and, 3) To assess exiting institutional and capacity gaps to implementation of Uganda's obligation under the Convention. Mercury and Mercury Poisoning Mercury is a highly vaporizable silver white metal which is liquid at room temperature. It belongs to group IIB of the periodic table. It is used in electrical and electronic devices, switches, thermostats and relays, mea- suring and control equipment, energy efficient fluorescent light bulbs, batteries, mascara, skin lightening creams and other cosmetics, dental fillings and a host of other consumables worldwide (Parson and Percival, 2005). Despite having a wide range of unique industrial and medical applications and uses, mercury similarly has a number of negative effects on humans and the environment including;National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 6a) Disrupting the development of fetuses and young children; b) In the vapour form, mercury is rapidly absorbed into the blood stream and when inhaled it damages the central nervous system, thyroid, kidneys, lungs, immune system, eyes, gums and skin; and, c) In children it can cause neurological damage resulting into symptoms such as; mental retardation, seizures, vision and hearing loss, delayed development, language disorders and memory loss (ATS- DR, 1999; Clarkson 2002; Counter and Buchanan 2004; Wigle 2003). Because of its significant negative effects on human and environmental health, reduction and elimination of environmental and human exposure to mercury needs not to be over- emphasized. It is against this back- ground that in 2013, in Minamata - Japan, countries including Uganda, signed a Convention to protect hu- man health and environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and its compounds. Uganda is not a primary producer of mercury. However, substantial amounts of mercury are imported into the country directly or indirectly as a component of other products especially cosmetics and consumer prod- ucts. The main mercury exposure activity in Uganda is Artisanal and Small scale Gold Mining (ASGM) where it is used to concentrate gold. Humans are also exposed to mercury through lightening creams and lotions. A number of mercury containing creams have hitherto been available on the Ugandan market. Whereas these cosmetics products3 have since been banned, they still find their way onto the market through the country's porous borders.National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 7Chapter I: National Background Information 1.1 Country Profile 1.1.1 Geographical, and Demographic Profile Uganda is located in East Africa and lies across the equator, about 800 kilometers in land from the Indian Ocean. It lies between 10 29' South and 40 12' North latitude, 290 34 East and 3500' East longitude. The country is landlocked, bordered by Kenya in the East; South Sudan in the North; Democratic Republic of Congo in the West; Tanzania in the South; and Rwanda in South West. It has a total area of 241,551 square kilometers, of which land area covers 200,523 square kilometers (UBOS, 2016a). Uganda has a diverse culture. It encompasses religion, tribe, traditions and beliefs, value systems and language, among others. Uganda's population is made up of different ethnic groups with unique customs and norms. These play a major role in shaping the behavior and ways of life of people in the country. Lately, some of the traditional values have changed due to integration as a result of migration and/or inter-marriages. Some cultural groupings are headed by traditional kings or chiefs who are not politically elected but have an indirect role in community governance and moral build up (UBOS, 2016b). The main ethnic Baganda are the largest ethnic group in Uganda and comprise approximately 17% of the population. 4 Language is one of the uniting factors in any society. In Uganda, while English is the official language, there are a number of other languages spoken. However, Swahili is being promoted in the spirit of regional integration within the East African Community (EAC). Uganda's Constitution (1994) allows freedom of worship. There are various religious groupings in the country including; Christians, Muslims and others. Uganda has a population of 34.6 million people (UBOS, 2016a). The population dividend is such that urban towns and districts have more people per square kilometer than the rural areas. Table 3 shows the least and most populated districts in Uganda. Despite urban centers having a high population per square meter, the bulk of Uganda's population live in rural areas in extended and semi extended households which are highly dependent on the natural ecosystem goods and services for their subsistence. Of the 34.6 million people in Uganda only 7.2 million were living in urban centers, defined as recognised urban centers, in 2016. Table 3: Least and Most Populated Districts in Uganda Most Populated Districts Least Populated Districts District Population District Population Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 81.1.2 Political Profile Uganda is a presidential republic with a multi-party system. The executive is made up of the President and the cabinet of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister. The legislative branch is represented by the Parliament of Uganda and the judicial branch includes the Supreme, Constitutional, and Commercial Courts. The system is based on a democratic parliamentary system with universal suffrage for all citizens over 18 years of age. The country is divided into 112 districts and one capital city as shown in figure 2 below . Districts are further subdivided into counties, sub-counties and parishes. The role of these Local Governments is to implement and monitor Government programs at the respective levels. Over time, the administrative units have been sub-divided with the aim of easing administration and improving the delivery of services (UBOS, 2016a). Figure Figue 2: Map of Uganda showing districtsNational Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 91.1.3 Profiles of Economic Sectors According to Uganda statistical abstract (UBOS, 2016b), services make the biggest contribution to the country's GDP as shown in table 4 below.Services are followed by agriculture, forestry and fishing. Industry follows afterwards and contributes 19.8% to Uganda's GDP. Specifically, the contribution of mining to overall GDP in the country is very small (0.6%). Most of Uganda's mining and minerals processing facilities are privately owned characterized with limited capital and technology to fully exploit the available resources. The low contribution to overall GDP is greatly attributed to; rudimentary methods of work, clandestine nature of the sector activities and tax evasion.

The overall goal of NDPII is to transform Uganda into a National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 10middle income country by the year 2020. There are four main objectives under this goal and these include; a) To increase sustainable production, productivity and value addition in key growth opportunities; b) To increase the stock and quality of strategic infrastructure to accelerate the country's competitive - ness; c) To enhance human capital development; and, d) To strengthen mechanisms for quality, effective and efficient service delivery. The NDP is implemented through Sector Investment Plans (SIPs), Local Government Development Plans (LGDPs), Annual work plans and Budgets of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). The NDPII also seeks to leverage the international and regional frameworks such as Africa Agenda 2063 and Post 2015 Development Agenda to exploit growth opportunities. Uganda is party and subscribes to the 1992 Rio resolution and blue print for sound environmental management. 1.1.5 Environmental and Natural Resources Overview Uganda's natural resource base is one of the richest and most diverse in Africa. As such, the country's economy relies heavily on goods and services provided by natural capital5. Therefore sound use and management of the environment and natural resources is central and emphasized in all government policies, plans and strategies that strive to achieve sustainable development and poverty alleviation. National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) is a semi-autonomous institution established in May 1995 under the National Environment Act Cap 153. NEMA is the principal agency charged with the responsibility of coordinating, monitoring, regulating and supervising environment management in Uganda. NEMA advises Government and spearheads the development of environmental policies, laws, regulations, standards and guidelines for sound environmental management.The mandate, vision, goal and objectives of NEMA aim at ensuring and promoting a clean, healthy, and pro- ductive environment for sustainable socio-economic development in Uganda. National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 11Chapter II: Mercury Inventory and Identification of Emissions and Releases This section identifies the sources and quantities of mercury emissions to air and releases to land and water. It also provides an overview of the initial inventory of mercury in Uganda. In developing the mercury inventory, the assessment has used the UNEP toolkit level 2 for identification and quantification of mercury releases considering 2014 as a reference year. The toolkit was designed to guide inventory developers through the different stages of identifying sources and quantifying the emissions and releases from different sources. 2.1 Mercury Releases, Stockpiles, Supply and Trade 2.1.1 Mercury Release Sources in Uganda The main categories of mercury sources in Uganda include; extraction and use of fuels, primary metal production, production of other minerals and materials with mercury, intentional use of mercury as an auxiliary material in industrial processes, consumer products with intentional use of mercury, other intentional products/process uses, production of recycled metals, waste incineration and waste deposition/ landfilling and waste water treatment and residue deposits as shown in Table 5 below.

As such mercury releases and emissions (inputs) are absorbed or trans-located into the natural habitats (land, air and water) in a repetitive cyclical manner. Mercury inputs are the amounts of mercury that are made available for potential releases through anthro- pogenic activities in the country. This therefore refers to the sources of mercury in the country or the various activities that introduce mercury into the environment as shown in table 6 and 7 below. For waste categories, the \"inputs\" are calculated to show the distribution of mercury in waste through the different waste treatment activities; though waste is not an original source of input mercury into society (except in case of waste import). Waste \"inputs\" are marked in italics. The origin of mercury in waste and waste water produced in the country is mercury in products and materials. Waste fractions and waste water therefore do not represent original mercury inputs to society (except imported waste). Waste and waste water may however represent substantial flows of mercury through society. The following were found to be the major flows of mercury with waste and waste water; Informal waste burning, informal dumping of general waste, controlled landfills and waste water systems. The releases from informal waste burning and dumping of general waste is a consequence of use of mercury added products and absence of collection systems for mercury added products. The main source category of mercury emissions and releases is primary metal production. The leading contributor of emissions is gold (and silver) extraction using mercury amalgamation process and the second most important source of mercury is waste incineration. This is followed by the use of consumer products (thermometers, electrical switches, and cosmetics, batteries with mercury and light sources that contain mercury). Waste deposition and extraction and use of fuels also make significant contributions to the mercury releases and emissions respectively. The least contributing sources are; production of recycled metals, cement production, cremation and cemeteries and other intentional products.

Another output pathway is through \"by-products and impurities\" in which case mercury flows back into the market with by-products and products. The mercury pathways are explained in detail in Tables 8 and 9. Gold (and silver) extraction with mercury amalgamation processes, batteries with mercury, informal waste burning, biomass fired and heat production (including charcoal production) and informal dumping of general waste made the largest contributions to mercury emissions and releases to the atmosphere. Similarly, gold (and silver) extraction with mercury amalgamation processes was the largest contributor of mercury releases to both water and land. The other prominent contributors of mercury release to water are; waste water treatment, informal dumping of waste, cosmetics and related products, dental amalgam fillings, manometers and laboratory chemicals and equipment with mercury. For land, other than the mercury amalgamation process, the other important sources of mercury releases are; batteries with mercury (batteries with mercury are also the biggest sources of mercury in general waste), electrical switches and relays, cemeteries, informal dumping of waste, manometers among others as shown in 9.

Air Mercury emissions to the atmosphere from point sources and diffuse sources from which mercury may be spread locally or over long distances with air masses; for example, from: Point sources such as coal fired power plants, metal smelter, waste incineration; Diffuse sources as small scale gold mining, informally burned waste with fluores- cent lamps, batteries, thermometers. Water Mercury releases to aquatic environments and to waste water systems: Point sources and diffuse sources from which mercury will be spread to marine environments (oceans), and freshwaters (rivers, lakes, etc.). for example, releases from: Wet flue cleaning systems from coal fired power plants; Industry, households, etc. to aquatic environments; Surface run-off and leachate from mercury contaminated soil and waste dumps Land Mercury releases to soil, the terrestrial environment: General soil and ground water. For example, releases from: Solid residues from flue gas cleaning on coal fired power plants used for gravel road construction; Uncollected waste products dumped or buried informally Local un-confined releases from industry such as on site hazardous waste storage/ burial Spreading of sewage sludge with mercury content on agricultural land (sludge used as fertilizer) Application on land, seeds or seedlings of pesticides with mercury compounds By-products and impurities By-products that contain mercury, which are sent back into the market and cannot be directly allocated to environmental releases, for example: Gypsum wallboard produced from solid residues from flue gas cleaning on coal fired power plants. Sulphuric acid produced from desulphurization of flue gas (flue gas cleaning) in non-ferrous metal plants with mercury trace concentrations Chlorine and sodium hydroxide produced with mercury-based chlor-alkali technol- ogy; with mercury trace concentrations Metal mercury or calomel as by-product from non-ferrous metal mining (high mer- cury concentrations) General waste General waste: Also called municipal waste in some countries. Typically, household and institution waste where the waste undergoes a general treatment, such as incineration, landfilling or informal dumping or burning. The mercury sources to waste are consumer products with intentional mercury content (batteries, thermometers, fluorescent tubes, etc.) as well as high volume waste like printed paper, plastic, etc., with small trace con- centrations of mercury. Sector specific waste treatment /disposalWaste from industry and consumers which is collected and treated in separate systems, and in some cases recycled; for example, Confined deposition of solid residues from flue gas cleaning on coal fired power plants on dedicated sites. Hazardous industrial waste with high mercury content which is deposited in dedicated, safe sites Hazardous consumer waste with mercury content, mainly separately collected and safely treated batteries, thermometers, mercury switches, lost teeth with amalgam fillings etc. Confined deposition of tailings and high volume rock/waste from extraction of non-ferrous metals The country-specific waste treatment/disposal method is described for each sub-catego- ry in the detailed report sections below.National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 182.2 Extraction and Use of Fuels/Energy Sources 2.2.1 Other Coal Uses - Combustion Data from COMTRADE6 for the recent years (2011 to 2015) for the sub categories with HS codes; 270111 - bituminous coal, not agglomerated, 270112 anthracite or bituminous, not agglomerated, 2704 - Retort carbon, coke or semi-coke of coal, lignite pea, 2706 - Tar from coal, lignite or peat, other mineral tars, 2707 - Coal -tar distillation products including oils and 270779 - Coal tar distillation products has been considered and average consumption derived as seen in tables 10,11,12,13 and 14 below.

Gold and silver amalgamation is the biggest mercury emitting and releasing activity in this category. Primary ferrous metal production also makes significant contributions to mercury outputs of this category. 2.3.1 The Status of Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining in Uganda Whereas there are a number of licensed mining companies, gold mining in Uganda is predominantly done by unlicensed and informal artisanal and small-scale miners. The DGSM (2013) estimates that Artisanal and Small Scale Gold (ASG) miners contribute most of the gold mined in the country. The known ASGM districts detailed in Annex III. It is here that gold worth billions of shillings is traded annually. The 'COWI ASGM site investigation reporting system' used by NEMA revealed that; a) The price of gold per gram varied from USD 27.3 (UGX. 90,000) to USD 33.5 (UGX 110, 500) in 2016. The cost of panning a sack (5 to 7 basins) of concentrates was USD 4 (UGX. 14,000). b) The daily miner income per working day ranges from USD 3 (UGX 10,000) to 5.4 (UGX 18,000). c) One gram of Hg costs USD 0.18 to 0.30 (UGX. 600 to 1,000). d) Mercury to gold ratio applied (Hg: Au) is 2 to 3g Hg: 1g Au. It is, therefore, very cheap to purchase mercury and its recovery efforts are considered useless by majority of the artisanal miners. Different methods are used at different sites to extract gold from the ores as briefly explained below; Mercury amalgamation This is the most widely used method to extract gold from the ores. Mercury is added to crushed/whole ore and the resultant amalgam is subjected to heat. Mercury vaporizes off leaving gold. Some artisans use retorts for mercury recovery though the idea has not been fully appreciated Plate 2: Physical crushing of oresNational Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 25 Plate 3: Gold and mercury amalgam on bare hand Plat 4: Panning of core concentrates using mercury to capture gold Plate 5: Use of a Centrifuge in Busia District Plate 6: Use of centrifuge to concentrate gold in Busia DistrictNational Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 26 Plate 7: Children panning gold in a river, Bukwo District Cyanidation This is usually used on ores of very low gold concentration (sometimes tailings after mercury amalgamation) - less than 10 g/t or 0.001 % (mass basis). At these concentrations the use of aqueous chemical (hydrometallurgical) extraction processes is an economically viable method of extracting the gold from the ore. Typical hydrometallurgical gold recovery involves a leaching step during which the gold is dissolved in an aqueous medium, followed by the separation of the gold bearing solution from the residues, or adsorption of the gold onto activated carbon. After elution from the activated carbon the gold is further concentrated by precipitation or electro-deposition. Use of cyanide, for gold extraction, has been greatly appreciated within the artisanal mining sites of Mubende District. Use of borax Recently, professional environmentalists with Uganda National Association of Community and Occupational Health (UNACOH) and Ban Toxics from the Philippines, with support from the Danish Government through Dialogos, a Danish NGO, started promoting a Mercury-Free gold mining system using borax in Mubende, Buhweju, Bugiri, Namayingo, Busia, Moroto and Nakapiripirit Districts. Borax, also known as sodium bo- rate, is classified as non-toxic, causes no known chronic health effects. This method is so far reported the best with more gold extracted/ton of ore. Other non-mercury extraction methods including; hand picking of alluvial gold as experienced in Kaabong District, panning and swirling in river beds have been reported in Katenga mining site in Buhweju District7. The Mercury Supply Chain The mercury value chain in Uganda is illegal, informal and operates underground with its own sets of rules and regulations. Mercury used to amalgamate gold is smuggled into Uganda from Kenya, Democratic Repub- lic of Congo and Tanzania through the country's porous borders. The Customs Officers are neither trained nor have equipment to detect presence of mercury in products and packages. Mercury that is smuggled into the country for use at ASGM sites is bought predominantly from gold buyers mostly Asians in Uganda's capital Kampala. At ASGM sites, miners actively deny using mercury doing whole ore amalgamation. In cir- cumstances where they confess, they don't divulge their mercury sources. Because gold processing using mercury mainly occurs at ASGM sites, disbanding these sites can greatly re-National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 27duce mercury use in gold mining in Uganda. This has a greater possibility of fuelling mercury use and trade further underground. In underground processes, family members, especially children and women are at a higher risk of exposure to vapours with devastating effects on pregnancies and children. More toxic versions such as Inorganic mercury compounds where Mercury occurs inorganically as salts such as mercury(II)chlo - ride, Mercuric cyanide (also known as Mercury (II) cyanide), Hg(CN)2 and organic mercury compounds may be illicitly supplied in such scenarios. 2.3.1.1 Gold (and Silver) Extraction with Mercury Amalgamation According to UNEP (2012), 17,050 artisanal miners in Uganda produced 1,210 kg of gold in 2008. A technical committee in 2010 reported that there were about 150,000 miners in Uganda. Assuming a 30% increment in the number of miners in the country for the year 2014, the quantity of gold produced estimation is as follows; Number of miners in 2014 = (1.3* 150,000) = 195,000 miners Amount of gold produced in 2014 = (1,210*195,000)/17,050 = 13,839 kg of Gold At the ASGM sites, two major gold extraction techniques are used; mercury amalgamation and non-mercury technics. Using 'COWI ASGM site investigation reporting system' developed for the estimation of mercury use (World Bank, 2016); NEMA estimates that \"10% of the gold produced is obtained by use of methods other than mercury amalgamation. The rest of the gold produced by mercury amalgamation was extracted by concentrate method where 95% of them use concentrate. Nearly 5% of the artisanal miners who apply the concentrate techniques use retorts\". Other methods used are panning and segregating gold. This information was recorded at ASGM sites in the districts of; Mubende, Namayingo and Busia. the districts of Kaabong, Moroto and Buhweju, about 95% of the gold is produced by panning and separation without use of mercury. From the explanations above, estimates of gold produced by the use of other methods other than mercury amalgamation (and only simple concentration methods applied) is as below; = 0.1*13,839 = 1,384 kg of gold produced Gold extraction with mercury amalgamation processes = 0.9*13,839 =12,455 kg of gold produced From concentrate = 0.95*12,455 = 11,832 kg of gold produced From whole ore = 0.05*12,455 = 623 kg of gold produced Use retorts = 0.05*11,832 = 592 kg of gold produced Gold (and Silver) Extraction with Mercury Amalgamation results are detailed in tables 22,23 and 24 below.National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 28Table 22: Summary of Input and Results of Gold from Whole Ore From whole ore Unit Production Use Disposal Activity rate kg gold produced 623 - - Input factor for phase kg Hg/kg gold produced 5 - - Calculated input to phase kg Hg 3,115 - - Output distribution factors for phase: - Air 0.25 - - - Water 0.40 - - - Land 0.35 - - - Products 0.00 - - - General waste treatment 0.00 - - - Sector specific waste treatment 0.00 - - Calculated outputs/releases to:- Air kg Hg 778.75 - - - Water kg Hg 1,246.00 - - - Land kg Hg 1,090.25 - - - Products 0.00 - - - General waste treatment 0.00 - - - Sector specific waste treatment 0.00 - - Table23: Summary of Input and Results of Gold from Concentrate From concentrate Unit Production Use Disposal Activity rate kg gold produced 11,832 - - Input factor for phase kg Hg/kg gold produced 1.3 - - Calculated input to phase kg Hg 15,382 - - Output distribution factors for phase: - Air 0.75 - - - Water 0.13 - - - Land 0.12 - - - Products 0.00 - - - General waste treatment 0.00 - - - Sector specific waste treatment 0.00 - - Calculated outputs/releases to:- Air kg Hg 11,536.50 - - - Water kg Hg 1,999.66 - - - Land kg Hg 1,845.84 - - - Products 0.00 - - - General waste treatment 0.00 - - - Sector specific waste treatment 0.00 - -National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 29Table 24: Summary of Input and Results of Gold from Concentrate and with Use of Retorts From concentrate and with use of retorts Unit Production Use Disposal Activity rate kg gold produced 592 - - Input factor for phase kg Hg/kg gold produced 0.55 - - Calculated input to phase kg Hg 326 - - Output distribution factors for phase: - Air 0.20 - - - Water 0.40 - - - Land 0.40 - - - Products 0.00 - - - General waste treatment 0.00 - - - Sector specific waste treatment 0.00 - - Calculated outputs/releases to: - Air kg Hg 65.20 - - - Water kg Hg 130.40 - - - Land kg Hg 130.40 - - - Products 0.00 - - - General waste treatment 0.00 - - - Sector specific waste treatment 0.00 - - 2.3.1.2 Gold extraction and initial processing methods other than mercury amalgamation The method used is purely physical separation of alluvial ore (directly in the river) and only picking out pure gold lumps. In some cases, it involves panning the ore with water in a basin and decanting out to separate out the gold. Since there is no mercury use involved, and no chemical or thermal processing used, it is in con- clusion considered that this activity is by and large not a significant mercury release source, thus the activity has been omitted from the inventory emissions and release estimations. 2.3.2 Primary Ferrous Metal Production According to a report by the US Geological Survey, Minerals Year Book (2014), 41,959 MT iron ore was ex- tracted in Uganda. In the absence of information on the iron content of the ore, it has been considered to correspond to the pig iron production which is detailed in table 25 below. The quantity reported is propor- tionally low because the industry is not yet well established.

The construction industry is steadily improving all through and consequently the quantities of recycled ferrous metals are increasing. It is reported by US Geological survey8, Minerals Year book 2014; 67,000 MT of ferrous metals were recycled in Uganda. Considering an average weight of a vehicle at 2 MT, the quantity of recycled ferrous material is 33,500 vehicles. The summary of Input and results of Recycled Ferrous Metals (Iron and Steel) are contained in table 26 below.

From the US Geological Survey, Minerals Year Book (2014), 2,141,000 MT of cement were produced in Uganda. It is assumed that all the cement produced is without co-incineration of waste and use simple particle matter technology for their pollution abatement systems.

Findings from field visits by NEMA indicate about 2,782 MT of hazardous waste were incinerated in the country in 2014. The practice is usually done at specific locations with simple particulate matter systems for abating pollution. Results on incineration of hazardous waste are detailed in table 28 below.National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 32Table 28: Summary of Input and Results of Incineration of Hazardous Waste Incineration of hazardous waste Unit Production Use Disposal Activity rate t(waste incinerated)/y 2,782 Input factor for phase g Hg/t (waste incinerated) 24 Calculated input to phase kg Hg 67 Output distribution factors for phase: - Air - 0.90 - Water - 0.00 - Land - 0.00 - Products - 0.00 - General waste treatment - 0.00 - Sector specific waste treatment - 0.10 Calculated outputs/releases to: - Air kg Hg - 60.30 - Water - 0.00 - Land - 0.00 - Products - 0.00 - General waste treatment - 0.00 - Sector specific waste treatment kg Hg 6.70 2.5.2 Incineration of Medical Waste To quantify the total generated medical waste in Uganda, the number of medical facilities in variance with their waste generation rates has been considered by categorising them into; National Referral Hospitals, Regional Referral Hospital and General Hospitals. Based on the available literature Uganda has 2 National Referral Hospitals, 14 Regional Referral and 139 General Hospitals as reported by the Ministry of Health. Most of the medical waste is believed to be generated from the mentioned facilities. National Referral Hospitals are estimated to generate an average of 1338 kg of medical waste per day. A case study (NEMA, 2014) at Soroti Regional Referral Hospital gives an average of 92 kg of waste (all waste combined) per day and 87 kg of waste is estimated for General Hospitals. Medical waste is assumed to be 40% of the waste in Referral and General Hospitals. In this assessment, it is assumed medical wastes are incinerated at facilities under simple particulate matter systems. The quantities of medical waste are estimated as shown below; Amount of medical waste from National Referral Hospitals; = 2*1,338*365 = 976,740 kg Amount of medical waste from Regional Referral Hospitals; = 0.4*14*92*365=188,048 kg Amount of medical waste from General Hospitals; =0.4*139*87*365National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 33=1,765,578 kg Total medical waste generated in the country (MT) = (976,740 + 188,048 + 1,765,578)/1,000 = 2,930 The summary of Inputs and results of incineration of medical waste is detailed in table 29 below.

Selection of the urban areas for the study was based on urban population and socio-cultural variations. The findings indicated that waste was predominantly biodegradable (78%) with a generation rate of 0.55 (0.3 to 0.66) kg/capita/day9 and collection coverage of 43.7%. A range of methods involving interviews, questionnaires, observations and document reviews were used to obtain quantitative and qualitative data. The survey found out that the average waste generation rate of 0.55 kg/cap/day was comparable to National Environment Management Authority (2007) results. Uncollected wastes are burnt (74.1%) or dumped (15.2%) in open places. The rest is understood to be well managed under city and municipality authorities. The above generation rate and the human population of Uganda as of 2014 (34,856,813 inhabitants) were National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 34used to extrapolate the total waste generated in 2014. The amount of Informal waste burning (open fire waste burning on landfills and informally dumped) is as below; 0.741*total waste generated in the country in 2014 0.741*34,856,813*0.55*365 = 5,185,151,360.42 Kg ( 5,185,151 MT ) The summary of input and results of waste burning are detailed in table 30 below.

The default factors were based on literature data of mercury contents in waste and wastewater, and this data was only available from developed countries. The following test of the results was performed to qualify the results for these sources. The test made for general waste compares the calculated inputs to all four general waste sub-categories with the sum of general waste outputs from intentional mercury uses in products plus processes as follows, using data from the Inventory Level 2 spread sheet:In the IL2 spread sheet the test was done as follows; tab \"Level 2-Summary\": A test with original IL2 input of g/ tonne of 2*(J23 + Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 35(0 + 25,926 + 30 + 31,314) > 2*(0 +33)) 57,270> 8,013.5 ( test is positive) A test with revised input factor of 1 g/ tonne of waste: (0 + 5,185 + 6 + 1,078) < 2*(0 + (6 + 132 + 60 + 4,025 + 32 + 62)) 6,269< 8,632.34 (test is negative) The test made for wastewater compares the calculated inputs to wastewater treatment with the sum of outputs to water from intentional mercury uses in products plus processes as follows, using data from the Inventory level 2 spread sheets:In the IL2 spread sheet the test was done as follows; tab \"Level 2-Summary\": E69 > 2*(G23 + (G36 to G53)).380 < 2*(2,301 + 4 + 99 + 20 + 33) 380 < 4,916 ( test is negative ) The tests made for waste in light of the final choice of input factors indicate that the default input factors for general waste does not over-estimate the mercury releases from waste treatment. The same is the case for wastewater treatment. 2.6.2 Controlled Landfills/ Deposits Findings by NEMA (2014) indicate that about 600,000 MT of waste is estimated to have been landfilled across the country in 2014. It is further reported that there are fifteen (15) controlled landfills in the country; each with a full operational capacity of 20,000 MT per six (6) months. Based on this information, the quantity of total waste into controlled landfills is as shown below;Total waste estimated: = (20,000*15 landfills*2) MT/Year= 600,000MT/Year However, the estimates used in the calculation were based on; a) The landfill capacity assuming in full operation, and not on the actual waste received and landfilled; b) The assumption that the landfills are in full operation throughout the year. The summary of inputs and results of controlled landfills/deposits are detailed in table 31 belowNational Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 36Table 31: Summary of Inputs and Results of Controlled Landfills/Deposits Controlled landfills/deposits Unit Production Use Disposal Activity rate t(waste)/y 600,000 Input factor for phase g Hg/t (waste) 1 Calculated input to phase kg Hg 600 Output distribution factors for phase: - Air - 0.01 - Water - 0.0001 - Land - 0.00 - Products - 0.00 - General waste treatment - 0.00 - Sector specific waste treatment - 0.00 Calculated outputs/releases to: - Air kg Hg - 6.00 - Water kg Hg - 0.06 - Land - 0.00 - Products - 0.00 - General waste treatment - 0.00 - Sector specific waste treatment 0.00 Plate 8: Unsorted waste in the Kiteezi land fill in KampalaNational Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 37 Plate 9: Kiteezi land fill (left) and waste in a drainage channel (right) in Kampala 2.6.3 Informal Dumping of General Waste From the literature as discussed in chapter 2.6.3, the amount general waste that is informally dumped is estimated as below; = 0.154*total waste generated in the country in 2014 = 0.154*34856813*0.55*365 = 1,077,615,802.302 Kg ( 1,077,616 MT ) Based on the calculated estimates of mercury inputs to intentional mercury uses, and the default input test performed on the intermediate default factor (5 g Hg/t waste), which tested high estimates, the low range default value of 1 g Hg/t waste was applied in the calculations.The summary of inputs and results of informal dumping of general waste are detailed in table 32 below.

Farmers collect dried sludge for use as manure in crop and flower gardens. 73,365,000 m3 is estimated to be gener- ated annually from all the systems in Uganda as calculated below; Total waste water at conventional treatment systems 2*33,000*365 = 24,090,000 m3 Total waste water at stabilization ponds 27*5,000*365 = 49,275,000 m3 Total waste water from all systems = (49,275,000 + 49,275,000) m3 = 73,365,000 m3 The summary of inputs and results of waste water systems/treatment are detailed in table 33 belowNational Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 39Table 33: Summary of Inputs and Results of Waste Water Systems/Treatment Waste water systems/treatment Unit Production Use Disposal Activity rate m3 waste water 73,365,000 Input factor for phase mg Hg/m3 waste water 5.25 Calculated input to phase kg Hg 385 Output distribution factors for phase: - Air - 0.00 - Water - 0.50 - Land - 0.20 - Products - 0.00 - General waste treatment - 0.15 - Sector specific waste treatment - 0.15 Calculated outputs/releases to: - Air - 0.00 - Water kg Hg - 192.50 - Land kg Hg - 77.00 - Products - 0 - General waste treatment kg Hg - 57.75 - Sector specific waste treatment kg Hg - 57.75 2.7 Consumer Products with Intentional use of Mercury and other Intentional Products/ Process uses 2.7.1 Medical Thermometers and Manometers There is no production of such measuring equipment in Uganda. COMTRADE data has been used to ascertain the number of medical thermometers that were imported in the recent years 2013-2015 and it should be noted there is no production of such items in the country. Thermometers and pyrometers; liquid filled, for direct reading, not combined with other instruments- 902511 (\"Mercury Learn - HS codes,\" 2015) has been used for the search. It has been estimated by informant health officers that 80% of the medical thermome - ters are estimated to be filled with mercury. The average number of thermometers for inventory calculations has been based on the quantities imported in the years 2013, 2014 and 2015. From interactions with med- ical practitioners, it is estimated, there is 1 manometer blood pressure gauge for every 10 thermometers. Usually for cases of such waste, there is no separate collection and waste handling is informal. Consumptionaverage for the years 2013- 2015 The quantity of medical thermometers is detialed in table 34 below.

Examples of switches are; float switches triggered by a change in liquid levels, tilt switches activated by a change in position and flame sensors activated by a change in temperature. These switches can be found in pumps, appliances, National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 41ranges/ovens and a variety of machinery. Relays are devices used to open or close electrical contacts to control another device in the same circuit. They are often used to turn off large electrical currents by supplying a small amount of electricity to a control circuit. They can be found in telecommunication circuit boards and industrial ovens. There is currently no production of electrical switches and relays in the country. The data has been estimated using the number of inhabitants and electrification rate in 2014. It is reported that 34,856,813 inhabitants were in the Uganda in 2014 and 9% was the electrification rate (UNEP, 2005) resulting into 439 kg Hg as observed in the toolkit. It has been found that informal waste handling is more pronounced in Uganda and there is no separate collection and handling for the switches. The summary of inputs and results of electrical switches and relays with mercury is detailed in table 36 below.

There is currently no production of mercury containing lamps in Uganda. All lamps into the country are imported from other countries, the majority from China.Under the category \"light sources with Mercury\", the quantities for the different sub-categories with the following HS codes : 853931 - Lamps; discharge, (excluding ultra-violet), fluorescent, hot cathode (\"Mercury Learn - HS codes,\" 2015), 853939 - Lamps; discharge, (excluding ultra-violet, excluding cathode) 853949 - Lamps; ultra-violet or infra-red lamps, (excluding arc-lamps); have been obtained from COMTRADE. The average values for the years 2013-2015 for each of the sub-categories have been considered as the estimated net consumption. The proportion of fluorescent tubes (double end) to single ended fluorescent compact lamps has estimated to be 50% of the total. In conclusion, light sources wastes have no separate collection and are informally dumped. National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 42The results from COMTRADE database are as shown in tables 37,38,39,40 and 41 below; Table 37: Quantities of 3,380,730 + 2,243,756)/3 = 2,746,631 lamps Table 38 Quantities of Discharge Lamps Excluding UV Year Import(items) 5,671,450 lamps 72,564)/3= 58,575 lamps. + 5,671,450 + 2,746,631) = 4,238,328National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 43Table 40: Quantities of High Pressure Sodium Lamps Year Import(items) Consumption(items) 2011 1,315 (5,165 + 56,457 + 6,652)/3 = 22,758 lamps To minimise the potential error in the mercury content of lamps, quantities of high pressure sodium lamps have been distributed evenly on the 2 specialty lamp categories imported in Uganda because their mercury contents are quite alike. Therefore, the number of single ended fluorescent compact lamps = 4,238,328 + (22758/2) = 4,249,707 lamps Table 41: Summary of Input and Results of Light Sources with Mercury Light sources with mercury Unit Production Use Disposal Activity rate - - - - Input factor for phase - - - - Calculated input to phase kg Hg - - 149 Output distribution factors for phase: - Air - - 0.30 - Water - - 0.00 - Land - - 0.30 - Products - - 0.00 - General waste treatment - - 0.40 - Sector specific waste treatment - - 0.00 Calculated outputs/releases to:- Air kg Hg - - 44.64 - Water - - 0.00 - Land kg Hg - - 44.64 - Products - - 0.00 - General waste treatment kg Hg - - 59.52 - Sector specific waste treatment 0.00 2.7.4 Batteries with Mercury For batteries with mercury, quantities used in the country in recent years (2013-2015) were obtained from the average of sub categories with HS codes of: 850630 Cells and batteries; primary, mercuric oxide (\"Mer- cury - HS codes,\" 2015) as showcased in the COMTRADE database. From the assessment, 4,578 MT is the net import into Uganda in 2014. This figure appears quite high for this kind of specialty battery, and as National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 44well it cannot be ruled out that some other batteries with lower mercury contents (for example other button cell battery types) could have been misreported under this code. The quantities of batteries with mercury are contained in table 42 below. Table 42: Quantities of Batteries with Mercury Year Import(kg) Export(kg) Consumption(kg) 1,347 1,700 38,126 200 37,926 For clear statistical purposes, years; 2011, 2013 and 2014 are considered for this category of batteries.Average Consumption = (387 + 4,050 + 4,578)/3 = 3,005 kg ( 3 MT) Cells and batteries (850660); primary, air-zinc and 850640 Cells and batteries; primary, silver oxide (\"Mercu- ry Learn - HS codes,\" 2015) revealed 5.804MT as imports in 2014 as seen in Table 43 below. Table 43: Quantities of Batteries with Mercury Year Import(kg) Export(kg) Consumption(kg) 1,800 Cells and batteries (850640); primary, silver oxide gives 3.06 MT as net imports into the Uganda in 2014 as seen in the Table 44 below.

Mercury containing skin lightening cosmetics11 are smuggled into the country from West African countries through porous borders. Quantities of cosmetics and related products with mercury have been estimated from the amounts of the aforementioned products seized by customs officers of Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) since their importation is banned by the government of Uganda. The seized quantity obtained has been used to extrapolate for the estimated total quantities smuggled into the country for the year 2014 with the assumption that the seized figures represented only 20 % of the total smuggled. Therefore, a total of about 3.465 MT was obtained as the cosmetics and related products with mercury estimated to have been smuggled into the country in 2014. Quantity of estimated cosmetics with mercury as seized by the Customs Officers in 2014 was 63 cartons, each with averagely 11 kg. Assuming a 20% efficiency of the operation due to the porous nature of the boarders, the estimated weight of cosmetics with mercury into Uganda is; = (63/0.2) *11= 3,465 kg ( 4 MT) The summary of inputs and results of cosmetics and related products with mercury is contained in table 49 below.

The project activities included awareness raising, training of dental health staff, production of dental aware- ness materials, installation of dental separators at demonstration sites (Jubilee Dental, Mengo Hospital and Mulago Hospital), documentation of country dental trade data and waste management practices among others However, during the implementation of the project the following challenges were encountered; a) Low acceptability by dentists on phasing down dental amalgam. b) Difficulty in co-ordinating stakeholders (traders/importers, dental health sector, regulators and the public) and yet management of mercury in products and dental amalgam is cross cutting. c) Non availability of separators (blockage/filling up of the separators require installation of separators as quickly as possible and yet they are not locally available). d) Awareness raising and sound management of mercury waste are still a challenge. Mercury output estimates have been calculated using country population of 34,856,813 inhabitants (2014) and dentistry personnel density of 0.0017. The output scenarios include; preparations of fillings at dentist clinics, use and disposal as seen in tables 50,51 and 52 below. In Uganda, a few clinics, only those supported during the East African Dental Amalgam Phase down project, are equipped with high efficiency amalgam filters (95% retention rate). However, it should be noted that, during the process of undertaking the mercury inventory, Health Ministry representatives estimated about 15% of fillings are made in facilities with amal- gam separators.

It is reported that due to fact that Asians cremate dead bodies by virtue of their cul- ture, about 312 Asians are estimated to have died and were cremated in 2014 using the calculations seen below; Total Number of death = mortality rate*total population = (10.4/1,000) *34,856,813 = 362,511 corpses Estimated Number of Asians who died in 2014 = (30,000/34,856,813) *362,511 = 312 corpsesNational Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 51In consideration of the relatively low level of dental care in Uganda, the low range default factor for mercury per corpse was selected for burial. For the Asian population (using cremation), the same may not be the case, as they generally belong to the higher income groups.The summary of inputs and results of crematoria is contained in table 53 below Table 53: Summary of Inputs and Results of Crematoria Crematoria Unit Production Use Disposal Activity rate Corpses 312 Input factor for phase g Hg 2.5 Calculated input to phase kg Hg 0.78 Output distribution factors for phase: - Air - - 1.00 - Water - - 0.00 - Land - - 0.00 - Products - - 0.00 - General waste treatment - - 0.00 - Sector specific waste treatment - - 0.00 Calculated outputs/releases to: - Air kg Hg - - 0.78 - Water - - 0.00 - Land - - 0.00 - Products - - 0.00 - General waste treatment - - 0.00 - Sector specific waste treatment - - 0.00 2.8.2 Cemeteries This is the most common form of burial practiced in Uganda. Statistically, mortality rate of 10.4 persons per 1000 is used to compute the number of corpses from the number of inhabitants in 2014. From crematoria estimates above, the number of cemeteries is equal to the total number of corpses in the country in 2014 less than that by crematoria; 362,199 corpses are estimated to have been buried. In the light of the low general level of dental care in the country, the input factor here was adjusted to the low range default factor 1 g Hg/corpse. Thesummary of inputs and results of cemeteries is contained in table 54 below.National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 52Table 54: Summary of Inputs and Results of Cemeteries Cemeteries Unit Production Use Disposal Activity rate Corpses 362,199 Input factor for phase g Hg/corpse 1 Calculated input to phase kg Hg 362 Output distribution factors for phase: - Air - - 0.00 - Water - - 0.00 - Land - - 1.00 - Products - - 0.00 - General waste treatment - - 0.00 - Sector specific waste treatment - - 0.00 Calculated outputs/releases to: - Air kg Hg - - 0.00 - Water - - 0.00 - Land - - 362.00 - Products - - 0.00 - General waste treatment - - 0.00 - Sector specific waste treatment - - 0.00 2.9 Contaminated Sites The main mercury contaminated sites are ASGM sites due to mercury tailings and processing/burning activities of the amalgam. A comprehensive assessment of mercury contaminated sites has not yet been conducted in Uganda. Figure 4 details ASGM/ potential mercury contaminated sites in Uganda.National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 53 Figure 4: ASGM sites in Uganda Artisanal and Small scale Gold Mining (ASGM) is of great national and local importance in Uganda. Gold was the second most important export after coffee in Uganda. Gold earned 204 million USD in foreign revenue in the financial year 2015/201612. Locally, ASGM is an important source of income and employment to miners and their dependents. The widespread unemployment and poverty in rural areas where alternative work is not available or is of low/ no pay, ASGM has become a primary mean of survival. Despite the economic and social benefits of ASGM, the practice has far reaching negative externalities on the environment, society and human health. It is important to note that; a) Artisanal and Small scale Gold Mining has a number of negative effects on the environment. Natural landscapes are destroyed as miners excavate deep into the earth's crust in search of gold. These resulting pits are usually not refilled after excavation. In addition, ASGM miners who use mercury to amalgamate gold indiscriminately dispose tailing back into the environment (soils and water bodies). This introduces mercury (an inorganic and non-de- gradable compound) into the environment. National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 54b) Artisanal and Small scale Gold Mining has resulted into sharp increase in the price of land as more land is brought under mining as speculators buy more land. Similarly, there has been an influx of migrant workers looking for work. This increases pressure on natural resource services but also as more people go into ASGM, less labour is available for agriculture. As more people migrate into ASGM areas, there has been an increase in the costs of living in ASM areas as there are a lot of people and money chasing few goods, c) Another potential risk of ASGM is increase in child labour. This has a significant negative effect on education levels as more and more children leave school and join the informal Labour force in the mines. The percentage of children (<18 years) among miners ranges from 0 to 5% whereas children (<14 years) ranges from 0 to 2% (NEMA, 2016).The children pan concentrates containing mercury and burn the gold amalgam. This has a long run implication of reducing social capital in the ASGM areas. Such areas are thus at a risk of chronically remaining poor when the gold deposits become exhausted. d) Truancy; with increased child Labour, there is a high level of school drops outs in the artisanal mining communities. Children are lured into works, with little payments, which makes them have no time for school at all. 2.9.1 Impacts of Mercury on Human Health and the Environment The effects of mercury on human health are well documented (ATSDR, 1999; Clarkson 2002; Counter and Buchanan 2004). The tragic poisoning event of 2000 people around Minamata Bay, Japan between 1953 and 1968 instigated numerous studies that identified the neurological system and kidney as primary target organs of methyl mercury exposure (Clarkson 2002; Counter and Buchanan 2004; Wiggle 2003). Another devastating outbreak of methyl mercury poisoning occurred in rural Iraq in 1971-1972 where 40,000 people were poisoned and 6000 cases were admitted to the hospital (Clarkson 2002; Counter and Buchanan 2004; Wiggle (2003). The outbreak occurred after seed grain treated with a methyl mercury fungicide was accidentally consumed by locals (Clarkson 2002; Counter and Buchanan 2004). Evidence of the severe health effects associated with mercury exposure in these major epidemics have been the cornerstone and impetus for further epidemiologic and clinical studies investigating the biological effects of mercury. The outcome of these studies has led to numerous health warnings and the creation of mercury pollution regulations and monitoring programs around the globe. Health effects of mercury include; a) It is a threat to the development of fetuses and young children. b) In the vapour form, it is rapidly absorbed into the blood stream when inhaled and damages the central nervous system, thyroid, kidneys, lungs, immune system, eyes, gums and skin. c) In children it can cause neurological damage resulting in symptoms such as mental retardation, seizures, vision and hearing loss, delayed development, language disorders and memory loss (ATSDR, 1999; Clarkson 2002; Counter and Buchanan 2004; Wiggle ( 2003). Studies have also shown that children with higher levels of contamination are more likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Boucher et al., 2012). Symptoms can include numbness in the hands and feet, general muscle weakness, narrowing of the field of vision, and damage to hearing and speech. In extreme cases, insanity, paralysis, coma and death have been known to ensue rapidly (ATSDR, 1999; Clarkson 2002; Parson and Percival 2005; Wiggle (2003). Neurological and behavioral disorders may be signs of low levels of mercury exposure, with symptoms such as tremors, insomnia, memory loss, neuromuscular effects, headaches, and cognitive and motor dysfunction. In addition, studies have also shown mercury.National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 55Chapter III: Policy, Regulatory and Institutional Framework Assessment 3.1 Policy and Regulatory Assessment Ratification (or acceptance, approval or accession) of the Minamata Convention on mercury by a member country legally binds the country to the Convention's obligations. It is then important that local policies and regulations in member countries are aligned to the provisions and articles of the Convention that are binding and which apply in the Ugandan context. The current analysis aligns the binding articles of the convention with existing regulations and policies in Uganda. It also establishes the needs in the jurisprudence to ensure compliance to the provisions of the convention to enable Uganda reduce and eventually eliminate human and environmental exposure to mercury. Table 55 below presents summarizes national policies and regulatory measures needs for effective implementation of the Minamata Convention in Uganda. Table 55: National Policy and Regulatory needs for effective implementation of the Minamata convention Article 3 - Mercury supply sources and trade Description of Article This article deals with sources of mercury and trade in mercury with the aim of reducing existing stock of mercury . It contains control measures aimed at limiting the global supply of mercury to complement and reinforce the demand reduction control measures. Summary of Article Provisions Not to allow new primary mercury mining Prevent the import and use of mercury from primary mercury mining for artisanal and small- scale gold mining (ASGM) Obtain information on stocks of mercury or mercury compounds exceeding 50 metric tons (MT), and mercury supply generating stocks exceeding 10 MT/yr.1 Not to allow the export of mercury unless the importing country provides written consent, 2 the mercury is for an allowed use or environmentally sound storage, and all other conditions of Article 3.6 are met3 Not to allow the import of mercury without government consent, ensuring both the mercury source and proposed use are allowed under the Convention (and applicable domestic law) Policy and regulatory measures in place that enable the country to comply with the above listed provisions: Mining Act, 2003 No person may explore or prospect for, retain or mine or dispose of any mineral in Uganda except under a license issued under the Act. It is a criminal offence to mine without a license. The commissioner may grant to any person a permit to export minerals from Uganda on conditions determined by or under the Act. Occupational Safety and Health Act, 2006 In circumstances prescribed by the Government, it is the duty of a person who imports any article or chemical substance for use at work, to obtain adequate research information on its toxicity and harmful effects to the health of any worker exposed to it and to avail this information to any person concerned, in order to eliminate or minimise any risks to health or safety which the article or chemical substance may give rise to. External Trade Act Cap 88 This act makes provisions for the regulation of external trade and other connected matters. Export restricted goods under the Act mean goods in respect of which the Minister has made a statutory order prohibiting their export without a license. Import restricted goods mean goods in respect of which the Minister has made a statutory order prohibiting their import without a license. This act provides for restriction of import and export of certain goods. Regulatory or policy recommendations to ensure compliance with the Convention's provisions: New primary mining of mercury needs to be prohibited Prohibit the import of primary mercury for use in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) Mercury needs to be classified as an export/import restricted good whose import and export are can only be permitted for specialized purposes or use. This needs to be accompanied by policy guidelines/laws regulating export and import of mercury which domesticate the provisions of the convention Creating an inventory of all mercury supplied for artisanal and small scale mining (ASGM).National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 56Article 4 - Mercury Added Products Description of Article Deals with mercury added products banning their manufacture, import or export after their phase out date and minimizing use of mercury in dental amalgam. It seeks to reduce mercury demand in products through a combination of measures which phase out mercury uses in many key products, phase down mercury use in another, require the review of remaining products for possible restrictions within five years, and discourage the manufacture of new products using mercury. Summary of Article Provisions Mercury-added product means a product or product component that contains mercury or a mercury compound that was intentionally added. Not allow the manufacture, import or export of mercury-added products listed in Part I of Annex A after the phase-out date specified for those products except where exclusion is specified in Annex A or the Party has a registered exemption pursuant to Article 6. Report at the first opportunity to the Conference of the Parties a description of the measures or strategies implemented, including a quantification of the reductions achieved. Consider additional measures to achieve further reductions. Take measures to prevent the incorporation into assembled products of mercury-added products the manufacture, import and export of which are not allowed for it under this Article. Discourage the manufacture and the distribution in commerce of mercury-added products not covered by any known use of mercury-added products. Take measures for the mercury-added products listed in Part II of Annex A in accordance with the provisions set out therein. Policy and regulatory measures in place that enable the country to comply with the above listed provisions: Uganda National Bureau of Standards Act Cap 327 This act establishes Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS). It ensures that products comply with certain standards in manufacture, composition, treatment or performance and to prohibit substandard goods where necessary. It also enforces standards in the protection of the public against harmful ingredients, dangerous components, shoddy material and poor performance. In regard to the management of mercury, the bureau is thus required to ensure that manufacture of products such as drugs that use mercury or mercury compounds is done in accordance with sound and prescribed standards. Food and Drugs Act Cap 278 Under this Act, no person is to add any substance to food, use any substance as an ingredient in the preparation of food that renders the food injurious to health with intent that the food shall be sold for human consumption in that state. No person is to add any substance to a drug so as to affect injuriously the quality, constitution or potency of the drug. It is a criminal offence to sell foods and drugs whose quality has been injuriously affected by addition of substances such as mercury.National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 57National Drug Policy and Authority Act Cap 206 Exportation of restricted and controlled drugs without license is prohibited under the Act. There are certain drugs containing mercury compounds. Under the Act these are classified into different classes. These include restricted drugs namely; Hydrocyanic acid, cyanides; double cyanides of mercury and of B drugs or controlled drugs. These drugs and preparations containing them may only be supplied by retail by a registered pharmacist or licensed pharmacy. Class C drugs are licensed drugs which may be sold by retail only by a person or company operating a licensed pharmacy or a licensed drug seller. These include mercuric oxide when contained in yellow oxide of mercury ointment and mercury, its halides when contained in preparations for use in agriculture or horticulture. The Act imposes a strict restriction on the manufacture of classified drugs. Under the Act, no person is to mix, compound, prepare, supply or dispense any restricted drug unless that person is a registered pharmacist, medical practitioner, dentist or veterinary surgeon or a licensed person. No person is to supply any classified or restricted drug unless the drug is in a container of the prescribed description and the container bears a label giving the prescribed particulars of its contents. Such drugs containing mercury or compounds of mercury should clearly be labeled. No person is to carry on a business of supplying restricted drugs by wholesale unless he or she is authorized to carry on that business by a license. This expressly bars person not licensed from dealing in restricted or controlled drugs having mercury as one of their ingredients. In regard to Storage, the Act prescribes means of storage of prescribed and restricted drugs. Exportation of such drugs without license is prohibited under the Act. The Drugs bureau; this bureau keeps and maintains a list of all toxic substances, their composition, toxicity and antidotes. It supplies such information to medical practitioners, dentists or veterinary surgeons in respect of drugs as may be in its possession in emergency cases of poisoning. Agricultural Chemicals (Control) Act, 2006 No person is to manufacture, package, store, display, distribute, transport, possess, use or advertise any agricultural chemical except in accordance with regulations made under this Act and in accordance with the National Environment Act, Cap 153. This also applies to mercury containing agricultural chemicals No person is to import, export or re-export or sell in Uganda any agricultural chemical unless that chemical has been registered, packed and labeled in accordance with regulations made under this Act and conforms to the standards required. This also applies to mercury containing agricultural chemicals. Regulatory or policy recommendations to ensure compliance with the Convention's provisions: Prohibit and/restrict the import and export of mercury or mercury products by the External Trade Act. Prohibit and/or restrict the manufacture and trade of mercury added products including creams, pharmaceutical and agricultural products on the Ugandan market, pharmaceutical preparations and sale of mercury-added drugs. Restrict and reduce the use of dental amalgam Article 5 - Manufacturing processes in which mercury or mercury compounds are usedDescription of Article Deals with use of mercury or mercury compounds in the manufacturing processes, listed in Part I of Annex B and Part II of Annex B of the Minamata Convention, by not allowing their use and reducing their use respectively. Some manufacturing processes do consume large quantities of mercury, thus control measures to prohibit or restrict their mercury use are crucial.National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 58Summary of Article Provisions Not allow the use of mercury or mercury compounds in the manufacturing processes listed in Part I of Annex B after the phase-out date specified in that Annex for the individual processes, except where the Party has a registered exemption pursuant to Article 6. Take measures to restrict the use of mercury or mercury compounds in the processes listed in Part II of Annex B in accordance with the provisions set out therein. Take measures to address emissions and releases of mercury or mercury compounds from facilities that use mercury or mercury compounds facilities. Identify facilities within its territory that use mercury or mercury compounds for processes listed in Annex B and submit to the Secretariat, no later than three years after the date of entry into force of the Convention for it, information on the number and types of such facilities and the estimated annual amount of mercury or mercury compounds used in those facilities. Not allow the use of mercury or mercury compounds in a facility that did not exist prior to the date of entry into force of the Convention for it using the manufacturing processes listed in Annex B. Discourage the development of any facility using any other manufacturing process in which mercury or mercury compounds are intentionally used that did not exist prior to the date of entry into force of the Convention. Policy and regulatory measures in place that enable the country to comply with the above listed provisions: Occupational Safety and Health Act, 2006 Under this Act, a duty is placed on the employer to take all measures reasonable for the protection of employees and the general public from dangerous aspects of the employer's undertaking and ensure that the working environment is kept free from any hazard due to pollution through sound technical measures. Under the Act toxic materials are to be used as a last resort and kept to a minimum. The use of mercury in manufacture of any product allowed by the Minamata Convention on Mercury should only be as a last resort. Wherever possible, hazardous substance such as mercury should be replaced by harmless or less harmless substances. An employer is also under obligation to take general preventive measures including administrative and technical measures to prevent or reduce the contamination of a work environment to the lowest possible level or where possible to levels specified by the exposure limits prescribed by the commissioner. Under this Act, a duty is placed on the employer to take all measures reasonable for the protection of employees and the general public from dangerous aspects of the employer's undertaking and ensure that the working environment is kept free from any hazard due to pollution through sound technical measures. It is the duty of manufacturers to ensure that the chemical substance or mixture of chemical substances for use at work is designed or constructed or formulated to be safe and without risk to health when used properly and for the purpose for which it is meant. The manufacture, supply and use of chemical substances in a working environment, which the government chemist or any other authority mandated by law considers highly toxic, or dangerous or capable of causing grave harm to health, the environment, or an undertaking is subject to specific authorization by government chemist or other authorities, after measures are taken to ensure adequate protection. Agricultural Chemicals (Control) Act, 2006 Under this Act, no person is to manufacture, package, store, display, distribute, transport, possess, use or advertise any agricultural chemical except in accordance with regulations made under this Act and in accordance with the National Environment Act, Cap 153. No person is to import, export or re-export or sell in Uganda any agricultural chemical unless that chemical has been registered, packed and labeled in accordance with regulations made under this Act and conforms to the standards required. Regulatory or policy recommendations to ensure compliance with the Convention's provisions: Currently, mercury is not used in any industrial processes in Uganda. Despite this, it is important to regulate against the possible use of mercury in any industrial processes currently and in the future Prohibit the use of mercury and mercury compounds in any facility. Prohibit the establishment of any facility using mercury or mercury compounds in its industrial processes Article 7 - Artisanal and Small scale Gold Mining 4 Description of Article This Article applies to artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in which mercury amalgamation is used to extract gold from ore. National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 59Summary of Article Provisions Take steps to reduce, and where feasible eliminate, the use of mercury in gold mining. Notify the Secretariat if the artisanal and small-scale gold mining and processing in its territory is more than insignificant. Develop and implement a national action plan in accordance with Annex C; Policy and regulatory measures in place that enable the country to comply with the above listed provisions: Mining Act, 2003 Any person who wishes to carry on small-scale prospecting and mining operations must apply for a location license. The license is not renewed if the applicant has not carried out effective restoration of the surface areas to the satisfaction of the commissioner. Regulatory or policy recommendations to ensure compliance with the Convention's provisions: Formulate a national action plan on Artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Reduce and eventually prohibit the use of mercury in gold mining. Article 8 - EmissionsDescription of Article This Article concerns controlling and, where feasible, reducing emissions of mercury and mercury compounds to the atmosphere through measures to control emissions from the point sources.

National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 78Chapter IV: Identification of Populations at Risks and Gender Dimensions 4.1 Preliminary Review of Potential Populations at Risk and Potential Health risks Artisanal Miners: Artisanal and small scale gold mining is the main occupational source of exposure to mercury in Uganda. Miners use mercury to amalgamate gold during artisanal gold mining. As such, they are in direct contact with the mercury as they mix the ore, water and mercury for amalgamating gold. In most cases, miners do not wear any form of protection during the mixing process and when burning the mercury gold amalgam to evaporate off the mercury. As such, it is possible that mercury enters their tissues directly through the skin and also through inhalation of mercury vapors. In humans, approximately 80% of inhaled mercury vapor is absorbed via the respiratory tract where it enters the circulatory system and is distributed throughout the body. Chronic exposure by inhalation, even at low concentrations in the range 0.7-42 g/ m3, has been shown in case control studies to cause effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers. On the other hand, elemental mercury is poorly absorbed by ingestion and skin contact. However, it is hazardous due to its potential to release mercury vapor. Plate 15: Gold mercury amalgam burning without a retort Communities in ASGM areas; There are no formal and standard processes for disposal of mercury in the gold extraction process, miners dispose the tailings back into the environment indiscriminately. As such, mercury may trickle into natural ecosystems like water bodies. In addition, since most miners burn the mercury gold amalgam in the open, the vapors escape into the natural ecosystem (air and later through rainfall back to water bodies). People staying in the vicinity of the sites are therefore at a high risk of mercury induced illnesses and conditions due to inhalation of mercury vapors or through drinking mercury contaminated water and eating mercury contaminated fish. Communities in ASGM areas reported that pollution (water, environment and soil) and erosion sedimentation are some of the main externalities of gold mining in their communities.According to a research survey on Artisanal Gold Mining and Livelihood Security in Gold rush communities in Mubende, of the 300 respondents, 21% reported health problems emanating from use of mercury. According to a trained nurse operating a clinic in the mine site areas, many gold buyers complain of severe chest pains, shortness of breath, paralysis and swelling of legs. She attributes this to mercury. She says many gold washers come with bizarre cases of peeling skin and finger nails. She further explains that the conditions are always unresponsive to conventional treatment regimes. National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 79Garbage Collectors/Sorters and Incinerators: Most solid waste collected in Uganda is not sorted; garbage collectors and sorters are involuntary exposed to mercury through the garbage that they collect and sort. Just like artisanal miners, these also have or use very minimal protection and as such they can easily get exposed to mercury. People working in incinerators may also suck in mercury fumes and suffer from resultant negative effects. Pregnant Women and Children below 17 Years: A 2016 empirical study13 identifies that women, pregnant women and children under the age of 17 are at a risk of mercury contamination due to mercury in the muscles and fat tissues as a result of consuming fish from Lake Albert. The report observes that pregnant women and children had a higher concentration of mercury (above WHO threshold) than men who had mercury concentration below the WHO threshold. The report argues that unlike other countries where the number of fish consumed could be regulated, in Uganda, this was not possible. As such, this predisposes the pregnant women and children who nutritionally need more proteins from fish to mercury poisoning.Women: Women in Uganda are the major consumers of creams and lotions. Specifically, they are more likely to use mercury containing creams as a means to enhance skin lightening than men. As such, they are more at risk of mercury exposure and should therefore be treated as a higher risk group.Students: In Uganda, all students are required to do physics and chemistry practicals as part of the school curricula where they use mercury and mercury containing equipment in the laboratories. Similarly, the protection students have is usually minimal and given and as such are highly vulnerable to poisoning from mercury. In the same way, laboratory technicians and teachers may also be exposed to mercury.Dental Practitioners: Because alternatives to mercury dental fillings are mostly unavailable and expensive in Uganda, mercury containing dental fillings is still used. Practitioners who prepare the amalgams and patients are therefore at risk. Without adequate protection, they inhale mercury vapors that evaporate during the drilling process. Similarly, dental patients too may loosely be at risk.

In the previous section, it was evident that women and children are more at risk of mercury exposure. It is therefore essential that; Behavioral change programs are developed disseminated and target towards women and the children who are the most at risk population to exposure due to consumption of mercury containing fish. Non mercury containing creams including lightening creams should be introduced so as to discourage the black market of the mercury containing creams which developed as a result of a Government ban on the mercury containing creams There is also need to avail alternative protein containing foods to the children and men so as to cut back on their dependence of fish which amplifies the probability of their exposure to mercury. It is important to advise women in the childbearing age to not eat the types of fish with high mercury content. It may be relevant to have more information on the food types with high mercury content which could be used for some targeted advice.National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 81 Plate 19: Women in gold processing at an ASGM site in Mubende Plate 20: Women in Mubende district panning gold concentrates using mercuryNational Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 82ANNEX I: Stakeholder Engagement Process The process was highly consultative and participatory and NEMA gave overall guidance and supervisory support.

Read the Toolkit Reference Report sections carefully before using this spreadsheet! : This spreadsheet is not self-explaining and there is a clear risk of making serious mistakes, if the proposed principles and data are not read and understood carefully. Make yourself acquainted with the methodology used for mercury inventories in the Toolkit Reference Report. Before working with an individual source sub-category in this spreadsheet, read the Toolkit report's section describing the source. Spreadsheet names: The numbers in the individual sheets' names refer to the chapter number of the source category dealt with in the individual sheet. Metric units : All units used in this spreadsheet are - and must be - metric units, in accordance with the Toolkit report. The notation \"t\", means metric tons (also called \"tonnes\" in UK terminology). Disclaimer:The designations employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the United Nations Environment Programme concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Moreover, the views expressed do not necessarily represent the decision or the stated policy of the United Nations Environment Programme, nor does citing of trade names or commercial processes constitute endorsement.This publication is intended to serve as a guide. While the information provided is believed to be accurate, UNEP disclaims any responsibility for possible inaccuracies or omissions and consequences that may flow from them. Neither UNEP nor any individual involved in the preparation of this publication shall be liable for any injury, loss, damage or prejudice of any kind that may be caused by persons who have acted based on their understanding of the information contained in this publication. Guide to the column headers and the entry of data: \"C\": The column shows the section number in the Toolkit report describing this source category. \"Su-C\": The column shows the section number in the Toolkit report describing this source sub-category. \"Source category /phase\" : This column displays the name of the source category, source sub-category or life cycle phase dealt with in this line and in any lines below until the line with the next name in the column. \"Exists? (y/n/?)\": Enter \"yes\" if it is confirmed that this source is present in the area covered by the inventory. Enter \"no\" if it is confirmed that this source is NOT present in the area. Enter \"?\", if it is not known if the source is present or not in the area covered by the inventory.Non-existing source categories: If you have positively verified that the source in question does not exist in the country, enter the number \"0\" as the activity rate and as the Hg input in order to display the correct output numbers, namely \"0\". \"Default input factor\"\": These columns inform you of the default input factors defined in the Toolkit report, and their units. The appropriate unit is noted in the next column to the right. \"Enter input factor\": Here you enter your choice of input factor for the source in question. For source sub categories where default factors are defined in the Toolkit report, an intermediate default input factor is already entered in the appropriate cell (generally same as used on Inventory Level 1). Remember that well documented national or local input factors should always be preferred, if available. Provide documentation for the used factors in the inventory report. The appropriate unit is noted in the next column to the right. Only this unit can be used! \"Enter activity rate\": Here you enter the activity rate for the source category in question. See in the corresponding section of the Toolkit report, which type of activity rate you must use. Find appropriate activity rate data according to the principles and advice given in section 4.4 (\"Data gathering and quantification of mercury releases\") in the Toolkit report. Only this acitivity rate with the mentioned unit can be used! \"Calculate. Hg input\": This column displays the calculated mercury input to the source in question. For source sub categories where default factors are defined in the Toolkit report, the appropriate calculation formula is already entered in the cell. For National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 89sources where this is not the case, you must enter appropriate calculation formulas according to the Toolkit principles; often you can copy - or be inspired by - calculation formulas given for other sources in the same column. BE VERY CAREFUL THAT THE UNIT AND ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ARE CORRECT - this is one of the error types most often made in such calculations. For some source sub-categories that have several contributions to the overall releases from the sub-category, the sum of input contributions is displayed in bold red writing. \"Output scenarios, where relevant\": For some source sub-categories, several output scenarios are defined in the Toolkit report according to the characteristics of the source. For such sources, the description of the scenario is given in this column, and corresponding output distribution factors are entered - or can be entered - in the columns to the right of this column. For sources where there is only one output scenario, this column is empty. \"Enter Hg input\": In this column, the mercury INPUT to this source category, or phase, or scenario must be entered. In simple cases, the number to be entered here is the number calculated in the column \"Calculat. Hg input\"; for these a simple reference (e.g. \"= k34\") can be made or the number can be entered manually. For sources with several output scenarios you must investigate which scenario(s) is/are relevant and enter the mercury input lead to that scenario. For some source sectors, e.g. coal combustion, the total calculated mercury input must be distributed between the relevant scenarios in accordance with information obtained in your data collection. For example for coal combustion, half of the annual coal supply may be used in facilities with no emission reduction devices, while the other half is used in facilities with fabric filters. In this example, 50% of your mercury input must be entered in the \"no devises\" row in this column, while the other 50% must be entered in the \"fabric filters\" row. For other sources, e.g. batteries, you can choose the scenario you find most appropriate for the country covered in your inventory - and enter the total calculated mercury input in that row, or you can distribute the total input between the scenarios, for example if different scenarios are relevant in different parts of the country investigated. \"Enter output distribution factors\": Here you enter your choice of output distribution factors. Important: In most cases the sum of all output distributions factors for a source must be 1 (exceptions: see notes in this spreadsheet and corresponding sections in the Toolkit report). For source sub categories where default factors are defined in the Toolkit report, the default factors are already entered in the appropriate cells; note that question marks in the report are substituted here by \"0\" to facilitate the use of the spreadsheet for quick initial screenings. Remember that well documented national or local distribution factors should always be preferred, if available. Provide documentation for the used factors in the inventory report. \"Calculated Hg output, Kg/y \": These columns display the calculated mercury releases distributed on the output pathways considered. Each cell in these columns contain a formula calculating the release estimate based on the mercury inputs to the source or phase or output scenario in question and the output distribution factor for this pathway. \"Remarks\": Here you enter a few words on information on the specific fate of mercury released to \"Sector specific treatment/ disposal\", and you enter important key information on a summary level. Give reference to where in the inventory report the information is described in more detail. Other important information: \"#Value!\" : This term appear in calculation results, if \"?\", \"-\" or similar text signs are written in input cells. If data are available, enter these instead of the \"?\" in the input cells. If data are not available, the sign (?,- or other) may often be the appropriate thing to show in the results cell. To present the same sign (?,- or other), enter the appropriate sign manually in the calculation cell. User defined alterations of the spreadsheet principles : This spreadsheet is designed for mercury release quantification according to the general methodology and specific principles for each source sub-category recommended in the Toolkit report. For many source sub-categories other specific approaches may be usable (e.g. other activity rate types). This spreadsheet may be adjusted accordingly by the users as desired, requiring that the applied principles are in line with the overall approach of the Toolkit, and are well documented in the inventory reporting and that full reference is given to this Toolkit spreadsheet. Enter calculation formulas : In this spreadsheet, default calculation formulas were only entered for source sub-categories, for which defaults were defined in the Toolkit report. Depending in the data available, inputs and releases may however be possible to estimate for more sources. In such cases, the user should enter appropriate formulas and data for the calculations. In many cases this can be done by copying appropriate formulas from other cells in this spreadsheet - be careful to be accurate. Sub-calculations: In many cases sub-calculations will be needed, e.g. for calculations/conversions of the activity rates, or alternative input factors or alternative output distribution factors. Such calculations must be made in other spreadsheets, National Minamata Initial Assessment (MIA) Report 90for instance in new sheets inserted in this same Toolkit spreadsheet file; remember to report clear and transparent documentation of all data and calculations used - read more about this in the Toolkit report. Decimal point/comma: In order to display decimal comma or decimal point according to your preference, make sure your MS Windows systems language is set accordingly. Note however that numbers displayed here as text (default factor intervals) will display with decimal point, in accordance with the Toolkit report format, regardless of language settings chosen. Sum of quantified releases: The predefined summary sheets take into account the risk of double counting mercury contributions in pre-defined source categories where this can happen. If you wish to calculate sums of quantified inputs or releases, other than the ones already displayed, remember not to double-count Hg amounts quantified for several source categories (e.g. Hg amounts that are counted under both production, use, and disposal). This requires a deeper analysis based on relevant Toolkit report sections. Adjustment for electrification rate and dental personnel: For some products types with scarce database for forming default factors, consumption estimates are calculated based on population and electrification rates; the latter as an indication of developments status. An electrification rate of 100% of the population is pre-entered. Should the electrification rate be lower in your country (see reference report Annexes), you can enter the best estimate of the actual number (listed in reference report annexes). Similar principles apply for dental personnel density in your country, where usable estimates are also given in reference report annexes.
