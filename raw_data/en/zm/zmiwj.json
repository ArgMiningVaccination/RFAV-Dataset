Options may range from surgery to systemic therapies to radiation. Treatments may vary, so be sure to discuss options for the specific stage of lung cancer with your doctor. We ensure that you always know what to expect and feel comfortable with your treatment plan. Treatment options for lung cancer include: Our team of thoracic surgeons use some of the latest techniques to remove the lung cancer. Our surgeons are experts in minimally invasive video assisted or robotic techniques that allow removal of the cancer with small incisions and no rib spreading. Using advanced robotic-assistance tools, we can perform surgery with greater access to harder-to-reach areas of the lungs. This procedure allows surgeons to navigate a flexible robotic endoscope to the periphery of the lung with improved reach, real-time vision and precise control. More than 90% of our lung cancer surgeries are either minimally invasive or robotics-assisted, which means faster recovery times and less damage to surrounding tissue. Immunotherapy utilizes the immune system to recognize cancer cells and fight off the cancer cells. Chemotherapy is used to kill the cancer cells or shrink them. The medicine may be given in the form of a pill or administered directly into your veins. Radiation therapy kills the cancer cells using high-energy rays. Our team of radiation oncologists uses innovative technology to produce the optimal treatment of your cancer without damaging surrounding tissue. Targeted therapy is used to stop or slow the growth of the cancer and prevent it from spreading. After lung cancer treatment, it is not uncommon to experience side effects from some of the therapies. The kinds of side effects depend on what treatment you are having. Your doctor will describe these in more detail. If you start to have side effects during treatment, make sure your doctor is aware. We offer a full range of [integrative therapies](/services/cancer/programs-care/integrative-oncology) to help you manage side effects and keep pain and discomfort to a minimum. If you would like to participate, and are eligible to join, Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center conducts cancer clinical trials for lung cancer. These [clinical trials](/services/cancer/programs-care/clinical-trials) will study new treatment options to better help diagnose and treat lung cancer. Coping with any cancer diagnosis can take a toll on a patient. Consider these ways to help: Friends and family are a great support system, especially for physical and emotional support. Let family help take care of pets and your house while you're in the hospital or lean on them for any additional support you need. Read more about lung cancer to discuss any and all options with your doctor. If you can understand the treatment options you have available, you'll be more likely to be a part of the conversation about making decisions. You are not alone on this journey. Ask your doctor about [support groups](/calendar) or local groups that you can join to continue having an open discussion around lung cancer. Trust the experts at Banner MD Anderson to help with any lung cancer treatment or support options for you or your loved ones. "}
