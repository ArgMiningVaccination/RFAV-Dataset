Making homemade skincare products is a cost-effective and fun way to tailor your skincare regime to suit your skin's needs, giving you total control over the ingredients you use. Plus, if you suffer with sensitive or problematic skin, you can avoid irritating and potentially harmful ingredients that may react with your skin. Learn how to make natural skincare products using ingredients your skin will love. Why make your own skincare products? Most skincare products available in the shops contain toxic ingredients and fragrances, including the brands marketed as \"organic\" and \"natural\" or claiming to contain \"naturally-derived ingredients\". The cosmetic industry is not officially regulated so companies can create their own definition of what a natural product is and this can vary considerably brand to brand. Manufacturers use the term \"natural\" as a marketing tactic to get shoppers to buy their products. They aren't obliged to disclose all the ingredients on the product label, enabling them to hide hundreds of toxic ingredients by calling them natural fragrances or aroma. This is why making your own natural skincare products has never been more important. You can source the best natural ingredients for your skin type and never have to use chemical-laden products again. 7 tips for making homemade skincare products - Always work with clean hands and ensure equipment is clean to avoid cross contamination. - Keep your working environment as sterile as possible, including tea towels that you may be drying items with. - Store your ingredients and products in a cool dark place to avoid exposure to light and heat which may cause formulas to melt and ingredients to separate. - Always do a patch test after making a batch to ensure irritation doesn't occur. - Special care should be taken when creating products for pregnant women or children, and without expert knowledge, essential oils should be avoided. - Label and date products so you can easily identify what each product is and keep track of expiry dates. - Be mindful of hot liquid, especially if using a bain-marie.
