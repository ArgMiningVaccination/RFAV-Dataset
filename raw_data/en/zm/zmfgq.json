In fact, many major health insurers now cover these treatments. In Sunny Isles, Florida, acupuncture and integrative medicine services are available from the Advanced Holistic Center. Our team of experienced medical professionals integrates ancient Chinese medicine practices - including Gua Sha, herbal medicine and cupping therapy - to provide a truly holistic treatment approach. The Benefits of Holistic & Integrative Medicine The traditional Western approach to medical practice focuses on specific responses to quantitative signals. For example, if your blood pressure reading exceeds a specific level, it triggers a doctor to prescribe medication to lower it. Western medicine is generally evidence-based, which is important. However, by focusing almost exclusively on treating symptoms - rather than identifying and addressing contributing factors - these practices often disregard the interdependence of the body's systems and components. As a result, other problems can develop, e.g., medication side effects. Integrative or holistic medical practices, which often incorporate aspects of Eastern medicine, place an overarching focus on the patient as a whole. Rather than only treating symptoms, holistic medicine seeks to get all of your body's systems working in harmony.
