State approaches the middle of FY 2007, the economic env ironment is one of slowing growth in the national economy. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee began a campaign of regular in creases in the federal funds interest rate in mid-2004. This policy was aimed at heading off a flare-up in inflation as the economy grew out of the 2000 recession. The aim of that pol icy was to gradually bring real growth in GDP down to near its l ong-term potential. Long-term potential growth is a function of the growth in the labor force and productivity growth . This is generally assumed to be in the range of 3.25% real growth in GDP. The increases in the federal funds interest rate have successf ully slowed the economy and inflation, which had shown signs of escalation, now appears to be moderating. The impacts of this po licy are most evident in the housing market in which inventori es of homes for sale are up, median prices ar e declining and housing starts and permits are down. The key issues for the national economy are the duration and depth of the housing downturn and the extent to which the downturn spills over into other sectors of the economy. The most likely scenario is that the U.S. economy moderates but does not slump into a recession. However, the risks of a serious downturn or recession are rising. Some of the factors currently supporting growth momentum in the economy include the decline in energy prices from peaks in the mid-summer period, a good business investment climate including high profit margins and high capacity utilization and solid gro wth in much of the world economy which promotes demand for U.S. expor ts. In addition, real interest rates, which are nominal intere st rates adjusted for inflation, remain relatively low by histor ical standards despite the measur ed increases in the federal funds rate. Other indicators point to a more severe slowdown. The interest rate yield curve is inverted with long-term rates lower than sh ort- term rates. This has often been a leading indicator of an ec onomic recession. Manufacturing has weakened. Initially, this weakening was confined to the auto and housing related sectors. Howe ver, there are some indications of a wider downturn in thi s sector. These conflicting indicators highl ight the uncertainty and risk currently facing the national economy. The State's economy is expected to follow the general pattern of the national economy. In fact, growth in non-farm employment h as moderated in recent months although it is still strong relati ve to employment growth for the U.S. as a whole. In addition to these potential macro-economic impacts, Georgia's economic out look is also affected by uncertainty associated wi th key sectors of its economy. Delta Air Lines, a major employer , is in bankruptcy proceedings and is the target of a proposed acquisition. One major auto manufacturing pl ant has shut-down and the State's other majo r plant is expected to close in 2007. O ther manufacturing sectors are also under pressure; for example, te xtile mills and apparel manufacturi ng. Acquisitions of Georgia-ba sed corporations are in the works. While t hese events are of critical importance to t he companies and their employees, it is impor tant to keep in mind that events such as these are part and parcel of a dynamic, market economy. Moreover, each of these events represents a small part of the overall Georgia economy. 2 U.S. Economic Trends Overview The last U.S. recession ended in late 2001 and the economy has grown consistently from that low. Figure 1 below illustrates th e improvement in the U.S. unemployment rate and the indus trial capacity utilization rate since that time. The band on the chart highlights the duration of the 2001 recession. As these indica tors improved, the Federal Reserve began a measured policy of regular increases in the federal funds rate. The rationale was that the economy was approaching full capacity utilization with unemployment falling toward 5.0% and capacity utilization increasing toward 80%. At these levels, the economy is considered to be at full employment, and, if economic growth were to continue to push capacity utilization higher and unemployment lower, the th reat of escalating inflation would rise. The aim was to achieve a soft-landing in which the economic growth slows to its long-term potential, inflation remains low and a recession is avoided. Figure 1 Figure 2 below shows the overall slowing in GDP growth as higher interest rates have had an impact on the economy. Real GDP growth slowed in the last two quarters of 2006; falling to 2.6% in Q2 and then down to 2.2% in Q3. Figure 2 Figure 3 examines some of the detail underlying this growth slow down. It shows the contribution of the monthly percentage grow th from the four broad sectors of the economy. As shown, pers onal consumption spending slowed signi ficantly from Q1 to Q2 and then made a moderate recovery in Q3 but is running at a relatively low rate of growth. Given that consumption makes up about 70 % of the U.S. GDP, slow growth in consumption has a major impact on overall growth. 3 More dramatically, investment has slowed significantly over t he three quarters and barely made a positive contribution to growt h in Q3. Finally, net exports have varied bet ween providing a boost to growth or a drag on growth over this period. Figure 3 Figure 4 examines more closely the change in growth due to investment activity. Figure 4 The key trend has been the large drag on overall growth due to the decline in investment in residential structures. At the same time, investment in equipment and software and in nonresidential structures has been reasonably strong. Investment has been a net contributor to GDP growth in three of the last four quarters. Given slowing growth in the br oader economy, this could be a sig n of excessive inventory accumulation which w ill cause a further slow-down as business a ttempt to balance inventory positions with demand growth. There are six key trends affect ing the US economic outlook. 4 1. Severe slowdown in housing The downturn in housing in recent months has been dramatic as evidenced by several i ndicators of the national housing market. First, Figure 5 pictures the trends in sales of existing and new homes. Since peaking in mid-2005, sales have plummeted. Sales of existing homes are over 14% off their peak while sales of new homes are down by about 27% from their peak. Figure 5 A similar trend appears in housing starts. Figure 6 depicts the dow nturn in housing starts. The downturn in housing sales beg an in mid-2005. Housing starts responded to this downturn with a lagged effect. Housing starts began their decline in early 2006 an d are down about 24% from the recent peak. Figure 6 Finally, housing prices have fallen in respons e. Figure 7 pictures the year over year percentage change in the median selling price of existing homes as reported by the Nati onal Association of Realtors. After rapi d escalation in 2004 and much of 2005, the ra te of price escalation began to slow. Price appreciation has turned negative in the second half of 2006. 5 Figure 7 The downturn in housing markets is having broader affects on t he economy. First, lower constr uction activity reduces the employment level in construction and other housing related i ndustries such as mortgage lendi ng. Second, declining price appreciation and outright price declines reduce the wealth effect of housing. Ho meowners have tapped into their home equity in recent years to fund personal consumption expenditures. A resu lt has been that households have increased their debt obligation s and reduced their savings rate. Fi gure 8 depicts these two trends. Figure 8 One area of concern is the implications of the recent trend aw ay from the traditional fixed rate mortgage requiring twenty perc ent down payment combined with declining home values. This trend includes adjustable rate mortg ages as well as more exotic mortgages which include characteristics such as limited or zero down payments and zero principle payments under certain conditions. These mortgages often have allo wed homeowners to \"buy up\" in term s of purchasing a more expensive home and taking on more debt relative to the value of the home than tradi tional mortgages would allow. As long, as home values are risi ng and the homeowner's income comes up as monthly payments rise with adjustments in the interest rate, the mortgage works well. However, in an environment of falling home prices and slowing income growth due to weakening in the labor market, the stage could be set for a significant increase in foreclosures. In turn, this could casc ade into further weakening of home prices and construction activity. 6 2. Slowing growth in personal consumption expenditures With the wealth affect of rapid home price appreciation evaporating, households are likely to begin firming up their financial situation. Thus, it is likely that households will begin to save more and pa re back debt. This also means a drag on consumption growth. Figure 9 graphs the year over year percentage growth in total retail sales excluding motor vehicl es and parts. As shown, the g rowth has slowed precipitously in the last few months. Figure 9 3. Moderation in energy prices Energy prices have been volatile in since Hurricane Katrina disrupted offshore oil and gas prices in September 2005. As shown in Figure 5, oil and natural gas prices had been on a long-term upward trend prior to this disruption. Rising global demand due t o rapid economic growth in Asia had been a key factor behind this increase. Oil prices fell after the initial supply shock caused by Ka trina but then spiked again in late spring and summer of 2006. Geopolit ical risk in key oil producing regions around the world was t he primary factor that drove prices to all time highs with crude pr ices over $70 per barrel. Since that time, oil prices have dro pped sharply and are trading around $60 per barrel. Figure 10 The fall in energy prices will reduce the pressure on househol d budgets and provide some stimul us to consumer spending. 7 4. Interest rate yield curve is inverted Figure 11 depicts the interest rate yield curve for U.S. Treasury securities and its movements over the last five months. Over that time, the interest rate on 10 year Treasury bond has dropped 49 ba sis points while the rate on 3 month bills has dropped only 5 basis points. Note that the starting point, the yield curve t he week of July 21, 2006 was already inverted so that these moves have only increased the degree of inversion. Figure 11 Weekly Interest Rates on Treasuries 4.204.404.604.805.005.205.40 3 Month 6 Month 2 Year 10 Year 20 Year 21Jul06 22Sep06 24Nov06 An inverted yield curve has often been a leading indicator of a recession. 5. Labor markets remain in good shape but there are some indications of weakening Despite the slowdown in growth, unemployment remains extremely low at 4.4%. As shown in Figure 12, non-farm employment growth has moderated but total employment continues to expand. Figure 12 Non-farm employment growth slowed from rates of growth near 1.6% but is currently stabilized near 1.4%. Thus, labor markets, a s measured by unemployment and additions to non-farm employment remain solid. Some evidence is building up of weakening labor markets based on unemployment insurance data. Figure 13 shows that initial claims for unemployment insurance and conti nuing claims have both ramped up in recent we eks. This creates some expectation of softening in the labor market. 8 Figure 13 6. Manufacturing appears to be slowing Manufacturing is beginning to show signs of a broader slowdown. Figure 14 shows new orders, shipments and the unfilled orders backlog for manufacturers. As shown, both new orders and shipments have declined in recent months. Figure 14 While much of the weakness is concentrated in the auto and housing -related materials sectors, new order activity suggests that the decline is broadening. Summary and Outlook The most likely scenario for the U.S. economy is for continued mo derate growth. The economy currently is near capacity with unemployment running well-below 5% and capacity utilization over 80%. Georgia Economic Trends Georgia's economy has performed well over the past year enjoying strong growth in employment. However, the slowdown in the U.S. economy is expected to feed into the Georgia economy. In fa ct, some signs of slowing grow th are already apparent. As show n in Figure 15, non-farm employment growth has moderated from in ex cess of 2.5% on a year over year basis to about 1.9%. Note that Georgia's employment market continues to expand more quickly than that of the U.S. as a whole. 9 Figure 15 In addition, there has been a slight increase in unemployment insurance claims in recent weeks, similar to the U.S. However, i t is likely that some of the increase in initial claims is associated with the closing of the Ford Hapeville assembly plant at the e nd of October 2006 and, thus, may not suggest broader weakening in the Georgia labor market. Figure 16 shows the recent trends in unemployment insurance claims in Georgia. Figure 16 Georgia's non-farm employment situation re flects in part the on-going transition as t he State increasingly integrates into the global economy and adapts to other structural changes in the economy. Figure 17 summarizes the net percentage change in payrolls for major sectors of Georgia's economy over the period January 2001 through June 2003. 10 Figure 17 Non-farm Employment - % Change Jun 03 over He alt hLeisureOther SvcsGovernm ent Job losses were spread across most sectors of the economy in cluding construction, manufacturi ng, retail & wholesale trade, information, professional services, transportation and utilities, and other services sectors. Job gains were limited to a few s ectors including leisure, educati on and health, and financial. These job losses reflect both the cyclical downturn and the rise of global competit ion. Global competition has negatively impac ted manufacturing employment in the U.S. and Georgia as producers look to squeeze out any producti on costs possible by shifting production overseas and low-cost foreign pro ducers claim a larger share of the global market. In addition, the retail sector ha s gone through significant restructuring in which sm aller retailers have difficulty competing with larger retailers with more efficien t operations. This tends to reduce employment in the retail sect or. Other sectors have also s een increased outsourcing of jobs to off- shore locations which impacted employment levels. Despite these challenges, employment growth has recovered we ll in Georgia. Figure 18 depicts the change in employment in Georgia from the trough in June 2003 through October 2006. This chart indicates that employment growth has been broad-based spread across almost all sectors of the economy with particular strengths in education and health , professional services, leisu re and construction. Manufacturing employment has been almost stable over this period. T he information sector, which includes teleco m, remains weak. Figure 18 Non-farm Employment - % Change Oct 06 Over SvcsGove r nme nt 11 The weakening in the U.S. housing market is also in evidence in Georgia. Figure 19 compares housing starts in the U.S. to Georgia. The data are expressed in percent change over the pr ior year on a three month moving average basis. As shown, starts are down substantially but the decline in the U.S. is much more severe than in Georgia Figure 19 The milder downturn in housing starts is c onsistent with the relative price escalati on in home prices in Georgia compared to th e U.S. The rationale is that since Georgia did not experience the rapid price escalation enjoyed in many markets, there is less specul ative excess to work out in the Georgia market. Thus the downturn should be milder in Georgia compared to the U.S. and especially to the regional markets that experienced the hi ghest price appreciation rates. Figure 20 com pares median prices in Georgia to thos e of the U.S. as a whole as reported by the Offi ce of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. Figure 20 Personal income growth has also shown some signs of slowdown. As shown in Figure 21 Personal in come growth hit a recent peak in the fourth quarter of 2005 and has moderated since that time. Moreover, personal income growth in Georgia has fallen below the comparable growth for the U.S. in the last two quarters. 12 Figure 21 The acceleration in growth in FY 2006 resulted in accelerating gr owth in tax revenues in that fiscal year. The emerging econom ic slowdown the nation and the state are now experiencing is also slowing revenue growth. Figure 22 shows monthly growth in tax revenues as reported by the Georgia Department of Revenue on a three month moving average basis. Figure 22 Growth in DOR Receipts (Yr/Yr % Change - 3 Month growth has slowed subs tantially since peaking in March 2006. Summary In contrast to last year at this time, Georgia's economic grow th is moderating. Currently, employment growth remains well abov e that of the U.S. but personal income growth is currently running more slowly than U.S. growth. Assuming the current outlook for stable but moderate growth in the U.S. economy plays out, Georgia's economy should follow-suit . In the short-term, Georgia's economy is fac ed with digesting the loss of manufacturing j obs associated with plant shut-downs an d acquisitions of large companies based in t he state. However, given the size of the State's economy and the on-going growth in businesses and associated employment, the State's economy should be able to absorb these losses while maintaining its growth momentum. The major risk to the near-term outlook is a more severe than anticipated slowdown or outright recession in the national econom y. FY 2008 BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS 13 EDUCATED GEORGIA Governor Perdue continues to place needed resources into education from Pre-K to higher education. This commitment to education is based on his belief that by preparing Georgians for the challenges of this new century they can realize the American dream of ever expanding opportunities and a better life. This budget demonstrates the st ate's dedication to education by funding enrollment growth in all leve ls of education: Pre-K, K-12, and higher education. In addition, funds have been included to expand the graduation coach program from high sc hool to middle school as part of the concerted state effort to reduce the number of high school dropouts. Significant funds are also commi tted to major capital projects, to deal with the major enrollment growth in education. Facilities are recommended to insure that classrooms will be available for Georgia students from the time they enter kindergarten to the time they are pursuing college. EARLY CARE AND LEARING $12,693,598 in lottery funds to fund enrollment growth, increasing the total number of slots in the Pre-Kindergarten program to 78,000. STUDENT FINANCE $658,912 to expand GAcollege411 marketing efforts and to provide 4 financial consultants to educate students, parents, counselors and graduation coaches about the resources available through GAcollege411. The goal of GAcollege411 is to increase access to college by helping students plan, apply, and pay for college. $250,000 to provide 25 nursing service cancelable loans for graduate degrees. This recommendation will address the critical shortage field of nursing by helping to recruit nurse faculty. $718,000 to support Georgia National Guard members and the families of wounded members by providing 125 additional Helping Educate Reservists and their O ffspring (HERO) scholarships. $3,280,000 to increase Tuition Equalization Grants (TEG) from $1,000 to $1,100 per award to assist Georgian students attending private colleges and universities. K-12 PUBLIC SCHOOLS $152,589,582 to recognize a 2.65 percent increase in enrollment growth, bringing the total number of full time equivalent (FTE) students funded for FY 2008 to 1,607,836. The Governor also recommends an increase of $89,549,344 in traini ng and experience for teachers. Enrollment Growth 3200 4200 52006200 7200 8 in additional Equalization Grant funding in FY 2008 to recognize the gap in wealth between school systems. $417,670,000 in 20-year bonds for capital outlay construction in local school systems. $794,140 is recommended to address many of the needs at the 3 state schools and Georgia PINES program (Parent Infant Network for Educational Services). Five new instructors are needed at the Atlanta Area School for the Deaf due to increased enrollment. The recommendation also includes fundi ng for training and experience for teachers and for ongoing minor repair and renovations (MRR) at the 3 schools. Additional funding for trav el is recommended for the Georgia PINES program to maintain services to parents of students with disabilities. $1,213,500 to expand funding of $100 gift cards to all classroom teachers to purchase classroom s upplies. More than 105,000 teachers used these cards in FY 2007. The additional funds are provided for new teachers as well as to provi de one card for every K-12 media center. $600,000 to expand the Teacher Success Model, an evaluation system based on performance standards and student learning measures. This model for teacher assessment will improve teacher quality by developing valid methods, tools, resources and training to support educators in assessing teachi ng practices. Funds will provide 4 new positions and associated expenses. $2,404,116 for Advanced Placement (AP) exams to recognize an increase in the number of students tested. The Governor also recommends an increase in PSAT funding for FY 2008 of $169,152 (in addition to $88,529 for Amended FY 2007.) It is anticipated that students will take 55,000 AP exams and 99,000 PSAT exams in FY 2007. $780,000 to begin JROTC programs at small rural schools to aid in dropout prevention. The funds will support 13 new programs across the state with enrollment of 50 students per program. $2,500,000 for incentives to encourage students to prepare for and take a college entrance exam. Number of GAcollege411 FY 2008 BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS 14 $21,351,588 in additional funds to continue and expand the graduation coach program. This program began in FY 2007 as an innovative way to address the high school graduation rate. The graduation coaches identify students who are at risk of dropping out of school and develop strategies and inte rventions to help these students graduate from high school. The Governor recommends expanding the graduation coach program to middle schools. 63.365.469.470.8 5860626466687072Percent of Graduates 2003 200 4200 52006 Fiscal YearGeorgia's Graduation Rate UNIVERSITY SYSTEM $80,077,807 to recognize a 1.8 percent increase in credit hours, bringing the total number of hours generated to 6,631,556. The credit hours were generated by 259,945 students. Both numbers represent an all-time high for the University System of Georgia (USG). bonds is recommended for USG capital outlay projects. This recommendation includes a professional sciences center at Macon State College, School of Pharmacy building at the University of Georgia, a library for Georgia Gwinnett College and a health sciences building at Kennesaw State University. $500,000 is recommended to expand the course offerings at the University of Georgia-Griffin ca mpus. Majors will include Special Education, Science Education and Adult Education. UGA-Griffin anticipates enrollment to grow to 175 students in FY 2008. $297,294 to increase the public library state grants formula based on an increase in state population. $190,000 to expand the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. The SBIR office a ssists high-tech start-up companies across the state in securing feder al seed capital funding for product development. SBIR anticipates a high return on investment in the area of leveraged federal funds over the next few years from the increased outreach efforts. $700,000 for the Agricultural Experiment Station and $300,000 for the Cooperative Extension Servic e is recommended to provide for ongoing maintenance and operating needs across the state. $10,000,000 additional funding for Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) to assist with start up. GGC is t he first new college in the University System of Georgia since 1970. It will enroll its first freshman class in FY 2008. $3,838,996 to expand Medical College of Georgia course offerings to the Athens area. Currently, Georgia ranks 37 th in the nation for per capita physicians. $1,707,623 to fund the recruitment of 20 additional Eminent Cancer Scientists and Clinicians. $4,083,333 for the development of a digital dashboard to provide real-time data on the state of cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment in Georgia. $17,500,000 in cash and $42,500,000 in general obligation bonds is recommended for Major Rehabilitation and Renovation (MRR) on USG's 35 campuses. The University System operates over 44,000,000 square feet. $10,000,000 to begin the Life Sciences Vaccine Initiative, a major thrust by the Georgia Research A lliance in establishing Georgia as a hub for vaccine research. TECHNICAL AND ADULT EDUCATION $650,000 to expand the fast track nursing initiative. This funding allows technical colleges with nursing programs to expand course offerings to neighboring colleges that do not have a nursing program. The program anticipates placing over 100 new nurses into the workforce in FY 2008. $20,710,750 in cash is recommended for minor repairs and renovations and replacement of obsol ete equipment. Previously, these items were funded with bonds. $52,980,000 in bonds is recommended for new construction projects and equipment for the technical college system capital outlay projects. This recommendation includes c onstruction of health sciences buildings at both Athens Technica l College and Columbus Technical College. $3,000,000 for adult literacy programs. HEALTHY GEORGIA Health care costs have become a growing component of state government spending. This budget allocates resources to preserve the security of health care coverage through the Medicaid and PeachCare programs. It is based on c ontinuing efforts by the state in costs containment in both areas. These changes, which have saved over $4.2 billion over five years, have allowed Georgia to continue FY 2008 BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS 15 adequate levels of health care servic es to children and those with low incomes. Also included is a funding increase in the State Health Benefit Plan, which provides health insurance coverage to active and retired teachers, state employees, and their dependents. Changes in accounting standards require the state to report the actuarial liability for retiree health insurance benefits. This budget begins this transition by placing $100 million in a separate account to fund Other Post Employee Benefits (OPEB) for retiree healthcare for state employees. Governor Perdue has continued to care for the most vulnerable members of our society by funding additional slots for the Mental Retardation Waiver Program, as well as, additional positions for the Community Care Service Program, which allows elderly clients to continue to live at home. Georgia ranks 1 st in the Southeast and 3rd nationally in vaccination coverage for children. The state's appropriation of funds to ensure that all children receive vaccines has incr eased Georgia's vaccination rate. Without this level of commitment there would be significant barriers to vaccination for Georgia's uninsured children. COMMUNITY HEALTH $176,000,000 to fund increased costs in the State Health Benefit Plan, which provides health insur ance coverage for active and retired teachers, state employees, and their dependents. $100,000,000 to fund Other Post Employee Benefits (OPEB) for retiree healthcare. The Governor's PeachCare budget assumes full federal funding to ensure continuation of health benefits through FY 2008. Implement a Long-Term Care Partnership program in Georgia to encourage investment in long-term care insurance. Implement Money Follows the Person Grant to rebalance the distribution of services between institutions and the community Implement a Health Information Technology and Transparency Advisory Board to promote health care information transparency. $1.5 million in tobacco settlement funds to establish a rural primary care access initiative. HUMAN RESOURCES $11,438,747 to fund 1,330 waiver slots for the Mental Retardation Waiver Program (MRWP) waiting list. $13,540,000 in bonds to fund needed maintenance repairs at hospitals and other facilities statewide. $7,200,000 to fund 83 forensic secure beds at the state hospitals. $4,339,738 to purchase Human Papillomavirus vaccines for underinsured children. $2,079,800 to fund an additional 500 slots in the Community Care Services Program for eligible elderly clients that will provide services to enable them to continue to live at home $2,700,000 to fund an additional 1,000 slots in the Non-Medicaid Home and Community Based Services program. Georgia has seen a rapid decrease in adult-only Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) c lients.

The lottery law was amended during the 1994 legislative session to require that a second reserve account within the Lottery for Education Account be established called the Scholarship Shortfall Reserve Subaccount.LOTTERY FUND EXPENDITURES GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDED BUDGET - AMENDED FY 2007 AND FY 2008 The scholarship reserve law requires a reserve equal to 50% of the amount of scholarship proceeds disbursed during the preceding year be maintained.The subaccount balance on June 30, 2006 totaled $223,220,798. Georgia's lottery laws require the establishment of two reserves that are funded as a percentage of lottery collections to avoid disruption in progra ms should collections fall short of annual appropriations. The Shortfall Reserve Subaccount was included in the original law and required that an amount be set aside each year equal to 10% of the prior year's total lotteryproceeds depositedinto the Lotteryfor Education Account. If net funds in the account are not sufficient to meet appropriations,funds shall be drawn from the reserve to make up the shortage.Current Budget Recommendations 36GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDED BUDGET - FY 2008 Currently, Georgia is ranked 1stin the southeast for average teacher salaries. Governor Perdue continues to demonstrate his respect and appreciation for the hard work of teachers by providing a 3% pay raise for all teachers,which is in addition to the 3% salary increase that more than half of the teachers will earn due to progression on theteacher salary schedule. The Governor also understands that many teachers purchase classroom supplies out oftheir pockets, to ensure their students have the tools they need to learn. In recognition of this, the Governor iscontinuing to provide public school K-12 teachers in Georgia with a $100 gift card to buy much needed classroomsupplies. Also, the dedicated faculty and staff at the University System and Department of Technical and AdultEducation will receive a 3% salary improvement. Average faculty salaries in Georgia continues to rank near the topof SREB states and are nearly 98 percent of the national average. This increase will ensure that faculty salariesremain competitive. Recruitment and retention of talented State employees will always be one of the most important issues facing the public sector. Because we are faced with an increasingly competitive labor market it is important to ensure that oursalaries and benefits remain commensurate with similar employers. The State commissioned a Compensation andBenefits Study which concluded that salary adjustments were needed in order for us to remain competitive. As aresult of this study, the Governor is providing agencies 0.5% of total personal services to be used for marketadjustments, performance incentives or equity adjustments. Additionally, certain job classifications that have beenidentified as more than 25% below market rate will be eligible for a supplemental salary adjustment. The recommendations put forth by the Governor in this budget are focused on attracting, motivating, and retaining a high performing workforce. The Governor's vision of becoming the best managed state in the nation can only beachieved by employing the best employees. Pay Package 1 Provide for general salary increase of 3% for employees of the Executive and Legislative Branches effective January 1, 2008. The proposed salary adjustment for Executive Branch employees will be in conformance with thecompensation and performance management plans promulgated by the State Personnel Board or as otherwiseprovided by law. Provide also for a cost-of-living adjustment as provided by O.C.G.A. code section 45-7-4(a) and(b). Additionally, provide 0.5% of total personal services to be used for market adjustments, performance incentivesor equity adjustments according to plans approved by the Georgia Merit System and the Governor's Office ofPlanning and Budget. $42,498,694 2Provide for supplemental salary adjustments for certain identified job classifications to ensure that all incumbents hired as of January 1, 2008 are paid no less than 75% of the market as identified in the Georgia Merit SystemCompensation and Benefits Study.7,544,270 3. Provide a 3% increase to the state base salary on the teacher salary schedule for the State Board of Education effective September 1, 2007. This proposed 3% salary improvement is in addition to the salary increases awardedto certificated personnel through normal progression on the teacher salary schedule.

T he public-private initiative is aligned with Governor Perdue's goal to make Georgia the best-managed state in America. The Commission brings an outsi de perspective and enterprise thinking to the workings of state government and recommends business-tested tools and best prac tices to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Commission objectives are directed at best value for the tax dollar, operational cost savings that will free up funds for higher priorities, increased accountability and transparency in managing state assets, streamlined management capabilities through enterprise-wide systems, and customer-centered services. Initiative Since 2003, the Commission has launched 17 short-term task forces of private-sector experts and pro bono consultants to analyze administrative processes and modernize business systems and strategies. Particular interests have included asset management (fleet, space, and property), procurement spending and sourcing, IT architecture and tech support, p ublic finance options, and accounts receivable. The Governor's Office of Implementation was established in 2004 to lead inter-agency efforts to put the initiatives into action. Results Of more than 70 Commission recommendations to date, 65 have been acted upon by the Governor's Office through Executive Orders and administrative directives. Cr oss-functional teams of agency administrators and staff have worked with the Office of Implementation to engineer operational innovations within departments and across the state. As of December 2006, Commission initiatives implemented in government have generated $13 milli on in estimated savings. (This does not include cost avoidance and pr oceeds from property sales used to renovate state office buildings .) Estimated savings are verified by an Internal Validation Committee established to substantiate dollar figures, methodologies and results. Members of the committee include the Governor's Chief Financial Office r, the State Accounting Officer, the Director of the Office of Planning and Budget, the Director of Implementation, and a private sector representative. The largest single source of savings is the Procurement Transformation Initiative, which is replacing piecemeal purchasing of billions of dollars in goods and services with a system of strategic sourcing that leverages the government's buying power to drive down pricing. An estimated $135 million in targeted savings is expected over the next four years. The main focus of the work is establishing new purchasing agreements in selected spending categories, phased in three waves. The initial wave of contracts, awarded in FY 2007 in five major categories, will yield approximately $15 million in first-year savings. Governor Perdue appointed Georgia's first State Property Officer and ordered the first statewide inventory of government-owned and - leased properties: more than 19, 000 buildings and 1,000 leases. Surplus properties have been identi fied for sale, and leases have been consolidated and renegotiated. The first-year savings on renegotiated leases totals $1.04 million. Available Savings Total savings resulting from Commission initiatives were distributed across agencies, and adjustments were made to break out the amount that represented state general funds only. Of the total $21.9 million savings, $6.7 million was identified in the Amended FY 2007 budget to redirect to other high priorities within agencies' budgets and $368,000 was eliminated entirely. As part of the budget process, each agency had the opportunity to propose plans for redirecting the savings to other priorities within their budget. As a result, agencies were allowed to retain savings within programs to fund projects that they identified as high priority. Some of these projects include: teleco mmunications and on-going technology needs; computer charges and software purchases; replacement of outdated computers, and increased real estate rentals. A portion of the savings was redirected to new initiatives and innovative projects. Examples include the Methamphetamine-force project in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, wireless broadband internet access for the Department of Juvenile Justice caseworkers, and the Clemency Online Navigation System for Pardons and Paroles. Details of the savings and redirections are shown by agency on the following chart. Agencies that were authorized to redirect all or a portion of their savings within programs are denoted by an asterisk. These savings are not reflected in the department budget summary pages. It should be noted that agencies that do not receive state general funds redirected their savings internally. Savings attributed to the legislative and judicial branches are available but are not redirected in these recommendations.

Included in these responsibili ties is a dairy inspection program for farms and processing plants, so that Georgia dairy products can be marketed as \"Grade A\" throughout the United States. The primary function of the Fuel and Measures section, another crucial function of the division, is to ensure equity in the market place by verifying the accuracy of weighing and measuring devices. The section inspects all measuring devices used for commerce by conducting on-site inspections and tests of commercial weighing devices including scales, liquefied pet roleum gas meters, milk tanks, moisture meters, gasoline pumps, transport tank trucks, fuel oil terminals, and bulk plants.

Additionally, the division enforces the requirements of the Dealers in Agricultural Products Act to license and bond those who purchase agricultural products from G eorgia producers, as well as the State Warehouse section, which examines and audits licensed and bonded facilities that store Georgia agricultural products. Additionally, the division registers and licenses Vidalia onion growers, licenses processors of Vidalia onion products , and enforces the requirements of the U.S. Certification Mark VIDALIA.

The department works to ensure that quality health care services are provided to a wide array of individuals, including state empl oyees, teachers, and retirees; and those citizens who are eligible for Medicaid or PeachCare for Kids by virtue of being aged, low-income, or disabled. The department is additionally charged with identifying and evaluating available options that would provide health insurance coverage for the estimated 1.7 million Georgians currently uninsur ed. A nine-person board appointed by the Governor has policy-making authority for DCH. The department has three major di visions: the Division of Medical Assistance Plans, the Division of Managed Care and Quality, and the Division of State Health Benefit Plan. DCH also targets health care access and improvement through the Office of Rural Health Services. There are three Boards that are administratively attached to the department: the Composite State Board of Medical Examiners, which licenses physicians; the Georgia Boar d for Physician Workforce, which provides financial aid to medi cal schools and residency training programs; and the State Medical Educ ation Board, which administers medical scholarships and loans to promote medical practice in rural areas. DIVISION OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PLANS The largest division in the depar tment, the Division of Medical Assistance Plans, administers the M edicaid program, which purchases health care on behalf of over 1.3 million persons who are aged, blind, disabled, or indigent. State and feder al dollars fund Medicaid with the federal government paying for about 60% of health care costs. A broad array of health care services is available that address the needs of program participants, including hospital, physician, pharmacy, and nursing home services. The division administers the state's Indigent Care Trust Fund (ICTF), which completed its 16th year of operation in 2006. Utilizing intergovernmental transfers and federal matching funds, the ICTF reimburses hospitals serving a di sproportionate share of medically indigent Georgians. The division is also responsib le for the PeachCare for Kids Program, Georgia's version of the federal Children's Health Insurance Program. PeachCare provides medical and dental coverage for over 200,000 children whose parents' income is too high to qualify for Medicaid, but who cannot afford private health insurance. Current eligibility allows children in fa milies with incomes between 185% and 235% of the federal poverty level to participate. DIVISION OF MANAGED CARE AND QUALITY The Division of Managed Care and Quality is responsible for implementing and directing the state's new healthcare management effort known as Georgia Healthy Families (GHF). Implemented in June 2006, the department, in partnership with private Care Management Organizati ons, provides a more efficient delivery of health care services, better care for members, and accountability to taxpayers while at the same time maintaining predictable and sustainable expenditure growth. Children, pregnant women and women with breast or cervic al cancer on Medicaid, as well as children enrolled in PeachCare, ar e eligible to participate in GHF. The GHF initiative was phased-in on a regional basis beginning June 2006 with the final regions brought into the plan September 2006. DIVISION OF STATE HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN The Division of State Health Benefit Plan (SHBP) manages the health plan which provides health in surance coverage to more than a half million state employees, teacher s, retirees, and their dependents. The SHBP offers members several coverage options including a preferred provider option (PPO), several HMO choices, a traditional indemnity plan, along with a limited number of pilot programs focused on consumer-directed healthcare. OTHER DIVISIONS The department also contains ot her divisions including General Counsel, which provides legal assistance to the department and administers the Certificate of Need (C ON) process; Office of Inspector General; Operations; Information Technology; Community Affairs; Communications; and Financial Management.

More than 52,000 of these offenders are serving prison sentences. More than 140,000 offenders are on probation. As part of its strategic plan, the department has developed the following priorities: Sound correctional practice is founded upon reliable and timely information. Citizens are safe from inca rcerated and supervised offenders; correctional environments will be safe, secure, and disciplined for all staff and offenders. Communications are hallmarked by enhanced public awareness, collaborative partnerships, and effective departmental teamwork. A continuum of balanced sanctions is available to the criminal justice system. A highly trained, professional work force is available to achieve the department's mission, today and in years to come. Prepare offenders to accept res ponsibility for their acts, to effect restitution to victims and the community, and to lead productive, crime-free lives. DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS Incarceration offers a highly structured and secure environment, which removes offenders from the community who pose a high risk. DOC provides legally mandated servic es in the areas of physical and mental health, counseling, education, vocational training, chaplain services, and recreation. DOC requires offenders in its facilities to work to support the system and the community. Inmates and probationers work on prison farms, in food preparation, laundr y, construction, in facility and landscape maintenance, and performing factory work in Correctional Industries' manufacturing plants. The types of DOC institutions include: State Prisons (42) - These instit utions are typically reserved for felony offenders with more than 1 year of incarceration to serve. County Prisons (24) - The state pays a subsidy to county institutions to house and supervise state inmates. Inmates assigned to the county prisons typically work on roadway or construction projects for the county in which they are housed. Inmate Boot Camps, Probation Boot Camps, Probation Detention Centers (24) - These three programs offer a short- term, intensive incarceration period. The boot camp program enforces strict discipline and military protocol. Transitional Centers (11) - These community-based centers are designed to allow offenders nearing the end of their prison term to prepare for life in the community. DOC requires offenders to have jobs in the local community, pay room and board to the center, and support their families. Probation Diversion Centers (11) - Judges may sentence offenders to diversion centers as an alternative to prison. Like transitional center residents, o ffenders in the diversion centers work and pay room and board, restitution, fines, and family support. Private Prisons (3) - D. Ray James prison, owned and operated by Cornell Corrections and prisons in Coffee and Wheeler counties owned and operated by Corrections Corporation of America house state sentenced inmates. Like state prisons, these facilities are typically reserved for felony offenders with more than one year of incarceration to serve. Probation is designed to enforce judicial sentences in the community. The Statewide Probation Act of 1956 laid the legal foundation for the Probation Divisi on. The law provides for standardized supervision by sworn peac e officers of those offenders sentenced to probation, either directly from court on a straight probation sentence, or after completing a specified term of imprisonment on a split sentence. Probationers are required to be employed and to pay restitution, fees, fines, and court costs. Many probationers are also required to perform community service - unpaid labor for the local community. Probationers are supervised with incr easing levels of intensity in accordance with the risk they pose to the community. Requirements at these varied supervision levels may include adherence to a curfew, wearing an electronic device to monito r movements, drug testing, and home and job visits by the probation officer.

The department disburses state education funds, provides technical assistance and support services to local school systems, operates three state schools for hearing- and visually-impaired students, and provi des intensive assistance to local schools identified by the Office of Student Achievement. There are 180 school systems in the state operating more than 2,100 schools. These schools are primarily funded through the Quality Basic Education (QBE) formula - a partnership between the state and local school systems that provides $8 billion in funding for education. STUDENT LEARNING AND ACHIEVEMENT The Department of Education pr ovides leadership in developing and implementing the new curriculum, the Georgia Performance Standards for elementary, middle and secondary students. The new curriculum, which was implemented in FY 2005, is raising the expectations for all our students. All English/Language Arts classes have been converted to the new curriculum, and the Department is on schedule with the remaining subjects. Full implementation of the new curriculum is expected in FY 2012. In addition to providing funds for daily instruction, the department also administers a number of programs for students in need of additional services. These in clude a program for handicapped preschool children, tuition for the multi-handicapped and funding for the Severely Emotionally Disturbed (SED) network. Nearly 15,900 students are being served through these grants totaling $103.7 million. In an effort to expand educational opportunities for all students in Georgia, the department opened the Georgia Virtual School in FY 2006. The Georgia Virtual School provides a number of core curriculum, foreign language, bus iness electives and Advanced Placement (AP) courses online for public, private and home school students. Current funding for the vi rtual school provides 4,000 slots. In an effort to improve the state's graduation rates, the department implemented an innovative program in FY07 which placed a graduation coach in every high school. Graduation coaches are instrumental in identifying students who are at-risk of not graduating and providing necessary interventions and strategies to help students graduate. Such efforts include devel oping individual graduation plans (Peach State Pathways), organizing tutoring programs to prepare for the Georgia High School Graduation Test (GHSGT), and creating a network of graduation teams and community mentors/partners to support the students and schools. The Department of Education also provides resources for students preparing for the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT). The department provides funding for high school sophomores to take the Preliminary Scholastic Assessm ent Test (PSAT). An additional resource for SAT preparation was added in FY 2006. The Department now provides an online SAT prep class for public, private and home school high school students. The online tool allows students to take practice tests and quizzes that ident ifies the students' strengths and weaknesses and helps them prepare for the SAT. More than 127,000 students have already taken advantage of this resource during FY 2007. SUPPORTING LOCAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS The department also administers funds and provides technical assistance for school improvement. School Improvement Teams serve five statewide regions and provi de intensive, targeted support and additional resources for schools and school systems not meeting Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) under the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act - particularly schools that have not made AYP for two or more years and are in Needs Improvement (NI) status. The school improvement program offers a wide array of services ranging from professional development, analysis and planning, and implementation strategies for sc hools not meeting the standards. Since the Department began its school improvement efforts in FY 2004, the number of schools in needs improvement status has declined from 533 to 310. The Department of Education partners with 16 Regional Education Service Agencies (RESA) to provide shared services to improve the effectiveness of educational programs and services of local school systems and to provide direct instructional programs to selected public school students. The Department of Education also provides funding and support for many state and federal grant programs including: Title I - Improving Basic Programs; Title II-A tation; Equalization; and Career, Technical and Agricultural Education.

In general, ERS is a vehicle for collecting employee and employer contributions, investing accumulat ed funds, and disbursing retirement benefits to members and beneficiaries. As required by Georgia law, the system is examined on an annual basis by an independent actuarial firm that specializes in pension and retirement plans. The firm prepares a yearly valuation on the contingent assets and liabilities of the system, thus revealing its abilit y to meet the future obligations of each retirement plan. An independent accounting firm also audits the system each year. EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM Since 1950, the staff of ERS has administered retirement benefits for state employees in accordance with the Official Code of Georgia. Full-time employees of participat ing departments are required to become members of ERS as a condition of employment, with the exception of employees who first become eligible after age 60. The ERS Board of Trustees is ultimately responsible for administration of the system, while the executive director - who is appointed by the board and serves at the pleasure of its members - is responsible for daily management of ERS operations. The board consists of seven members as follows: Three ex officio members (State Auditor, State Merit System Commissioner, and Office of Treasury and Fiscal Services Director). One member appointed by the Governor Two members - appointed by the first four members - with five or more years of creditable service with ERS and One member - appointed by the first six members - who must not hold public office, not be an ERS member, and have at least ten years of experience in the investment of money. The members who are not ex officio members serve four-year terms. LEGISLATIVE RETIREMENT SYSTEM (LRS) AND GEORGIA DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN (GDCP) LRS is a retirement plan for members of the General Assembly, while GDCP is a plan for tem porary, seasonal, and part-time employees of the state not covered by ERS or the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS). Both plans are placed under the administration of the ERS Board of Trustees. GEORGIA JUDICIAL RETIREMENT SYSTEM (GJRS) This system is for members and retirees of the Superior Court Judges Retirement System, the District Attorneys' Retirement System, and the Trial Judges and Solicitors Reti rement Fund, as well as certain employees of the Attorney Gene ral and Legislative Counsel. The GJRS Board of Trustees consists of the seven ER S trustees plus three additional members appointed by the Governor who serve in one of the following positions: state court judge, superior court judge, state court solicitor-general, juvenile court judge, or district attorney. These appointments are for four-year terms. PUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYEES' RE TIREMENT SYSTEM (PSERS) PSERS offers a supplemental retire ment plan to certain public school employees not covered by TRS. These employees include bus drivers, cafeteria workers, and custodians. The PSERS Board of Trustees consists of the seven ERS trustees plus two additional members appointed by the Governor for four-year terms. GEORGIA MILITARY PENSION FUND (GMPF) GMPF provides retirement allowances and other benefits for the Georgia National Guard. A member becomes eligible for benefits upon attainment of age 60 with 20 or more years of credible service (including at least 15 years of serv ice as a member of the National Guard), having served at least ten c onsecutive years as a member of the National Guard immediately prior to discharge, and having received an honorable discharge. PEACHSTATE RESERVES PeachState Reserves, transferred from the Georgia Merit System to ERS by executive order on July 1, 2005, is the deferred compensation retirement plan for the State of Georgia. Employee contributions and investments in 401k and 457 plans are administered by ERS through this program. AUTHORITY Title 45 and 47 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.

The commission carries out this mission by protecting the forest from fire, insects, and diseases, while working with private landowners and the forestry industry to maximize forest resources. The commission provides comprehensive forestry education programs, supplies high quality tree seedlings to Georgia landowners for reforestation, works with business to promote the continued production of Georgia-grown forest products, and facilitates the development of emerging forestry- based industries. The Georgia Forestry Commission protects and manages Georgia's 24 million acres of forestland, which represents an approximate $26 billion asset and comprises 75% of all land in the state. The commission has 4 main programs: Forest Protection, Forest Management, Tree Improvement, and the Tree Seedling Nursery. Through these programs, the Forestry Commission provides a wide variety of services to rural forest landowners, offers technical assistance to municipalities and urban landowners, provides seedlings at a reasonabl e price and protects the forest resources of the state through fire prevention and suppression. FOREST PROTECTION Forest protection, the primary function of the Georgia Forestry Commission, is carried out through the Fire Business Activities subprogram. This includes a statewi de network of county and district offices supplied with staff and equipment necessary for the prevention and suppression of more than 8,000 annual forest fires statewide. The basic fire suppre ssion function includes the prompt detection and reporting of fires, followed by a powerful initial response from trained firefighters oper ating crawler tractor-plow units and water trucks. The effectiveness of the Forest Protection program is a direct result of properly maintained equipment, including fire detection aircraft that can be quickl y mobilized in the early phases of a forest fire. In addition, through the Forest Protection program forest rangers carry out prescribed burns and firebreak plowing. These procedures help Georgia landowner s prevent wildfires and reduce the damage from fires that do occur. Under state code, the Georgia Forestry Commission is responsible for all wildfires outside the unincorporated areas of the state through the Rural Fire Defense subprogram. This ensures state coordination and cooperation with Georgia's rural fire department network and is the most valuable forest protection community outreach program offered by the commission. Rural Fire Defense provides low-cost fire equipment as well as assistance with training and operations for local, mostly rural, fire departments statewide. Through the Fire Prevention and Educ ation subprogram, the commission provides information about the prevent ion of dangerous wildfires and has established prevention measures su ch as burn permitting to encourage responsible debris burning. FOREST MANAGEMENT In the area of forest management, the commission provides technical assistance and service to private and industrial landowners. The responsibility of the Urban and Community Forestry Assistance subprogram is to provide leadersh ip and technical assistance in establishing and maintaining sustainable urban and community forests and to provide professional expertise to resolve conflicts between development and forest resources. Multiple forest resource management techniques for both public and private lands are encouraged and promoted through the Stewardship Management subprogram, which also conducts fo rest health monitoring (including periodic insect and disease evaluat ions, surveys and eradication), promotion of forest water quality, and cost-share technical assistance to the forest landowner in establishing sound forestry practices. Additionally, the department manages 4 state-owned and 2 non-state-owned forests through the State Managed Forests subprogram. The commission works to educate the public about forest resources and their contributions to the econom y and the environment of Georgia through its Utilization and Marketing s ubprogram. This promotes Georgia forest products both nationally and internationally and is presently implementing the Carbon Registry to encourage the offsetting of carbon- rich pollutants through the purchase of credits in forested land. Finally, the commission collects current forest resource data used to inform Georgia residents and policy makers through its Forestry Data Collection and Analysis subprogram. REFORESTATION The role of the Reforestation division is to provide high quality, genetically superior forest tree seedlings to the residents of Georgia at a reasonable price. The Reforestati on division is comprised of 2 programs, Tree Improvement and the Tree Seedling Nursery. The nursery, near Montezuma, produces a variety of pine and hardwood species for reforestation, timber production, wildlife habitat, and beautification purposes. The Tree Impr ovement program uses traditional plant breeding techniques to devel op fast-growing, disease-resistant varieties primarily for commercial wood production. Together these programs ensure the regeneration and sustainability of Georgia's vast forest resources. AUTHORITY Title 12-6 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.

Constitutionally, he is charged with executing the laws of the state and conserving the peace as Commander-in- Chief of the Georgia National Guard. The Governor is also charged statutorily with a number of responsibilities including the economic and fiscal management of state government. To accomplish these duties, the Governor must meet and work with citizens of Georgia, officials of local governments, members of the General Assembly, state agency heads and Federal officials. These activities will move us toward a more educated, healthy, safe and growing state. The Office of Planning and Budget (OPB) assists the Governor in the development of a policy driven state budget; develops and annually updates a State Strategic Plan; assists all state agencies in the development of their own strategic plans and ensures that it conforms to the state plan; and performs financial and personnel functions for the Office of the Governor and attached agencies. OPB al so conducts management studies and other evaluations of stat e government operations. The Governor's Program Budgeting initiative dictates that budgets will be predicated on programs that support departmental business plans and a more effective and efficient, results-oriented, and customer-focused budget process. To assist in managing state government in an efficient and effective manner, the Governor set up the Commission for a New Georgia, a non-profit corporation led by CEOs and senior executives from all parts of Geor gia. Their mission is to bring a fresh perspective to ways state government can better manage its assets and services and map its strategic future. Nearly 300 knowledgeable citizens have serv ed on 17 focused, fast-acting task forces tackling a wide range of issues. The task forces recommended 54 actions to improve cost savings and customer service in government and to open new opportunities for a growing economy. These recommendations are now being put into effect through the Governor's Office of Implementation. ATTACHED AGENCIES Several agencies are attached to the Office of the Governor for administrative purposes. This reduces administrative costs through consolidation of the ad ministrative support functions. These agencies operate autonomously; however, their funding is received through the larger agency.

DHR serves all Georgia citizens through regulato ry inspection, direct service and financial assistance programs. DHR was created by the Georgia General Assembly in the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1972. The Act consolidated the Department of Public Health and the Department of Family and Children Services and other state human service programs. In that same year, the Board of Human Resources established an integrated service delivery system. The integrated system, which utilizes local boards of (public) health and regi onal boards for mental health, developmental disabilities and addictive diseases, allows Georgians to receive services in the comm unities where they live. DHR has four divisions: Aging Se rvices; Public Health; Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Addictive Diseases; and Family and Children Services. AGING SERVICES The Division of Aging Services administers programs for older Georgians and adults with disabilit ies. These programs provide in- home services to maintain i ndependence, provide public education and outreach services, health promotion, senior employment, investigative and protective services for vu lnerable adults, and an ombudsman program for Georgians in long-term care. PUBLIC HEALTH The Division of Public Health is responsible for ensuring conditions that protect the health and well being of Georgia citizens, providing disease control and prev ention, reducing the number of avoidable injury-related deaths and di sabilities, and promoting healthy lifestyles. The three basic function s of public health include: assessing the health of the community by di agnosing and investigating diseases, injuries, and health conditions and monitoring the health status and needs of individuals and the comm unity; ensuring the health of individuals and the safety of the comm unity through provision of health services; and establishing and im plementing sound public health policy. MENTAL HEALTH, DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, AND ADDICTIVE DISEASES The Division of Mental Health , Developmental Disabilities, and Addictive Diseases (MHDDAD) was created to establish, administer and supervise state programs for mental health, developmental disabilities and addictive diseases. The division is charged by law to: provide adequate mental health, developmental disabilities and addictive diseases servic es to all Georgians; pr ovide a unified system which encourages cooperation and sharing among government and private providers; and provide service through a coordinated and unified system that emphasizes community-based services. FAMILY AND CHILDREN SERVICES The Division of Family and Child ren Services (DFCS) provides child welfare, economic assistance, and family violence services. Services are provided through a network of offices in all 159 counties and through networks of community partners and contract agencies. Organizationally, DFCS is made up of three units - Field Operations, Programs and Policy, and Finance and Administration. CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES The Office of Child Support Serv ices (OCSS) helps children by enforcing parental obligation to pa y financial support. Services include locating non-custodial parents, conf irming paternity, establishing and enforcing child support and medical support orders, and collecting and distributing payments. REGULATORY SERVICES The Office of Regulatory Serv ices (ORS) ins pects, monitors, licenses, registers, and certifies a variety of health, long-term and childcare programs to ensure that facilities operate at acceptable levels, as mandated by state statutes and by rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Human Resources.

The department's role is twofold: Provide for the supervision, detention and rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents committed to the state's custody or supervision Provide necessary public safe ty services by appropriately separating youth offenders from the community The department accomplishes its mission through the operation of its five programs: Community Non-Secure Services, Community Supervision, Secure Detention, Secure Commitment and Administration. DJJ provides its services to nearly 60,000 youth every year and maintains a daily population of about 22,000. Youth who enter into the department's care include those sentenced to probation, short-term incarceration or committed to the state's custody as part of a long-term secure confinement plan. Based on a needs assessment, youth placed in the department's care receive a variety of rehabilitat ive services, as well as required educational programming. The department operates as a separate state school district, and has rece ived full Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) accreditation for both its regular and vocational education components. Juvenile offenders participate in many therapeutic and counseling prog rams that support their transition back into their communities and reduc e the risk of future delinquent activity. One of the department's fo remost principles is that of Balanced and Restorative Justice, a set of values that asks that the primary stakeholders in a crime be involved in repairing the harm caused and work to ensure that the community is a stronger place following the incident. DJJ operates under the guidance of a 15-member board appointed by the Governor. COMMUNITY NON-SECURE SERVICES AND COMMUNITY SUPERVISION These programs house the servic es provided to youth offenders placed in community settings as a re sult of directives issued by the Juvenile Court system. A broad continuum of specific programs delivering supervisory and rehabilitativ e services are provided to these youthful offenders, including residential therapeutic treatment, wilderness programs, group homes, mu lti-systemic therapy services, intensive supervision programs and electronic monitoring. Some 20,000 youth reside in community-based settings on any given day while in the department's care. The Community Supervision program contains all employees responsible for administering those programs housed within the Community Non-Secure Services program. Over 850 of the department's 4,200 staff members are part of the Community Supervision program. Most of these are juvenile probation and parole specialists, whose primary task is to supervise and maintain continuous interaction with y ouths placed in their charge. SECURE DETENTION All of the state's 22 Regional Youth Detention Centers (RYDCs) are included in the Secure Detention program. RYDC facilities are designed to provide a secure placement for youth awaiting formal adjudication for an offense. Nearly 1, 700 staff work in these facilities, located across the state and housing an average daily population of approximately 1,200 youth. SECURE COMMITMENT The state currently operates eight Youth Detention Campus (YDC) facilities, which house juven ile offenders committed to the state for a maximum of two years, and those youth sentenced to a short-term incarceration program for a maximum of 60 days. These facilities employ approximately 1,400 staff w ho provide services to an average daily population of nearly 1,000 youth. Both RYDC and YDC facilities provide the youths housed therein with a variety of services, includi ng academic, recreational, vocational, medical, counseling and other therapeutic programs. ATTACHED AGENCY The Children and Youth Coordinating Council (CYCC) is attached for administrative purposes to DJJ, and operates under the guidance of a 23 member board. The Council's goal is to assist local communities in preventing juven ile delinquency through the provision of state and federal grants, technical assistance and training of service providers. CYCC currently funds 120 community-based programs in Georgia totaling approximately $6.7 million in five program areas: delinquency prevention and early intervention, enforcement of underage drinking laws, the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG), Title V prevention and abstinence education.

The board reviews the sentences of all inmates to determine what degree of executive clemency may be warranted, directs the clemency action, and supervises the offenders who ha ve been paroled or conditionally released from prison until the co mpletion of their sentences. DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS In order to accomplish its mission, the agency has identified two core businesses: Making Informed Parole Decisions (Clemency) Transitioning Offenders Back into the Community (Field Supervision) The agency has re-engineered its entire organization to ensure that business processes, strategic objectives, performance measures, programs and budget are all aligned with the core mission. The organizational structure of the agency also reflects the core businesses and mission of the agency, with three divisions: Clemency, Fi eld Operations and Victim Services. The Administration program supports the mission of the Board. The Clemency division works most closely with the Board on a day-to-day basis, gathering information and preparing cases for the Board to make informed par ole decisions. The Clemency Division manages requests for restor ation of rights and pardons. The Field Operations Division assists the Clemency Division by completing important investigations that are used in the clemency decision process. Inmates who are granted the privilege of parole to community superv ision are supervised by this division's parole officers, who work in 56 offices throughout the state. Field parole officers prov ide offender oversight through a balanced approach to supervision which blends both surveillance and enforcement along with referrals to treatment and self-help programs. Victim Services works with victims or their families to answer their questions about parole, to ensure their views and concerns reach Board Members prior to th eir parole decision, and to keep them notified of activity on thei r case. This division is also responsible for communication with victims and victims groups to make sure board members know and understand their needs and concerns. Parole officers spend a majority of their time in the community intervening with parolees and their families, talking to employers, networking with police officials and staying in touch with treatment providers to ensure parolee comp liance with the conditions of parole. As certified peace office rs, parole officers also execute board warrants and provide backup to local law enforcement as needed. Administration supports the inte rnal operations of the agency including budget/fiscal, staff traini ng, personnel services, quality assurance audits, research, evaluat ion and technology, legislative liaison, internal affairs and public information.

In carrying out its responsibilities, the commiss ion promulgates and enforces rules governing regulated companies, a ssists consumers of regulated companies with questions and probl ematic situations, and educates the public on consumer rights and responsibilities in the evolving regulatory environment. Above all, the commission aims to ensure that the best value in electric, nat ural gas, transportation, and telecommunications services are de livered to Georgia consumers and that the level of pipeline safety and utility facility protection practiced in the state remains high. The PSC is a quasi-legislative, quasi-judicial agency directed by a five-member board of commissioners. Commissioners are elected through statewide general elections and serve six-year terms. The agency's staff includes accountants, analysts, engineers, information systems specialists, inspectors, and various administrative personnel who assist the commissioners in fulf illing their duties. The Commission has two programs: Facilities Protection and Utilities Regulation. FACILITIES PROTECTION Through its safety program, the Georgia Public Service Commission protects people, property, and the environment from physical harm from an accidental releas e of natural gas or other liquid, and averts interruptions of utility service resulting from damage to utility facilities caused by blasting or e xcavating operations. The commission fulfills its responsibilities by enfor cing industry compliance with safety rules and regulations and by educating the system operators. By training operators, the commission ensures that industry personnel understand proper procedures for locating and marking utility facilities before blasting or excavating. The combination of enforcement and education is highly effective and cont ributes to the health and security of Georgia. TRANSPORTATION Under legislation adopted by the 2005 General Assembly, the commission assumed the regulat ion of household goods movers, luxury limousines, buses, and non-consensual towers. The Commission sets maximum rates to be charged and ensures that these carriers are properly licensed, insured, and able to comply with all safety regulations. UTILITIES REGULATION The goal of Utilities Regulation is to ensure that telecommunications, electric, and natur al gas providers serve the state with affordable rates and quality service. Although the natural gas and tele communications industries have been partially opened to competition, the PSC remains responsible for monitoring the rates and service standar ds of electric, transportation, natural gas, and telecommunications co mpanies. Additionally, it is the role of the commission to approve s upply plans for electric and natural gas companies, monitor utility syst em and telecommunications network planning, arbitrate complaints among competitors, provide consumer protection and education, and certify competitive transportation, natural gas and telecommunications providers. The PSC recognizes that its responsibility to ensure that utility services are reliable and reasonabl y priced has not changed even as utility markets become more competitive. The Public Service Commission believes that Georgians should continue to have access to high quality utility services, whether those services are priced in a competitive market or through economic regulation.

USG works to create a more educated Georgia through its core missions of instruction, research and public service. INSTRUCTION Access to higher education is critical to the economic development of the state. Currently, 90% of Georgia citizens are within commuting distance of 1 of the 35 USG institutions. Twelve two-year colleges offer programs leading to an associate degree. Four state colleges offer associate degrees and limited baccalaureate degrees. Thirteen state universities offer baccalaureate degrees, and most offer associate and graduate degrees. Two regional and four research universities offer baccalaureate and professional degrees, along with some associate degrees. Also, four institutions offer technical programs through an arrangement with the Department of Technical and Adult Education (DTAE). In the fall of 2006, the System enrolled almost 260,000 students - its highest enrollment ever. Also during FY 2006, USG granted 43,848 degrees. RESEARCH Research is concentrated in four research universities: the University of Georgia, Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia State University, and the Medical College of Georgia. Funding for research is derived from the funding formula, federal or private sponsored research, special state programs lik e the Georgia Research Alliance (GRA), Traditional Industries Progr am (TIP), and special research institutes. For example, GRA is a partnership between Georgia's public and private research universities and private corporations to promote economic development by focusing Georgia's research capabilities in targeted technologies that offer significant potential for economic and industrial growth. Another example is TIP which pr ovides applied research grants in three areas\u2014food processing, pulp and paper production, and carpet and textiles. Researchers team up with industry to solve problems critical to the grow th and sustainability of Georgia's traditional industries. SERVICE The University System also has as one of its missions direct service to farmers, businesses, industry, and communities. Assistance is provided through continuing educat ion, public service institutes, and special services and organizations. For example, the Advanced Technology Development Center/Economic Development Institute (ATDC/EDI) encourages industrial and economic development by providing an extension service that meets the technical, informational and other needs of industry and local development groups as well as working on the nurturing of new technology companies. Cooperative Extension Service pr ovides assistance to Georgia farmers through a network of county extension agents who share information and research developed through the Agricultural Experiment Stations. Cooperative Ex tension also provides useful and practical information to the people of Georgia on subjects related to natural resources, home economics, youth development, rural development, and family support. OTHER ACTIVITIES The Board of Regents also overs ees the Public Libraries Service which provides assistance, inform ation, and materials to meet the needs of local communities throughout the state. There are 58 public library systems that operate 372 public libraries statewide in addition to the state's library for the blind and physically handicapped. ATTACHED AGENCY Attached to the University System is the Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission (GPTC) which provides a 9- station television and 13-station radio network designed to meet the educational, cultural and informati onal needs of the people of Georgia. Additionally, GPTC focuses on prov iding electronically delivered classroom support for all Georgia learners. AUTHORITY Titles 12, 20, 49 and 50 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.

The commission's primary goal is to make Georgia a better place for its citizens through the wi se use and protection of basic soil and water resources and to achieve practical water quality goals through agricultural best practices. There are 40 Soil and Water Conser vation Districts in Georgia, composed of 1 or more counties each; every county has at least 2 supervisor representatives on the Di strict Board of Supervisors. Serving as the coordinator of t he 370 district supervisors is a commission appointed by the Governor, comprised of 5 supervisors from different regions of the state and appointed by the Governor to serve 5-year terms. The commission is headquartered in Athens with 6 regional offices and has a professional staff whose primary duty is to serve and advance the goals of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts. The regional offices are located in Rome, Athens, Conyers, Milledgeville, Dawson, and Statesboro. CONSERVATION OF AGRICULTURAL WATER SUPPLIES The Conservation of Agricultur al Water Supplies program exists to assist agricultural water users in quantifying water use, conserving existing water supplies through irrigation audits, and reducing dependence on ground water and surface water supplies through agricultural catchments. The Soil and Water Conservation Commission accomplishes these goals through agricultural water metering by installing water meters on farmers' irrigation systems to track and document water usage. This allows the commission to accurately determine state water use and obtain data to be used by policy makers and individual farmers alike in developing water conservation strategies. In addition, the commi ssion administers farmer incentive programs designed to increase the uniformity and efficiency of agricultural irrigation systems and to develop agricultural water catchments for irrigation of cropland in South Georgia. CONSERVATION OF SOIL AND WATER RESOURCES The Conservation of Soil and Water Resources program supports landowners in protecting soil and water resources through the use of voluntary best management practices intended to meet water quality standards. Best management practices implemented by the commission and individual farmers pr event erosion and pollution on both agricultural and urban lands. Three subprograms in the Conservation of Soil and Water Resources program address different types of land and conservation issues. The Agricultural Lands subpr ogram helps to reduce soil erosion and non-point source pollutants on agricultural lands; Urban Lands addresses erosion on development sites by educating developers, local governments, and erosion and s ediment control professionals on best management practices; and Cons ervation District Education and Outreach promotes increased awareness of the importance of soil and water conservation by supplying Georgi a citizens with research data, mapping systems, and soil and water resource information. WATER RESOURCES AND LAND USE PLANNING The Water Resources and Land Use Planning program exists to conduct planning activiti es that further the understanding of water use and improve water management throughout the state. Through this program, the commission provides resource information to stakeholders and policy makers participating in the statewide water planning process, using wetted acreage maps and an irrigator gateway. WATERSHED FLOOD CONTROL DAMS Georgia has 357 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-constructed flood control watershed dams, most of them located in the northern part of the state. The Watershed Flood Control Dams program provides for proper operation and maintenance of these dams by working with federal, local, and Soil and Water Conservation District officials. Through the program, the commission helps to ensure that dams meet the Georgia Safe Dams Act standards for structural integrity, operate efficiently to provide multi-purpose use, and ensure flood protection for nearby communities.

As required by Georgia law, the sy stem is examined on an annual basis by an independent actuarial firm that specializes in pension and retirement plans. The firm pr epares a yearly valuation on the contingent assets and liabilities of the system, thus revealing its ability to meet future obligations. In addition, an independent accounting firm audits the system annually. Administration of the system is ultimately the responsibility of the TRS Board of Trustees, while daily management of system operations is the responsibility of the executive director. The executive director is appointed by the board and serves at the pleasure of its members. The board consists of ten members as follows: State Auditor, ex officio Director, Office of Treasury and Fiscal Services, ex officio Two classroom teachers (both active members of TRS) appointed by the Governor One school administrator (an ac tive member of TRS) appointed by the Governor One Board of Regents employee (an active member of TRS) appointed by the Board of Regents One trustee appointed by the Governor who must be an active member of TRS One trustee appointed by the Governor One retired member of TRS elected by the trustees One citizen (not a TRS member) experienced in the investment of money elected by the trustees MEMBERSHIP All individuals employed half time or more in covered positions of the state's public school systems, regional libraries, county libraries, and regional educational service agencies are required to be TRS members as a condition of employ ment. Covered positions include teachers, administrators, super visors, clerks, teacher aides, secretaries, public school nurses, and paraprofessionals. Similarly, employees in covere d positions of the University System of Georgia are required to be TRS members unless eligible for participation in an optional retire ment plan administered by the University System's Board of Regents. Also eligible for TRS membership are certain employees of the State Department of Education and the Department of Te chnical and Adult Education, along with public school lunchroom, maintenance, warehouse, and transportation managers and supervisors. INVESTMENTS TRS has its own \"in-house\" Invest ment Services Division, which handles day-to-day investment trans actions. Securities lending and portfolio officers, securities and investment analysts, and investment assistants are all part of the TRS investment team. Six members of the TRS Board of Trustees, along with the executive director, comprise the Investment Committee. Committee members convene with the directors of the Investment Services Division and hear recommendations from outside investment advisors at monthly meetings. Investment recommendations made by the committee require approval by the entire board. COLA FUNDS FOR LOCAL SYSTEM RETIREES Teachers who retired prior to July 1, 1978 from a local retirement system (Atlanta City Schools, Chatham County Schools, Fulton County Schools, and Rome City Schools) receive a post-retirement cost of living adjustment (COLA) to their monthly benefit whenever such adjustment is granted to teachers who retire under TRS. These funds are appropriated to TRS annually. FLOOR FUNDS FOR LOCAL SYSTEM RETIREES Any teacher who has retired from a local retirement system (Atlanta City Schools, Chatham County Schools, Fulton County Schools, and Rome City Schools) prior to July 1, 1978 shall receive a minimum allowance upon retirement of not less than $17.00 per month for each year of creditable service, not to exceed 40 years of service. These funds are appropriated to TRS annually. AUTHORITY Title 47, Chapter 3 of the Offi cial Code of Georgia Annotated.

In 1987, the new board was created as an agency separate from the Department of Education to provide guidance to public technical institutes operated by the state or by local boards of education. The board was renamed the State Board of Technical and Adult Education in 1988 to govern the newly created Department of Technical and Adult Education (DTAE). The department is divided into four programs: Technical Education, Adult Literacy, Economi c Development and Administration. TECHNICAL EDUCATION DTAE oversees 33 technical colleges, 31 branch campuses and seven technical education centers. In addition, there are four technical education divisions housed within four of the University System of Georgia colleges. The colleges offer more than 1,200 programs and provide opportunities for students to learn new skills or upgrade existing skills to keep pac e with rapidly-changing technology and competition in a world market. Students attending technical colleges have the option of short-term programs as well as courses of study leading to certificates, diplom as, and associate degrees. These programs can range in duration from a few weeks to two years. The technical colleges serve approximately 145,000 students annually and produce about 26,000 graduates each year. ADULT LITERACY The Adult Literacy program, through its network of 37 service delivery areas throughout the state, promotes and provides adult basic education and literacy programs, including the general educational diploma (GED) Testing program t hat awards GED diplomas. The program is the primary fiscal agent for the U.S. Department of Education adult literacy funds. It is also the largest adult literacy provider for other state agencies and facilitates collaboration among state and local entities to improve literacy efforts for adults needing basic English literacy, or s pecialized skills instruction. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (QUICK START) The Economic Development progra m provides employee training services to new and expanding industries as well as existing industries at no cost through Quick Start. Quick Start plays a key role in the state's business recruitment and retention efforts by serving as a state training incentive. Supported by DT AE's network of technical colleges, Quick Start has provided training for new jobs in virtually every technology required by Georgia's m anufacturing and service sectors. ADMINISTRATION The Administration program fulfill s overall administrative roles for the central office and the 33 technica l colleges. These activities include budgeting, accounting, purchasi ng, asset management, personnel, information technology, research, public information, facilities management, legal services, planning, and evaluation.

Since passage of this law, employees may now gain benefits from employers when injured on the job. The law ensures employees that certain benefits will be paid to them as a result of on-the-job injuries. The same la w also provides employers with a form of limited liability from these injuries. The state's workers' compensat ion law applies to all employers that have at least 3 full-time, part-ti me, or seasonal employees. Some categories of workers are exempt including: federal employees, railroad workers, farmers, domestic servants, business partners, independent contractors, and some corporate officers. The state created the State Board of Workers' Compensation to oversee the workers' compensation law. The board may create rules, regulations, and policies to enforce this area of law. The board is also vested with the responsibility of conducting training seminars that educate employers, employees, insure rs, self-insurers, physicians, and rehabilitation suppliers about work ers' compensation law changes and other related issues. If either the employer or an employee involved in a workers' compensation claim wishes to contest the facts involved in the case, an administrative law judge under the board or a board mediator may be used to settle the issue. Either party disagreeing with this ruling may appeal the decision through the appellate division, state superior or appellate courts; however, that avenue may only be used to debate points of law, not facts of a case. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE The board consists of three direct ors, 1 of which is the chair, and all are appointed by the Governor. The directors promulgate workers' compensation regulations, and develop workers' compensation policy. They also hear appeals of adminis trative law judges' decisions and render rulings on appeals, and approv e and submit budget requests for the agency. The executive director/chief operating officer oversees the operations of the board. The exec utive director also provides management supervision, makes presentations to various groups as requested, assists the directors as needed, and acts as peer review of medical services. The Alternative Dispute Resoluti on Division mediates appropriate issues, issues orders, and makes pr esentations to various groups as requested. The Appellate Division researches cases that are appealed to the board, recommends appropriate action, receives and processes documents regarding appealed cases, and sets calendars for appellate hearings. The Claims/Quality Assurance Di vision maintains the file room and filing system, screens requests for hearings, operates the mailroom, processes mail and forwards files and mail to divisions, locates files and resolves problems caused by duplicate files, codes and enters data, and performs quality assurance reviews of insurers and self-insurers. The Enforcement Division investigates incidents of non-compliance and incidents alleging fraud, maintains information on employers' insurance coverage, and makes presentations to various groups regarding fraud/compliance. The Trials Division holds formal hearings, and makes presentations to various groups as requested. The Managed Care and Rehabilitation Division processes requests for rehabilitation services, performs quality assurance reviews of rehabilitation suppliers, holds c onferences to resolve disputes, reviews and approves rehabilitation plans, reviews applications of managed care organizations, and regi sters rehabilitation suppliers. The Settlements Division reviews and processes stipulated settlements and requests for advances. The IT Services Division's mi ssion is to provide innovative contemporary and accessible technology in computing, media, telephone services and training to enabl e the SBWC staff to meet their goals as a state agency. The IT staff works collaboratively within the SBWC and stakeholders to provide technological leadership, which empowers its users through the use to technology.
