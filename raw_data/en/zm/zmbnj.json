We aim to bridge the gap between conventional and complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) on a sound scientific basis, promoting their mutual integration. The journal publishes papers relevant to complementary patient-centered care, especially those with emphases on novel, creative and clinically relevant approaches. It covers the entire spectrum of original research, clinical trials, views, conceptual papers, and reviews on complementary practice and methods, as well as clinical case studies of high quality and relevance. Article Types Research Article Research Articles report on primary research. They must describe significant and original observations. Consideration for publication is based on the article's originality, novelty, and scientific soundness, and the appropriateness of its analysis. Research Articles are reports of original work. Authors are asked to follow the [EQUATOR Network](http://www.equator-network.org/) for Research Articles. Prior approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or an Ethics Review Committee is required for all investigations involving human subjects. Documents [Research Article](/DocumentLibrary/ResearchArticle-2.docx) (DOCX, 28.97 KB) Word count: maximum 50,000 characters (10 printed pages) including title page, abstract, main text, illustrations, tables, and references. Each table or figure counts for 1,500 characters. Abstracts should be structured as follows: Background, Patients and Methods (or Material and Methods), Results, Conclusion. Review Article Review Articles are considered reviews of research or summary articles. They are state-of-the-art papers covering a current topic by experts in the field. They should give evidence on and provide answers to a well-defined aspect or question in a particular area. Review Articles must include a critical discussion of the reported data and give a clear conclusion with potential impacts on the standard of care. A downloadable template is available below.

Each table or figure counts for 1,500 characters. Systematic Review Systematic Reviews are literature reviews focused on a research question that synthesizes all high-quality research evidence relevant to that question. Systematic Reviews should be presented in the Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion format. The subject must be clearly defined. The objective of a Systematic Review should be to arrive at an evidence-based conclusion. The Methods section should give a clear indication of the literature search strategy, data extraction procedure, grading of evidence, and kind of analysis used. We strongly encourage authors to comply with the [Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.](http://www.prisma-statement.org/) A downloadable template is Review](/DocumentLibrary/SystematicReview-1.docx) (DOCX, 27.56 KB) Word count: maximum 50,000 characters (10 printed pages) including title page, abstract, main text, illustrations, tables, and references. Each table or figure counts for 1,500 characters. Case ReportCase Reports can present a case study, case report, or other description of a case. Case Reports present significant new insights or cases with an unusual and noteworthy course. Submissions can be based on a case or a number of similar cases. The most important aspect of the presentation is that it should provide a new perspective on a recognized clinical scenario or may represent an entirely new clinical condition. The novelty of the case(s) may lie in the phenotype, the presentation, the investigation, and/or the management. We strongly encourage authors to comply with the [CARE guidelines](http://www.care-statement.org/).The manuscript must include a statement detailing that written informed consent for publication was obtained and from whom (e.g. \"Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\"). If the patient has died, consent for publication must be obtained from their next of kin. If the patient described in the case report is a minor or vulnerable, then consent for publication must be obtained from the parent/legal guardian. The completed consent form must be made available to the Editor if requested, and will be treated confidentially. A downloadable template is available below. Documents [Case Report](/DocumentLibrary/CaseReport-1.docx) (DOCX, 27.04 KB) Word count: maximum 25,000 characters (5 printed pages) including title page, abstract, main text, illustrations, tables, and references.

[WHO definition](https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform)of clinical trials \"A clinical trial is any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes [...] Interventions include but are not restricted to drugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures, radiologic procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process-of-care changes, preventive care, etc. This definition includes Phase I to Phase IV trials.\" [ARRIVE](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines)guidelines. In the manuscript, authors should specify the name of the ethics committee or other relevant authority who approved the study protocol and provide the reference number where appropriate. [ICMJE recommendations](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/author-responsibilities--conflicts-of-interest.html)on the 'Disclosure of Financial and Non-Financial Relationships and Activities, and Conflicts of Interest'. Authors are required to disclose any relationship that could reasonably be perceived by a reader as a potential conflict of interest at the time of submission. All forms of support and financial involvement (e.g. employment, consultancies, honoraria, stock ownership and options, expert testimony, grants or patents received or pending, royalties) which took place in the previous three years should be listed, regardless of their potential relevance to the paper. Also the nonfinancial relationships (personal, political, or professional) that may potentially influence the writing of the manuscript should be declared. The role of the funder in study design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; any restrictions regarding the submission of the report for publication should be declared. If the funder had no role in any of the above, this should be clearly stated in the manuscript's funding section. [ICMJE Criteria for Authorship](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html)should be credited in the Acknowledgement section. If an author is removed from or added to the listed authors after submission, an explanation and a signed statement of agreement confirming the requested change are required from all the initially listed authors and from the author to be removed or added. Please note if authors are submitting to a journal with a double blind peer review policy, the Author Contributions statement should be anonymized where appropriate. [ICMJE](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html)recommends that: [FAIR Data Principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples)when depositing data. Authors are encouraged to deposit their research data in a repository that has been widely adopted within their research community, suitable repositories per each area and data type can be searched using the FAIRsharing database tool by DataCite](https://datacite.org/cite-your-data.html)(e.g. author(s), title, publisher (repository name), DOI) and follow journal style. References to software, when they appear in the reference list should include the minimum information recommended by the [FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group](https://zenodo.org/record/3479199#.ZCVqwcrMKUm)(e.g. creator(s), software title, publication venue (repository name), date the software was published, identifier (DOI, if available)) and follow journal style. [http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005](http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005). PlagiarismPlagiarism, whether intentional or not, is not tolerated in Karger's journals. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, copying or reusing text, ideas, images or data from other sources without clear attribution, and goes against the principle of academic publishing. Karger may subject any manuscripts to a plagiarism-detection software ( Crossref Similarity Check, powered by iThenticate) and if the software raises any concerns, there will be a follow-up investigation in line with [COPE guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/files/u2/02A_Plagiarism_Submitted.pdf). At any stage of peer-review, publication, or post-publication, if plagiarism is detected the manuscript may be rejected, corrected or retracted, as appropriate, and we reserve the right to inform the authors' institutions about any plagiarism detected. We expect that our editors and reviewers will inform the journal about any concerns related to plagiarism. Further Conditions Submissions are welcome in both English and German, preferably in whichever of these is the authors' native language or the language they use most often for academic purposes. Abstracts must be submitted in English and German. If the authors do not speak German, the journal will provide the translation once the manuscript has been accepted. CONSORT Reports on Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) should be prepared according to the [CONSORT statement](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/) ([BMJ 2010;340:c332]). The report must state explicitly how the comparison groups were assembled, allowing the reader to assess the method of randomization. Please specify in the title and summary that the manuscript is a report on an RCT. When an RCT is submitted, the authors should refer to the 'CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial' and the flow diagram available at www.cosort-statement.org. Both should be submitted with the manuscript, as they will be included in the review process. Reports on herbal/phytotherapeutic treatments should be prepared according to the CONSORT statement for herbal interventions (www.consort-statement.org/downloads/extensions; [Ann Intern Med 2006;144:364-367]). Reports on homeopathic treatments should be prepared according to the RedHot-Supplement to CONSORT [Forsch Komplementmed 2006;13:368-371]. Also see the explanatory document 'Recommendations for reporting randomized controlled trials of elaboration' (www.consort-statement.org/downloads/extensions; [J Clin Epidemiol 2006;59:1134-1149]). In order to facilitate information on the herbal interventions, point 4B.4 and 4D.1 of the CONSORT checklist are not mandatory in livestock trials. Early View Accepted papers are published online in the unedited, original manuscript version within a few days of acceptance, subject to the authors accepting and confirming applicable conditions of publication, including publication charges. The Early View version will be replaced by the version of record once available. Peer Review Peer Review Policy All Karger journals employ a rigorous peer-review process to confirm the validity and ensure scientific accuracy of published articles. Independent researchers with relevant expertise assess submitted manuscripts to help journal editors determine whether a manuscript should be published in their journal. Peer Review Type Complementary Medicine Research uses a single-blind peer review system where reviewers know the names of the authors, but the authors do not know who reviewed their manuscript. Peer Review Process The Editor-in-Chief and the international Editorial Board ensure a thorough and fair peer-review process with the highest scientific publishing standards. The editorial office performs preliminary checks on submitted manuscripts to ensure compliance with submission guidelines, editorial policies and ethical standards. After completion of internal checks, each submission is assessed by the Editor-in-Chief (and/or Managing Editor) who decides whether to proceed with peer review and may assign a suitable handling Editor (Associate Editor, Editorial Board Member or Guest Editor). Handling Editors guide the peer-review process for manuscripts within their areas of expertise with the help of reviewers who are well qualified and up-to-date on the subject matter and/or methodology. All articles, except for Editorials and some Correspondence articles, are externally peer reviewed, typically by at least two individuals with expertise in the manuscript content area and/or research methods, before a final decision is made about acceptance for publication. If an Editor, Editorial Board Member, or employee submits a manuscript, it is assigned to an independent Editor who will handle the peer review, and details of the review process, beyond the anonymized review and decision, are not accessible to the Editor, Editorial Board Member, or employee. All Editors, reviewers and authors shall adhere to Karger's editorial policies and best practices in line with [COPE Core Practices](https://publicationethics.org/core-practices) to maintain high standards of peer-review. Peer Reviewers Authors may suggest reviewers, who must have a recent publication record in the area of the submission, must not have published with the authors in recent years, and must not be from the same institution as the authors. Whether or not to consider these reviewers is at the Editor's discretion, and in line with Karger's Editorial policy. Where possible, institutional email addresses or information which will facilitate verifying the identity of the reviewer should be provided. Appeals and Complaints Any appeal on a decision or complaint during peer-review, or post-publication, must be submitted in writing to the corresponding Karger's editorial office (see \"Journal Contact\"). All cases will be handled in line with [COPE guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/guidance/Guidelines). Reproducibility Availability of materials The Methods section of the article must contain sufficient information to allow a reader to replicate the study. Karger encourages authors to use protocols.io as an open access repository for their detailed methodology. For protocols registered in [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/), please cite this record in your methods section and include the record DOI in the references. Karger supports the inclusion of Research Resource Identifiers in the methods section, for further information please see the [Resource Identification Portal](https://scicrunch.org/resources/). Supplier and catalogue numbers should be included for any chemical and reagents. Image presentation Where authors include a representative image of an experimental group or outcome it is expected that no image enhancements or adjustments are applied to that image. Where necessary for clarity of interpretation, for example, image cropping or brightness adjustment, this should be applied to the whole image, be detailed in the Methods section of the article and the original images must be uploaded as supplementary material. Statistics Karger recommends following The [SAMPL Guidelines](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/sampl/) when reporting statistical analyses. Sample size must be reported for each study in the methods section tables and Figure legends. Where statistical testing for the significance of an effect is carried out, a dedicated section for statistical methodology must be included in the Methods. This section should provide sufficient information that would allow, with access to the full data set, reproduction of the article's results. The choice of statistical tests and any post-hoc tests must be justified in this section. The threshold for significance, alpha, should be defined here as well as how multiple comparisons are adjusted for, where applicable. When reporting the results of statistical tests it is not sufficient to only report the p-value. For example, for a Student's t-test, it is necessary to report the degrees of freedom, t-statistic as well as the exact p-value. Materials Design Analysis Reporting Framework Karger Publishers endorses the Materials Design Analysis Reporting (MDAR) Framework for minimum reporting standards in the life sciences and encourages authors to consider all aspects of the [MDAR Framework](https://osf.io/2k3va/) relevant to their study when submitting a manuscript. Authors are encouraged to submit a completed [MDAR Checklist](https://osf.io/bj3mu) with their manuscripts. MisconductKarger takes seriously all allegations of potential misconduct and will follow relevant [COPE Guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/guidance/Guidelines). Concerns regarding a published article should be raised to the Research Integrity and Publication Ethics Manager at publication.ethics[at]karger.com. All efforts will be made to resolve concerns raised about a published article without undue delay and an Erratum or Retraction will be issued, where necessary. An Expression of Concern may be published to inform readers of ongoing matters in line with [COPE guidance](https://publicationethics.org/guidance). In cases of suspected research or publication misconduct, it may be necessary for the Editor or Publisher to contact and share submission details with third parties including authors' institutions and ethics committees in line with [COPE Guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/guidance/Guidelines). Advice may also be sought directly from COPE. Article Preparation Formatting The preferred word processing program for manuscripts is Microsoft Word. Page and line numbering should be activated, and the level of subheadings should be indicated clearly. Footnotes should be avoided. When essential, they should be numbered consecutively and appear at the foot of the appropriate page. Abbreviations (with the exception of those clearly well established in the field) should be explained when they are first used both in the abstract and in the main text. Units of measurement should be expressed in SI units wherever possible. Generic names of drugs (first letter: lowercase) should be used whenever possible. Registered trade names (first letter: uppercase) should be marked with the superscript registration symbol \u00ae or when they are first mentioned. The manuscript text, tables and illustrations must be submitted in separate files. For further technical specifications, including those regarding tables, figures, and illustrations, please refer to the [Karger website](https://karger.com/Resources/Authors/Submission#technical).

The authors should check the PDF document and respond to any questions that have been raised during proofreading within 48 hours. Alterations made to proofs, other than the correction of errors introduced by the Publisher, are charged to the authors and may require editorial approval. Please note that the revised proofs are not sent to the authors prior to typesetting and online publication unless there are exceptional circumstances. The article layout will be created according to the Karger standard. DOI NumberA DOI number will be available as a unique identifier on the title page of each article. DOIs are useful for identifying and citing articles published online without volume or issue information (for more information, see [www.doi.org](http://www.doi.org)). Online First PublicationAll articles are published electronically ahead of print with a DOI number and are supplemented later with the definite reference to the printed version. The articles become available immediately after the authors' approval to print. Licenses and Copyright [FAQ on our Open Access web pages](https://karger.com/open-access/index#faqs)for details. Archiving and Self-Archiving All articles are archived in Portico. Articles may also be archived in PubMed Central if the journal is indexed there. Karger supports Green Open Access and permits authors to archive their Author's Accepted Manuscript (AAM, i.e., accepted manuscripts after peer review but before production; also referred to as a postprint) on their personal home page or institution's repository, provided that these are not used for commercial purposes, are linked to the publisher's version, and acknowledge the publisher's copyright. Preprints may be shared without restriction. In addition, authors may post their accepted manuscripts in public Open Access repositories and scientific networks no earlier than 12 months following publication of the final version of their article. The posted manuscripts must: 1. Be used for noncommercial purposes only 2. Be linked to the final version on karger.com and include the following statement: \"This is the peer-reviewed but unedited manuscript version of the following article: [insert full citation, e.g., Cytogenet Genome Res 2014;142:227-238 (DOI: 10.1159/000361001)]. The final, published version is available at http://karger.com/?doi=[insert DOI number].\" It is the authors' responsibility to fulfill these requirements. For papers published online first with a DOI number only, full citation details must be added as soon as the paper is published in its final version. This is important to ensure that citations can be credited to the article. To facilitate compliance with Coalition S/Plan S Open Access mandates, Karger permits authors, independently and without Karger`s action, to upload a copy of their Author Accepted Manuscripts (AAM), applying a CC BY license, to a repository designated by their Plan S funders. However, when an article is published as Open Access, the Version of Record should be archived instead of the AAM. The AAM may be made freely available in the archive upon the official, final publication of the article (Version of Record or VOR, i.e. the post-production, final article version). Manuscripts to be archived in PubMed Central (PMC) due to NIH funding requirements or that have been published Open Access under Author's Choice will be submitted by Karger on the authors' behalf, as outlined under Funding Organizations. Articles published as Open Access under Author's Choice may be shared freely on any repository or website. Re-posted Open Access articles must follow the terms of the relevant Creative Commons license. To ensure citations are credited to the Version of Record, Karger encourages authors to link to the published article on karger.com and include the following statement: \"The Version of Record of this article is available at http://karger.com/?doi=[insert DOI number](e.g. [http://karger.com/?doi=10.1159/000365070).](http://karger.com/?doi=10.1159/000365070)\" Karger policies on Open Access, licensing and self-archiving can also be found at [Sherpa Romeo](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/id/publisher/242?template=romeo). Funding OrganizationsIf the authors are affiliated with an organization that has an Open Access agreement with Karger, the authors are prompted during submission to select from a list of these organizations. By choosing one of the listed organizations, eligibility can then be assessed. NIH-Funded Research The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy mandates that AAMs must be archived in its digital database PubMed Central (PMC) within 12 months of the official publication date. As a service to authors, Karger Publishers submits the accepted, unedited version of NIH-funded manuscripts to PMC upon publication, where it is made available after a 12-month embargo period. Where the authors have chosen to make their paper freely available under Karger's Author's Choice service, this embargo does not apply. Plan S Karger approves authors, independently and without Karger`s action, to make their AAMs openly available in PMC or another repository under a CC BY license upon publication of the Version of Record (VOR, i.e post-production, final article version). However, when an article is published as Open Access, the Version of Record should be archived instead of the AAM. Some Coalition S funders, such as Wellcome Trust, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and FWF, designate PMC as the repository in which to make the Author's Accepted Manuscript (AAM) openly available. For papers made Open Access via Author's Choice, Karger will deposit the article in PMC on the author's behalf with a CC BY license. Authors should refer to their funders' policies for details. Authors should check their funders' requirements about how to declare their funding and any associated mandates within their manuscript. [Karger website](https://karger.com/OpenAccess/AboutOA#transformative-journals). Karger Publishers also complies with other funders' requirements for submission to PMC. In some cases, doing so requires that authors select Author's Choice, which is generally reimbursed by the funder or is a permissible cost in the grant. Authors should include information on their grants in the Funding Sources section of their papers. More information on funding sources can be found on the [Karger website](https://karger.com/OpenAccess/Funding-and-Open-Access-Agreements). Errata and Retractions Karger is committed to maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the scientific record. Retractions will be issued where required in accordance with [COPE guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines). Errors in an article that affect the content of the article, such as figures or results, or the article metadata, such as the author list, will be corrected through the publication of an Erratum. Please note that the corrections of other errors introduced by authors and missed during the final manuscript proofing stage may be declined. Authors should [contact us](/pages/contact-us?mailbox=522184&mailtype=group) to report errors in their articles. Please state journal name, volume, issue and page numbers, the DOI number if the article has not yet been printed, as well as article title and the nature of the error. Submission Manuscript Submission Manuscripts should be submitted online via the Complementary Medicine Research submission and peer review system by the manuscript's corresponding author. The corresponding (submitting) author will automatically be the contact person for the manuscript for the peer review and production process. For fee payment and license signing, the contact author will be the first listed corresponding author. The corresponding (submitting) author is solely responsible for managing all communication between the journal and all co-authors and acts on behalf of all listed authors. This ensures that all correspondence reaches a unique contact and thereby secures swift communication in particular throughout the submission, peer review and production process. Articles can be published with more than one corresponding author (usually limited to three), but only the submitting author can be accommodated during the submission, peer review and production process. The corresponding (submitting) author's specific responsibilities include: - Ensuring all the listed authors have approved the manuscript submission to the journal and agreed to all of the content including the author list, including the Submission Declaration - Handling the revision(s) and re-submission(s) of the manuscript until acceptance - After acceptance, manuscript proof reading and approving the final proof - Acting as the point of contact for queries about the published article. It is their responsibility to inform all co-authors of any matters arising in relation to the published article including questions relating to publication ethics, availability of data, materials, etc. Where there are multiple corresponding authors, the first listed corresponding author's specific responsibilities include: - Upon acceptance, ensuring that all listed authors agree to the license agreement - Arranging for payment of Page Charges/Article Processing Charges where required. The affiliation of the corresponding author will be used to determine eligibility for discounted or waived charges including discounted or waived APCs under read and publish/offsetting/OA agreements Please note that the author names entered into the manuscript submission and peer review system should be identical to the information presented on the title page of the manuscript, including the sequence of authorship. The author names submitted should reflect the official publication names. It is the submitting (corresponding) author's responsibility to ensure the accuracy of all content in the proof, including the names of co-authors, addresses and affiliations. Before submission, please read the Submission Guidelines in full for specific requirements for manuscript preparation. A brief cover letter outlining how your study contributes to the current scientific literature and how it fits the aims and scope of the Journal should be provided. If your submission is part of a special issue of the journal, please refer to the specific name of the special issue in your cover letter and specify who invited the submission where appropriate. Submission DeclarationThe submitting author will submit, on behalf of all authors, their manuscript for potential publication after full peer-review. All co-authors will confirm that the submitting author has authority to act on their behalf via the verification link sent out to all authors upon completion of the submission. Please refer to the Submission Declaration PDF for details. Documents [Submission Declaration](/DocumentLibrary/SubmissionDeclaration-5.pdf) (PDF, 65.62 KB) "}
