Concerns about the negative impacts and rising expenses of traditional health care are also fueling the hunt for alternatives. Acupuncture, acupressure, homeopathy, Ayurveda, and hypnosis are examples of therapy modalities. Alternative therapies, on the other hand, are currently recommended as a supplement to traditional treatment. Although their efficacy as a standalone therapy is debatable, when used in conjunction with conventional treatment, they can be a valuable addition to the general dentist's therapeutic arsenal. When mainstream medicine cannot give a proper treatment or simply offers symptomatic alleviation for chronic diseases, the patient's desire for alternative therapies rises. This was found to be true for common medical conditions such as back pain and asthma. Surprisingly, patients seek conventional medical practice treatments for dental or oral health issues more frequently in emergencies (i.e., tooth pain or dental decay, temporomandibular joint disorder, periodontal disease, or dry mouth). Cloves and tea tree oil are the two topical or oral herbal or natural products that dental patients utilize most frequently. Furthermore, people worried about getting dental work done may find great benefits from using mind-body techniques.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-09-20", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
