At the El Sidr\u00f3n cave site in northern Spain, Homo (sapiens) neander- thalensis , an extinct species of archaic humans, ingested the non- nutritional medicinal plants Achillea millefolium (yarrow) and hamomilla (chamomile) and fungus Penicillium rubens , the source of penicillin [1], as shown by analysis of ingested par-ticles trapped in the dental calculus of their fossilized teeth. All of these medicines are still in use today. The archaeological record of multiple sites across the Near East spanning the Lower Paleolithicto the Neolithic period suggests that the deliberate and continued use of medicinal plants was universal among Paleolithic hominins [2]. Two of the oldest written medicinal traditions, Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TMC), date back over 5000 years.Much of the world is still dependent upon the use of herbal med-icines from these and other traditions for daily health needs.These treatments, found to be consistently effective, have be-come widely accepted as complementary health care treatmentseven in industrialized nations [3 -7].

Huffman Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University 41-2 + 81(0)568630085huffman.michael.8n@kyoto-u.jpABSTRACT The use of medicines was long considered by Western schools of thought to be a a domain unique to humans; however, folk-lore/Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) from around theworld suggests that animals have also long provided inspira-tion for the discovery of some medicinal plants used to treathumans and their livestock. Searching for medicinal knowl-edge from animals depends on the recognition of their abilityto select and effectively use medicinal plants to prevent or ac- tively ameliorate disease and other homeostatic imbalances. The interdisciplinary field of animal self-medication is provid-ing scientific evidence for this ability in species across the ani-mal kingdom and lends support to animal-origin medicinalplant folklore and recent ethnomedicinal information. Here,14 case studies of purported animal-inspired plant medicinesused by cultures around the world are presented togetherwith ethnomedicinal and pharmacological evidence. Based on this evidence, the diversity and potential mode of self- medicative behaviors are considered. Over 20 animal species,including llama, sloth and jaguar in South America, reindeerand yak in Eurasia, langur and macaque in Asia, and chimpan-zee, wild boar, porcupine and elephant in Africa, are linked tothese case studies, representing a variety of potential preven-tative or therapeutic self-medicative behaviors. These exam-ples provide an important perspective on what is likely to have been a much wider practice in the development of human tra- ditional medicine. A role for animal self-medication researchin the rejuvenation of old therapies and possible new discov-eries of phytotherapies for human and livestock health is en-couraged.Folklore, Animal Self-Medication, and Phytotherapy -Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Some Things TrueReviews 187Huffman MA.

Article published online: 2021-10-08traditions of medicinal plant use, and are sought after as sources of alternative treatments for human and livestock diseases in theface of growing antibiotic and antiviral resistance to syntheticdrugs [6,8 -13]. It is reasonable to assume that knowledge of what plants are medicinal and for what purposes is acquired by humans as a resultof regional independent discovery, the sharing of information be-tween groups, and at the beginning, perhaps even between dif- ferent hominin species that were intermixing at the time. One other possible route much less seriously considered until recentlyis the acquisition of medicinal plant use from the observation ofwild animals. Cindy Engel reviewed this topic in great depth inher book Wild Health , mentioning over 320 animal species and 137 plant species [14]. Indigenous societies around the worldhave long credited the observation of animals to the discovery ofsome medicinal plants too [9, 15]. For example, according to the beliefs of the Blackfoot, an indigenous North American people of Montana (USA) and Alberta(Canada), Na pi, their mythological creator, is believed to have taught humans to seek wisdom and advice from watching animals[16]. Today, and in the recent past, traditional healers among theWaTongwe in western Tanzania have discovered solutions tohealth problems from observing wild animals use plants whenshowing signs of sickness. These observations of elephant, bush pig, porcupine, and chimpanzee led them to the discovery of me- dicinal plants to treat such things as urinary infections, cholera,stomach upset, and diarrhea [17]. Innovative use of one of theseplants has led to a treatment for sexually transmitted diseases andsecondary infections in immunocompromised HIV patients inareas where access to modern antibiotics was limited and costly[17]. The pervasiveness of the animal origins of medicinal plant use in the literature raises the question of whether nonhuman animals played a larger role in the discovery of traditional medicines thanonce thought, and is there still more to learn? It has been arguedthat such 'folklore 'is a metaphor for indigenous interpretations of actual social and ecological phenomena observed in nature [18].The label of 'folklore 'should not put us off. If there is reason to believe there is something to it, it deserves to be investigatedmore closely. People around the world traditionally living close to and dependent upon nature have an intimate knowledge of the ecology of their surroundings, simply because their survival de-pends on it. This body of knowledge perhaps is best viewed as Tra-ditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), defined as 'the sum of data and ideas acquired by a human group of its environment resultingfrom the group s use and occupation of a specific region over many generations [19]. TEK includes the behavior of wild or do- mesticated animals of particular importance in their daily lives. The ability of animals to self-medicate has now gained wide recognition among scientists, but it did not go unnoticed by afew early scholars such as Aristotle in 'Historia animalium '(384 - 322 B.C.) and Pliny the Elder (ca. 77 -79 CE) in 'Naturalis historia '. Both made several mentions of self-medicative-like behaviors intheir descriptions of animal habits [20]. Given the universal adap-tive value of such behavior, it should not be surprising that evi-dence is now available from a wide range of species from insects to mammals [21 -27]. The scientific field of study into this isknown as zoopharmacognosy or animal self-medication [21,28]. In simple terms, zoopharmacogosy focuses on understandingwhat impacts the health of animals, what they do to protectthemselves from infection and, when sick, how they maintainphysiological homeostasis [17, 22, 29 -31]. Self-medicative behav- ior is currently divided into five basic modes: (1) 'sick behaviors ' (lethargy, depression, anorexia, behavioral fever, basking behav-ior); (2) behavioral avoidance or reduction of the possibility for disease transmission (avoidance of feces-contaminated food, water, substrates); (3) dietary selection of items with a preventa-tive or health maintenance effect (bioactive items eaten in smallamounts or on a limited basis); (4) ingestion of a non-nutritionalsubstance for the therapeutic treatment of a disease or its symp-toms (use of toxic or biologically active items at low frequency orin small amounts; and (5) application of a substance to the bodyor a living space for the treatment or control of vectors or external health conditions (fur rubbing, anting, den/nest fumigation) [31]. These modes are used to evaluate the diversity and level of self-medicative effort in the animal kingdom. The first clear-cut demonstration of self-medication came from research on chimpanzees in western Tanzania. By the inten-tional ingestion of the extremely bitter juice extracted from thepith of Vernonia amygdalina Del (Asteraceae), chimpanzees sup- press strongyle nematode infection and its associated symptoms when sick, bringing about relief of symptoms and a marked de- crease in parasite load [21]. Interestingly, chimpanzees use thepith, and the WaTongwe, traditionally living in the same habitat,use the leaves to treat similar symptoms. It was demonstratedthat they ingest approximately the same dose of the same majorbioactive compound, and both chimpanzees and humans showsigns of recovery within 20 hours [32 -34]. However, given the widespread use of V. amygdalina across Sub-Saharan Africa by hu- mans, even in areas where chimpanzees are not found, it is likely they discovered the plant s curative properties independently. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated a wide array of biologically active properties in V. amygdalina [35,36]. The 38]. This species also has many uses for the treatment of both human and livestock diseases [39, 40]. From the field and laboratory research on chimpanzee bitter- pith chewing, a four-point criterion for demonstrating therapeuticself-medication was established and has become the standard forself-medication research: (1) identify the disease or symptom(s)being treated; (2) distinguish the use of a therapeutic agent fromthat of everyday food items; (3) demonstrate a positive change inhealth condition following self-medicative behavior; and (4) pro- vide evidence for pharmacological activity from compounds present in the plant part ingested [21]. The study of animal self-medication provides an ecological and biological context for evaluating the animal origin folklore andTEK of some well-known traditional medicines and can help us topotentially derive different uses for them [41 -45]. The study of chimpanzee bitter-pith chewing (which is a Mode 4 behavior) hasalready led to the discovery of 11 bioactive constituents in a new group called the steroid glucosides [37]. 188Huffman MA.

The goal of this paper is to present and evaluate a subset of such animal-origin medicinal plant use stories and recent ethno-medicinal literature based on the above mentioned four-point cri-terion. The potential level of medicinal activity in the plant as-sessed from the literature will be presented, and the most likelyself-medicative mode of action the behavior could represent willbe tentatively assigned. This is not intended to be an extensive re-view of the animal-origin medicinal plant use literature, nor is it intended to promote the plants described here for use as thera- pies. These examples will be discussed from the perspective ofpast and present roles for animal self-medication research in theevaluation and implementation of traditional medicines as poten-tial phytotherapies in human and veterinary healthcare. Results and Discussion Aeschynomene cristata Vatke var. cristata (Fabaceae): porcupine The origin of this species use of this plant for medicinal purposes among the WaTongwe is linked to the observations of an of Tanzania. He observed the porcupinedigging up and chewing on the roots of this plant. The porcupine passed blood in its stools from ingesting the plant sb i t t e rr o o t s . Kalunde closely monitored the outcome until the porcupine re-covered from all symptoms a few days later [17, 46]. Kalunde was surprised that the porcupine would ingest the poisonous roots of the plant known to the WaTongwe as 'mulen- gelele ', and not only survived but recovered from its illness. Kalunde next needed to convince members of his village sufferingfrom similar symptoms to allow themselves to be treated. He did so by taking a measured dose himself to show that it was not toxic when taken in the appropriate dose. His grandson, my collabora-tor Mohamedi Seif Kalunde, later used mulengelele frequently tosuccessfully treat patients coming to him with what he diagnosedas a sexually transmitted disease, possibly gonorrhea. The use ofmulengelele became widespread among other WaTongwe healersfor its overall antibiotic activity. With limited access to westernHIV medications, mulengelele root extract was subsequently used to treat secondary symptoms of AIDS patients [17, 46]. Though pharmacological investigations have yet to be con- ducted, the effectiveness of the plant for treating sexually trans-mitted disease and dysentery-like symptoms of people in Ka-lunde s village all suggest antibiotic properties of A. cristata .O na visit to the Kew Gardens Herbarium in 1994, I came across avoucher specimen of A. cristata collected by the \"University of Ox- ford Tanganyika Expedition \"from the Mahale Mountains in 1959. On the label it reads 'antibiotic. 'I assume that this is what the col- lector was told at Mahale by whoever guided them to the plant,although I am unable to verify this. Based on the available information, this behavior can be classi- fied tentatively as Mode 4 therapeutic self-medication by the por-cupine.Amanita muscaria (L.) Lam. (Amanitaceae): caribou, reindeer, bear According to the S\u00e1mi reindeer herders of Finland, this mush- room, nutritious for humans when detoxified, is said to intoxicatereindeer when ingested. The animals are said to run about aim-lessly, emitting atypical noises, and twitching their heads. Wildcaribou, as reindeer are called in Canada, are reportedly affectedin the same way [14]. The Khanty people of Western Siberia be- lieved that bears eat these mushrooms for 'courage 'during the mating season [47]. Based on these observations, the Khanty arereported to have ingested the mushrooms for their hallucinogenicproperties to communicate with the spirit world and to meetpowerful spirits with 'courage '[47]. A. muscaria was used as a hallucinogen in group rituals, as well as by the Chukchi, Koryak, Inuit, and Russians east of the KolymaRiver and on the Kamchatka Peninsula [47]. The indigenous rein- deer herders in Siberia and the S\u00e1mi herders also collected and drank the urine of their reindeer, rich in the unmetabolized psy-choactive constituents of the mushrooms they foraged on priorto collection, for their hallucinogenic effect [48]. Another wayshamans reportedly obtained the desired effect was by quicklyslaughtering and eating the meat of animals intoxicated by themushrooms [47]. Also in Siberia, the urine of fellow humans whoingested A. muscaria was taken in order to maximize or prolong the hallucinogenic effects [48]. One dose of A. muscaria is said to be passed through the urine of 4 -5 people for its hallucinogenic effect [49]. The mushroom was also said to be ingested by theKhanty to increase strength for hunting and other strenuous activ- ities like walking long distances and enduring cold temperatures[48]. These mushrooms contain ibotenic acid, its breakdown prod- uct, muscimol, and other constituents that exhibit sedative-hyp- notic, depressant and hallucinogenic psychoactivity. The acid is noted to produce feelings of euphoria, muscle jerks, drowsiness,sweating, pupil dilation, and increased body temperature, symp-toms which appear 30 to 90 minutes after consumption and aresaid to be most intense after two or three hours [50]. The description of the effect of giving a bear 'courage 'could be the perception of the observer based on the bear sb e h a v i o ra n d perhaps their own experience, due to the plant s intoxicating properties in both a lowering of inhibition and inducing a sense of strength, real or not. A reduction of fear would be of benefitto the bear when competing for mates. Competition is high andinteractions between males and females at mating time can beviolent, as males are known to kill young cubs to induce femalesto resume reproductive cycling [51 -53]. More detailed information is needed to further understand the ecological context of its consumption, but as we will see from fur- ther examples, animals are known to ingest a variety of plants with stimulant or mildly hallucinogenic properties that could pro-mote alertness and temporarily enhance a feeling of wellnessunder periods of environmental or social stress. These effects,however, could also be side effects of the plant being ingestedby the animals for other reasons, but for humans the functionsare clearly expressed. Based on the available information, this behavior is tentatively classified as Mode 3, as a stimulant or tonic food, since there is no 189Huffman MA. Folklore, Animal Self-Medication, | \u00a9 2021.

The health maintenance effect could be derived from the short-termrejuvenating or energy-giving properties of a stimulant. The alka-loids in many hallucinogenic substances could also serve to sup-press infections. Banisteriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) C.V. Morton (Malpighiaceae): jaguar people credit their uses of Banisteriopsis caapi , also widely known as [14]. In the Amazonian rainforest, jaguars have been filmed gnawing onthe bitter roots, bark and leaves of this plant, after which they ap-pear dazed, rolling on their backs (www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqGDv0KCJl8). A similar behavior reported in many felid spe-cies, including domestic cats, is the frenzy induced by catnip ( Ne- peta & Zucc.] Planch. ex Maxim.), which to also have mosquito- and bedbug-repellent activities [54, 55]. The plant is used by shamans of the Tukano and other Amazo- nian cultures in ritualistic ceremonies and by hunters to heightenalertness and vision. It is said to give them 'jaguar eyes ',o rt h e ability to see well in the darkness of the forest for more effectivehunting. This is supported by the plant s effect of dilating the pu- pils, which could enhance night vision and looking for prey in the dark forest. Among the Tukano, the hallucinogenic properties were used as a means of facilitating contact with the spirit worldand inducing a shaman s healing powers. Ayahuasca is now used recreationally around the world for its mind-altering properties[14, 56, 57]. It is also used as a purgative, effectively removingparasites and toxins from the digestive tract [14]. Use of the plantby jaguars may also potentially induce antiparasitic action. The alkaloids (e.g., beta-carboline 57]. Jaguars ingestion of ayahuasca can tentatively be classified as Mode 3 self-medication, for many of the same reasons givenabove, or possibly Mode 4 if evidence were available to showjaguars using the plant were doing so directly for its anthelminticproperties. However, more detailed information is needed to fur- ther understand the context of jaguars and other animals con- suming plants with hallucinogenic properties by; for example, dothey hunt afterwards, or do they ingest plants when parasite lev-els are high, and does it subsequently lower these levels? Theplant s properties could promote alertness or simply be a byprod- uct of Jaguars hedonic attraction to the plant, with the functional value being its antiparasitic properties. These pharmacologicalproperties lend support to the functional aspects of the plant for jaguars, but more work needs to be done to understand the pos- sible adaptive value of hallucinogen ingestion in animals. Catha edulis (Vahl) Endl. (Celastraceae): According to folklore, a Yemenite herder called Awzulkernayien saw goats in his flock become much more active and move abouttirelessly after chewing on the leaves of C. edulis . Curious about this, Awzulkernayien chewed on the leaves himself and felt re- newed energy, even after a long day s work following the herd[14]. These effects have since been demonstrated in human and animal trials [58]. This plant is a banned substance in Europe and North America but is still used widely in East Africa and across the Middle Eastunder the names khat, chat, Absyssinian tea, qat, qaad, Arabiantea and others, as a mild stimulant producing euphoria [59]. Khatis used to fight off fatigue, improve work performance, and stayawake, and is also thought to improve mental performance. Yemeni khat chewers believe that it is also useful for other ail- ments like headaches, colds, body pains, fevers, arthritis, and de-pression [58]. The plant alkaloids, terpenoids, cathedulins) are most re-sponsible for the narcotic properties of the plant, which resemblethose of cocaine, causing grandiose delusions, paranoia, night- mares, hallucinations, and hyperactivity [14,58,60]. This plant can also tentatively be classified as Mode 3. The plant s pharmacological properties lend support to the folklore. Health maintenance properties for animals could possibly includesome of the ailments noted above by khat chewers, but more de-tailed observations are needed to understand the context of con-sumption by goats, to know whether is it accidental, seasonal orcontext-specific. Coffea arabica L. (Rubiaceae): domestic goat According to folklore, somewhere in present day Ethiopia a young goat herder named Kaldi saw old and young members of his flockfriskily moving about after eating the red berries from a wild cof-fee bush. Hearing this, an abbot in the local monastery obtainedsome of the beans, roasted and brewed them as a hot drink. Henamed this 'Kahveh '(stimulating, invigorating), from which the words 'caf\u00e9 'and 'coffee 'are derived [14,61,62]. Apparently, the members of the monastery found it helpful in preventing drowsi-ness during nightlong religious ceremonies. The center of genetic diversity of C. arabica is in the highlands of southwestern Ethiopia, the Boma Plateau of Sudan and MountMarsabit in Kenya, but today coffee is consumed worldwide as acaffeinated drink to fight off fatigue and to promote mentalclarity. An Arabian physician, Razes, first mentions coffee in the 10th century, but it has been used most likely for the last 1500 years in southwestern Ethiopia. Elsewhere in Africa, coffee berriescrushed and mixed with fat were served as a food to stimulatewarriors in battle. Around 1000 AD in Yemen, coffee drinking be-came a widespread social ritual among Muslims. From the MiddleEast it spread to Europe and North, Central and South America[63, 64]. Caffeine and the related methylxanthines theobromine and theophylline are alkaloids widely distributed in plants throughout the world. Its value to wild animals as a stimulant to combat fa-tigue could be adaptive. Gorillas in the wild show preference forthe seeds (nuts) of Cola pachycarpa K. Schum. and C. nitida (Vent.) Schott & Endl. These seeds usually contain caffeine (2 -2.5%) and theobromine. The amino acid content of Kola 'nuts 'indicates that protein levels are low, suggesting that gorillas may be eating thefruits and seeds not for nutrition, but primarily for their high caf- feine content [65, All rights reserved.Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. The example of goats eating coffee berries fits Mode 3, based on the behavioral information in the folklore linking the physiolog-ical properties of berries to the behavior of the individuals ingest-ing it. Here too, the health maintenance effect could be derivedfrom the short-term (Berberidaceae): domestic goat, Tibetan macaque According to Chinese folklore, the properties of this plant were first recognized when herders saw their male goats becoming sex-ually excited after ingesting the leaves [14]. Tibetan macaques inChina have also been reported ingesting this plant, at a time ofyear when mating activity is high but conceptive reproduction isat a seasonal all-time low [67]. This macaque species is knownfor its diversity of conflict-reduction behavior involving sexual be- haviors, suggestive of high levels of social stress, which could pos- sibly be regulated by the consumption of this plant. Known by the common name Yin Yang Huo ( ) or horny- goats weed, this species is used in TCM as the most potent herbfor enhancing male and female reproductive health. It is pre-scribed as a treatment for erectile dysfunction, to increase post-menopausal estrogen levels, and to treat osteoporosis [68, 69]. The plant contains the well-researched compounds, Icariside II (Baohuoside I) and Baohuoside II, III, V, VI [70]. These compounds demonstrate effects that are osteoprotective, neuroprotective,cardiovascular protective, anticancer, anti-inflammatory and im-munoprotective, enhance reproductive function, and promotesexual health for both males and females [68, 71]. Significantstress reduction and antidepressant properties via downregula-tion of glucocorticoid receptor activity and regulation of hippo-campal neuro-inflammation have also been demonstrated [72 - 74]. The leaves of this species are also noted for their immunosup- pressive action and inhibitory properties of lymphocyte activation[75]. There is ample pharmacological evidence to support both ani- mal and traditional human uses of this plant for its reproductiveproperties and potential stress reduction. Given the preliminaryinformation gathered from the Tibetan macaques, which sup-ports the folklore, I would tentatively classify this as a Mode 3 or 4 self-medicative behavior, depending on the situation-specific therapeutic potential for animals in the wild. Erythroxylum coca Lam. and related spp. (Erythroxylaceae): llama, three-toed sloth, Hoffmann st w o - t o e ds l o t h According to Peruvian folklore, the origin of coca use is credited to the observation of llamas ingesting the leaves of this plant when moved to lower elevations in the Andes, eating the abundantly available leaves for lack of their typical high-altitude foods. Theherders observed that these leaves gave their llamas extendedstamina, and tried them themselves, obtaining similar effects.Other folk tales attribute human use of coca to watching slothsand monkeys consume the leaves [14]. This suggests ingestionby a number of different animal species and thus possibly multiplediscovery of events by people and animals in different areas across the plant s distribution.The leaves of coca are commonly chewed in Andean life as a stimulant and have been suggested to be in use for at least thelast 1000 to 3000 years, but possibly even as early as 5000 BCE, when llamas were first domesticated. The Aymara people, an in-digenous population of the Andes and Altiplano regions of SouthAmerica, use them as a treatment for altitude sickness, to reducehunger pains and fatigue, as a fast-acting antidepressant, and toincrease sexual vigor, among other things [14, 76, 77]. Coca leaf has been described as a comprehensive remedy for restoring bal- ance to the digestive system. The masticated leaves are held inthe mouth to relieve and help heal painful oral sores and lesions,and also used for toothaches [76]. The leaves of the plant contain eighteen alkaloids. Best known is the psychoactive constituent, cocaine [76, 78]. Given the preliminary information available from the folklore, coca-leaf consumption could be classified as Mode 3, possibly 4, with the possibility that ingestion of the plant could provide either stimulation or specific therapeutic relief from symptoms experi-enced by the animal. Further observations of the context and out-come of plant ingestion would be necessary to better explain thefunction of this behavior for animals consuming these leaves. Ligusticum porteri J. M. Coult. & Rose (Apiaceae): black bear, brown bear, Kodiak bear According to indigenous North American folklore, the bear intro- duced this medicine, called 'Osha, 'to them. One account is that bears consume the roots of the plant after emerging from winterhibernation in a weakened state, to restore strength or whenwounded or sick [79]. Behavioral observations in captivity haveshown that when presented with the root, bears will chew it, andthen, mixed with saliva, rub it into their fur [14]. The roots arechewed by several indigenous tribes in the western United States to increase endurance and to ease breathing at high altitudes, for long-distance walking, and related pain. In current phytothera-pies, it is also used as an antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, andanti-inflammatory agent. It is also used as an antiseptic for abra-sions, open wounds, superficial infections, as a stomach bitter forindigestion, to support healing of respiratory conditions (coughs,colds, sore throats, tonsillitis, flu), and other types of viral infec-tions, including herpes and HIV [80 -84]. The roots butylidenephathalide are most com-monly attributed to the plant s therapeutic effect [85]. Due to a lack of field studies on this behavior in bears, we have only the captive studies to depend upon for direct ethological in-formation. Given the apparent lack of nutritional value in the waythe roots are utilized, and the secondary compounds they are known to contain, use of the roots can tentatively be classified as a Mode 4 form of therapeutic self-medication. Ophiocordyceps sinensis [Berk.] Sung GH et al. (formerly known as Cordyceps sinensis ) (Ophiocordycipitaceae): yak According to Chinese folklore, yak herders discovered the use of this fungus for enhanced vigor after observing the effects on yaks eating them at the beginning of their breeding season [14]. 191Huffman MA. Folklore, Animal | \u00a9 2021. Thieme. All rights reserved. This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. The fungus is widely used in Ayurvedic medicine and TCM for enhancing vigor and vitality. The name of the medicine meanswinter worm -summer grass ( ), denoting that the med- is a fungus that infects caterpillars of moths(Hepialidae ). In winter, the fungi infect the caterpillars, and the growth protrudes from the head of the paralyzed or dead caterpil-lar in early summer. Humans collect these infected caterpillars,dry and crush them into powder. After long-term treatment, chronic immune and respiratory ailments are said to be relieved. Traditional healers in the Himalayas of China, Nepal. and Bhutanuse this to increase longevity, to treat infertility and erectile dys-function, and as a female aphrodisiac. It is also used to treatgeneral weakness, tuberculosis, bronchitis, malignant tumors,coughs and colds, rheumatism, arthritis, jaundice, prostate en-largement, liver diseases, kidney diseases, coronary heart disease,chronic pain, sciatica and backache, high blood pressure, dizzi- ness, and diabetes-related high blood sugar levels [86]. The prod- uct is so widely used that I was able to purchase it in processedpowder formulations at 7-Eleven stores in downtown Taipei as atreatment for the common cold. The fungus contains cordycepin, cordycepic acid, glutamic ac- fatty ac-ids, their derivatives, and other organic acids and vitamins. Some demonstrated properties include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, anti-apoptotic and imm unomodulatory actions [86, 87]. From the available information, it is difficult to discern the function of self-medication this behavior represents in yak, butfor humans the majority of uses suggest a Mode 4 self-medicativetherapeutic treatment for an animal that ingests the fungus. Moreinformation is needed to draw any conclusions of the self-medica- tive value to yak, but it can at least tentatively be classified as a Mode 3 self-medicative behavior for now. WaTongwe, this is a medicinal plant used by them to treat for stomach problems. The origin ofthe name of this plant comes from the Tongwe verb 'kunyonga ' (literally to kill, but here meaning to pull out of the ground, or twist off) and the Swahili 'tembo '(elephant). Elephants twist and pull out small saplings or pull off the leaves of big trees with theirtrunks before processing them. One day Babu Kalunde, the grand-father of Mohamedi, observed an elephant suffering from stom-ach upset. The elephant put a few bunches of the plant s leaves into its mouth, chewing them up a bit without swallowing them.The elephant then took in some water with its trunk and trans- ferred both the leaves and water into its pharyngeal pouch (an or- gan used for storing a few liters of water located in the neck area).After holding the leaves and water together for some time, it dis-carded the leaves and swallowed the water. From that point on,Babu Kalunde and other Tongwe herbalists began to use the waterextract of Munyonga nTembo, or its thoroughly crushed leaves asa suppository for stomach upset [17]. Across Africa the plant is used to treat malaria, dysentery, in- testinal upsets, diarrhea, flatulence, fever, respiratory infections,snakebite, hookworm, and skin eases, among others [8, 88 - 90]. Broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against pyogene, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi and reported from leaf, bark and root [91]. Sesquiter-penes and monoterpene hydrocarbons, class terpenoids isolatedfrom the leaves [90]. This behavior is suggestive of Mode 4 form of therapeutic self- medicative behavior based on the specific symptoms at the timeof use. Not much more can be said without more elephant behav-ioral data or pharmacological studies of the plant, but free-rang-ing Asian elephants under the care of Mahouts in Thailand are alsoknown to select herbs from the forest specifically for stomach up-set, and the Mahouts will collect and use those plants for treat-ment of the elephants and themselves [92]. Shilajit: Nepal langur It is said that long ago Himalayan villagers observed langurs in themountains during warm summer months chewing on the semi-soft resinous substance known as Shilajit oozing out from be-tween layers of rock on cliffs. Wild Nepal langurs across the Hima-layas can be observed licking the resin from rock faces in theirhigh-altitude habitats. The villagers attributed the monkey sg r e a t strength, longevity, and wisdom to the use of this substance. Peo- ple began to consume the substance themselves, experiencing abroad spectrum of health benefits, including increased energy, re-lief from digestive problems, increased libido, enhanced memoryand cognitive function, improvement of diabetes, reduction ofallergies, and increased longevity [93]. Shilajit is used as a traditional medicine for a number of its im- portant pharmacological activities [94]. It is a complex mixture of organic humic substances, plant and microbial metabolites occur- ring in the rock rhizosphere of Stephenrencella-Anthoceros are also included. Shilajit is a widely used treatment in Ayurvedic medicine, dating back to at least 1000 BCE for phthisis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, digestive troubles, bladder calculi, edema, nervous dis-eases, leprosy, diabetes, bone fractures, parasitic diseases of theskin, as an antiphlogistic and as a memory enhancer [93, 95,96].It is also found and used in Russia, Tibet, Afghanistan and in thenorth of Chile. The Sherpa, high-altitude porters and mountainguides of Nepal, include shilajit in their diet [97]. Many of the Aryuvedic uses have been validated in the labora- tory. These activities include immunomodulation, improvementof cognitive function, anxiolytic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and analgesic effects, and the reduction of chronic fatigue[95, 97]. There is no specific illness mentioned in the folklore that lan- gurs may be targeting when ingesting the substance. Based onpreliminary observations of langurs living at high altitude in the Himalayas, I would tentatively classify this as a Mode 3 self-medi- 192Huffman MA.

(Apocynaceae): boar spp., porcupine, western lowland gorilla According to locals and European hunters in Gabon and the Con- go, gorillas, porcupines, and boars dig up the roots of this plant,chew on them and subsequently go into a wild frenzy, jumping around and fleeing as if being chased by something [66,98]. The hunter-gatherers are said to have passed this information on to the farming communities in the past. This plant is still anessential component of religious rites, particularly 'Bwiti '.T h e Metsogho-Massango and Bapinzi peoples of southern Gabonpractice Bwiti in its original form [99]. Local inhabitants of the PetiLoango region of coastal Gabon use T. iboga for a similar ritual called 'Bouiti 'in their secret society rituals [66]. People cultivate the plant in their gardens for use as an energizer, stimulant and hallucinogen [14]. The key active ingredients are ibogaine, tabernanthine, and iboluteine. These affect the central nervous system and cardiovas-cular system, and increase stamina. They contain psychoactiveproperties and act as an interrupter for drug addiction withoutwithdrawal symptoms [14, 66]. Experimentally injected into dogs,ibogaine induces fear behavior (as if they were seeing frightening things), sudden barking out loud for no apparent reason, leaping backwards or desperately trying to hide in a corner. Experimenta-tion with frogs and guinea pigs produced effects similar to thosefrom a large dose of caffeine [100,101]. Use of the roots by animals does not appear to be nutritional, based on the intense responses shown and demonstrated bioac-tivity of the substances they contain. At the moment, the medici-nal value cannot be clearly determined, but could tentatively be classified as a Mode 3 behavior with unknown function(s). This type of ingestive behavior, like other examples reported aboveand elsewhere, remains an enigma in need of further investiga-tion. Its potential adaptive value may provide insights for possibleuses for humans and livestock. Terminalia kaiseriana F. Hoffm. (Combretaceae): bush pig Similar to the story of mulengelele, the origin of this plant su s eb y the WaTongwe of western Tanzania, was discovered by a hunter who observed a wild boar suffering from diarrhea digging up andingesting the roots of the plant. The boar was followed, and sub-sequently, over a few days, was observed to recover [17]. WaTongwe traditional healers now use this plant for the treat- ment of cholera or extreme diarrhea. The intensely bitter rootsand bark are crushed and put into water, to be drunk or used as an enema [17]. Elsewhere in East Africa, the roots, stem bark, and leaves are made into a hot water tea, or mixed with maizeporridge for the treatment of various infectious diseases and theirsymptoms, e.g., diarrhea and cough [102]. They are also usedelsewhere in Tanzania to treat for malaria, skin disease [ 103], schistosomiasis, and gonorrhea [88, 104]. The crude methanol extract of the roots shows promising anti- microbial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, with MIC values of 625 \u00b5g/ml. An ellagitannin-enriched Lobar RP-8 CC fraction of theroots effectively inhibits the growth of the pathogenic S. aureus with a MIC value of 250 \u00b5g/ml [105]. The ingestion of T. kaiseriana by bushpigs can be tentatively classified as Mode 4 of therapeutic self-medicative behavior, giventhe plant s pharmacological properties and the curative context- specific use by the wild boar. Trema orientalis (L.) Blume :c h i m p a n z e e In the course of my research at Mahale, Mohamedi and I have closely followed numerous chimpanzees over the course of theirillness to full recovery or death. In 2003, I was able to witness first- hand the acquisition of a new medicine by Mohamedi as a conse-quence of our observations of the use of a plant by one such chim-panzee suffering from a strongyle nematode infection. The plant,locally known as mhefu, is a common pioneer tree species foundin recently cleared forests or on the edge of fields. It is one of the plants whose rough leaves are swallowed whole by chimpanzees for the physical expulsion of strongyle nematodes by chimpan-zees at Mahale [106,107]. Chimpanzees swallow the rough leavesof this plant and eight other rough-surfaced species available intheir habitat on an empty stomach without chewing them. Thisstimulates the GI tract to fast-track evacuation of the contents ofthe large intestine, resulting in the physical purging of the noduleworm, O. stephanostomum , along with the intact leaves of this plant [107]. This was the first time we witnessed chimpanzees swallowing the rough leaves of T. orientalis , and Mohamedi was curious about the plant. Prior to then, the WaTongwe in this area did not recog-nize it as medicine. After tearing a leaf and sniffing, he took apocket full of them home and prepared a water extract from thecrushed leaves to see how they would work to stop diarrhea. Hefound the extract to be quite effective. At first his mother, Joha Kasante, also a traditional healer, was skeptical that it would be of any medicinal value, not because an animal used it as medicine,but because she knew the tree only as a good source of firewoodand building material. Convinced by its effectiveness, the elderlymother and son began to use it in their medicinal practices. Interestingly, a water decoction of the leaves is used elsewhere as an anthelminthic treatment for roundworms and hookwormsin West Africa, East Africa, and some parts of Central Africa and Madagascar. The plant contains tannins, saponins, flavonoids, tri- terpenes and analgesic,anti-inflammatory, plasmodicidal, anthelmintic, and antibacterialactivity, and also has a laxative effect [108]. In chimpanzees, the swallowing of whole leaves of T. orientalis without chewing them is classified as a Mode 4 therapeutic self-medicative behavior for the expulsion of nematodes [107]. Thisbehavior is widely observed across Africa for the same purpose by the other great ape species (gorillas and bonobos), using over 40 different species of plants [21,31]. It was not the goal of this paper to recommend new treat- ments for animals or to demonstrate that these examples are con-clusive cases of self-medication. Nonetheless, in my estimation, allof the case studies presented were consistent with the behavior ofthese species and are worthy of future research as possible candi-dates of self-medication. Based on the available information, each of the 14 cases could be classified into either Mode 3: stimulant, 193Huffman MA. Folklore, Animal Self-Medication, | \u00a9 2021. Thieme. All rights reserved. This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. tonic foods (N = 7), Mode 4: therapeutic treatment (N = 5) or pos- sibly both modes (N = 2) of self-medicative behavior ( Table 1 ). The variety of case studies presented here from folklore and modern day examples of the acquisition of medicinal plants byhumans observing wild and domestic animals, reportedly to self-medicate, speak to a wider pattern around the world. This pro-vides a new perspective into the role animals have played in theformulation of our medicinal heritage, based on the understand- ing that animals, too, self-medicate to stay healthy. It is impossi- ble to say what proportion of our medicinal heritage we owe tothe observation of animal self-medication, but there should beno doubt that it has played a role in the past and continues to playa role even today in some societies. In our species early history, when faced with the urgent need to treat a sickness for which there was no known cure, choosing apossibly poisonous plant such as mulengelele ( A. cristata ) would have been made easier if a sick animal with similar symptoms was seen to ingest it and recover. This would have been less riskythan randomly selecting unfamiliar plants in the habitat. Oncelearned, humans, like many other animals, learn from experienceand pass this information down from one generation to the nextin an environment-specific context [109]. The contemporary casestudy of T. orientalis use by chimpanzees leading to the traditional healer s use of it, and the widespread similar use of this plant across other parts of Africa, nicely illustrates the fact that medici- nal plants can have multiple independent and other animal-de-pendent origins. These few case studies suggest that some plants might have been ingested for health maintenance as stimulants or tonics tofight off hunger, fatigue, improve reproductive potential andlower stress, or as therapeutic agents for internal and externalparasite infections and wounds. The goal of this article was not to recommend specific treatments as veterinary phytotherapies. Instead, it was my wish to demonstrate the usefulness of animalself-medication studies in understanding the animal origins ofour species medicinal behavior and at the same time, to generate potential interest in new avenues for innovating and improvingupon phytotherapies for the basic well-being of humans and live-stock from this method. As we look to the future, we can be reminded of these exam- ples, showing us that the activities of even well known medicinal plants can reveal new uses for them. For example, L. porteri ,t h e bear medicine, is known to possess significant antiviral, antibacte-rial. and antifungal properties. The active ingredients of this plantare sold today as alcohol tinctures in natural health food stores asa source of lactone glycoside and saponins for the treatment ofrespiratory illness and sore throats. This has particular relevanceto our situation under the COVID-19 pandemic. During the last global pandemic of 1918 (Spanish Flu), a species closely related toL. porter, Lomatium dissectum (Nutt.) Mathias & Constance, was traditionally used by the Washoe, a Northern Paiute tribe in Arizo-na, to treat viral respiratory illness. This caught the attention ofWestern medical doctors in the region in 1918 because the Wash-oe used this plant to successfully treat H1N1 virus. Reportedly, noone treated with it died of the flu. L. dissectum is phytochemically and therapeutically similar to containing the bioac- tive lomatiums, reputedly some of the most potent antiviral com-pounds active against influenza known in herbal medicine today [12]. The examples presented in this paper convey the importance some traditional societies have put on animal behavior as a sourceof medicinal wisdom, and provide clues as to how scientists cannow advance this line of approach for use in modern phytothera-peutic treatments. Observation of wild animals can be argued torepresent millions of years of in situ experimentation. The scien- tific approach of zoopharmacognosy could help to alleviate some of the ethical questions of laboratory animal drug tests, and im-portantly, aid in the fight of drug resistance using phytotherapies.In recent years, the practice of Applied Animal Self-Medication hascome of age. Practitioners and teachers like Caroline Ingraham inthe U.K. [110, 111] have made significant strides in using theparadigm of an animal s ability to self-medicate, by presenting ill individuals with choices, allowing them to self-select and self-dose from an array of essential oils, herbal and mineral options known to treat the appropriate illness. This has met with success in thetreatment of a wide range of ailments in both wild and domesticanimals. I have spent much of the last three decades studying wild ani- mals around the world trying to better understand what makesthem sick, what they do when they are sick, and what do theyuse to regain health. In the process, I have come to appreciate the wisdom of traditional cultures living much closer to the 'natu- ral'world than most of us do today. By combining millions of years of natural selection in the animal kingdom with the accumulatedknowledge of modern and traditional human health care systems,we have much to benefit from the important relationships be-tween humans, animals and plants. Through scientific evaluationand validation of information long considered folklore, new appli-cations from old therapies, and even new ones, can be found. I would like to suggest that this marriage of the old and the new, borrowing and integrating the skills of many fields, is a holis-tic paradigm with promise. As long as people are curious aboutnature and believe it has something to teach us, we have a chanceat saving it along with ourselves. Material and Methods Fourteen case studies were extracted from Engel sWild Medicine (2002) and my own research (Huffman 2007), of ethnomedicinespurportedly acquired from the observations of their use by ani-mals. The main criteria for the selection of examples from thefolklore were geographical, cultural, and animal taxonomic diver-sity, as well as a putative mode of self-medication. The casestudies are listed in alphabetical order by plant species or com-mon name, when species name was not available. From these 14 case studies, over 20 animal species and numerous human cul- tures from around the world are represented ( Table 1 ). Plant species names and authorities were verified using Plants of theWorld Online, facilitated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew(www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/). Pharmacological and thera-peutic value of the plants was further investigated using GoogleScholar to find relevant publications. A variety of medicinal plantdatabases was also used (see reference list). 194Huffman MA.
