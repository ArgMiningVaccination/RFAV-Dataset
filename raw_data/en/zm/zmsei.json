[Why Trust Us?](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/about/a24170223/about-womens-health/) 9 Best Magnesium Supplements For Sleep And Relaxation, According To Experts \"Magnesium has become the MVP of minerals in recent years, and for good reason.\" The [supplement](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a41019044/millennials-guide-to-supplements/) space as a category can feel pretty overwhelming. Whether it's the targeted TikTok ads or endless aisles at CVS, figuring out what pills and potions are necessary, or potentially helpful or harmful, is daunting. One supplement that's stayed in the spotlight for its purported health benefits and wellness properties: magnesium. \"Magnesium has become the MVP of minerals in recent years, and for good reason,\" says [Lisa Moskovitz, RD](https://virtualnutritionexperts.com/about/), the CEO of [Virtual Nutrition Experts](https://virtualnutritionexperts.com) and author of The Core 3 Healthy Eating Plan. \"It's a macro mineral (meaning our body needs it in larger quantities) and electrolyte that our body relies on for various reasons including nerve and muscle function, bone health, proper heart rhythm, blood pressure and blood sugar regulation, as well as energy production.\" The 9 Best Magnesium Supplements Plus, magnesium is a key nutrient that may help reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporosis, says [Alona Pulde, MD](https://weheal.health/physicians-and-coaches/), a board-certified family medicine physician and chief executive officer and co-founder at [WeHeal](https://weheal.health). Another bonus? Magnesium has been shown to support mood and [brain function](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a43623464/higher-magnesium-dose-lowers-dementia-risk-study/) and low levels of the mineral have been linked to anxiety and depression, she adds. Okay, but how much magnesium do you actually need? Most female adults need 310 to 320 mg a day, while men need 400 to 420 mg per day, says Dr. Pulde. Luckily, most people can get the recommended intake by eating magnesium-rich foods like legumes, nuts, seeds, quinoa, oatmeal, spinach, kale, and avocado, she says. However, it is possible to have a magnesium deficiency, says Dr. Pulde, noting that this can be diagnosed by your doc via a full work-up and blood test to check your levels.

Who needs a magnesium supplement? It's always best to talk with your doctor before taking any and all supplements since they are not regulated by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA). \"I recommend eating a daily diet that includes magnesium-rich foods, and only take a supplement if directed by your physician to correct a deficiency,\" says Dr. Pulde. However, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK500003/#:~:text=Hypomagnesemia%20is%20an%20electrolyte%20disturbance,renal%20losses%2C%20and%20other%20conditions.) has found 2.5 to 15 percent of Americans experience magnesium deficiency with rates even higher in those with diabetes or alcohol use disorder. \"This could likely be because the typical Western diet is not very abundant with magnesium-rich foods,\" says [Jenn Baswick, RD](https://www.instagram.com/the.intuitive.nutritionist/), a registered dietitian and founder of [The Intuitive Nutritionist](http://theintuitivenutritionist.com). So, if you experience a loss of appetite, [nausea](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19912535/reasons-vitamins-cause-nausea/), vomiting, fatigue, weakness, and/or numbness in your limbs, talk with your doctor about a magnesium supplement because you may be deficient, says Dr. Pulde. If a healthcare provider gives the thumbs up, they can guide you on proper dosing depending on your needs. What are the different types of magnesium supplements? Not all magnesium supplements are created equally, and different types target specific conditions, says Moskovitz. \"Magnesium glycinate is beneficial for promoting better sleep, mood stability, and blood sugar regulation, while magnesium citrate and chloride are more effective at [fighting constipation](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19984082/how-to-make-yourself-poop/),\" she explains. It's also important to take into consideration how well a magnesium supplement absorbs in your body, says Dr. Pulde. The most easily absorbed forms and chloride are also typically in a liquid form, which means they are better absorbed than tablets like magnesium oxide and sulfate, she adds. (Side note: there are other forms of magnesium but the above are most relevant, per Dr. Pulde.) How and when should you take a magnesium supplement? The key is to take your magnesium supplements with meals, and at the same time each day, says Dr. Pulde. Whether you take them with breakfast or dinner is up to you. On top of that, it's best to take magnesium supplements at least two hours apart from other medications to avoid digestive upset, says Baswick. In particular, magnesium supplements can negatively interact with certain antibiotics, high blood pressure medications, antacids, and laxatives, by affecting their absorption and efficacy, adds Dr. Pulde. Always talk with your doctor to determine what's best for you. The 9 Best Magnesium Supplements How Our Team Chose The Best Magnesium Supplements Women's Health editors, including writer Andi Breitowich, researched the bestselling, most popular, and top-rated magnesium supplements. Our team consulted Jenn Baswick, RD, Lisa Moskovitz, RD, and Alona Pulde, MD, and then evaluated thousands of customer reviews and ratings to narrow down the best nine items for a wide range of needs and preferences. What are the side effects of magnesium supplements? Side effects are typically minimal, but if taken on an empty stomach, digestive upset, cramping, nausea, and diarrhea are possible, says Baswick. However, choosing the more well-absorbed forms of magnesium supplements may help to prevent symptoms, she adds. How do you know if a magnesium supplement is legit? It's always best to talk with your doctor and let them advise you based on your specific needs, says Dr. Pulde. However, if purchasing over-the-counter supplements, do your homework and buy a reputable brand with ingredient transparency and third-party testing, she adds. To make it easier, Moskovitz recommends looking for a Consumer Lab, USP, or NSF seal on the supplement bottle to indicate third-party testing. Can you take too much magnesium? \"Consuming magnesium-rich foods should never cause any problems, but it is absolutely possible to overdo it with supplement use,\" says Baswick. \"It's always important to consume supplements under the tolerable upper intake limit, which in this case is 350 mg for magnesium (unless directed by a doctor), because if someone were to take an excessive amount of magnesium supplements it could cause diarrhea, nausea, or abdominal pain,\" she explains. In extreme cases, magnesium toxicity can cause more severe symptoms such as muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, or cardiac arrest, she adds. Is Epsom salt a magnesium supplement? Epsom salt (also known as magnesium sulfate) may raise magnesium levels in the body when added to a bath, though it may be a less efficient way to increase your magnesium levels, says Dr. Pulde. In fact, [according to the Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/7-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-epsom-salt/), there are no definitive studies showing that magnesium can be absorbed through your skin in sufficient amounts to address deficiencies. Anecdotally, an [Epsom salt bath may relieve stress](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/7-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-epsom-salt/), muscle pain, or inflammation.
