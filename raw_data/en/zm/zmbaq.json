Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make coverage determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and coverage determinations do not apply to those clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment and have discretion in making individual coverage determinations. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other coverage determinations. Overview This Coverage Policy addresses transplantation donor charges/expenses. Coverage Policy Transplantation donor expenses are covered under the transplantation recipient's benefit plan when ALL of the following criteria are met: The recipient of the transplantation meets ALL of the following criteria: is eligible for coverage under a Cigna health benefit plan has a condition for which the proposed transplantation is considered medically necessary meets the coverage criteria for transplantation Eligible donor meets OPTN/UNOS (Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing) donor evaluation and guideline criteria for the specific transplantation being performed (e.g., living kidney transplant, living liver transplantation). The organ to be donated is appropriate for the proposed transplant. Page 2 of 9 Medical Coverage Policy : 0132 For a bone- marrow, peripheral -blood or umbilical -cord blood stem -cell transplant, there is an identified, appropriate, allogeneic match between the donor and the recipient. The charges are not covered by the donor's benefit plan. The following are considered medically necessary or otherw ise covered when the transplantation recipient is eligible for coverage for transplantation service under a Cigna health benefit plan: deceased (i.e., cadaveric) donor: organ/tissue procurement, including preservation, storage and transportation living do nor: solid organs: testing for related and unrelated donors as approved by Cigna bone marrow, stem cell or umbilical cord blood: related- donor testing and unrelated- donor search fees and procurement if billed through the National Marrow Donor Program or other recognized marrow registry prediagnostic testing expenses hospital and surgi cal expenses for removal of the donor tissue/organ, and all services provided during the inpatient admission transportation of the donated tissue/organ lodging, food and transportation to and from the transplantation site for donors receiving services from a transplantation facility, for the donation procedure, for recipients who have this benefit pursuant to standard contract terms, coverage is limited to 30 days of follow -up care after date of donation for transplant -related complications, if not otherwis e covered by donor's own health benefit plan Transplantation donor expenses for non- human organ transplants are considered experimental, investigational or unproven. General Background According to the U.S. Government Information on Organ Donation and Transplantation: 105,873 is the number of men, women and children on the national transplant waiting list as of March 2022. 40,000 + transplants were performed in 2021 17 people die each day waiting for a transplant every 9 minutes another person is added to the waiting list Solid -organ transplantation is the treatment of last resort for patients with end- stage organ disease. Many types of organs can be successfully transplanted, including the heart, lungs, kidney, small bowel, pancreas and liver. Solid -organ transplantation may be from a living or deceased (i.e., cadaveric) donor. In a solid -organ transplant, a healthy donor organ replaces the recipient's diseased organ. Marrow or blood cell transplantation is a life- savin g treatment for numerous blood diseases, such as leukemia and lymphoma. This type of transplantation replaces the individual's unhealthy blood cells with healthy blood-forming cells from a donor. Three sources of blood- forming cells include marrow, blood- forming cells collected from the blood (called peripheral -blood stem -cell donation [PBSC]) and umbilical cord blood. Transplantation involving the use of the individual's own cells is referred to as an autologous transplant. During this procedure, cells are collected from the patient's blood or, less frequently, marrow, and stored for a transplant. Using transplantation cells from a family member, an unrelated donor, or cord blood is referred to as an allogeneic transplant. Syngeneic transplantation is a transplantation method using cells from an identical twin. Xenotransplantation refers to any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation, or infusion into a human recipient of either (a) live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman animal s ource; or (b) human body fluids, cells, tissues, or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells, tissues, or organs . Interest in xenotransplantation is the result of various factors, including an insufficient number of available human organs for transplantation, advancements in genetics, and other scientific advances. However, several barriers Page 3 of 9 Medical Coverage Policy : 0132 exist to xenotransplantatio n and include severe rejection responses, difficulty controlling immune responses, and infectious disease issues. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) note these Criteria for Xenotransplantation Patient Selection: \"Due to the potentially serious public health risks of possible zoonotic infections, you should limit xenotransplantation to patients with serious or life- threatening diseases for whom adequately safe and effective alternative therapies are not available, except when very high assurance of safety can be demonstrated. You should limit candidates to those patients who have potential for a clinically significant improvement with increased quality of life, following the procedure. You should also consider the patient's ability to comply with public health measures as stated in the protocol, including long -term monitoring \" (FDA, 2016). Xenotransplantation is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, nonetheless, significant concerns have been raised regarding safety, and further study is needed to demonstrate safety and impact on health outcomes. Solid -Organ Transplantation Deceased Donors: The ideal (deceased) organ- donor candidate is an individual who has suffered a fatal injury to the brain (with impending or actual brain death), yet has intact cardiovascular function. Potential donors must meet the following criteria: brain death free of infection no history of carcinoma, with the exception of low -grade skin or brain tumors free of severe systemic disease relatively normal organ fun ction hemodynamically salvageable Once a deceased donor has been identified, an organ procurement organization (OPO) coordinator will begin the process of evaluating the suitability of the donor. A complete medical and social history will be conducted to determine that the donor meets the above criteria. Living Donors: Living -donor organ donation has increased due to the limited availability of deceased donor organs. Living- donor transplants are used in liver, kidney and lung transplantation, and investi gations of living- donor pancreas and intestine donation are being conducted. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a Clinical Practice Guideline on the Evaluation and Care of Living Kidney Donors (Lentine, et al., 2017). OPTN/UNOS h as issued various other guidelines, including but not limited to those for Living Donation (OPTN, 2021). Informed consent must be obtained from living donors. The donor's signature on a document must clearly confirm that the donor: is willing to donate is free from inducement and coercion and has been informed that he or she may decline to donate at any time Living donors must be provided an opportunity to discontinue the donor consent or evaluation process in a way that is protected and confidential. Livi ng donors must be provided an Independent Living Donor Advocate (ILDA) to assist the donor during the consent process, with instruction about all phases of the living donation process, which include: consent medical and psychosocial evaluations pre and post-operative care required post -operative follow up Living donor ILDA requirements apply to living kidney, liver, pancreas, intestine or lung donors. For any living kidney donor who is undergoing evaluation for donation, the living donor recovery hospi tal must designate and provide each potential living donor with an ILDA who is not involved with the potential recipient evaluation and is independent of the decision to transplant the potential recipient. The ILDA may be one person or an independent living donor advocate team with multiple members. An ILDA team must designate one person from the team as the key contact for each living donor. Page 4 of 9 Medical Coverage Policy : 0132 The ILDA must: 1. Function independently from the transplant candidate's team. 2. Advocate for the rights of the liv ing donor. 3. Fulfill the qualification and training requirements specified in the recovery hospital's protocols regarding knowledge of living organ donation, transplantation, medical ethics, informed consent, and the potential impact of family or other ex ternal pressure on the living donor's decision about whether to donate. 4. Review and document whether the living donor has received information on numerous issues (OPTN/UNOS Living Donation Policy 14.2.A; 9 /06/2022). Bone -Marrow, Peripheral -Blood and Um bilical -Cord Blood Stem -Cell Donors Stem cells are a type of cell that can grow into other types of cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. They are generated in the bone marrow and found in the bone -marrow, blood -forming cells collected from the blood (called peripheral -blood stem -cell donation [PBSC]) and umbilical cord blood. Donated stem cells are used to help the recipient produce components of his or her blood compromised by disease or by the treatment of certain diseases, such as cancer. In general, bone- marrow, peripheral -blood and umbilical -cord blood stem -cell donors must meet the following medical criteria (Nat ional Marrow Donor Program, 2018): between the ages of 18 and 60. Ages of 18 and 44 are preferred because younger donors produce more and higher -quality cells than older donors. in good health tissue match to recipient body mass index (BMI) of 40 or less Bone -Marrow Donor: Bone -marrow donation involves a minor surgical procedure, which is performed under local or general anesthetic. Four to eight small incisions are made in the pelvic area, and bone marrow is extracted with a surgical needle. The process takes 45- 90 minutes. The donor may initially have soreness at the donation sites, but a full recovery gene rally occurs within a few days. The donor's system will completely replace the extracted marrow within a few weeks, since marrow continuously regenerates itself. Peripheral -Blood Stem -Cell (PBSC) Donor: PBSC donation requires the donor to receive medicat ion, such as growth factor (e.g., filgrastim), for several days to increase the number of stem cells released from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Donors may experience bone pain, muscle pain, nausea, insomnia and fatigue from the medication. The stem cells are collected by apheresis. In apheresis, blood is drawn through a needle from one arm, run through an apheresis machine that separates out the stem cells, and is returned through a needle in the other arm. Donors may not feel well during the donat ion, but generally make a full recovery immediately following the donation. Umbilical -Cord Blood Stem -Cell Donor: Umbilical -cord blood contains large numbers of stem cells. After a baby's birth, blood is collected from the placenta and umbilical cord. There is no physical effect on the mother or the infant. Disparities in Organ D onation Organ donation is affected by legal, cultural, religious, and racial factors, as well as by health considerations. Gender: Although organs in and of themselves are gender neutral and can be exchanged between the sexes, women account for up to two thirds of all organ donations. More me n than women are recipients, and women are less likely to complete the necessary steps to receive donated organs (Steinman, et al., 2006). Race: Minority groups suffer from disparities in deceased and living donation. Barriers to minority deceased donation include: decreased awareness of transplantation, religious or cultural distrust of the medical community, fear of medical abandonment and fear of racism. African- Americans comprise only 11.8% of living donors. Barriers to minority living donation include: unwillingness to donate, medical comorbid conditions, trust or fear of medical community, loss to follow -up, poor coping mechanisms, financial concerns, reluctance to ask family members and friends, fear of surgery, and lack of awareness Page 5 of 9 Medical Coverage Policy : 0132 about living donor kidney transplantation. Interventions based upon an understanding of these barriers will need implementation culturally sensitive initiatives at a national level (Bratton, et al., 2011). Transplant Tourism Each year the number of patients on a waiting l ist for transplantation exceeds the number of patients receiving transplants. An increase in the wait time for transplantation may result in increased risk for clinical deterioration, reduced quality of life, and, in some cases, deaths of patients on the w aiting list. This has led to an increase in the number of patients seeking organs from other countries for the purpose of transplant. Transplant tourism is the purchase of transplantation organs abroad which includes access to an organ while bypassing laws , rules or processes of any or all c ountries involved. Most countries in the Western world prohibit compensated organ donation. Within the United States, the National Organ Transplant Act of 1972 states, \"It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation.\" Penalties include a fine of up to USD $50,000 and/or imprisonment for up to five years. A policy proposal relating to transplantation of deceased -donor organs into nonresidents of the United States was jointly sponsored by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) International Relations and Ethics Committees and approved by the OPTN/UNO S Board in June 2012 ( Vella, 2019; Glazier, et al., 2014). The American Society of Transplantation (AST) recently updated their guidelines on Travel Medicine, Transplant Tourism, and the Solid Organ T ransplant R ecipient. The guidelines review recommendati ons for prevention and management of travel -related infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients as well as risks associated with transplant tourism (Buchan, et al. , 2019). The American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Foundation Choosing Wisel y \u00ae Initiative (2019 ) No relevant information found. Use Outside of the US National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has a 2011 guideline titled Organ donation for transplantation: improving donor identification and consent rates for deceased organ donation (CG135). It was updated in December 2016. It offers best practice advice on improving donor identification and consent rates.
