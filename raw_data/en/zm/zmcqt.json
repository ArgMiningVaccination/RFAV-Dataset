And we all need insulin to live. It allows the glucose (or sugar) in our blood to enter our cells and fuel our bodies. If you have type 3c diabetes your pancreas will also stop producing the enzyme you need to digest food. You can only get type 3c diabetes because of an illness or condition that affects your pancreas. Conditions related to type 3c Type 3c is linked to many other conditions, all of which affect the pancreas, such as: - pancreatitis - pancreatic cancer - cystic fibrosis [haemochromatosis](/diabetes-the-basics/related-conditions/haemochromatosis-diabetes) You can also develop type 3c if you have your pancreas removed because of any other damage. Your doctor should be aware of your pancreatic issues if they're testing you for diabetes. But make sure you mention it to them so that they know that you're at risk for type 3c. Organisations such Fibrosis Trust](https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/) can offer you support for some of the conditions related to type 3c. Symptoms of type 3c diabetes If you have type 3c then your pancreas may not be able to give you what you need to digest your food. This is pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) and means that your pancreas isn't working properly. The signs to look out for can include: - losing weight without trying to - stomach pain - feeling more tired than usual - frequently passing wind - diarrhoea - fatty or oily stools [hypoglycaemia](/guide-to-diabetes/complications/hypos), also called low blood sugar There are also common [signs and symptoms](/diabetes-the-basics/diabetes-symptoms) of diabetes that you might want to look out for as well. If you notice any of these symptoms, or have any concerns, then you should speak to your doctor. Type 3c diagnosis There is a lack of awareness for type 3c which might mean you get an incorrect diagnosis. You'll see stories on our [forum ](/how_we_help/community/diabetes-support-forum)of people who have had similar experiences. But remember, we know that type 3c is linked to problems with the pancreas. So you can ask your doctor to check for type 3c if you've had pancreatic problems and explain your reasons why. If you have a type 3c diagnosis, you should be seen by a healthcare team that knows what to do.

Managing type 3c diabetes Making sure you're managing your type 3c diabetes in the right way can be a challenge. The current guidelines say you should treat type 3c with [metformin](/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/tablets-and-medication/metformin) or [insulin](/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/insulin). This is why managing type 3c can be a difficult thing to do. There isn't a one-size-fits-all treatment because it really comes down to how much damage your pancreas has. And you may benefit from more regular reviews by your healthcare team. You're likely to start on metformin to help manage your blood sugar levels. Metformin works by helping the insulin you produce to work better. This should then reduce your blood sugar levels. But if this isn't enough to manage your blood sugar and you're losing weight then you'll move on to insulin. Many people with type 3c diabetes require insulin at an earlier stage compared to people with type 2 diabetes to help manage their blood sugar levels. But if metformin is working for you, then you should have a check every six months to see if you need to move on to insulin with your healthcare team. Other treatments It's likely that your healthcare team will also discuss with you any diet and lifestyle change you might need to make. This might include treatment to help with digesting food. What is type 3 diabetes? The term type 3 diabetes has been used unofficially to describe diabetes that affects people with Alzheimer's, and is not the same as type 3c which is caused by damage to the pancreas. We're currently funding a research project that looks into the [link between Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes](/research/our-research-projects/south-east/untangling-link-between-type-2-diabetes-and-alzheimers-disease). This should provide more insight into why people with type 2 diabetes are more likely to "}
