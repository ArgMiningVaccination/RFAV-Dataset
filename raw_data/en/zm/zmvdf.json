Parks Avenue Nashville, TN 37243Butch Eley COMMISSIONERLaurie Lee EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 1 Who we are Benefits Administration, or BA, is a division within the State of Tennessee's Department of Finance and Administration. The authorization for providing group insurance benefits for public officials, state, local education and local government employees and retirees is found in Chapter 27 of Title 8, Tennessee Code Annotated. The benefit plans authorized by this legislation are governed separately by three committees identified as the State, Local Education and Local Government Insurance Committees. Committee members for 2020 are listed at the right. Each committee represents the interests of the employer(s) and their employees and retirees in financially separate benefit plans. The responsibilities of each committee can be summarized under four broad areas: 1. To establish the benefit plans offered. 2. To approve premiums necessary to fund plan operations. 3. To provide for the administration of certain plan functions through the selection of contractors and monitoring of vendor performance. 4. To establish and review eligibility, enrollment, benefits and administrative rules of the program.

State Group Insurance Program participants include state government and higher education employees who make up the state plan, employees of participating local school systems who make up the local education plan and employees of local government agencies and various eligible quasi-governmental agencies who make up the local government plan. In 2020, the SGIP offered all members three health insurance options \u2014 the Premier Preferred Provider Organization, Standard PPO and Consumer-driven Health Plan. A fourth option, a PPO plan called the Limited PPO, was available to participants in the local education and local government plans. Members have the choice of two medical insurance carriers \u2014 BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee or Cigna.The division contracts separately with CVS Caremark for prescription drug coverage and Optum Health for behavioral health and substance use services for all plan options.

These teams deliver value by implementing accountable plan design and conservative fiscal policy to sustain a market-competitive benefit. Specifically, the division has a consistent strategic focus on four key levers: 1. Purchasing\u2014 Obtain best pricing through competitive procurements that leverage the state's purchasing power and vendor core competencies 2. Plan design\u2014 Balance plan target actuarial value and cost with incentives for members to seek appropriate care and manage chronic disease 3. Population health\u2014 Build health management and wellness supports into the plan design to encourage member accountability for health behaviors and improve health outcomes 4. Pay for value\u2014 Increase the accountability of contractors and providers so that we pay for improved quality and competitive cost, not volume The year-over-year aggregate premium increases for the state active, state retiree, local education and local government plans from 2017-2020 have averaged .1% 4.2%, 3.9% and 2.4%, respectively, well below the industry average. The plans' financial performance reflects the success of this strategy. In 2020, the following key initiatives were accomplished. Vendor Services The Vendor Services team manages health plan benefits through the procurement and administration of services and programs and by the research and development of recommended benefit changes to ensure coverage remains current and competitive. COVID-19 was a major focus for Vendor Services in 2020. In addition to amending benefits to comply with federal requirements for 100% coverage of tests and vaccines, BA also implemented 100% coverage of COVID-19 treatment and telehealth visits through carrier-sponsored vendors regardless of diagnosis and removed early refill edits for medications. For The Tennessee Plan, any Part B deductible expenses (up to $198) incurred by members for telehealth visits related to COVID-19 were paid by the plan when the provider chose not to waive member cost-sharing. All these benefits remained intact for the entirety of 2020. Additionally, the health center in the Tennessee Tower in Nashville was established as a COVID-19 testing site for state plan members. BA implemented minimal benefit changes beginning Jan. 1, 2020. Acupuncture was added as a covered service with the same cost-sharing and limits as the existing chiropractic benefit. The intent of this coverage is to offer care alternatives that may help members avoid opioid use, surgery and other costly interventions. Population health incentive amounts for the state plan remained the same ($250 per employee and spouse - $500 annual maximum) and minor changes were made to the menu of incentive options. Additions included an annual physical and well woman exam while prostate screenings were removed as an option. Diabetes, and its impact on members and the plan, is an ongoing concern. Currently, 8.7% of State Group Insurance Program members have diabetes, and it is estimated that many more are pre-diabetic and at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In addition to ongoing disease management programs, the State Insurance Committee approved a no-cost diabetes reversal pilot with Virta. This virtual diabetes reversal program focused on eliminating diabetes-specific medications while getting and keeping patients reversed (below 6.5 A1c threshold). Pilot results were positive and are being used to plan for an expansion of similar benefits to the entire population in the future. Several pharmacy initiatives were implemented in 2020 which are expected to result in more appropriate utilization as well as significant savings for members and the plan. These initiatives include reducing the use of low-value drugs and drugs with hyperinflated costs through the implementation of prior authorization and step therapy. Effective April 1, 2020, the plan began participation in Cigna's new Surgical and Treatment Support Program, or STSP. This program incentivizes members to select high value providers, those that offer high quality and lower cost, via the removal of all member cost share and a maximum $600 travel benefit, per procedure, for members who must travel more than 60 miles to receive care from these select providers and facilities. For the STSP, Cigna contracted with top performing providers and facilities across the state to deliver total joint replacements (hip and knee) and spinal surgeries (laminectomy and lumbar spinal fusion) at a payment rate that is a minimum of 20% lower than the market. The program provides members with concierge services, such as offering a customer companion for personalized 5 support, to help members make their health care decisions. Participation in the Episodes of Care value-based payment initiative continued in 2020. In addition to the nine episodes previously rolled out (perinatal, total joint, percutaneous coronary intervention, cholecystectomy, colonoscopy, EGD, bariatric, coronary artery bypass graft and valve) the performance period for two new episodes, hysterectomy and knee arthroscopy, began. There have been quality improvements for many of the episodes and some savings to the plan overall. Financial Management & Program Integrity This area promotes compliance, transparency and accountability throughout the division. During 2020, the group successfully created a comprehensive audit plan and implemented the Flexible Savings Account debt resolution process. The comprehensive audit plan enhances vendor accountability by identifying areas to be audited, increasing the number of audits and the timeframe these audits will occur. Through a contract with a Flexible Savings Account vendor, Benefits Administration implemented the use of a debit card as a convenience to members to spend their flexible spending account balances. Members must provide appropriate supporting documentation to substantiate these purchases according to Internal Revenue Service rules. Financial Management collects amounts from members who have not provided appropriate documentation to substantiate their debt card purchases. The Financial Management area ensured vendors were paid accurately and timely, monitored the state sponsored plan performance, monitored the Other Postemployment Benefits, or OPEB, trust performance and coordinated the OPEB funding with higher education institutions. The Vendor Accountability area monitored the third party administrators by reviewing the vendors' time to process claims, tested for duplicate claims, performed focused claims testing on denied and pended claims and reviewed the internal provider claims appeal logs. The Member Accountability area performed reviews of ineligible members and assisted the third party administrators in collecting from subrogation cases, totaling more than $646,000 in collections. The Risk Management area continued to evaluate and mitigate divisional risks. Operations In 2020, Operations focused on enhancing the training and materials provided to agency benefits coordinators to educate them on the insurance options available through the state plan. We transitioned from a set monthly schedule of live training for new agency benefits coordinators to training that is available on- demand through the Edison system. This gives agency benefits coordinators the ability to take the training at their own pace at a time that works for them. We created new ABC reference guides with instructions on how to process a transaction or access a certain document on our website. Additionally, we hosted virtual ABC training sessions throughout the month of August to give ABCs important updates and reminders. We held 12 sessions over a period of three weeks and trained an average of 450 ABCs each week. Our Education and Outreach team onboarded 23 new agencies onto our plan during 2020, which involved working with the new agencies one on one to teach them how to process enrollments, run reports and communicate with our service center. Operations continued the process of simplifying the log in process for members changing their benefits for 2021. We implemented single sign-on with the University of Tennessee, which gave the university employees the ability to access the Edison system to enroll in benefits through the UT system. The most recent customer satisfaction survey of our ABCs showed that our customers rated their overall satisfaction with our service center at 98.6%. For the year, our Zendesk customer service satisfaction rate was 96.8%. Communications The Communications Team's mission is to help agencies and members understand their insurance benefits options and make informed choices. At no time has this been more important than 2020. In response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Communications implemented benefits-related messaging across multiple platforms, including emails, our website, webinars, dial- in EAP sessions and informational articles. Second only to pandemic communications are those that were sent during Annual Enrollment. In 2020, BA reached more than 170,000 State Group Insurance Program members via U.S. mail, published information, at tn.gov/PartnersForHealth and sent emails to more than 130,000 members. 6 Correcting bounced or bad email addresses remained a top priority, as it is critical to getting members the information they need to make smarter health care decisions. Communications continued to work with Operations on updating and correcting email addresses for higher education, local education and local government members. While in-person benefits fairs were cancelled due to COVID-19, BA implemented a series of vendor webinars for members so they could hear directly from vendor representatives and ask questions. These augmented the regular annual enrollment member benefits webinars held by BA. Each year we survey our agency benefits coordinators' customer satisfaction, and in 2020, we received 370 responses, for a 62% response rate. Participants rated their overall customer service satisfaction at 98% meets or exceeds expectations. Ninety-seven percent of those who attended one or more sessions of the ABC trainings with the Communications and Operations teams in 2020 found them helpful. In 2020 we compiled several new reports to track the monthly social media analytics for the ParTNers for Health and Working for a Healthier TN Facebook and Twitter accounts. Using this data, we can post our most important information at times we know our audience is most likely to see it. From 2019 to 2020, ParTNers for Health's Facebook followers increased 16%, and Twitter followers increased 9%. Working for a Healthier TN's Facebook followers increased 32%, and Twitter followers grew 23%. In 2020, BA began a new agency outreach effort with a goal of building and managing relationships with local education and government agencies across the state. In its first year, the joint efforts of the Communications and Operations teams brought 16 new local government agencies into the plan and reactivated two agencies. Since COVID-19 prevented team members from traveling, they also placed several hundred calls to advise ABCs of COVID-19 benefits updates, and to determine whether they had other needs with which BA could assist. Finally, Communications made several improvements to the ParTNers for Health website. The homepage redesign moved critical links to second-level pages front and center. Page edits limit the amount of scrolling required, including in some cases breaking longer webpages out into multiple shorter pages. Health options and other benefits webpages now clearly identify who is eligible for what, and three new pages specifically address outreach for local government and education agencies. 2020 Procurements There were no contracts that began service delivery in 2020. While BA awarded pharmacy benefits manager, health savings account/flexible spending account and dental health maintenance organization (prepaid) contracts in 2020, they will not \"go live\" until 2021. 7 Overview of Plan Options Multiple plan options were available in 2020, and members could enroll in any of the plans: 1. Premier Preferred Provider Organization 2. Standard PPO 3. Consumer-driven Health Plan with a health savings account 4. Limited PPO (local education & local government only) Networks Members had a choice of BlueCross BlueShield Network S, Cigna Local Plus or Cigna Open Access Plus in all grand divisions. Employees enrolling in OAP paid an additional monthly premium charge of $40 or $80 (depending on tier) to partially account for the higher costs associated with this broad network. For 2020, 12,267 members enrolled in the OAP network. Coverage by Plan Standard PPO enrollment declined in all three plans. Limited PPO enrollment increased slightly and has surpassed Premier PPO enrollment in the local government plan. Enrollment in the CDHP/HSA increased from 6,469 in January 2017 to 8,084 in December 2020 (25% increase). Employees contributed approximately $9.02M to their health savings accounts, which is an average of $1,116 per account Employers (state, higher education and some local education and local government agencies) contributed approximately $5.02 million to employee HSAs.

The rows of the table are defined as follows: (1) This line shows the total of each fiscal year's earned contribution revenues and investment revenues. (2) This line shows each fiscal year's other operating costs of the fund including overhead and claims expense not allocable to individual claims. (3) This line shows the fund's incurred claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (both paid and accrued) as originally reported at the end of the first year in which the event that triggered coverage under the contract occurred (called policy year); some of these amounts are unavailable. (4) This section shows the cumulative amounts paid Ten-Year Claims Development Informationas of the end of successive years for each policy year; some of these amounts are unavailable. (5) This section shows how each policy year's incurred claims increased or decreased as of the end of successive years; some of these amounts are unavailable. This annual reestimation results from new information received on known claims, reevaluation of existing information on known claims, as well as emergence of new claims not previously known. (6) This line compares the latest reestimated incurred claims amount to the amount originally established (line 3) and shows whether this latest estimate of claims cost is greater or less than originally thought. As data for individual policy years mature, the correlation between original estimates and reestimated amounts is commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of incurred claims currently recognized in less mature fiscal years. The columns of the table show data for successive fiscal and policy years.39 Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Fund Net Position YEAER ENDED YEAR ENDED 30-JUN-20 30-JUN-19 Operating revenues Premiums $ 157,213 $ 149,675 Total operating revenues $ 157,213 $ 149,675 Operating expenses Medical and mental health claims $ 141,430 $ 139,882 Administrative services 1,019 871 Contractual services 7,923 7,396 Total operating expenses $ 150,372 $ 148,149 Operating income (loss) $ 6,841 $ 1,526 Non-operating revenues Interest income $ 826 $ 1,089 Total non-operating revenues $ 826 $ 1,089 Change in net position $ 7,667 $ 2,615 Net position, July 1 47,178 44,563 Net position, June 30 $ 54,845 $ 47,178Statements of Net Position 30-JUN-20 30-JUN-19 Assets Cash $ 63,525 $ 58,771 Accounts receivable, net 2,489 2,150 Total assets $ 60,014 $ 60,921 Liabilities Accounts payable and accruals $ 11,126 $ 13,685 Unearned revenue 43 58 Total liabilities $ 11,169 $ 13,743 Net position Unrestricted $ 54,845 $ 47,178 Total net position $ 54,845 $ 47,178Local Government Plan40 Statements of Cash Flows YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED 30-JUN-20 30-JUN-19 Cash flows from operating activities Receipts from fund members $ 160,588 $ 152,530 Payments to insurance companies and healthcare providers (156,564) (149,000) Payments for state services (96) (107) Net cash from (used for) operating activities $ 3,928 $ 3,423 Cash flows from investing activities Interest received $ 826 $ 1,089 Net cash from investing activities $ 826 $ 1,089 Net increase (decrease) in cash $ 4,754 $ 4,512 Cash, July 1 58,771 54,259 Cash, June 30 $ 63,525 $ 58,771 Reconciliation of operating income to net cash from operating activities Operating income (loss) $ 6,841 $ 1,526 Adjustments to reconcile operating income to net cash from operating activities Changes in assets and liabilities: (Increase) decrease in accounts receivable (339) (1,144) Increase (decrease) in accounts payable (2,559) 3,022 Increase (decrease) in unearned revenue (15) 19 Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities $ 3,928 $ 3,42341 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 (1) Required contribution and investment revenue earned (fiscal Six years * Seven years later 91,669 94,182 * Eight years later 91,669 * Nine years later * (5) Reestimated incurred claims and expenses: End Six years * Seven years later 91,669 94,182 * Eight years later 91,669 * Nine years later * (6) Increase (decrease) in estimated incurred claims and expenses from end of policy year (30) (556) (258) (513) 216 (107) 107 (515) - * * Data not availableSupplementary Information \u2014 Active Employees The table below illustrates how the Local Government Group Insurance Fund's earned revenues and investment income compare to related costs of loss and other expenses assumed by the fund for each of the last ten years.
