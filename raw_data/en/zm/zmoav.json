Kaya Hope Lobo, 10, a student at South Oceanside Elementary School, proudly represents her ancestors, the Juane\u00f1o Indians, who lived in parts of this region before the Spanish explorers came. And Nerice Kaufman, executive director of Hospice of North Coast, just as proudly claims ancestral ties to those Spaniards. Last week, Kaufman presented Kaya with the first-place award for her essay at the third annual Scholars for Tomorrow contest sponsored by Old Mission San Luis Rey Historic Foundation. Students from a dozen Oceanside schools participated in the essay contest, and a half-dozen of the schools also entered models of the missions. Kaya received $30 as the first-place winner from her school and $100 as best in the district. Her essay, bound in leatherlike paper, told the story of her forebears, who lived in the Juane\u00f1o village of Tobe near present-day San Juan Capistrano. She is a member of the Acjachemen Nation of the Juane\u00f1o Band of Mission Indians. Her bound volume included pictures of grandparents, great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents as well as uncles, aunt and cousins \u2014 Juane\u00f1os all. Kaya's grandfather, Wick Lobo, and grandmother Carol Lobo of Laguna Niguel, as well as her parents, Chris and Tina, attended the awards ceremonies. The women are not Indian, but Kaya, her dad and her granddad are tribal members. Kaya also tells the story of her ancestors on a video, just under 15 minutes long, filmed by her father and posted on YouTube. And that's why, Kaya said in a short interview before the awards ceremonies, \"I hope you will understand that this is not just another fourth-grade mission project for me. We are Mission Indians \u2014 and that's a major part of me and my family. Over the years, we've talked about my ancestors a lot.\" Kaufman is an eighth-generation Californian with a strong connection to the missions. \"My great-great-grandfather came with Serra (founder of the California mission chain) aboard a ship\" from Spain, she said. There are 21 California missions in all, stretching from San Diego \u2014 founded in 1769 \u2014 to Sonoma north of San Francisco, but only nine were founded by Father Junipero Serra. The rest, including San Luis Rey in Oceanside, were founded by his successors. Kaufman said her great-great-grandfather's shield hangs in Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo in Carmel, founded by Serra. And she said her great-grandmother, Josefa Espinosa Rico from Carmel, was the Catholic Church's last living witness in its investigation into possible sainthood for Serra. The awards ceremony, held in the Serra Room at Mission San Luis Rey, was co-sponsored by Oceanside, San Luis Rey and El Camino Real Rotary clubs and the school district. Kaufman represented San Luis Rey Rotary. Second place in the essay contest went to Chris Dikiy from Ivey Ranch Elementary and third place to Katherine McMillin of Foussat Elementary. "}
