Born in 1861 to Austrian parents, Steiner was an international figure, scientist, educator and artist. Steiner 's interests inspired movements of renewal in education, medicine, architecture, science, agriculture, religion, arts and human consciousness. Steiner founded the first Waldorf School in 1919 in Stuttgart, Germany , when Emil Molt, a wealthy industrialist and owner of the Waldorf-Astoria Cigarette Factory , asked him to help create a school for the families of his workers. The Waldorf School of Bend (WSB) is one of over 1000 independent Waldorf schools and 2000 Waldorf Kinder gartens in 60 countries throughout the world. The community of the Waldorf School of Bend joins a global community of children, parents, teachers and friends who have made a commitment to work toward social renewal through Waldorf education. Basic Principles & Elements of Waldorf Education Through the curriculum and atmosphere at the Waldorf School of Bend, we meet children at each developmental stage, helping them to grow into free individuals. Waldorf Education is non-denominational and is not associated with any one particular religion; however , children are recognized as having physical, emotional and spiritual needs as well as intellectual capacities. Artistic, cognitive and practical lessons are combined to nurture the strengths, potential and uniqueness of each child. At the heart of the Waldorf method is the conviction that education is an art . Whether the subject is arithmetic or history or physics, the presentation must live. It must speak to the child' s experience. To educate the whole child, subjects are brought to life through work with head, heart and hands. Affiliations WSB is an Associate school member of the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA) and the Waldorf Early Childhood Association of North America (WECAN). AWSNA & WECAN aid member schools to assure quality throughout the Waldorf community . E DUCATIONAL P HILOSOPHY Early Childhood Programs (Parent & Toddler, Nursery, Pre-Kindergarten, and Kindergarten) An important aspect of Waldorf education is the emphasis on the relationships among teachers, children, and parents through the years. The task of the Early Childhood teacher is to help the child develop physically in a healthy way. This provides the proper foundation for the development of the child' s social, academic and spiritual life. Teachers create an environment in which the young child feels secure, loved and recognized. The child' s security arises out of being surrounded by beauty and by August 2021 Page 1 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D experiencing the certainty of a rhythmic life. Daily , weekly , and seasonal rhythms help to instill a healthy habit of life. Student-T eacher Ratio The Early Childhood student-teacher ratio is at least one teacher for every ten children. Grades Programs (1st Grade through 8th Grade) In the Grades, we believe the growth of trust and understanding is nurtured by the stability of staying with the same teacher and classmates. The class teacher , whenever possible, continues with the class for the first six grades, until they enter the junior high program in 7 th grade. The children also regularly work with other Subject teachers, such as in foreign languages, handwork, games/movement, music, etc. The Waldorf Grades curriculum is designed to complement and support the unique development of each child, as it naturally unfolds. The curriculum is dynamic and works to balance social, physical and intellectual development. As the teacher journeys through the grades with his/her students, he/she experiences the changing forces of the children over the years. The grades teacher inwardly adjusts accordingly in order to continually meet and understand the needs of his/her students. In addition to academic learning and skill development, there is respect and reverence for the natural world, a foundation of a model for healthy living, and a desire to serve humanity . The Waldorf curriculum is designed to promote a lifelong love of learning. Arts in Education The arts - drama, painting, music, drawing, form drawing, crafts, and handwork - are integrated into the entire curriculum, including math and science. Educating through the arts brings vitality and wholeness to learning, balancing intellectual development. The integration with academics and the arts is reflected in the main lesson subject books created by the students. Subject Programs For the 2021/2022 school year, special subject classes are Handwork and Woodwork (Grades 5-8), Spanish, Games and Movement, Eurythmy , and Gardening. Practical Arts in the Waldorf Curriculum enhances the main lesson and teaches valuable living skills. Over the years, students may learn knitting, cross stitching, felting, crochet, hand and machine sewing, weaving, gardening, cooking, woodworking, metal smithing, leather smithing, book binding, ceramics, and numerous other practical arts. In addition, WSB includes blocks of theatre arts, performance, music, eurythmy etc. annually throughout our Grades programs. \"The brain discovers what the fingers explor e. The density of nerve endings in our fingertips is enormous. Their discrimination is almost as good as that of our eyes. If we don't use our fingers, in childhood and in youth we become \"finger -blind,\" this rich August 2021 Page 2 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D network of nerves is impoverished - which r epresents a huge loss to the brain and thwarts the individual' s all-ar ound development. Such damage may be likened to blindness in itself. Per haps worse, while a blind person may simply not be able to find this or that object, the finger -blind cannot understand its inner meaning and value.\" ~Matti Ber gestr oem, Pr ofessor and Neur ophysiologist Foreign Languages Foreign languages play an essential role in the curriculum of a Waldorf School. It was Rudolf Steiner 's plan to have children exposed to two contrasting foreign languages (for example, a \"heart\" language and a \"head\" language) beginning in Early Childhood and continuing through eighth grade. The voice of a culture speaks to the peoples' expression of life. In this way a child begins to experience many ways of meeting the world. Flexible thinking is inspired. Typically , WSB offers Spanish class, and may offer additional foreign languages when possible. Music Singing and playing an instrument requires a level of listening that engages the child' s whole being. Waldorf teachers gear musical instruction toward the child' s developmental level and strive to integrate it within the curriculum in a way that strengthens learning as a whole. Music conveys an inner logic, wisdom and beauty that strengthens the sense of self within the context of the whole and creates a sense of harmony and social awareness. Singing begins in Early Childhood and continues as part of the daily rhythm throughout the grades. The pentatonic flute is used in 1 st and 2 nd grades. Generally , the diatonic flute begins at the end of 3 rd grade and continues through 5 th grade. The children are introduced to the alto recorder in 6 th grade and the tenor recorder in 7 th grade. After school programs such as piano, vocals and strings may be offered to further meet the needs of our children and community . Festivals and Rhythms of the School Year In a Waldorf School, annual celebrations and observances of the seasonal and cultural festivals help to develop the children' s relationship to their larger community and cultural environment. The festivals include songs, stories, verses, games and activities known in a variety of cultures. While each class studies many cultural festivals or celebrations, each local Waldorf school selects specific festivals to reflect the nature of their unique community . These yearly rhythms are repeated just as we keep to daily classroom routines and rituals, thus creating a safe, secure environment where learning and growing can occur . While teachers plan the festivals, parent support is essential to their success. Our annual calendar will list the dates of each festival, and informational flyers giving you further details and history will be left in your family' s mailbox. Our website (https://www .bendwaldorf.com/festivals/) also lists the festivals and events we participate in each year . August 2021 Page 3 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D Friday Gatherings Friday Gatherings are another way WSB comes together in the community . The various grades perform songs, verses and plays and it is a great opportunity to experience the curriculum unfolding. We begin most gatherings with our school verse and end with our school song. Both are provided below . For the First Friday of every month, when school is in session, a specific grade and curriculum will be highlighted. School Verse This is our school. May peace abide here. May the rooms be full of contentment. May love dwell here: love of one another , love of our school, and love of life itself. Let us remember that as many hands build a house, so many hearts build a school. School Song Tis a gift to be simple Tis a gift to be fr ee Tis a gift to come r ound Wher e we ought to be And when we have come to a place just right We will be in the valley of love and delight. When true simplicity is gained To bow and to bend we shan' t be ashamed Turn oh turn will be our delight Till by turning and turning we come r ound right! Existential Questions and The Role of Spirituality in the Waldorf Curriculum The Waldorf curriculum is not connected with any particular religion. The word religion is derived from the Latin \"religio,\" which means to re-unite. It is an expression of the universal human quest for meaning, for our source and our destiny . Throughout human history , people from all cultures have asked, \"Who am I?\" \"What am I doing here?\" \"What does it mean to be human?\" Throughout the world we share questions about creation, good and evil, and what exists beyond the starry cosmos and unknown dark matter . These soul questions live deeply within all humanity . Many lessons throughout August 2021 Page 4 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D Waldorf education propose questions of universal implication. We explore mythology , literature, history , science, and art in a way that evokes discussions and pondering of universal questions. Students live in an atmosphere that is permeated with (not devoid of) the quest for self-knowledge, and for the exploration of life's deepest mysteries. The Waldorf curriculum is designed to create the appropriate relationship between a child and these questions. Through art, a child builds a relationship with beauty , and in studying science, one seeks an understanding of truth. Out of beauty and truth develops a sense of morality and reverence for life that leads to questions of existence. Assessments and Screenings The following assessments or screenings are of fered at the Waldorf School of Bend: First Grade Readiness (conducted by Kinder garten Teacher) Second Grade Screening and Assessment (conducted by the Faculty) Reading Assessment ( conducted by the Pedagogical Director and Teacher) Fifth Grade Assessment (conducted by the Faculty) Child Studies (conducted by the Faculty) Integrated Assessment Practices (conducted by individual class teachers and educational support staff) Parent-Teacher Conferences Parent-T eacher Conferences are held once a semester allowing teachers and parents to discuss the student' s progress, assess academic, developmental and emotional growth, and develop student objectives. These meetings are required by enrollment at WSB as they are so vital to forging the pivotal partnership between teachers and parents to shepherd student success. During these meetings teachers will provide a synopsis of your child' s progress to include quarterly/block rotation assessments. Parents may always request a Parent-T eacher meeting outside of these conferences to address additional concerns or questions in a timely manner . There is no school on the days Parent-T eacher Conferences are scheduled. Class-Parent Meetings Class Parent Meetings are held periodically throughout the year as deemed appropriate by the class teachers. These meetings focus on bringing the class teachers and all parents of children in the class together to discuss the curriculum, rhythm of the class, to provide insights on Waldorf education and address parental questions and concerns. Attendance at these meetings is also required by enrollment at WSB and monumentally important in building a united class parent body . These meetings are conducted in a class community format so that all may gain from the insights and dialogue, shared, and open, honest communication can be established. End-of-the-year Student Reports In addition to Quarterly Reports (Grades 1-3) and Block reports (Grades 4-8) provided throughout the year, within two weeks of the end of school, teachers will complete individual student reports, to be August 2021 Page 5 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D given to parents, detailing the child' s progress during the year. The report will also cover general classroom curriculum, Subject curriculum and projects conducted that year .

To begin the school day as a unified whole is a committed effort that profoundly affects the habit life of the class and the individual student. This effort will help the students establish good habits, a rhythmic relationship to time, and a strong will that can serve them in their educational journey . Sign In and Sign Out Children in Early Childhood through Grade 3 must be accompanied by a parent or other designated guardian every day. The school has legal responsibility for each child until that child' s parents (or other designated guardian) have assumed care of the child. Students in Grades 4 and up can be signed in or out by a parent or teacher . After signing out, the parent is responsible for the child. Please do not allow your child to wander or play unattended in the parking lot or on the grounds before or after school.

Please do not park in these spaces without a handicap placard. Pick Up By Authorized Individuals Children may leave with adults who are not their parents/guardians only if the individual is entered into the child' s BigSIS on-line student record via the BigSIS Parent Portal or if the parent authorizes alternative pickup arrangements in writing. You may send a note with your child advising staff of alternative arrangements or write a note on the class sign-in sheet. If there is no written authorization from the parent, staff will call the parent to verify the arrangements. Otherwise we cannot release your child to another person. Attendance and Tardiness Policy The curriculum is created to promote a rhythmical unfolding of the day , the week and the year that then allows learning to take place in a balanced way . With regular attendance, the student does not miss out on experiences that have been designed for him or her . Assemblies and special performance events require the participation of each student in the designated class. Families are asked to schedule appointments and travel around important class and special performance events including events hosted by Subject teachers such as music. August 2021 Page 8 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D Grade School Absence Policy When a grade school student is absent: 1. Please call the main of fice with a message for the teacher by 8:00 am. 2. If a child is picked up from school any time before normal release time, the family member must notify the teacher and main of fice and sign the child out on the classroom attendance sheet for the day . Excused Absence includes 1. Illness 2. Serious illness or death of immediate family member 3. Mandated medical appointments* (i.e., medical procedures or specialist appointments that cannot happen at any other time) accompanied by a physician's note (or other relevant medical personnel's) 4. Observance of religious holidays 5. Those mandated by the school (e.g., conjunctivitis, lice, etc.) A family member must call on the day of absence. If a child is absent for three days or more in a row, a doctor 's note must be sent to school. The teacher(s) will consider a grade appropriate plan for making up the work missed. * We request you to schedule standard medical and dental appointments after school hours. Experiential Excused Absence includes 1. Family educational travel 2. Cultural learning experiences Experiential absences must be pre-approved by the class teacher and all Subject teachers must have advance notice of the absence. Unexcused Absence includes 1. An excused absence that is not accompanied by a phone call or note to explain the circumstances 2. An experiential absence that has not been coordinated with the class teacher 3. Vacations 4. \"Home days\" Upon the third unexcused absence of a given semester (August through December or January through June), the teacher contacts the parents to determine if there is a common cause for the absences and what assistance can be offered. Upon the fifth unexcused absence, a Student Success Plan conference may be held among the parents, class teacher , College Member and Educational Support staff (please note that a student in grades seven through eight may attend such a meeting with the group). Upon the eighth August 2021 Page 9 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D unexcused absence of a given semester , the parents, class teacher , College Member , and the Director will meet to contemplate whether the WSB experience meets the family's needs. This group will consider if the student's educational needs are being met and assess how the school can further assist the family . More than ten excused or unexcused absences accrued in a given semester or 20 combined absences over a school year can also impact the student's progression and enrollment at the school. The same process of review mentioned above will be followed to determine the student's continued enrollment at WSB and what assistance can be offered to help the family take full advantage of WSB' s experiential learning environment. (Note: Through prior coordination with WSB, these absentee totals may be exceeded to take advantage of a lengthy Experiential Excused Absence opportunity .) Early Childhood Absence Early Childhood vacations and home days must be pre-approved by the teacher to be counted as an excused absence. Children in Early Childhood who have not arrived by 9:30 a.m., and have not coordinated with the classroom teacher prior , should remain at home that day and it will be counted as an unexcused absence. Grades T ardy Policy Children should be on time in their class when their classes begin their day. If you believe your child is going to be late, please call the main office as soon as possible. When a student arrives after their start time, the student will wait outside their classroom door until the classroom teacher can integrate them into the on-going classroom activities. This may be immediate or may require the child to wait for a natural break in the classroom rhythm. Please discuss with your child' s class teacher what their specific requirements are for integration back into the classroom if tardy . Upon the third tardy of a given semester (August through December or January through June) in a two-week period, the teacher contacts the parents to determine if there is a common cause for the tardiness and what assistance can be offered. Upon the fifth tardy in a months' time, a Student Success Plan conference may be held among the parents, class teacher , College Member and Educational Support staff (please note that a student in grades seven and eight may attend such a meeting with the group). Upon the eighth tardy of a given semester , the parents, class teacher , College Member , Educational Support staff and Director will meet to contemplate whether the WSB school experience meets the family's needs. This group will consider if the student's educational needs are being met and assess how the school can further assist the family . More than ten tardy days accrued in a given semester or 20 combined tardy days over a school year can also impact the student's progression and enrollment at the school. The same process of review mentioned above will be followed to determine the student's continued enrollment at WSB and what assistance can be offered to help the family take full advantage of WSB' s experiential learning environment. August 2021 Page 10 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D Early Childhood T ardy Policy Since there is a need to support a gradual and flexible approach for the younger child, in the Kinder gartens late arrivals will be noted in the attendance record and teachers will contact the family if further support is needed. Restroom Use: Early Childhood Procedure The restroom facility is located outside the classroom. Therefore, one teacher will supervise the classroom and one teacher will be in the hallway outside of the r estrooms to support as needed. No child under the age of five will be allowed to go to the restroom without supervision. If a child in Early Childhood needs to use the bathroom during a recess time outside, an adult or appropriate aged student chaperone will accompany the child to the restroom. Grades Procedure Please inform your class teacher if your child needs special assistance using the bathroom. If they do require special assistance, we will make an individualized restroom plan for your child as needed prior to their first day of school. Gender Diversity Policy We support gender diversity and inclusivity at our school. If a student identifies as female, they are supported in using the female restroom. If a student identifies as male, they are supported in using the male restroom. If a student identifies as non-gender binary , they are supported in using the bathroom of their choice in which they feel the most comfortable. Disaster Preparedness All staff are instructed in fire drill and emer gency procedures and the children practice fire drills and other emer gency drills regularly during the school year. The primary means for emer gency notification is the school' s community emer gency texting program. Additional notifications will be posted on the website, school Facebook page and sent via e-mail as soon as possible. August 2021 Page 11 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D Security and Visitor Policy The external doors to the school are locked from 9:00 am until 15 minutes prior to Grades release time to control access in and out of the school. A doorbell is located to the right of the front doors to gain access during school hours . Any visitor will be let in by Administrative staff and asked to sign in when they arrive and sign out when they leave. Visitors to Early Childhood classes have additional visitor policy requirements (please see the Early Childhood handbook if applicable). Emergency School Closure/Late Start The Waldorf School of Bend ordinarily follows the emer gency closure decisions of the Bend-La Pine School District. If the decision to close the school is made, it will be made no later than 7:15 a.m., and a text message notification will be sent to the WSB community . As soon as practical, additional notifications will be posted on the school website, school Facebook page and/or sent via e-mail. Other sources of school cancellation information can be found on local television and radio stations, and through contacting the Bend-La Pine School District Inclement Weather Hotline at (541) 323-7669. If the Bend-La Pine School District announces school cancellation, WSB will be closed. If the Bend-La Pine School District announces a two-hour delay: WSB' s Early Childhood program will be cancelled . WSB' s grades classes will begin two hours late. School ends at the normal time. Ultimately , the safety of WSB students is the most important factor . If parents decide it's best for their child to remain home on an inclement weather day, we support families in that decision however please inform the school as soon as practical. If WSB determines safety dictates a deviation from a Bend-La Pine School District closure or non-closure, notifications will be sent via text, website postings and e-mail with additional notifications to local TV and radio stations. Substance Policy Any intoxicants (i.e. alcohol, medicinal or recreational marijuana, etc.), smoking and other uses of tobacco are prohibited on school property , including interiors and grounds, and at all school-sponsored activities. As such, no individual deemed under the use of any intoxicants is allowed on campus or to participate in school sponsored field trips etc. This includes all teachers, staff, parents, students, volunteers and visitors. Reporting Child Abuse or Neglect As required by law, any suspected case of child abuse or neglect will be reported to the Oregon Department of Human Services. The Child Abuse Hotline number for Deschutes County is 541-548-9499 . All employees of WSB are mandatory reporters per Oregon State law and are trained annually to deal with the complexities of potential abuse or neglect situations. August 2021 Page 12 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D Class Field Trips Field trips are an important part of the Waldorf curriculum. Students, staff and chaperones are expected to maintain the same high standards when out in the larger community as are required while at school. No electronic games or toys should accompany children on field trips. Students traveling in private cars must use seat belts and will not sit in the front seat where airbags are in place, unless they meet the required height/weight limit. Teachers and drivers will bring copies of the class emer gency contact information and school provided first aid kits on field trips. Field trip permission forms are used for trips away from school. However , neighborhood walking excursions (for example, to the local park) are authorized by the enrollment agreement without a separate permission form. Parent Volunteers All parents that wish to volunteer in the classroom or accompany a class on field trips as a chaperone are required to complete the Oregon Criminal History Verification of Applicants form. For those parents who wish to volunteer in the Early Childhood classroom, they will need to register with the Oregon Office of Child Care Central Background Registry . Both forms can be completed in the office or online. In addition, all parents that volunteer to drive other students in their private vehicles must provide proof of automobile insurance and current driver 's license. One of the pivotal classroom parental volunteer opportunities is the role of Class Parent. Class Parent (or Par ents as ther e can be mor e than one) In general, the Class Parent organizes the practical support that parents give the teacher and the class. Class parents are a communication and organizational link specifically between a teacher and parents of the class about class and school events. Some Class Parent responsibilities include (but are not limited to) the following: works with the class teacher before the beginning of school to determine if any tasks need to be completed before school starts and helping plan work days, if needed acts as a liaison for the teacher with parents; welcomes new families to the class; assists in or ganizing field trips; assists or organizes volunteers to assist, with class projects and classroom assignments, including faculty meals, Annual Auction, festivals and other fundraising projects organizes and encourages class participation in general school fundraising; organizes class participation in all-school events, such as the class project for the annual school auction documents class events during the course of the year to be included in the school newsletter and history , including class plays, festivals and school assemblies; offers to take notes for the teacher at class meetings for distribution to parents/teacher; thank parents for their volunteer work during the year; organizing class gifts for the teacher at winter break, birthdays and at the end of the year August 2021 Page 13 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D Pets Due to possible allergies and unpredictable behavior , please do not bring pets into the school for drop-of f or pick-up of your child. Only certified pre-approved animals are authorized in the school and in the classrooms as a part of a pre-arranged presentation and as long as they have written documentation of good health, including current rabies vaccination on hand. Please discuss this with the administrative staf f and your child' s teacher prior to a desired event. Tuition/Fee Payment and Refund Policy Please refer to your enrollment contract for tuition rates, payment schedule and refund policy . Payment processing of all school tuition and associated fees is conducted on behalf of WSB by BigSIS. Questions regarding the amount of tuition or fee charges or actual payment processing can be directed to mbrocious@bendwaldorf.com School Photos In the fall, a professional photographer comes to our school and takes portraits of each individual child and group photos of each class with their teacher . Advance notice will be given in the newsletter and/or by notice in your family' s mailbox at school. Lost and Found The lost and found box is located at the end of the hallway leading to the main playground. Periodically , unclaimed items are given to charity . The school will provide notice before a donation occurs. Requirement for and confidentiality of Student Records Information on your child' s records is privileged and confidential. The school will not distribute or release information in your child' s record to anyone without your written consent. As part of your child' s enrollment you will be required to sign a records release form to enable WSB to request and garner school records from your child' s previous school(s). You are also required to keep your child' s health information, emer gency contacts and family account information updated by using the Parent Portal of our database at https://bendwaldorf.bigsis.com/portal/ . You will, upon request, have access to your child' s complete records. Upon request, we will transfer your child' s records to you or any other person you identify per Oregon statutes. C OMMUNICATION Telephone and Cell Phone Policy Our phone number is 541-330-8841. Messages are checked regularly during school hours. We work diligently to create an atmosphere in which children and teachers are free from the oversaturation of media that they experience outside of school. This supports the work the teachers do in August 2021 Page 14 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D the classroom by creating an environment in which the entire school building supports the Waldorf curriculum. In support of that effort we ask that all adults in the building uphold a commitment to only use devices in the school office and not in learning spaces. The following areas are consider ed learning spaces and are therefore media free; all classr ooms, hallways, the play yard and great room. Your efforts to make phone calls and texts before entering the building are appreciated. Please share this information with babysitters, friends, and guests. Children are not permitted to have cell phones (including watch phones etc.) in the classroom or on the playground. If a parent would like to send a cell phone to school with their child for safety reasons (walking to and from school etc.), please discuss this with the class teacher so that a safe location can be found to keep the phone during school. If students need to contact their parents during the school day, teachers will excuse them to the office to accomplish. For safety reasons, class teachers may choose to keep their personal cell phone with them while with the children on the playground and field trips. Please note: WSB hallways, classr ooms and play ar eas ar e cell phone-fr ee zones. Classroom Updates Class teachers and/or Class Parent will provide parents a classroom update, note, or newsletter every week, or as needed by the class. These are normally done through e-mail. In addition, the Parent Council Representative for each class will meet with the Parent Council and provide updates to the class teacher and other parents in the classroom about all school opportunities to work on festivals, fundraising and community outreach projects. Class Parents, who are the primary assistants for each classroom teacher , are also great resources on what' s going-on in the classes and how parents can assist their child' s class. Family Correspondence Each family has a \"Family Folder\" in the Main Office where correspondence and other documents will be provided. Please check your family' s folder at a minimum weekly . School Newsletter Our school newsletter is published every other week during the school year and sent by e-mail. Additionally , a quarterly newsletter will be produced this year to highlight activities, provide insights into Waldorf education and deepen our communication with our community . These newsletters can be e-mailed to extended family upon request. WSB Parent Dashboard All WSB parents should visit our Parent Dashboard ( https://www .bendwaldorf.com/parent-dashboard/ ) to access BigSIS Student Management System, school calendar and more. All WSB families are expected to update their child' s information such as health info, address, emer gency contacts, etc. through the BigSIS Parent Portal. Our school directory is also available via our password protected BigSIS Parent Portal. August 2021 Page 15 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D All School Gatherings All School Gatherings are scheduled at a minimum twice during the school year to provide an opportunity for the Board of Directors and Faculty to present information that is pertinent to the entire school and community . It also affords the school community a forum to ask questions, voice concerns and discuss the state of the school and its growth and development. Our entire community of parents and staf f are required to attend these gatherings to strengthen our ability to guide our school. Online Communication Our school has a comprehensive website that is updated on a regular basis and provides information on upcoming events, class activities and the overall rhythm of the school. The address is www .bendwaldorf.com . Additionally , you may check us out on our Facebook and Instagram platforms to connect with community members and with members outside our immediate community for activities, events and information sharing. H EALTH AND N UTRITION Snacks and Lunch In the early childhood programs, snacks are provided each day (a snack schedule is posted outside the classroom). Early childhood students should bring a lunch from home only if they are in after care and Grades students should bring a snack and lunch from home. Parents must notify the class teacher and the office of any food allergies that are discovered after enrollment and not indicated on the enrollment documents. Students are not permitted to share food. Our campus is peanut free. Please do not send foods containing peanuts or peanut products in your child' s snacks and lunches. Our school uses a gluten free food preparation protocol, keeping airborne gluten particles to a minimum. Additional restrictions may be present in individual classr ooms based on class student/teacher restrictions. Your classroom teacher will provide you with any additional restrictions prior to the school year . Please follow these guidelines to provide for a smooth social atmosphere and focused learning environment. We appreciate your support. Provide healthy natural/or ganic food choices when possible. Vegetables, leafy greens, whole grains and proteins provide essential nutrients. (Following this guidance is also appreciated when participating in community activities where families are sharing or providing food. i.e. Festivals, potlucks etc.) Please do not pack gum, candy , or soda. Microwaves and toaster ovens are not available for children' s use; therefore, we recommend students use a stainless steel/insulated thermos for hot foods. Bring food in a bag, basket or lunch box free of distracting, commercial/media-related images. If you choose pre-packaged foods, please select packaging free of such images. August 2021 Page 16 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D Illnesses Please see our Communicable Disease Plan for our detailed health and safety plan. In brief, since we do not have the space or staff to supervise sick or recovering children, it is best to keep them home if they are not well enough for outdoor play. A parent will be called if a child develops a fever or is too sick to participate in class. A place to rest quietly away from the group will be provided until a parent or alternate arrives. Please be sure your child is well enough to participate in all activities before returning to school. A child who has had a fever may return when his or her temperature has been normal for at least 24 hours without the use of fever reducing medications. Remember to advise the office of any contagious or transmittable illnesses so that the teachers and parents of exposed children can be notified. Parents are responsible for checking their child' s health before bringing the child to school. You will be notified and your child will be sent home if he or she has one or more of the following symptoms: fever over 100 degrees diarrhea (more than one loose stool in 24 hours) vomiting, nausea severe cough skin or eye lesions rashes that are weeping or puss-filled stiff neck and headache difficulty breathing or wheezing complaints of severe pain any suspected communicable illness, such as conjunctivitis, strep, lice *Please Review our Operational Blueprint and EC Health and Safety Guidelines for the most current health guidelines and practices. *Staf f will contact the child' s parents in case of a sudden illness. Medications Medications will be administered according to state regulations. Only medications (over the counter or prescription) provided by parents will be administered by school personnel with specific parental written consent. Parents would need to complete a medical release form if their child needs medication provided during the school day . Please be sure the teacher understands the medical needs of your child. Head Lice Policy Our school has a no-nit policy , which requires that children remain at home until all nits (lice eggs) are removed. If lice or nits are discovered at school, the parents will be called to pick up and treat the student immediately . This policy must be enforced, as it is virtually impossible for us to distinguish treated, dead nits from live nits. If a case is detected, each child is required to be checked by WSB staff or a professional before entering the school. August 2021 Page 17 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D P ARENT /S TUDENT C ONCERNS & D ISCIPLINE Parent-Teacher Questions, Student Concerns & Communication Flowcharts For the health of the school, each of us must responsibly communicate information about our school in a positive, accurate and respectful manner . Parents and teachers work together at the Waldorf School of Bend on behalf of the children. If you have questions or concerns regarding your child or the classroom, please contact your class teacher as soon as possible . If your questions or concerns are not resolved or cannot be addressed by the classroom teacher , please follow the communication flowchart below to resolve your issue or concern. August 2021 Page 18 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D Student Success Plan (SSP) When a child requires ongoing additional guidance and/or classroom support the teacher or parent may request a meeting to establish a Student Success Plan (SSP) to discuss the child' s specific needs. This meeting plan is separate from a parent-teacher conference or casual check-in before and after school or via email. While the parent-teacher conference is a time to look at the whole child and their successes and challenges, the SSP process is meant to address specific issues that may have come up over the course of the school year or in the child' s life and make a collaborative plan between teacher and parents to address said issues. A SSP may be established to assist students with classroom challenges or it may also be formed to assist students who are excelling, meet their fullest potential. If a teacher/WSB deems a SSP be instituted, it is imperative that the parents/guardians of the student in need participate fully and without hesitation. Student Success Plan (SSP) Outline The first team, made up of teachers, parents and possibly educational support staff, will develop a plan to include the most effective strategies for working with the child in the classroom and at home. During this first meeting a schedule of follow-on meetings will be developed on a structured timeline and goals and benchmarks will begin to be identified. Follow-up meetings will be held, according to the recommended timeline of the team, and potential additional support and/or personnel will be identified August 2021 Page 19 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D to join the team if necessary . A copy of the plan will be kept in the student files. An outline of the general SSP process is outlined below . Step 1) What you can expect at this 1st meeting: This is the time to address any emer ging questions or concerns the teacher and parents may have concerning their student. We will be discussing your child' s strengths, any known information about your child and any modifications tried. Finally , we will brainstorm strategies and put a plan into action. We will also name who is responsible for each part of the plan and create a realistic timeline. As long as sufficient progress is being made, this group of parents and teachers may continue to meet until the issue is resolved. If the issue requires further attention, the teacher or parent will request that we bring in a lar ger team to see what can be done to help resolve the problem. Step 2) Building a Student Success team: If ongoing assistance is needed for the child, the teacher or parent may initiate a second stage meeting. This meeting involves bringing in a Student Success team that may include but is not limited to: the WSB Educational Support staff, WSB faculty chair , WSB college member , therapists, doctors, local school district specialists or any other professionals the family may be working with. By working collaboratively , we strive to bring about the best possible solutions for each individual child. Step 3) Assessment of progress: This meeting is a follow up to Steps 1 and 2. At this stage ideally , we would like to be building on a plan or maintaining a program that has been successful for the child, teacher and family . If the team feels that all options have been attempted and there is still a significant problem, WSB and the family will look at whether or not continuing enrollment is the best course of action. *WSB' s SSP program is mandatory if deemed necessary by WSB faculty or staff. Continued enrollment at WSB may be subject to the par ent's willingness to participate . **If meeting #1 has a successful outcome, ther e is no need for subsequent meetings. Waldorf School of Bend Code of Conduct The children at WSB created a Code of Conduct to reflect our core values. We at the Waldorf School of Bend will: Use safety at all times August 2021 Page 20 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D Be respectful of each other, ourselves and nature Be caring and kind Be responsible for our actions Strive to find resolution Stand with courage Listen to our teachers Ask for help when needed Listen and strive to understand one another's points of view Discipline Philosophy Our goal as the faculty and staff is to help each child attain his or her greatest potential. While social skills come easier for some children, developing a higher level of social behavior is a lifelong process. Recognizing this, we will do our best to model respectful, loving authority and will create a rhythmic, nurturing, healthy , structured, safe environment for students. In the forefront of our approach is the recognition of negative behaviors, such as bullying and related behaviors, which will not be tolerated and dealt with earnestly within our philosophy . Our primary goal is to see the best in a child come forth freely , without demands or forceful consequences. The following is a guide to our general discipline philosophy: Prevention through preparedness to include: Teachers will provide a healthy classroom rhythm, set clear expectations and create a respectful and safe environment. Prompt and regular attendance helps children feel prepared and ready work with a positive attitude. Redir ection and kind reminders are used to guide children toward appropriate choices. Active listening and discussion between conflicting students, to identify the feelings and needs of those involved. Appr opriate and consistent consequences are delegated by the teacher depending on each individual circumstance. It may include a time-out period away from the group, work or will activities, an apology letter , etc. If an individual is not able to resolve the situation through the above approaches a Student Success Plan may be formed. Unusual Incident Reports are filed whenever an unusual incident occurs at school or on field trips. Examples of unusual incidents include: medical emer gencies, physical injury of a child, threatening or abusive language to self or others, threatening or abusive actions to self or others. Parents are August 2021 Page 21 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D notified of the incident and a written description of the incident is drafted by the faculty/staf f that are involved. Parents of children involved in the incident are required to sign an acknowledgement of the incident on the form. After an administrative review , parents will be of fered a copy of the completed form. Additionally , a copy of the report will be placed in the student' s file. Should the unusual incident be severe enough, there will be a Student Success team formed and the child may be suspended from attending school until the team is able to implement a plan (see SSP outline above). The following is an example of how in classroom discipline is handled at WSB: Observe...identify/notice... Disappr ove inappropriate behavior or actions Discover Ask in an age appropriate manner... What happened?... What' s wrong?... Why do you feel this way?... What' s a better way to address the issue in question?... The extent of this discovery/discussion will be incident dependent i.e. is the first time this has happened, or is this a repeat occurrence?... Do Over Give the student/students and opportunity to correct/modify their behavior The process above is used for each occurrence of an issue. The first occurrence is usually the most in-depth especially in the discovery phase. Consequences in a graduated order for repeat occurrences of same or similar issues: 1. Warning and/or apology if appropriate 2. Separation from class activities within classroom; pedagogical refocusing of ener gies into classroom tasks, activities, chores etc... 3. Separation from classroom i.e. for younger grades it may be to a bench outside the classroom to discuss with the teacher one-on-one; for older grades, it could be to the of fice August 2021 Page 22 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D 4. Separation to the of fice will entail an explanation to the School Administration on why they were asked to leave the class; based on this discussion/discovery a determination will be made whether to integrate the child back into class or elevate the issue further by calling the student' s parents 5. Separation from school if it is apparent that after a discussion with the teacher , Educational Support staf f/Directors and parents the student is not equipped to be in school that day Repeat incidents that continue to impede the student' s progress or detract from the experience of the class as a whole will warrant the implementation of an SSP (see description below). T HE R OLE OF THE P ARENT Family Involvement and Volunteerism Family involvement is integral and indispensable to the school; and as such, there are several avenues for families to volunteer their time, expertise and enthusiasm. Many parents hold positions on the Board of Directors, choose to be a Parent Representative to the Parent Council or a Class Parent for their child' s class, or volunteer at the school. A few of the creative ways families have participated in growing our community are by being a part of class field trips, working in the garden, helping to maintain the grounds, cleaning their child's classroom, or reading to students during Handwork class. By networking with fellow community members, families help keep the bonds among the children strong outside the classroom and build social relations among parents. If you have further questions regarding your family' s volunteer contributions to the school, please reference the volunteer agreement piece in our Parent Portal document section. Family Support WSB relies on gifts of time, talent and treasures from our school community in order to serve our students. There are many ways each family can lend their support. Contributing to our Annual Giving Fund, attending our Wanderlust Ball and Auction, or shopping at our 4 Gnomes School Store are just some of the ways. Please visit our website or ask our staff about ways you can support the gift of Waldorf Education at WSB. Families, Teachers and Administration Working Together At the Waldorf School of Bend, we believe that regular communication among families, teachers and staff helps solidify and strengthen relationships. Weekly updates from the class teacher , the website, our Facebook page and a bi-monthly and quarterly newsletter from the School serve as ways to keep families informed and updated. All-School Gatherings, Parent-T eacher Conferences, Class-Parent Meetings, Parent Council Meetings and volunteer opportunities serve to further strengthen our community and collaboration. All families bring a unique perspective to our community . Many classes come together to discuss specific topics and meet off-campus to deepen relationships among themselves. August 2021 Page 23 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D The Parent Council also sponsors Parent Enrichment Evenings throughout the year to help families deepen their knowledge on how to partner in their child' s development and education. Parents can support the child's classroom experience by establishing regular mealtimes and bedtimes and limiting exposure to electronics and media. Provide a regular time and space for schoolwork and musical instrument practice to help deepen the appreciation for subjects being covered. Dress Code Education at the Waldorf School of Bend extends beyond the basic academia acquired in the classroom by taking into consideration the environment into which the children come when they attend school. We aim to surround the children with a nourishing environment that is beautiful and wholesome. Practical We strongly believe in the pedagogical value of outdoor play. As part of our unique curriculum, our students play outside everyday , unless the weather is dangerously cold or wet, or if there is poor air quality due to wildfire smoke. Therefore, we expect children/caregivers to bring appropriate all-weather indoor and outdoor clothing to school that can be worn in layers, such as base layers, warm sweaters, rain jackets, snow suits, etc., particularly during colder , winter months (layers are best in changing or unpredictable weather .) Please label all clothing - especially frequently lost items such as gloves, hats, and coats - with your family name or your child' s initials. Due to the high level of daily activity our students undertake, clothing should fit comfortably , and be neither not too tight/restrictive (which might prevent easy movement) or too large/loose (which could be a tripping hazard). Additionally , pants and skirts that have a tendency to fall down when the student is in motion should be worn with a working belt or suspenders (as clothing that falls down upon the legs may also be a tripping hazard). Children also need to wear appropriate, closed-toe shoes for safety in movement and play. Please leave light-up sneakers, shoes with wheels on the bottom of them, high heels, dress shoes, open-toed sandals, or other novelty footwear at home. Soft-soled slipper shoes for indoor early childhood classrooms and sturdy tennis shoes or sneakers for either indoor or outdoor play are ideal. Aesthetic In addition to practical considerations, we also strive for certain aesthetic standards regarding student dress conduct. We value the creative, individual expression of our students, and we also value a communal learning environment that minimizes distraction. Therefore, we ask that clothing and personal grooming choices not be overtly distracting in appearance, and be guided towards modesty and respect. August 2021 Page 24 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D We understand that clothing and dress can be a potentially sensitive topic for some students/families, and that standards of appropriateness, distractibility , respectability , and modesty are individually , socially , and culturally subjective. Reasonable people can disagree in their personal opinions as to what constitutes \"appropriate,\" \"respectful,\" or \"modest,\" yet as a school we must set certain uniform standards to ensure that we are creating a learning environment that is safe and appropriate for children. Our goal in setting these standards is never to judge or shame a child; rather , our goal is to create a safe and appropriate learning environment for all of our students. For example, any clothing that may be construed as conveying hate speech, or that has historically racist, sexist, ableist, or other discriminatory history , such as images of the confederate flag, swastikas, etc. will never be tolerated or allowed. Gender Policy: Furthermore, we recognize and acknowledge that issues of appropriateness, respectability , and modesty are often intertwined with issues relating to gender , gender identity , gender expression, sex, and sexual orientation. We acknowledge this connection, and again, in setting our community standards, we strive to meet the individuality of each child while also meeting the learning needs of the communal group. We hope to foster developmentally appropriate conversations about these important issues with our students, towards the goal of educating our students to become critical, independent thinkers. In alignment with our non-discrimination gender diversity and inclusion policy , we explicitly and unequivocably support students in wearing clothing and making personal grooming choices that best expresses their preferred gender identity and/or sexual orientiation, regardless of their physical biology . All students can wear clothing commonly associated in our culture with any gender . Additionally , should classmates make derogatory comments about students' clothing and grooming choices with regards to gender , teachers will address these comments with sensitvity and ensure that all students understands that gender -based discrimination or bullying will not be tolerated at our school. If a student continues to harass another student based on their gender expression or identity , this may constitute grounds for dismissal from our school. Dress Standards: In alignment with all of the above, the following styles are not suitable nor allowed at school or school functions: August 2021 Page 25 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D 1. Popular media, video, and sports-inspired images on clothing. Corporate or Licensed logos or images of any kind lar ger than the palm of a child's hand. Exceptions: WSB tees and sweatshirts, or larger images related to nature-based elements (such as plants/flowers, wildlife, landscapes etc.) are appropriate as long as they are not distracting to others and do not overshadow the child wearing the clothing. 2. \"Spaghetti\" strapped garments, which are defined as straps on blouses, dresses or tank tops narrower than the width of the child' s two fingers. However , \"spaghetti\" strapped clothing may be worn with a t-shirt or other sleeved garment underneath. Tops where the shoulder strap width is greater than the width of the child' s two fingers can be worn without any accompanying garment underneath. Necklines of blouses, shirts, dresses etc. should be cut no lower than 4 finger widths below the child' s collarbone. 3. Bare midrif fs (check tops with arms raised!), visible underwear and tops with deeply cut armholes. 4. Clothing with tears, holes, or unfinished edges, such as cut-of f jeans. Pants or skirts longer than the student' s shoes. 5. Skirts, dresses and shorts shorter than the bottom of the child's fingertips when their arm and hand are extended straight down to the side. However , these shorter shorts, dresses or miniskirts may be worn if leggings or tights are worn underneath. 6. No skin tights (i.e. spandex, lycra, panty hose style or running style tights) without a skirt, dress or shorts over them. 7. Jewelry (other than simple small necklaces or small stud earrings in earlobes) - Kinder through 5th. (Moderate jewelry may be worn from 6th grade up.) 8. Any piercings other than earlobes. 9. Writing or drawing on skin (includes face paint, stickers, and tattoos.) 10. Perfume, hair dyeing or coloring, distracting hair -styles (such as Mohawks), henna treatments, false nails. 11. Makeup and nail polish (Pre-Kinder through 6th.) 12. No flip flops or open toed sandals for health and safety concerns. Also, no light-up shoes, shoes that make noise, or shoes with wheels 13. Shoes with heels more than 1\"; heeled shoes must provide stability and support. August 2021 Page 26 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D 14. Hats, ball caps or knit caps in the grades classrooms during lesson times. Hats can be worn during outdoor activities, at recess and other times deemed appropriate by classroom teachers for the weather conditions and activities of the day . 15. Alternative sports/activewear (running shorts/tights etc.) may be worn by students 5 th Grade and up who are engaged in school team, group or individual sports activities. These articles of clothing will be changed into or out of as appropriate for the time of the activity . Unless they comply with the above Dress Code, they will not be worn in the classroom. NOTE: Jr . High students may wear nail polish and 'natural looking' makeup. This privilege may be withdrawn if such becomes a distraction. Any time a child is not appropriately dressed, alternative clothing may be provided by the School. If necessary , clothing will be turned inside out or covered. Parents will be contacted should repeated problems occur . Grooming: Good grooming is as essential as appropriate clothing. We support students from a diversity of cultural and ethnic backgrounds in wearing their hair in their preferred style, i.e. loose, hidden, braids, dreadlocks, etc. We make no demands in terms of hair style or length (students may be bald, may wear their hair short, or may grow their hair out as long as they like), but we do ask all students, regardless of gender or gender identity , to have their hair neatly presented and out of the face for safety and visibility purposes. Particularly for Movement and Practical Arts classes, hair needs to be tied back so that vision is never compromised. Exemptions: WSB understands that families may have religious or other devout beliefs which may be in conflict with some aspects of this dress code. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis in an ef fort to accommodate these beliefs. Please contact your child' s class teacher to open a discussion about any exceptions to our school' s policy . Items to be Kept at Home Candy , toy weapons, stuffed animals, radios, iPods, video games, cassette/CD players, and role-playing games (Star Trek cards, Magic cards, or any type of trading cards, for example) should not be brought to school. Matches, lighters, jack knives, and other potentially dangerous objects also have no place in school and will be confiscated. Sexually explicit material has no place in our school and will be immediately confiscated if found. If a parent becomes aware at any time that this type of material has been present at school, we ask that the class teacher and the school administration be notified. August 2021 Page 27 W A L D O R F S C H O O L O F B E N D Media Policy To support the work we do at WSB, we ask that parents eliminate media use during the week and strongly monitor or eliminate its use over the weekend. It is especially crucial for the children in grades Pre-K through 5 to be free from the excessive influences of the media. What children bring to school after a weekend of unsupervised video watching or unsupervised radio listening affects the class and its work. Based on direct observation of the children, our teachers have serious concerns about excessive exposure to the media. We feel the medium itself, as much as programming content, undermines healthy child development. A reliance on ready-made pictures reduces the child's ability to visualize both the written and the spoken word. Students who are accustomed to passively receiving have difficulty making the inner effort necessary to sustain an imaginative train of thought. There is a growing body of research supporting this position. Essential to the Waldorf approach to education is the daily activity by students of reviewing the previous day's work. As the children sleep, the stories and experiences of the day are transformed and become their own. This process sparks the individual development of thinking. When a child is exposed to strong, fixed impressions, such as the media presents, this overnight process of taking in is compromised to a point where we know it cannot work at all as it is intended. In the event that a child's media experiences are affecting his or her ability to benefit from the curriculum and thereby causing disruption to the daily life of the class, the teacher will request a meeting with the parents of the student. A child whose media experiences are disruptive to the class, classroom activities, or educational process is of serious concern to the faculty and may lead to a request to withdraw a student. * As a reminder , Childr en are not permitted to have cell phones (includes watch phones etc.) in the classr oom or on the playgr ound. If a parent would like to send a cell phone to school with their child, please discuss this with the class teacher so that a safe location can be found to keep the phone during school. For safety reasons, class teachers may choose to keep their personal cell phone with them while with the childr en on the playgr ound, at the park and on fieldtrips. The Waldorf School of Bend welcomes your feedback on this Parent Handbook. We hope that parents and students will find the information that is provided in this Parent Handbook useful and that it provides an opportunity for many open and honest conversations. The Waldorf School of Bend appreciates every one of you for your commitment to this school and your child' s education. We are so pleased that you have chosen to be a part of this community .
