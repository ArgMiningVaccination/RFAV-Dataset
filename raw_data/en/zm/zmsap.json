Active Ingredients: Each 0.5 mL dose is formulated to contain: 60 \u00b5g of hemagglutinin (HA) for each of 3 strain s listed below for a total of 180 \u00b5g. (See DESCRIPTION .) Clinically Relevant Non -medicinal Ingredients: Formaldehyde, egg protein, Triton\u00ae X-100. Triton\u00ae X-100 is a registered trademark of Union Carbide, Co. For a complete listing see DOS AGE FORMS, COMPOSITION AND PACKAGING section. DESCRIPTION FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose [Influenza Virus Vaccine Trivalent Types A and B (Split Virion) ] for intramuscular use , is a sterile suspension containing three strains of influenza viruses propagated in embryonated chicken eggs, inactivated with formaldehyde , concentrated and purified by zonal centrifugation on a sucrose gradient , split with Triton\u00ae X-100, further purified and then suspended in sodium phosphate -buffered iso tonic sodium chloride solution. The FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose process uses an additional concentration factor after the ultrafiltration step in order to obtain a higher HA antigen concentration. FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose complies with the WHO (World Health Organization ) recommendation (Northern hemisphere) for the 2020 -2021 season . The strains for the 2020 -2021 (H1N1)pdm09 - like (H3N2) like strain and B /Washington/02/2019 - like strain . INDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USE FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose is indicated for active immunization against influenza caused by the specific strains of influenza virus contained in the vaccine in adults 65 years of age and older. Although the current influenza vaccine can contain one or more of the antigens administered in previous years, annual vaccination using the most current vaccine formulation is necessary because immunity declines in the year following vaccination. Sanofi Pasteur Product Monograph 372 - FLUZONE\u00ae High of 25 CONTRAIND ICATIONS FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose should not be admin istered to anyone with a history of severe allergic reaction to egg protein or any component of the vaccine or after previous admin istration of the vaccine or a vaccine containing the same components or constituents. (See DOS AGE FORMS, COMPOSITION AND PACKAGING .) WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS General Before administration of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose , health -care providers should inform the recipient or g uardian of the recipient of the benefits and risks of immunization, inquire about the recent health status of the recipient, review the recipient's history concerning possible hypersensitivity to the vaccine or similar vaccines, previous immunization history, the presence of any contraindications to immunization and comply with any local requirements regarding information to be provided to the recipient/guardian before immunization. As with any vaccine, immunization with influenza vaccine may not protect 100% of individuals. Influenza virus is remarkably unpredictable in that significant antigenic changes may occur from time to time. It is known that FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose , as now constituted, is not effective against all possible strains of influenza virus. Protection is highest against those strains of virus from which t he vaccine is prepared or against closely related strains. Administration Route Related Precautions : Do not administer by intravascular injection ; ensure that the needle does not penetrate a blood vessel. FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose should not be administered int o the buttocks. Febrile or Acute Disease : Persons with serious acute febrile illness usually should not be vaccinated until their symptoms have abated. Those with mild non -serious febrile illness (such as mild upper respiratory tract infections) may be g iven influenza vaccine. (1) Hematologic Because any intramuscular injection can cause injection site hematoma in persons with any bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia or thrombocytopenia, or in persons on anticoagu lant therapy, intramuscular injections with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose should not be administered to persons unless the potential benefits outweigh the risk of administration. If the decision is made to administer any product by intramuscular injection to such per sons, it should be given with caution, with steps taken to avoid the risk of hematoma formation following injection. NACI has recommendations for giving vaccinations to persons with bleeding disorders. (2) Immune As with all products, epinephrine h ydrochloride solution (1:1,000) and other appropriate agents should be available for immediate use in case an anaphylactic or acute hypersensitivity reaction Sanofi Pasteur Product Monograph 372 - FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Page 6 of 25 occurs. (2) Health-care providers should be familiar with current recommendations for the initial management of anaphylaxis in non -hospital settings including proper airway management. Fo r instructions on recognition and treatment of anaphylactic reactions see the current edition of the Canadian Immunization Guide or visit the Health Canada website. (2) As each dose may contain traces of formaldehyde and Triton\u00ae X-100, which are used during vaccine production, caution should be exercised when the vaccine is administered to persons with known hypersensitivity to one of these substances. (Se e CONTRAIND ICATIONS Immunocompromised persons (whether from disease or treatment) may not achieve the expected immune response. Nevertheless, as recommended by NACI, the possibility of lower efficacy should no t prevent immunization in those at high risk of influenza -associated morbidity, since some protection is still likely to occur. (1) Neurologic Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) has been temporally associated with the administration of influenza vaccine. If GBS has occurred within 6 weeks following previous influenza vaccination, the decision to give FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose should be based on careful consideration of the potenti al benefits and risks. (1) (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ) Special Populations Pregnant Women Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose . It is also not known whether FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose is indicated for persons 65 years of age and older. Nursing Women It is not known whether FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose is excreted in human milk. FLUZONE\u00ae High - Dose is indicated for persons 65 years of age and older. Geriatrics Safety , immunogenicity and efficacy of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose have been evaluated in adults 65 years of age and older. Pediatrics FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose is not indicated in persons younger than 65 years of age. ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse Drug Reaction Overview Adverse event information is derived from clinical trials and worldw ide post -marketing Sanofi Pasteur Product Monograph 372 - FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Page 7 of 25 experience with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose and FLUZONE\u00ae. Clinical Trial Adverse Drug Reactions Because clinical trials are conducted under very specific conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trial (s) of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial(s) of another vaccine and may not reflect rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinic al trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to vaccine use and for approximat e rates of these reactions. The safety of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose compared to FLUZONE\u00ae was evaluated in 3,833 adults (65 year s of age ) in a cl inical trial conducted in the United States. (3) The most common injection site reaction reported in participants receiving either FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose or FLUZONE\u00ae was pain, while myalgia was the most frequent systemic reaction . Onset was usually within the first 3 days after vaccination and a majority of the reactions re solved within 3 days. The frequency of the solicited injection site and systemic reactions reported within 7 days post - vaccination are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Percentage of Solicited Injection -Site and Systemic Reactions Within 7 Days After Vaccination with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose or FLUZONE\u00ae, Adults 65 Years of Age and Older (3) FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose N = 2569-2572* Percentage FLUZONE\u00ae N = 1258 -1260 * Percentage Injection site reactions Pain 35.6 24.3 Erythema 14.9 10.8 Swelling 8.9 5.8 Systemic reactions Myalgia 21.4 18.3 Malaise 18.0 14.0 Headache 16.8 14.4 Fever (37.5\u00b0C) 3.6 2.3 * N is the number of vaccinated participants with available data for the events listed Fever - The percentage of temperature measurements that were taken by oral route or not recorded were 97.9% and 2.1%, respectively, for FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose; Product Monograph 372 - FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Page 8 of 25 Data from Post -Marketing Experience The following additional events have been reported during th e post -approval use of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose or FLUZONE\u00ae in other countries . Because these events are reported voluntari ly from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Events Reported During Post -Approval Use of FLUZONE\u00ae: Eye Disorders Ocular hyperemia Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy Immune Anaphylaxis, other allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (including urticaria and angioedema ).

(See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS .) Concomitant Vaccine Administration No studies regarding the concomitant administration of inactivated influenza vaccine and other vaccines have been conducted with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose . FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose must not be mixed in the same syringe with other parenterals. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dose FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose should be administered a s a single 0.5 mL injection by the intramuscular route in adults 65 years of age and older. Fractional doses (doses <0.5 mL) should not be given. The effect of fractional doses on the safety and efficacy has not been determined. Administration Inspect for extraneous particulate matter and/or discolouration before use. If these conditions exist, the product should not be administered. Administer the vaccine intramuscularly . The preferred site is the deltoid muscle . Shake the prefilled syringe well to uniformly distribute the suspension before administering the dose. Aseptic technique must be used. U se a separate, sterile needle, for each individual patient to prevent disease transmission . Needles should not be recapped and should be disposed of according to biohazard waste guidelines. Give the patient a perm anent personal immunization record. In addition, it is essential that the physician or nurse record the immunization history in the permanent medical record of each patient. This permanent office record should contain the name of the vaccine, date given, d ose, manufacturer and lot number. OVERDOSAGE For management of a suspected drug overdose, contact your regional Poison Control Centre. Sanofi Pasteur Product Monograph 372 - FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Page 10 of 25 ACTION AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The inoculation of antigen prepared from inactivated influenza viru s stimulates the production of specific antibodies. Protection is highest against those strains of virus from which the vaccine is prepared or closely related strains. Immunity to the surface antigens, particularly HA, reduces the likelihood of infection. Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another type or subtype of influenza. Furthermore, antibody to one antigen ic type or subtype of influenza virus might not protect against infection with a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent emergence of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and is the re ason for annually reassessing the need to change one or more of the recommended strains for influenza vaccines. (4) Each year's t rivalent influenza vaccine contains three virus stra ins (two type A and one type B) representing the influenza viruses that are believed likely to circu late in the coming winter. (1) The antigenic characteristics of current and emerging influenza viru s strains provide the basis for selecting the strains included in each year's vaccine . (1) (5) Pharmacodynamics Seroprotection is generally obtained within 4 weeks. Pharmacokinetic s No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed. Duration of Effect Protection against influenza post -vaccination persists throughout the influenza season for which the vaccine is indicated.

Manufactured by: Monograph 372 - FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Page 12 of 25 PART II: SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION Drug Substance FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose [Influenza Virus Vaccine Trivalent Types A and B (Split Virion)] For the 2020 -2021 season FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose contains following - like strain [B/ virus ]. Product Characteristics FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose , Influenza Virus Vaccine Trivalent Types subtypes A and types B (Split Virion) for intramuscular use, is a sterile suspension prepared from influenza viruses propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. The virus -containing allantoic fluid is harvested and inactivated with formaldehyde. Influenza virus is co ncentrated and purified on a linear sucrose density gradient solution using a continuous flow centrifuge. The virus is then chemically disrupted using a nonionic surfactant (Triton\u00ae X-100 - a registered trademark of Union Carbide, Co.) producing \"split virus\". The split virus is then further purified by ultrafiltration and diluted to appropriate sodium phosphate -buffered isotonic sodium chloride solution. The FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose process uses an additional concentration factor after the ultrafiltration step in order to obtain a higher hemagglutinin (HA) antigen concentration. FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose has been standardized according to USPHS (US Public Health Service) requirements for the 2020 -2021 influenza season and is formulated to contain 180 micrograms (\u00b5g) HA per 0.5 mL dose, in the recommended ratio of 60 \u00b5g HA of each strain. FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose , after shaking well, is clear to slightly opalescent in colour. CLINICAL TRIALS Study Demographics and Trial Design Two clinical trials were conducted in the United States (see Table 2) with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose formulated using strains A (H1N1 ), A (H3N2 ), and B (either of or Yamagata lineage ).

The study compared the safety and immunogenicity of FLUZONE \u00ae High -Dose to those of FLUZONE\u00ae. A total of 3851 participants were included in immunogenicity assessments; of these, 2576 randomized to and 1275 were randomized t o FLUZONE\u00ae. Females accounted for 51.3% of participants in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose group and 54.7% of participants in the FLUZONE\u00ae group. In both groups, the mean age was 72.9 years (ranged from 65 through 97 years in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose group and 65 through 94 years in the FLUZONE\u00ae group); 35% of participants in the FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose group and 36% of participants in the FLUZONE\u00ae group were 75 years of age or older. The primary endpoints of the study were hemagglutination inhi bition ( HI) GMTs and seroconversion rates 28 after vaccination. Pre -specified statistical superiority criteria Sanofi Pasteur Product Monograph 372 - FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Page 14 of 25 required that the lower limit (LL) of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the GMT ratio ( FLUZONE\u00ae High - Dose divided by FLUZONE\u00ae) be greater than 1.50 for at least two of the strains, and if one strain failed, non -inferiority of that strain must be demonstrated (LL>0.67), and that the lower limit of the 2 -sided 95% CI of the seroconversion rate difference ( FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose minus FLUZONE\u00ae) be greater than 1 0% for at least two of the strains, and if one strain failed, non - inferiority of that strain must be demonstrated (LL> -10%). As shown in Table 3, statistically superior HI GMTs and seroconversion rates after vaccination with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose compared to FLUZONE\u00ae were demonstrated for influenza A subtypes, A (H1N1) and A (H3N2), but not for influenza type B. For strain B, non -inferiority of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose compared to FLUZONE\u00ae was demonstrated for both the HI GMTs and seroconversion rates.

The study was conducted over two influenza seasons (2011 -2012 and 2012 -2013) . The per -protocol analysis set for efficacy assessments included 15,892 FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose recipients and 15,911 FLUZONE\u00ae recipients. The majority (67%) of participants in the per -protocol analysis set for efficacy had one or more high -risk chronic comorbid conditions. The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of laboratory -confirmed influenza (as determined by culture or polymerase chain reaction ) caused by any influenza viral type/subtype in association with influenza -like illness (ILI), defined as a new onset (or exacerbation) of at least one of the following respiratory symptoms: sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing, or difficulty br eathing; concurrent with at least one of the following systemic signs or symptoms: temperature > 37.2\u00b0C, chills, tiredness, headaches or myalgia. Participants were monitored for the occurrence of a respiratory illness by both active and passive surveillance , starting 2 weeks post - vaccination for approximately 7 months. After an episode of respiratory illness, nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected for analysis; attack rates and vacci ne efficacy were calculated. As shown in Table 5, FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose vaccine demonstrated superior efficacy compared to FLUZONE\u00ae in preventing laboratory -confirmed ILI (p-value against H 0:VE 9.1% = 0.022 one - sided ).

A total of 23 deaths were reported during Days 29 - 180 post - vaccination: 16 (0.6%) among FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose recipients and 7 (0.6%) among FLUZONE\u00ae recipien ts. The majority of these participants had a medical history of cardiac, hepatic, neoplastic, renal, and/or respiratory diseases. These data do not provide evidence for a causal relation ship between deaths and vaccination with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose. In clini cal trial FIM12, adults 65 years of age and older were randomized to receive either FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose or FLUZONE\u00ae (2011 -2012 and 2012 -2013 formulations). The study compared the efficacy and safety of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose to those of FLUZONE\u00ae. The safety analysis set included 15,992 FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose recipients and 15,991 FLUZONE\u00ae recipients. Within the study surveillance period (approximately 6 to 8 months post -vaccination), 1323 (8.3%) FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose recipients and 1442 (9.0%) recipients experienced an SAE. Within 30 days post -vaccination, 204 (1.3%) FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose recipients and 200 (1.3%) FLUZONE\u00ae recipients experienced an SAE. The majority of these participants had one or more chronic comorbid illnesses. A total of 167 d eaths were reported within 6 to 8 months post - vaccination: 83 (0.5%) among FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose recipients and 84 (0.5%) among FLUZONE\u00ae recipients. A total of 6 deaths were reported within 30 days post -vaccination: 6 (0.04%) among FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose recipien ts and 0 (0 %) among FLUZONE\u00ae recipients. These data do not provide evidence for a causal relationship between deaths and vaccination with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose. TOXICOLOGY FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose has not been evaluated in non -clinical studies. Sanofi Pasteur Product Monograph 372 - FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose Page 19 of 25 ADDITIONAL RELEVANT INFORMATION Influenza infection in adults 65 years of age and older is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heightened susceptibility to influenza -related complications in older adults is due in large part to natural and progressive weakening of the immune system over time. This phenomenon, known as immunosenescence, also renders s eniors less responsive to standard dose influenza vaccine . (9) Another study showed that for the influenza seasons 1998 -1999 through to 2004 -2005, the range of standard dose vaccine effectiveness was 62% to 76% in persons 15 -64 years of age and 26% to 52% in those 65 years of age.

It provides important inf ormation about the product for consumers. This leaflet is a summary and it does not tell you everything about FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose . Contact your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you have any questions about the vaccine. ABOUT THIS VACCINE What the vaccine is used for: FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose is a vaccine used to prevent influenza in adults 65 years of age and older . Influenza (or flu) is an infection caused by the influenza virus. FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose contains 4 times the amount of antigens compared to the standard dose influenza vaccine, FLUZONE\u00ae. Influenza infection in adults 65 years of age and older is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Natural and progressive weakening of the immune system over time in older adults (immunosenescence), results in increased susceptibility to influenza -related complications and hospitalization. Also, seniors are less responsive to standard dose influenza vaccine compared to younger adults below 65 years of age. Flu symptoms can include fever, headache, muscle pain, runny nose, sore throat, extreme tiredness and cough. Some people get much sicker. The influenza virus spreads when a person who has the flu coughs or sneezes into the air. Small droplets containing the flu virus stay in the air for a short time then fall onto surfaces nearby. You can get the flu by: - breathing in these droplets through your nose or mouth. - the droplets landing directly on your eyes. - touching the hands of a person who has the flu and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. - touching surfaces that have been contaminated with flu virus and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. What it does: FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose causes your body to produce its own protection against influenza virus. After you get a flu shot, your immune system produces antibodies against the strains of virus that are in the vaccine. The antibodies are effective for the duration of the flu season . When you are exposed to the virus, the antibodi es will help to keep you from getting sick. If you do get the flu, you may not be as sick. FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose has been shown to induce higher antibody levels and have superior efficacy in preventing laboratory -confirmed influenza (prevented 24% more influenza cases) compared to the standard dose vaccine. When it should not be used: Do not give FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose to anyone who has ever had a severe allergic reaction to: - egg or egg products - any component of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose What the medicinal ingredient is: This vaccine complies with the WHO (World Health Organization) recommendation (Northern hemisphere) for the 2020 -2021 season . Each 0.5 mL dose of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose contains killed split viruses from three strains of influenza virus for the 2020 -2021 season. The viruses in FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose are: Kong/2671/2019 (H3N2) - like strain - B/Washington/02/2019 - like strain What the important non -medicinal ingredients are: Sodium phosphate -buffered, isotonic sodium chloride solution, formaldehyde and Triton\u00ae X-100. Does not contain adjuvant, preservative, or antibiotics.

If you have any of the following conditions, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist BEFORE you have FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose : Diseases of the immune s ystem or who are having treatment that affects the immune system. The vaccine may provide you with a lower level of protection than it does for people with healthy immune systems. A bleeding disorder or taking blood -thinning medications. Tell the person giving you the injection about your condition. There is a risk of excessive bleeding at the injection site if the vaccine is not given carefully. Allergy to egg protein or any component of the vaccine . Fever or serious illness. Wait until the person is better before giving the flu shot. A person who has a mild illness (such as a mild cold) may have the flu shot. Ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist for advice. A history of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks after a previous influenza vaccination. As with all vaccines, FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose does not protect 100% of people immunized.

Missed Dose: Not Applicable for this vaccine. SIDE EFFECTS AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT THEM A vaccine, like any medicine, may cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose causing serious harm is extremely small. The small risks associated with FLUZONE\u00ae High -Dose are much less than the risks associated with getting the disease against which it protects. The flu vaccine cannot cause influenza be cause it does not contain any live virus. The most common side effect is pain where you got the injection and muscle pain. Severe allergic reactions to flu shots are very rare. A very rare but possible side effect of influenza vaccination is Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). This is an autoimmune disease that attacks the nervous system. GBS causes weakness and abnormal sensations. Most patients recover fully. Other side effects may occur .
