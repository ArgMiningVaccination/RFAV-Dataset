But around 12 hours after receiving the second dose, McGuire went to bed with a splitting headache that hung around for a couple of days. Key points: - Tiredness, a headache and sore arm are common side effects after a second dose of Pfizer - These symptoms are triggered by the body's immune response to the vaccine - Painkillers can be taken after the jab to manage symptoms, but not beforehand \"I asked my husband to take the day off so he could watch the kids, because I just wanted to go to bed,\" said Ms McGuire, an immunisation nurse at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. It was the first time the 38-year-old had felt knocked around after a vaccine, but she wasn't worried. \"I knew that they were expected side effects,\" Ms McGuire said. \"I didn't feel great at the time, but I knew it was perfectly fine and felt reassured that obviously something was working.\" But why do these side effects happen in the first place and is there anything you can do to avoid them? Here's what we know. How common are post-Pfizer side effects? Data from AusVaxSafety, Australia's national vaccine safety system, suggest that Ms McGuire is not alone. A [survey of 314,192 people](https://www.ausvaxsafety.org.au/safety-data/covid-19-vaccines) who had received two doses of Pfizer found that 57.5 per cent of respondents had experienced adverse effects within three days after the second jab. The most common symptoms were fatigue, pain at the injection site and headaches, with around 22 per cent reporting that they missed work, study or routine duties for a day. These symptoms are in line with those seen in clinical trials and are often experienced with other vaccines, [according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration](https://www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-safety-report-08-07-2021) (TGA). These side effects can also occur [after the AstraZeneca vaccine](/news/health/2021-06-17/side-effect-astra-pfizer-vaccine-australia-safety-data/100202616), but they tend to show up at different times, said Kylie Quinn, a vaccine expert at RMIT University. \"Sometimes it happens after the first dose of AstraZeneca, whereas with Pfizer it seems to happen more often after the second dose,\" Dr Quinn said. There have also been [rare reports of heart inflammation](/news/2021-06-30/pfizer-covid-vaccine-links-to-heart-inflammation-information/100254282) (myocarditis) or inflammation of the heart membrane (pericarditis) after the second dose of Pfizer, though a causal link has not been established. Symptoms of these conditions include chest pain, shortness of breath and palpitations, but these are usually mild. As of 4 July, the TGA [received 38 reports](https://www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-safety-report-08-07-2021) of suspected myocarditis or pericarditis; 13 of these were men and 25 were women. This was out of approximately 3.2 million doses of Pfizer and most cases had recovered or were recovering, according to the TGA. \"The risk of getting myocarditis from COVID-19 is significantly higher than getting it from the vaccine,\" said Daryl Cheng, a clinical informatician and paediatrician who specialises in immunisation at the Royal Children's Hospital. Am I getting sick from the vaccine? While fever, headaches, and lethargy can make you want to call in sick, it's important to remember that vaccines don't infect you with COVID-19. Instead, they train your body to fight against the virus. For instance, the Pfizer vaccine uses a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic code that's involved in building the virus's spike protein, used by the virus to latch onto and enter human cells. When this piece of genetic material, called mRNA, enters human cells during the vaccination process, those cells \"read\" it like a blueprint and start making the virus's spike protein. The body then recognises those spike proteins as foreign, and produces antibodies that can fight a real virus infection down the track. Dr Cheng compares these antibodies to soldiers on the look-out for threats. \"It's like preparing to go to war,\" Dr Cheng said . \"The symptoms actually represent the body's preparation to fight.\" The downside of this immune activity is that it can also trigger systemic reactions such as fever, lethargy, and body aches and pains. But thankfully, these symptoms fade once the body has produced enough antibodies, Dr Cheng said. \"That's why we see after two to four days, some of the systemic reactions start to wear off,\" he said. Are side effects a sign of a strong immune system? While being stuck in bed for a day with a headache and fever is a sign that the vaccine is doing its job to trigger an immune response from your body, not experiencing any symptoms doesn't mean the opposite, Dr Quinn said. \"We have no direct correlation between how many symptoms someone gets and the strength of the body's immune response,\" Dr Cheng said. And while it isn't clear why the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines knock some people around more than others, age seems to play a role. A [recent survey](/news/health/2021-05-01/covid-19-pfizer-astrazeneca-vaccines-side-effects-study/100103326) of over 600,000 people in the UK who had received either one or two shots of Pfizer or a first dose of AstraZeneca found that younger people, women, and those who had previously had COVID-19 were more likely to report side effects after getting the jab. \"Younger people tend to react more strongly because their immune system is primed to respond to any potential introduction of the vaccine or the bug itself compared to older people,\" Dr Cheng said. The only exception is those who are on medications that suppress the immune system, such as chemotherapy and steroids. \"We expect that they may not actually get a response or many symptoms because their immune system has been artificially dampened by the medication or the treatment they're on,\" Dr Cheng said. Can exercise or painkillers reduce side effects? There have been some reports that exercising before getting jabbed can help stave off side effects, but Dr Quinn isn't so sure. \"Exercise can impact your overall immune stimulation level, but I don't think it's going to be a super reliable way of controlling these particular side effects,\" Dr Quinn said. It may also be tempting to take painkillers, such as paracetamol, before getting vaccinated to block any side effects from showing up in the first place. But the World Health Organization [advises against taking painkillers](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/advice) beforehand, as it isn't known whether they affect how well the vaccine works. Fortunately, it's perfectly fine to take painkillers after the jab to reduce uncomfortable symptoms, such as a sore arm and headache, Dr Cheng said. \"They really manage the symptoms and don't dampen the immune response itself,\" he said. Ms McGuire said that talking about the side effects you're experiencing can help other people know what to expect. \"I think sharing stories is really important,\" Ms McGuire said. \"Those expected side effects aren't something to be scared about. They're going to happen and they do just resolve.\" What should I do if I'm worried about side effects? Dr Cheng said it's important to call your GP or go to the emergency department if you're experiencing more serious side effects such as difficulty breathing and chest pain. And if you have a severe reaction to the first dose, your health provider can advise you about whether to go ahead with a second shot of Pfizer or to have the AstraZeneca vaccine instead. It's also important to report any unexpected side effects either directly to the TGA or to your state or territory health unit. This can be done on your behalf by your health professional, but there are a range of self-reporting options available. Unusual side effects can be [reported online](https://aems.tga.gov.au/) via the TGA website or you can call your local health department. AusVaxSafety also texts some patients three days after their the first or second dose of any COVID-19 vaccine with a link to a reporting platform. Reporting side effects is important because it helps health units build a better picture of adverse reactions people may experience after receiving the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines, Dr Cheng said. It can also help health units pick up on rare side effects that haven't been seen in clinical trials. \"The more people report, the more data we have to actively look for any potential side effects,\" Dr Cheng said.
