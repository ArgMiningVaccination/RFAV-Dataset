Hormones are chemicals produced by these glands that flow through the blood stream influencing how we think and feel. They govern the action and activity, strength and functioning of many of our organs and metabolic processes. As Patricia Davies states: \"A characteristic of hormones is that they influence body functions at a distance from the point of origin of the hormone. For this reason they are known as chemical messengers\". The balance of hormones is affected and influenced by many different factors, including: - Nutrition - vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, carbohydrates/sugars - Stimulants - caffeine, alcohol, recreational drugs - Medication - Exercise levels - Stress As far as aromatherapy is concerned, we tend to focus on using the essential oils' action on the emotions relating to certain conditions - as well as the conditions themselves, such as Pre-Menstrual Tension or Period Pain. Herbal Medicine - both Western and Chinese - uses the actual plant materials medicinal action to help restore hormonal balance. Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Nutritional Medicine can be great options for regulating hormonal fluctuations. For menopausal symptoms and hot flushes - one of the best herbal combinations I have come across is \"Menotune\" by \"Herbs Of Grace\" in Newmarket. Medication should be an absolute last resort, as there are so many side-effects, while Natural Medicine can offer such a range of safe, gentle and effective options. The hormonal system is vast in its various different influences - therefore it is often a holistic approach - a combination of therapies that can create the best results. As the Natural Medicine approach is also addressing the fundamental root causes of the issues - not merely alleviating the symptoms - the resolution of the issues is more likely to be long term. It is important to remember that symptoms are our body's way of communicating to us what it needs to redress the imbalances - so suppressing these indications can lead to more health issues in the future. Aromatherapy for balancing hormones Aromatherapy can help redress hormonal imbalances via a number of ways:- Stress Reduction Vaporising essential oils, aromatherapy baths, aromatherapy bath salts and aromatherapy massage can all help reduce the effects of adrenalin and cortisol - the fight or flight hormones produced by the adrenal glands. Massage also helps the body flush these chemicals out of the blood stream more efficiently, and can help to reduce stress related inflammation. Useful essential oils for relieving stress would include: [Lavender](https://www.baseformula.com/lavender-french-essential-oil), Neroli, Sandalwood, Benzoin, Patchouli, Vetiver, Jasmine, Ylang and Roman Chamomile. - Vaporise 2 drops [Neroli](https://www.baseformula.com/neroli-essential-oil), 4 Bergamot, 2 Sandalwood. - For a massage blend 30ml Sweet Almond Oil with 10 drops Lavender essential oil, 2 Neroli and 2 [Benzoin](https://www.baseformula.com/benzoin-50-dilution). Hormone Fluctuation Certain essential oils have constituent elements - phytohormones (plant hormones) - that mimic/reinforce the activity of certain human hormones. Aromatherapy oils such as [Geranium](https://www.baseformula.com/geranium-bourbon-essential-oil), Rose, Agnus Castus (not stocked by Base Formula), Palmarosa, Marjoram, Fennel and Clary Sage contain oestrogen like substances that help balance hormonal fluctuations and can therefore be helpful for PMT, menopause and period problems. - Massage oil for pre-menstrual tension: 30ml Grapeseed Oil, 6 drops Geranium, 2 Fennel, 2 Clary Sage and 2 Agnus Castus. - Alternatively you could try our [pre-blended essential oils](https://www.baseformula.com/aromatherapy/aromatherapy-blends/pre-blended-essential-oils)for PMT and the Menopause. Hormone ProductionSome phytohormones trigger or balance hormone production from certain glands. Essential oils such as Geranium, [Basil](https://www.baseformula.com/basil-linalol-essential-oil)and Rosemary stimulate the adrenal cortex, whilst Juniper and Eucalyptus can help reduce excessive blood sugar levels by their action on the pancreas. Stimulating Circulation & Detoxification Stimulating the circulation and detoxification process can help restore balance in various endocrinal activities following periods of intense stress, strain or shock. Essential oils such as [Lemon](https://www.baseformula.com/lemon-essential-oil), Juniper, Fennel, Geranium, Bergamot, Neroli, Thyme, Black Pepper and Ginger can help relieve bloating, joint and muscle pain, headaches, poor immunity and hormonal irregularities by helping rid the body of the after-effects of high stress levels.
