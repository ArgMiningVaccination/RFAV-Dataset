{"title": "Nicholson Chiropractic Health and Wellness - \"I gathered all vaccine ingredients into a list and contacted Poison Control. After intros and such, and asking to speak with someone tenured and knowledgeable, this is the gist of that conversation. Me: My question to you is how are these ingredients categorized? As benign or poison? (I ran a few ingredients, formaldehyde, Tween 80, mercury, aluminum, phenoxyethanol, potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, sorbitol, etc.) He: Well, that's quite a list... But I'd have to easily say that they're all toxic to humans... Used in fertilizers... Pesticides... To stop the heart... To preserve a dead body... They're registered with us in different categories, but pretty much poisons. Why? Me: If I were deliberately to feed or inject my child with these ingredients often, as a schedule, obviously I'd put my daughter in harm's way... But what would legally happen to me? He: Odd question... But you'd likely be charged with criminal negligence... perhaps with intent to kill... and of course child abuse... Your child would be taken away from you... Do you know of someone's who's doing this to their child? This is criminal... Me: An industry... These are the ingredients used in vaccines... With binding agents to make sure the body won't flush these out... To keep the antibody levels up indefinitely... He: WHAT?! Your conclusion? The man was beside himself. He asked if I would email him all this information. He wanted to share it with his adult kids who are parents. He was horrified and felt awful he didn't know... his kids are vaccinated and they have health issues...\" ~ By Iris Figueroa  INGREDIENTS TO VACCINES - You CANNOT make an educated decision without being educated. Here are just SOME vaccine ingredients. These are being INJECTED into your kids; Formaldehyde/Formalin - Highly toxic systematic poison and carcinogen. Betapropiolactone - Toxic chemical and carcinogen. May cause death/permanant injury after very short exposure to small quantities. Corrosive chemical. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide - May cause damage to the liver, cardiovascular system, and central nervous system. May cause reproductive effects and birth defects. Aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, and aluminum salts - Neurotoxin. Carries risk for long term brain inflammation/swelling, neurological disorders, autoimmune disease, Alzheimer's, dementia, and autism. It penetrates the brain where it persists indefinitely. Thimerosal (mercury) - Neurotoxin. Induces cellular damage, reduces oxidation-reduction activity, cellular degeneration, and cell death. Linked to neurological disorders, Alzheimer's, dementia, and autism. Polysorbate 80 & 20 - Trespasses the Blood-Brain Barrier and carries with it aluminum, thimerosal, and viruses; allowing it to enter the brain. Glutaraldehyde - Toxic chemical used as a disinfectant for heat sensitive medical equipment. Fetal Bovine Serum - Harvested from bovine (cow) fetuses taken from pregnant cows before slaughter. Human Diploid Fibroblast Cells - aborted fetal cells. Foreign DNA has the ability to interact with our own. African Green Monkey Kidney Cells - Can carry the SV-40 cancer-causing virus that has already tainted about 30 million Americans. Acetone - Can cause kidney, liver, and nerve damage. E.Coli - Yes, you read that right. DNA from porcine (pig) Circovirus type-1 Human embryonic lung cell cultures (from aborted fetuses) You can view all of these ingredients on the CDCs website. I encourage everyone to do their own research. Look up the MSDS on these chemicals. Read the thousands of peer reviewed studies that have evaluated the biological consequences these chemicals can have on the body, especially when being injected.

I have reasearched all of this. Chapter 10 in my book Victorious Mother. www.VictoriousMother.com Please set aside 30 minutes to look up vaccine ingredients. If you already have a copy of my book, start on page 230 and pay close attention to the chart on page 233. Infant deaths have DROPPED 30 PERCENT since covid began? Why? Because \"well baby checks\" are vaccine  appointments and those aren't taking place right now.
