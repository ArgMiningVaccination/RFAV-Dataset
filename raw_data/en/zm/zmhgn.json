This rule provides procedures by which policies, rules and procedures which govern the operation of the NMSU system will be developed, reviewed and officially adopted. As used in the ARP, the term \"rule\" also refers to and includes procedures. The RPM and the ARP may be viewed or downloaded from the web at rpm.nmsu.edu and arp.nmsu.edu respectively. The regulatory activities of the NMDA, undertaken in accordance with the State Rules Act, NMSA 1978, \u00a7 14-4-1 et seq., are outside the scope of this rule. Departmental or unit directives which relate only to internal unit operations are not subject to the development, review and approval requirements of ARP 1.10, and do not govern the activities of any individual, department or unit external to that unit. Internal unit rules and procedures must not violate nor be inconsistent with any provision of the RPM or the ARP. PART 2: AUTHORITY TO INITIATE POLICY OR RULE PROPOSALS Any individual or NMSU entity may propose a new or revised policy or rule for consideration. This \"Proposal Sponsor\" is responsible for shepherding the proposal through the procedural steps as described in this rule. 1/8 08/25/2020 1.10 - Procedures to Revise NMSU Policies and RulesPART 3: POLICY OR RULE ADMINISTRATOR Policy and rule proposals must specify one individual by position to serve as the policy or rule administrator. Typically, the policy or rule administrator is the person most involved in implementation of the policy or rule, has the greatest subject matter expertise, or supervises multiple departments that each have a role in administering the policy or rule. PART 4: SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF POLICY OR RULE Each policy and rule must specify the scope of its application, in the details section of the online RPM or ARP. While most policies and rules will apply NMSU system-wide, some may have a more limited scope (e.g. community colleges only, NMSU-Las Cruces campus only). If a proposal does not specify its scope, that determination will be made by UGC. PART 5: ROLE OF OFFICE OF UNIVERSITY GENERAL COUNSEL (UGC) UGC will advise and assist proposal sponsors with initial proposal development and the approval process. UGC is responsible for updating and maintaining the official RPM and the ARP, including making these records available on the NMSU website and documenting the revision history for each policy and rule. UGC will make the forms and templates referenced by this rule available on its website. UGC may provide comment on any proposal at any stage in the policy development and formal approval process. PART 6: DEVELOPMENT, REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS Proposals for new or amended polices or rules are subject to the following:2/8 08/25/2020 1.10 - Procedures to Revise NMSU Policies and RulesA. Preliminary Review by Policy Administrator and UGC : To initiate a proposal for a new or amended policy or rule, the proposal sponsor will send the proposal with a review track form (RTF), summarizing the proposal and rationale, to UGC and to the policy or rule administrator for initial review. Both the policy or rule administrator and UGC will provide preliminary advice and feedback to the proposal sponsor. UGC and/or the policy/rule administrator may elect to attach a comment memo to the RTF in support of or in opposition to the proposal. Throughout the review and approval process, the RTF together with the proposal and any and all comments by reviewers constitute the \"proposal packet\". 3/8 08/25/2020 1.10 - Procedures to Revise NMSU Policies and RulesB. Review Assignments : Following the preliminary review, upon approval from the proposal sponsor, UGC will transmit the proposal packet to members of the Assignment Advisory Group (AAG) for consideration at its next meeting. The AAG is comprised of the Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, the chair and vice chair of the Faculty Senate, and the chancellor. Decisions of the AAG will be made by majority vote; with the chancellor's vote controlling in the event of a tie. A representative from UGC attends all AAG meetings to record its assignments on the RTF. At the meeting, the AAG will make review assignments as follows: 1. The AAG assigns the proposal to either the academic track or the administrative track for review and comment as outlined in Sections D, E and F below. Proposals within the legislative jurisdiction of the Faculty Senate under RPM 1.70, as well as other proposals where the AAG may determine that the Faculty Senate legislative process is appropriate, are assigned to the academic track for review. All other proposals are assigned to the administrative track. The assigned review track is noted on the RTF. Nothing in this rule regulates or alters the Faculty Senate process for review and adoption of Faculty Senate propositions. 2. The AAG also determines which NMSU entities will be notified of the proposal and the opportunity to review and make recommendations. The UGC representative notes the review assignments on the RTF. 3. Following the AAG meeting, UGC will post the proposals and RTF forms on a document sharing website (UGC SharePoint) open to all NMSU constituents. 4. Proposals for minor changes with minimal impact on NMSU operations and those which require urgent adoption may be immediately approved by the Chancellor on a provisional basis and assigned for subsequent direct review by only the UAC. 4/8 08/25/2020 1.10 - Procedures to Revise NMSU Policies and RulesC. Academic Track Proposals : In addition to the other approval procedures described in this rule, proposals assigned to the academic track are subject to the following rules: 1. The proposal sponsor is responsible for identifying at least one willing faculty senator sponsor (FS Sponsor) who will be responsible for coordinating the review and comment process described in Section F. below, and for communicating to UGC the actions taken by the Faculty Senate's committees and Faculty Senate at large. The Faculty Senate Chair and Vice-Chair will assist in this process as needed. 2. Faculty Senate propositions affecting NMSU System policies may be brought into the ARP 1.10 approval process before, during or after enactment in the Faculty Senate. For proposals initiated under this rule, the Faculty Senate may postpone its review until after the assigned review groups have had an opportunity to comment and the proposal sponsor has incorporated changes as deemed appropriate 3. Unless the chancellor otherwise authorizes, an academic track proposal may not be submitted to the UAC for a second read or vote until approved by the Faculty Senate. 4. Academic track proposals will be submitted to UAC for second read in the form approved by Faculty Senate. If the UAC recommends veto or recommends amendment to a Faculty Senate approved proposal, then the Faculty Senate chair and vice chair will decide whether to forward the proposition to the Chancellor for a decision as recommended by the UAC, or to withdraw the proposal for reconsideration by the Faculty Senate. D. Administrative Track Proposals : Policy and rule proposals assigned to the administrative track do not require formal faculty senate legislation, but may be referred by the AAG to the Faculty Senate for review and comment. E. Review and Comment Period : Both academic track and administrative track policy and rule proposals will be subject to a review and comment period, which will be conducted as follows: 1. Following the AAG meeting, UGC will submit the proposals to the UAC for first read, usually at the UAC's next meeting. The review and comment period commences from the date of the first read. If no review groups were assigned at by the AAG, then UAC may vote to shorten or waive the review and comment period and/or may vote to waive second read.5/8 08/25/2020 1.10 - Procedures to Revise NMSU Policies and Rules2. UGC notifies the leadership of the assigned review groups (as identified on the RTF) of the assignment and the availability of the proposal packet for review through the UGC SharePoint. The proposal sponsor or designee may arrange to present the proposal to any of the review groups, and review groups may request a presentation. The reviews may be conducted in any order. Each assigned review group with comments or recommended edits uploads the group's collective comments through the UGC SharePoint for consideration by the proposal sponsor and UGC. Any NMSU constituent may also upload comments to the UGC SharePoint. 3. The review period deadline will be calculated by UGC and noted on the RTF. The period will typically be approximately 6 six weeks in duration, unless a shorter review period is authorized at first read by UAC. Upon request and justification from any interested constituent, the review and comment period may be extended by the chancellor or by vote of the UAC. 4. At the conclusion of the review and comment period, the proposal sponsor and UGC will confer regarding suggested edits and changes to the proposal and will prepare a final version of the proposal. In the event the proposal is modified during or following the review and comment process, the revised version will be uploaded to the UGC SharePoint prior to release of the UAC agenda for the meeting in which the proposal will receive second read. Where an administrative track proposal is modified significantly, the UGC and Proposal Sponsor may agree to extend the review period and submit the proposal to the assigned review groups for a second review. UAC may also vote to direct the sponsor to submit the revised proposal for a second review period. If re-review is required, UGC will notify the leaders of the assigned review groups. 5. Once the review period has concluded, for administrative track proposals, UGC will submit the proposal for inclusion on the agenda of the next UAC meeting for second read. When appropriate, the UAC agenda will indicate that substantive revisions were made to the proposal. For academic track proposals, UGC will notify the Faculty Senate chair and confer on the timing for Faculty Senate consideration.6/8 08/25/2020 1.10 - Procedures to Revise NMSU Policies and RulesF. UAC Recommendation : All policy and rule proposals will be submitted for review and recommendation by the UAC. Absent a vote waiving the first or second read, the proposal will receive two readings at UAC following assignment by the AAG. After the review and comment period, the proposal will be placed on the UAC agenda for second read and a vote on whether to recommend approval to the chancellor, unless processed otherwise, in accordance with the procedures set forth above. G. Chancellor Approval or Veto; RPM and ARP Maintenance 1. Upon consideration of the recommendations of the UAC and other reviewing entities, the chancellor may approve or veto the proposal. The chancellor will indicate that decision in writing for record retention purposes. RPM 1.70 will govern in any situation in which an academic track rule or policy proposal, formally approved as a faculty senate proposition, is vetoed or otherwise not acted upon by the chancellor. 2. The final proposal and the record of the Chancellor's decision to approve or veto will be maintained by UGC, or the library archives, for record retention purposes. 3. In the case of rule proposals, after approval by the chancellor, UGC will revise the ARP. UGC will also submit a summary of ARP revisions as an informational item for placement on the agenda for a regular meeting of the Board of Regents. 4. In the case of policy proposals, after approval by the chancellor, UGC will submit the proposal for placement on the meeting agenda for the Board of Regents. Upon approval by the Board of Regents, UGC will make the approved changes and additions to the RPM.

This rule provides guidance relating to the organizational structure of administrative units including levels of management and supervisory span of control and provides the process to make an organizational change. PART 2: ORGANIZATIONAL GUIDELINES A.Levels of Management : Unless an exception justifies otherwise, administrative units should have no more than three levels of management. The chancellor, the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs and the senior vice president for administration and finance are not counted as a management level (i.e. considered to be at Management Level 0). Direct reports to the chancellor and provost and senior vice president for academic affairs (deans, vice presidents, associate provosts, etc.) are considered Level 1 Managers. B.Supervisory Span of Control : Employees with managerial/supervisory responsibilities should have 8-12 direct reports. PART 3: PROCEDURES 1/3 08/25/2020 2.10 - Administrative Unit Change Process A. Initiation of Proposal 1. A head of an administrative unit or higher-level administrator may propose organizational changes (proposer). 2. The proposal for reorganization must clearly explain the rationale supporting the change, and justify any deviation from the above guidelines or any unit elimination or relocation. The proposal must include current and proposed organizational charts, to assist in clarifying how the involved unit(s) will be affected by the proposed change. Solid lines will indicate administrative reporting lines; dotted lines will indicate dual functional reporting lines. See Regents Policy 2.00 -Organizational Charts and Reporting Relationships . 3. The cognizant vice president or equivalent must approve the proposal before it is submitted to the assistant vice president for human resource services. 4. Once the cognizant vice president or equivalent approves the proposal, the proposer submits it to the assistant vice president for human resource services. B. Review and Approval of Minor Changes : Basic organizational changes internal to the unit, which do not impact other units and do not deviate from the above guidelines or propose elimination or relocation of any administrative unit, will be reviewed by and become effective upon approval of the assistant vice president for human resource services. C. Review and Approval of Major Changes : An organizational change that is not consistent with the above guidelines or that proposes to eliminate or relocate an administrative unit is considered a major organization change and requires approval of the chancellor, after review and recommendation of the assistant vice president for human resource services. Prior to forwarding the proposal to the chancellor, the proposer will work with the assistant vice president for human resource services in an effort to maintain the integrity of the university's guidelines on levels of management and supervisory span of control, or to document justification for an exception, as well as to coordinate with other affected units. The proposed change becomes effective upon approval of the chancellor, who will notify the assistant vice president for human resource services.2/3 08/25/2020 2.10 - Administrative Unit Change Process D. Implementation of Organizational Change : The assistant vice president for human resource services will notify the proposer and other affected units of any approved change. Once the proposal is approved, the proposer or appropriate unit director will complete and submit any required personnel action forms and revised organizational charts, as may be directed by the Office of Human Resource Services.

PART 2: REVIEWS/RECOMMENDATIONS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED Any proposal to create, reorganize, relocate or eliminate an academic unit must be submitted for review and recommendation by the Faculty Senate, the Academic Deans Council, and the Chancellor to the Board of Regents for their consideration and action. PART 3: INITIATION OF PROPOSAL TO CREATE, REORGANIZE, RELOCATE OR ELIMINATE AN ACADEMIC UNIT Proposals to create, reorganize, relocate, or eliminate an academic unit formally originate with a bill submitted to the Faculty Senate. The proposed legislation shall follow the procedure specified in Faculty Senate Constitution ARTICLE IX Propositions for Consideration of the Constitution of the Faculty Senate, except that no such proposal will be considered as emergency legislation. 1/5 08/25/2020 2.15 - Modifying Academic Units PART 4: EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGE If approved, the creation of a department will be effective either January 1 or July 1 following the approval.

The form must be submitted with all relevant documentation attached no later than November 30 (for January 1 effective date) and May 31 (for July 1 effective date). PART 6: CREATION OF NEW COLLEGES The creation of a new college is a decision based on the weighing of a number of criteria, including those below. An attitude of flexibility, reality, and organizational feasibility should be maintained in applying these criteria. The structure of the entire university, if a new college is formed, is an important consideration. A. There should be a documented professional need for the college in the state and region. 1. Rationale: This can be expressed through increasing student enrollment in programs that would be part of the new college, or an obvious need for professional graduates of the college as expressed by state and local groups who desire to hire these professions. B. The proposed college should be of a recognized profession or group of disciplines. 1. Rationale: The new college should give a desirable added professional recognition and development in the area of the new college.2/5 08/25/2020 2.15 - Modifying Academic Units C. At the outset, the new college shall have a minimum student enrollment of 250 with demonstrated ability to reach an enrollment of 500 within a 3- to 5-year period and a sufficient number of faculty to make it a viable administrative unit within the university. 1. Rationale: After several development years, the quantity of faculty and students should be sufficient to lend themselves to a quality of organization, instruction, and service that will provide a viable thrust to the university. The quality and quantity of the faculty in the proposed college should be capable of maintaining with distinction an academic undergraduate and graduate program. D. The university must be willing to make the commitment to furnish financial support for an additional college. 1. Rationale: This should include an adequate budget to provide for an expanding staff at the college level and funds for additional housing at a professional level. PART 7: CHANGING A DEPARTMENT OR GROUP OF DEPARTMENTS INTO A SCHOOL The proposed school should incorporate more than one area of specialization or should offer more than one degree (may include interdisciplinary cooperative efforts or more than one department). The proposed school should be an administrative and support unit with undergraduates and graduate students and an established, nationally recognized teaching and research program. The administrative head of a school may be called a chair, a head, or a director, but this person's administrative level will be equal to that of a department head. The legislation must contain a clearly stated and convincing justification for the name change, and must have support of the department and college faculty and administration. PART 8: NEW ACADEMIC UNIT3/5 08/25/2020 2.15 - Modifying Academic Units There should be a documented academic/educational need for the proposed new academic unit, including but not limited to, an increasing student enrollment or significant employment opportunities for graduates in that field. The proposed new academic unit should be consistent with the mission of the university and the college in which it will be located. There should be sufficient faculty and resources to staff the proposed new academic unit. PART 9: RELOCATION OR REORGANIZING AN ACADEMIC UNIT Proposals to relocate an academic unit must meet all of the following criteria: A. The relocation will produce a more homogenous set of programs and departments in both colleges. B. The relocation will enhance the professional identity of the program or department involved C. The relocation will not cause undue hardship for other academic units. D. The faculty and administrators directly affected are in agreement. E. Such a change will better serve the university community, clients, and/or the mission of the university. F. Address the transfer of resources, courses taught, and the faculty rank and tenure (or years to tenure) of those individuals being transferred. G. If a unit is being relocated to another college, there should be significant support from the unit being transferred and the unit receiving the transferred personnel/resources. PART 10: ELIMINATION OF AN ACADEMIC UNIT Proposals to eliminate an academic unit must meet the following criteria: A. A significant decline in enrollment, either as measured by number of majors or student credit hours. B. The resources are needed by programs or departments with much higher enrollment or student credit hour production.4/5 08/25/2020 2.15 - Modifying Academic Units C. In evaluating a proposal to eliminate an academic unit, the unit's contribution in the areas of teaching, research, and service shall be considered.

New Mexico State University is committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethics and integrity in all of its academic and administrative operations, by promoting such standards among its regents, administrators, faculty, staff, students and others acting on behalf of the university (including those acting on behalf of university controlled entities) and by striving to ensure a level of accountability appropriate for a public institution. A. Members of the university community are expected to exercise and demonstrate personal and professional honesty and to respect the rights, values and contributions of others. B. Members of the university community are expected to be aware of and comply with relevant laws, regulations, contract requirements and university policies and procedures. An unethical practice should never be condoned on the grounds that it is \"customary\" or that it serves a worthy goal. C. Individuals with access to confidential, proprietary or private information must never use or disclose such information except where authorized or legally obligated to do so. D. All members of the university community are responsible for avoiding, where possible, real or potential conflicts of interest and commitment between personal and professional responsibilities, including relationships that have the appearance of a conflict. E. The university's interests should be foremost in all official decision making and employees and others acting on behalf of the university shall remove themselves from decision-making roles that involve them in any personal capacity or which involve their friends or family members.1/2 08/25/2020 3.00 - Ethical Conduct Required in all NMSU Operations F.

Such conflicts may compromise or have the appearance of compromising the integrity of university-related activities and have unforeseen effects on those activities. Even if there is no perceptible effect on the activity, any apparent inability of the university to avoid and/or resolve conflicts of interest invites outside criticism and supervision. Such supervision could result in the loss of the university's ability to decide its own direction. Conflicts of interest may be primarily financial or may involve the use of one's position and powers for non-monetary self-interest. Such conflicts may be personal or relate primarily to the institution or its constituent organizations or involve an individual whose behavior is inextricably linked with her or his official position, such as an upper-level administrator or a member of the Board of Regents. In any of these situations, the general principles remain the same; 1) disclose always, 2) manage when possible; and 3) prohibit when necessary and where management is not possible. 1.Disclose Always: It is vitally important that individuals provide a clear picture of their activities and complete forms accurately and in a factually correct manner so that potential or actual conflicts of interest can be identified. Similarly, if situations change, disclosure needs to be made within 15 working days ( see ARP3.03 ). The university is under no obligation to manage, as opposed to prohibit, a conflict of interest disclosed by someone other than the individuals primarily involved. 1/7 08/25/2020 3.02 - Principles, Definitions and Examples Relating to Conflict of Interest/Commitment2. Manage when possible: The vast majority of conflicts can and are managed through removing at least one of the parties from the conflict situation. For example, an individual might recuse him or herself from the review process on a proposal, have another individual become principal investigator or abstain from participating in a particular promotion or tenure situation. The preference of the institution will be to provide management solutions to a conflict of interest that will remove or isolate the conflict. However, such management is not possible when disclosure is not made. 3. Prohibit when necessary and where management is not possible: In some few cases, it will not be possible to manage a conflict and the individual or organization will have to withdraw from the activity. In some cases, university policy or rules and/or state or federal law allows no solution other than prohibition. For example, no member of the Board of Regents may act as a vendor of goods or services to the university (Board of Regents Bylaws and Section 21-1-35, NMSA 1978). PART 2: DEFINITIONS AND ILLUSTRATIONS The definitions and examples listed below are intended to aid university employees and appropriate review bodies in identifying conflicts of interest. Identifying conflict situations and documenting steps taken to manage these conflicts serve to protect the employees and the institution, as well as ensure that the university will remain eligible for government sponsored research. A. Conflicts of Commitment Full-time faculty and staff of New Mexico State University owe their primary professional allegiance and their primary commitment of time and intellectual efforts to the education, research and service programs of NMSU. Conflicts of commitment occur whenever the time devoted to external activities adversely affects a faculty or staff member's capacity to undertake NMSU responsibilities, including maintaining appropriate time and accessibility as defined by the requirements of the job.2/7 08/25/2020 3.02 - Principles, Definitions and Examples Relating to Conflict of Interest/Commitment1. Examples of conflicts of commitment may include but are not limited to : a. Maintaining full-time paid employment at another institution/organization that interferes with work performance and/or attendance. ( See ARP 6.90 - Outside Employment orActivities ) b.

Preparing chapters, textbooks or monographs related to teaching, research or service activities, even if paid royalties as an author or editor. e. Occasional lectures, colloquia or seminars to disseminate results of university -related teaching, research or service activities. f. Holding an office in a professional society. B. Conflicts of Interest Conflicts of interest occur when there is a competition between a member of the university community's private interests and the member's professional obligations to the university such that an independent observer might reasonably question whether the member's professional actions or decisions are determined by any considerations other than the interests of the university. 3/7 08/25/2020 3.02 - Principles, Definitions and Examples Relating to Conflict of Interest/Commitment1. Examples of conflicts of interest may include but are not limited to a. The presence of a real or apparent incentive for the faculty or staff member to decide an issue in such a way as to have the opportunity for a financial interest in the result. b. A faculty or staff member having a significant financial interest in a concern that is in direct competition with the interests of NMSU. c. Procuring goods or services for NMSU from a concern in which an NMSU regent, administrator, faculty or staff member or member of their family has a significant financial interest. d. Using NMSU resources or staff for non-NMSU projects or granting external entities access to the same, in more than an incidental way, unless permission has been given and the activity benefits the university. e. Reviewing proposals or bids from family members, or those with whom the faculty or staff member has a close, professional relationship, or from an entity in which the faculty or staff member has a significant financial or management interest. 2. Examples of permitted activities may include but are not limited to 1. Serving as principal investigator or co-investigator on a multi- institutional project where NMSU is a participating member. 2. Permitting access to NMSU resources as part of licensing agreements or as part of statutory permitted activities. C.

The primary means of doing this is through the completion of the Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form upon hire and on an annual basis, with disclosure updates submitted on the basis of changes in circumstance. Additional policies, as set forth in ARP 3.11, are applicable to conflicts arising from sponsored activities but are based upon the annual disclosure requirement. PART 1: PROCEDURE Each person covered by this Rule is required to complete, sign and submit a Conflict of Interest Disclosure form upon hire with any NMSU entity; as new conflicts arise during employment by NMSU; and on an annual basis as requested by the Office of Human Resource Services. Completed forms will be reviewed and approved by the applicable supervisor (and only require next level supervisor review as defined below). Disclosure forms submitted containing no conflicts require only one level of review and approval. Disclosure forms submitted containing one or more (real or perceived) conflicts of interest require two levels of review and approval. In addition, a plan to manage or eliminate the conflict(s) must be submitted. If a conflict of interest or commitment exists for which no management plan is possible, the supervisor is required to recommend a plan of action. Conflicts of interest and commitment that have been submitted may be reviewed by the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities as necessary. Maintenance of the form is the responsibility of the Office of Human Resource Services.1/4 08/25/2020 3.03 - Continuing Duty to Disclose Conflicts; Paths Toward Remedies PART 2: REMEDIES FOR CONFLICTS There are two basic conditions that influence the path taken to remedy a conflict of interest or commitment. These may be summed up in the questions: 1) did the conflict arise as part of a sponsored activity? and 2) who disclosed the conflict? These questions must be asked together, as a conflict may be self-disclosed or disclosed by others and may or may not arise as part of a sponsored activity. A. The first question that determines disposition of conflicts of interest and/or commitment is whether or not the conflict arises from a sponsored activity. 1. The treatment of conflicts in non-sponsored activities will follow normal personnel procedures as outlined in ARP 3.25 Part 1 and ARP 10.01 - Due Process , drawing informally on the advice of the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities as desired. 2. Resolution of conflicts arising from sponsored activities shall be governed by the procedures set forth in ARP 3.11. 2/4 08/25/2020 3.03 - Continuing Duty to Disclose Conflicts; Paths Toward Remedies B. The second question is whether the individual(s) involved in the conflict made the disclosure prospectively or as part of a timely update, or whether someone else has brought the conflict to the university's attention. 1. In cases disclosed by the individual(s) having the conflict, the university will generally try to manage the conflict in a manner agreeable to the parties involved and in agreement with applicable university policies and state and federal laws. The person(s) identified as having the conflict may elect to manage the conflict by participating in measures that will guard the integrity of the situation. Such measures require the approval of the relevant dean, vice president or vice provost or (in the case of sponsored activities, the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities). The person(s) involved may choose or be told to withdraw from the activity or situation that creates the conflict. In some cases, the supervisor and appropriate dean, vice president or vice provost and, if applicable, the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities, shall approve the action taken. 2. When someone other than the individual(s) involved in the conflict brings an existing conflict to the attention of the university, the university is under no obligation to try to remedy the conflict and may require that the individual(s) withdraw from the activity or situation creating the conflict. In addition, the individual(s) may be required to repay monies that have been obtained in a situation involving a conflict of interest or commitment. Other sanctions up to and including termination of an individual's employment, may be imposed; subject to the appeals process outlined in ARP 10.50 (faculty) or ARP 10.20 (staff).

Persons in this status who are seeking degrees or certificates must demonstrate that the potential for conflict of interest will not compromise the quality of their program of study. Approval of cognizant department heads and deans will be required. In any case, supervisors should never have the responsibility of grading individuals whom they supervise. In the case of graduate degrees or certificates, such programs must also be approved on a case-by-case basis by the dean of the Graduate School with the concurrence of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. When appropriate, the dean may confer with the Graduate Council about the potential for conflict of interest in such programs. The graduate dean may require a specific representative on such a graduate committee, possibly including off campus representatives, as a condition for approving programs.

An example of such a request would be for a supervisor, including a faculty member, to ask that a subordinate nominate the supervisor or anyone else for an award. Another example might be suggesting that a subordinate purchase something to support a school activity of the supervisor's child.

The principles, definitions and policy or rule statements set forth in RPM 3.00 - Conflict of Interest - Ethical Conductand ARP 3.02 - Principles, Definitions and Examples relating to Conflicts of Interest/Commitment apply also to this rule, ARP 3.11 - Conflicts of Interest and Commitment in Sponsored Activities. Specific guidance on conflicts of interest in sponsored activities is set forth below. PART 1: CONFLICTS THAT ARISE FROM FINANCIAL INTERESTS Actual or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment in sponsored activities generally arise when an investigator or family member has a significant financial interest in, or a consulting arrangement with, a private business concern or other organization that is or may be affected by the sponsored activity. Some examples of this kind of conflict situation include, but are not limited to: A. Engaging for sponsored research a business firm in which the investigator or family member involved in the research project has a significant financial interest. B. Purchasing major equipment, instruments, materials or other items for sponsored research from a private firm in which the investigator involved in the research has a significant financial interest.1/6 08/25/2020 3.11 - Conflicts of Interest/Commitment in Sponsored Activities C. Engaging a private consulting firm in connection with sponsored research where the investigator involved in such research has a consulting arrangement with or significant financial interest in a competing consulting firm. D. Acceptance by an investigator involved in a sponsored research project of gratuities or special favors from a firm or other organization with which the university does business in connection with the sponsored research. E. Utilization of privileged information acquired by an investigator in connection with sponsored research for personal gain, or to economically benefit a business concern in which the investigator or family member has a significant financial interest. F. Sponsorship of research by a business firm in which an investigator involved in the research has a significant financial interest. G. In the absence of disclosure and express sponsor approval, employment of, or an offer of employment to, a family member of an investigator involved in sponsored research by either the sponsor of, or an organization engaged in, the research project. H. Receipt by a family member of an investigator involved in a sponsored activity of a scholarship, fellowship, work/study benefit, or other financial aid, which is funded by or through the sponsored activity. PART 2: CONFLICTS THAT ARISE FROM PERSONAL INTERESTS An actual or perceived conflict of interest or commitment may also arise from situations that may have a significant impact on an investigator involved in sponsored research, even though the situation does not involve a significant financial interest. These non-financial conflict situations frequently involve personal interests or relationships that are or may be affected by sponsored activities. Some examples are: A. An investigator's involvement in a sponsored activity where the investigator or a family member of the investigator acts as a non-paid advisor to, or board member of, the sponsoring entity. B. An investigator's involvement in a sponsored activity in which a family member is engaged as a human subject, student researcher or other non-paid participant.2/6 08/25/2020 3.11 - Conflicts of Interest/Commitment in Sponsored Activities C. An investigator's involvement in a sponsored activity that includes testing and validation of new technology developed by a family member of the investigator. PART 3: OTHER CONFLICT SITUATIONS It is important to realize that any number of other kinds of conflict situations can arise in the context of sponsored projects, some of which may be undeterminable at the outset of the project. Investigators involved in sponsored activities must be cognizant of the need to monitor project developments in order to identify potential or perceived conflict situations as they arise and to disclose them or facilitate their disclosure as soon as possible. Examples of other kinds of conflict situations might include: A. An investigator's involvement in a sponsored research project becomes so extensive during the course of the project that other obligations to the university are neglected, thus creating a conflict of commitment. B. An investigator's responsibility for multi-disciplinary sponsored research project gives rise to nepotism issues when a family member employed in a different university department falls under the investigator's supervisory authority in the context of the project and no disclosure of and express sponsor approval for such arrangement is in place. C. An investigator's loyalty to a family member ( See ARP 3.02 Part 2, Section E Relationships), close personal friend or a professional associate employed elsewhere results in sponsored research being conducted elsewhere which could and ordinarily would be conducted within the university, to the disadvantage of the university and its legitimate interests. PART 4: GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO CONFLICTS 3/6 08/25/2020 3.11 - Conflicts of Interest/Commitment in Sponsored Activities Any research or other project that is sponsored or funded by a governmental agency is likely to be subject to agency regulations or guidelines covering conflicts of interest as well as university policies. A. The federal Office of Management and Budget has promulgated rules, applicable to all federally funded grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, which define conflicts of interest and the financial thresholds applicable to them and which require grant recipients to maintain written standards of conduct governing real or apparent conflicts of interest. These rules are found in OMB Circular No. A-110, Sec. 42 . Most federal departments and independent agencies have formally adopted these rules and codified them in various sections of the Code of Federal Regulations . A few agencies have adopted supplementary conflict of interest guidelines applicable to their own grant administration procedures. B. Two agencies, the National Science Foundation and the Public Health Service, have established specific financial disclosure requirements and disclosure review and conflict of interest management procedures applicable to grants from those agencies. The guidelines and requirements set forth in this rule ARP 3.11 - Conflicts of Interest and Commitment in Sponsored Activities are intended to implement and comply with these federal conflict of interest rules, so that compliance with this university Rule will generally assure compliance with governmental requirements. C. Investigators are, however, urged to familiarize themselves with the conflict of interest rules adopted by agencies sponsoring their research activities. PART 5: DUTY TO DISCLOSE ACTUAL/POTENTIAL CONFLICTS; PROCEDURES A. Each person engaged in an area of sponsored research and covered by this Rule is responsible for determining whether any actual, potential or apparent conflict of interest or commitment exists.4/6 08/25/2020 3.11 - Conflicts of Interest/Commitment in Sponsored Activities B. The principal investigator of each specific sponsored activity, in consultation with all other participants in the activity, is responsible for determining whether any possible conflicts exist with respect to such activity and for so indicating on the New Mexico State University Proposal Award Form submitted to the Office of the Vice President for Research at the time approval for such activity is sought. C. If any possible conflicts are identified, the person or persons having the conflicts should attempt to resolve them in advance of submitting the activity proposal for review and approval, but in any event must concurrently disclose them for review by the Conflict of Interest Committee during the pre-award process. D. Disclosure shall be made by submitting the individual's current annual Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form with the approval documentation provided to the Office of the Vice President for Research. E. If a new conflict of interest or commitment arises during the course of sponsored work, the person having such conflict must submit an updated disclosure form. F. The Office of the Vice President for Research shall furnish the forms disclosing possible conflicts to the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities.

Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities The Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities shall be a standing committee consisting of the vice president for research, the director of a college/unit research center or institute director designated by the vice president for research and three faculty members appointed by the vice president for research and approved by the Faculty Senate. One member of the committee shall not be involved in sponsored research. B. Committee Authority and Functions 1. The Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities shall meet as necessary to review all disclosure statements and decide in each instance whether: a. There is no potential conflict of interest; or b. There was a conflict of interest, which has since been resolved; or c. There is a conflict of interest that has not been resolved. 2. In making these determinations, the committee, at its discretion and under conditions of confidentiality, may seek the advice of additional persons. 3. The committee will exercise care at all times to ensure confidentiality and to protect the safety and privacy of persons involved in or affected by the review. 1/4 08/25/2020 3.12 - Procedures to Resolve COI Relating to Sponsored Activities4. If the committee determines that there is an unresolved conflict of interest: a. The appropriate dean, vice president or vice provost will be notified; b. The committee will work with the affected principal investigator and other key personnel, including affected departmental personnel, to determine how the conflict should be managed so the sponsored activity can proceed if at all possible; and c. Acceptance of an award for the affected sponsored activity will be delayed pending resolution of the conflict. 5. In order to effectively manage or remedy a conflict of interest, the committee may impose conditions or restrictions to control, reduce or eliminate the possibility that the conflict will affect the objectivity of the sponsored research or other activity. Examples of conflict of interest management options include: a. Public disclosure of the conflict. b. Divestiture of conflicting financial interests or placement in a blind trust. c. Escrow of a conflicting equity interest until appropriate triggering conditions are met. d. Disqualification of the conflicted individual from management, supervisory or other affected responsibilities for the sponsored activity. e. Prohibition of the conflicted individual's involvement in affected aspects of the research or other activity. f. Severance of business relationships that create the conflict. g. Monitoring of research or other affected activities by independent reviewers. PART 2: APPEALS FROM DECISION CONCERNING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARISING FROM SPONSORED ACTIVITIES A sponsored activity may not be accepted in the event that the committee is unable to fashion a remedy for a specific conflict of interest and the conflict remains unresolved. In such case, the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities will notify the appropriate dean, vice president or vice provost. Appeal of the decision to not accept an award or to accept it subject to conditions in furtherance of a specific management plan, may be2/4 08/25/2020 3.12 - Procedures to Resolve COI Relating to Sponsored Activitiesmade to the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, who will consult with the principal investigator and the Committee on Conflicts of Interest in Sponsored Activities prior to making a final determination. A final determination on appeal of a conflict of interest decision will be made within 30 days of the date the appeal was taken. A final determination on appeal shall be achieved before the university accepts a sponsored activity. PART 3: RETENTION OF RECORDS CONCERNING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN SPONSORED ACTIVITIES The Office of the Vice President for Research will maintain records of all conflict of interest disclosures and all actions taken with respect to such disclosures for either: A. A period of three years following the final close-out of the affected sponsored activity or the resolution of any governmental action relating to such sponsored activity or the underlying conflict of interest, whichever comes later; or B. As otherwise provided by law. The original disclosure forms will be retained electronically by the Office of Human Resource Services as part of the employee's official personnel file.

Consensual relationships can create conflicts of interest that impair the integrity of academic and employment decisions. Such relationships also contain the potential for exploitation of the subordinate employee, student or student employee and the possible professional or academic disadvantage of third parties, and can subject both the university and individuals to liability. Therefore, the university strongly discourages consensual relationships between supervisors and subordinates, teachers and students, and advisors and students. Should such a relationship develop, the faculty member, supervisor or advisor has the obligation to disclose its existence to an immediate supervisor and cooperate in making alternative arrangements for the supervision, evaluation, teaching, grading or advising of the employee, student or student employee. PART 2: SCOPE This Rule applies to all NMSU employees including faculty, staff and student employees. PART 3: DEFINITIONS1/4 08/25/2020 3.13 - Conflicts of Interest Arising from Consensual Relationships A. A consensual relationship is a mutually acceptable, romantic and/or sexual relationship. B. A conflict of interest arises when an individual with the authority and responsibility to evaluate the work or performance of an employee, student or student employee acquiesces or engages in a consensual relationship with the employee or student. C. An employee is defined as any individual, whether paid or not, who is listed and active on the university's Human Resources Management System. This includes all faculty, staff and student employees to include affiliated faculty and associated employees. PART 4: REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY In the event a conflict of interest exists arising from a consensual relationship, the individual in the supervisory, teaching or advisory position shall immediately notify the supervisor about the relationship and cooperate with the supervisor in making arrangements necessary to resolve the conflict of interest. Notification of the consensual relationship shall be provided in writing and signed by both parties involved. PART 5: SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY A supervisor who is notified shall take immediate steps to alter the conditions that create the conflict of interest caused by the relationship. In most instances, this will be accomplished by providing an alternative means for the supervision, teaching, advising and/or evaluation of the subordinate employee, student or student employee. A supervisor who becomes aware of a consensual relationship that has not been declared shall investigate and take action as appropriate and required by this Rule. Both parties in the relationship and the supervisor shall sign the resolution. All documentation will be maintained in a departmental file. PART 6: FAILURE TO REPORT OR COOPERATE2/4 08/25/2020 3.13 - Conflicts of Interest Arising from Consensual Relationships Employees in positions of authority who enter into or continue consensual relationships without reporting them, or who fail to cooperate in efforts to eliminate the conflict of interest resulting from a consensual relationship may be subject to disciplinary action, which may include counseling, letters of warning, reprimand, suspension or termination. In the event that a complaint of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct is reported by the subordinate party regarding an unreported relationship, there will be no presumption that the relationship was consensual in nature. PART 7: GRIEVANCE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS Disciplinary actions imposed for violations of this Rule may be grieved or appealed by the individual who is disciplined pursuant to existing university policies and procedures. PART 8: ASSISTANCE Questions regarding this Rule should be directed to the assistant vice president for human resource services.

As set forth in the university's Business Ethics Handbook, employees should strive to conduct themselves consistent with the highest ethical principles, to avoid any action that may be viewed as a violation of the public trust in the use of these resources, and to act responsibly in order to preserve and safeguard university resources. These resources include employee time, facilities, supplies, and equipment such as telephones, fax machines, and computers. B.No Expectation of Privacy : This rule also provides notice to employees that internal or external audit or other needs may require examination of university resources or services and they should not expect such uses to be free from inspection. Employees do not have a right or expectation to privacy as it relates to information or data contained on or accessed through university equipment or resources. PART 2: GUIDELINES The following guidelines will be applied taking into consideration factors such as the nature of the use, reasonableness, time, detriment or cost to the university, employment history and employee work habits. Employees should consult with their supervisors in advance if they are unsure of the propriety of a certain action or practice. Violations of this policy may be reported through the university's confidential reporting line at https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/en/default_reporter.asp The use of the university's resources and services for non-work related purposes is permissible in very limited circumstances: 1/3 08/25/2020 3.14 - Non-Work Related Use of University Resources A. The cost to the university is negligible. B. The use does not interfere with an employee's obligation to carry out university duties in a timely and effective manner. Time spent on non- work related use of university resources is not considered to be university work time. C. The use does not undermine the use of university resources and services for official purposes, nor violate any university policy, rule or procedure, nor violate state or federal law. D. The use neither expresses nor implies sponsorship or endorsement by the university. E. The use does not involve the viewing, displaying, downloading, printing, procuring, or transmitting of sexually explicit material or any other material that would violate university policies or rules/procedures, or the law, including but not limited to, those relating to sexual harassment, fraud, hostile workplace, obscenity, libel, defamation, or hate/violent misconduct. F. University resources are not to be used for non-university business, marketing or political activities. G. The NMSU internal mail delivery system is not for delivery of non-work related material. University accounts must not be charged for mailing personal or non-university business material. H. NMSU telephones and other communications equipment are to be used for NMSU business, defined as NMSU mission related activities. NMSU recognizes the occasional need to make or receive a personal call, and no direct payment for personal local telephone calls is expected. Because the administrative costs associated with reimbursement have not proven to be cost effective, individuals are expected to use their personal cell phones for long distance calls or to pay directly (e.g. through use of prepaid calling cards) for all personal long-distance calls made on university telephones. In a personal situation requiring prompt action, the university expects the employees to use prudent judgment and in the event the individual does not have other means to charge a long distance telephone call, the unit manager should be notified so that the call may be identified on the monthly bill for the employee to reimburse the university. Unit managers are expected to address patterns of unprofessional and inappropriate personal use of the phone or other university-owned communications equipment.2/3 08/25/2020 3.14 - Non-Work Related Use of University Resources I.

Those with the authority to address and remedy sex-based discrimination and harassment; and/or 2. Those with the responsibility to report sexual misconduct to a supervisor and OIE; and/or 3. Those who a student would reasonably believe have such authority or obligation. D.

In assessing OIE's jurisdiction of off-campus behavior under Title IX, as well as all other alleged discriminatory conduct, OIE will apply a two-pronged test: 1. 1. Does NMSU have control over the harasser; and 2. Does NMSU have control over the context of the harassment (on our property, in our programs, on land we lease or control, or at events we sponsor). a. NMSU reserves the option to take jurisdiction of off-campus misconduct when deemed necessary due to the involvement and/or impact on students and/or employees. b. Discriminatory conduct, alleged to have occurred outside of the United States of America, must be reported, but will be investigated as a policy violation, not as a Title IX policy violation. F. NMSU will respond promptly to reports of sexual harassment in an education program or activity. G. As the designated Title IX Coordinator, the Executive Director is charged with oversight of the resolution of Title IX complaints, as well identifying and addressing systematic problems and patterns of conduct arising from such complaints. The Executive Director is authorized to appoint Deputy T itle IX Coordinators(s). PART 3: PROHIBITION OF SEX DISCRIMINATION/SEXUAL HARASSMENT A. NMSU is committed to providing a place of work and learning free of sexual misconduct which includes sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual violence.

No student or employee, either in the workplace or in the academic environment, should be subjected to unwelcome, non-consensual, non-verbal, verbal or physical conduct that is of a sexual nature. Even one incident may constitute a violation of NMSU policy, rule or procedure. D. Conduct of a sexual nature, constitutes a violation of NMSU policy and/or law and policy when: 1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic status; 2. Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for academic or employment decisions or evaluations, or permission to participate in an activity; or 3. The conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's academic or work performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile and offensive environment in which to work or learn. PART 4: PROHIBITION OF RETALIATION A. Retaliation against an individual who in good faith reports allegations of discriminatory conduct or provides information in an investigation about behavior that may violate NMSU policy, rules or procedures is prohibited. 1. Such conduct will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination/suspension from the university. B.

A preferred name reflects the manner in which an individual wishes to be addressed by faculty, staff, students, co-workers and the public. NMSU's rule on preferred names covers first and middle names; surnames may only be changed with a legal name change. Similarly, a preferred pronoun indicates how an individual would like to be referred to by others in lieu of their name; preferred pronouns may change over time. Some prefer gender-neutral or gender-inclusive pronouns when referring to or speaking with an individual. The following list of possible pronouns is not all inclusive: 1. he, him, his; 2. she, her, hers; 3. they, them, their and 4. xe, xem, xir. PART 2: CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO USE OF PREFERRED NAME AND/OR PRONOUN A.Individual Use : Commencing with the fall 2016 semester, a preferred first or middle name and/or use of a preferred pronoun may be utilized by anyone in the university community in combination with their legal surname. As long as the use of a preferred name is not for the purpose of misrepresentation, embarrassment or offense, or other misconduct, NMSU will honor an individual's use of a preferred name or pronoun in the course of university business and education, consistent with this Rule. NMSU reserves the right to deny use of, or to remove, a preferred name if not consistent with this Rule.1/5 08/25/2020 3.39 - Procedures to Use Preferred Name B. Respect for Use and Privacy : Employees, students and other members of the university community will respect such use, in addition to respecting the privacy of individuals concerning such use. C. Procedure to Use Preferred Name : Students and employees or others authorized to be listed in the NMSU Directory may initiate, update or delete the use of a preferred name via Banner Self Service, Personal Information section accessible through NMSU's portal (my.nmsu.edu) D. Limitations on Use of Preferred Name : Certain academic programs or internships and placements may be governed by New Mexico State law and may limit the use of a preferred name; before entering a preferred name in the system, it is recommended that you speak with your dean or ASNMSU legal services attorney regarding these potential regulatory limitations. PART 3: INSTITUTIONAL USE OF PREFERRED NAME VS. LEGAL NAME A. Preferred Name The preferred name will be used in lieu of the legal name wherever the legal name is not required, such as: 1. learning management system 2. class rosters 3. degree audit system 4. advisee lists 5. email system 6. online directory, unless the student has opted out of the directory (following is the link to the FERPA page that references opting out of directory information: http://records.nmsu.edu/ferpa/). B. Legal Name Use of the legal name (the name that appears on your passport, driver's license, birth certificate or U.S. Social Security card) is required for: 1. admissions and University Student Records Office official records 2. transfer credit 3. federal, state, and institutional student financial aid 2/5 08/25/2020 3.39 - Procedures to Use Preferred Name 4. housing contracts 5. payroll 6. benefit information 7. student billing and the student account invoice (including e-bills) 8. disciplinary action 9. other legally binding requirements C. Frequently Asked Questions/Examples 1. Who will have access to my Legal Name? University employees with the appropriate access, the NMSU Police Department, and your supervisor (if you are employed in a campus job). 2. May an individual obtain an NMSU ID card with the preferred name? If the individual records a preferred name in Banner Self Service (my.nmsu.edu), a replacement ID card may be obtained, but is not required. In order to obtain a new card, the old card with the legal name must be turned in to the ID Card Services Office. The cost of a new card can be found at http://idcard.nmsu.edu/id-frequently-asked-questions/ . 3. Is the NMSU ID card a form of identification accepted off campus? It is advisable to carry a government issued form of ID such as a driver's license or passport with you in order to access resources that are not on the NMSU campus. 4. May an individual change their NMSU username to reflect their preferred name? Under some circumstances an individual may be able to change their NMSU username. Contact the ICT Help Desk at http://help.nmsu.edufor more information. 5. Does a Preferred Name Affect my Legal Name? Use of a preferred name does not change your legal name. 3/5 08/25/2020 3.39 - Procedures to Use Preferred Name 6. What name will appear on a student's diploma? Generally, the student's legal name will appear on the student's diploma. However, students may provide abbreviated variations of their legal name when they apply for graduation. The legal name of a student which appears on a student's diploma may be modified slightly as follows: a. option to display first name or first name initial b. option to include or exclude middle name or middle initial c. option to modify legal name for proper capitalization d. option to modify legal name for proper accentuation of the name e. option to include or exclude suffixes (Jr., Sr., and II) f. the first and middle names may not be lengthened (i.e. expanding an initial to a full name) or shortened to anything other than an initial 7. Is it possible for a student to get a new diploma if the student's legal name has changed? The original diploma must be returned and a replacement diploma will be issued after obtaining the appropriate documentation to update the student's legal name. The cost of a new diploma can be found at commencement.nmsu.edu. The current University officials' signatures will appear on the replacement diploma. 8. Why is a certain office or system not using an individual's preferred name? There are a few reasons an office or system might not be using an individual's preferred name in some or all communications. As indicated above, some offices or processes require use of an individual's legal name. Even though some processes require the use of the legal name, it is the intent that all offices use the preferred name as much as possible in general communications. It is possible that an online system may not display an individual's preferred name. A preferred name may not be used in an online system because the system must use the legal name or because the system has not yet been updated to use the preferred name. If you have a concern that a legal name is being used instead of the preferred name, please contact the Chief Information Officer at cio@nmsu.edu. 9. More Information about Preferred Name : For questions regarding a preferred name, please contact the ICT Help Desk at help@nmsu.edu. 10.

Student Family Housing : In addition to any terms and conditions pertaining to Companion Animals contained in the housing license, the following applies to requests for animals to reside or to visit overnight within Family University Housing: a. No animals are allowed to reside, nor to visit overnight, in Family Housing without the express written approval from the Department of Housing and Residential Life; b. Only dogs, cats, birds, fish, rodents (only guinea pigs, hamsters or gerbils), amphibians and nonsnake reptiles are permitted in Family Housing, absent an exception based upon extenuating circumstances granted by the Department of Housing and Residential Life; c. The total number of dogs and cats in a household shall not exceed a total of two (2) (e.g. 2 dogs; 2 cats; 1 cat, 1 dog). d. Fish, birds, rodents, amphibians and reptiles must be contained in an appropriately sized aquarium or cage at all times. e. Dogs and cats shall be spayed or neutered, unless granted an exception by the Housing Director or designee. f. Alleged violations may be unilaterally investigated by University Housing staff, and action taken pursuant to the terms of the license agreement. g. The signatory on a University Housing license agreement, as the party responsible for the premises, may have sanctions or other administrative action levied against them for violations by an Owner/Handler who are their co-tenants or visitors. The Owner/Handler may also be sanctioned in accordance with applicable employee, student or visitor conduct policy, rule or procedures. 6. Unsupervised Animals : From time to time unsupervised animals may be encountered on a campus or other university property. In these situations, administrative or police action may be taken, for the protection of the public's safety, as well as for the safety and welfare of the animal. B. Service Animals; Service Animals in Training 8/20 08/25/2020 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises 1. Public Access : A person with a disability who uses a service animal shall be admitted to any university facility open to the public, including buildings and common carriers, subject to rare exception based on direct threat of significant harm to the health or safety of others. Service Animals shall be at all times under the control of the Owner, Handler or trainer of the service animal.Questions or concerns relating to public access by a service animal, and requests for reasonable accommodation in the workplace or academic setting not involving a service animal should be referred to either the Office of Institutional Equity (employees and visitors) (575-646-3635 or equity@nmsu.edu), or the Office of Student Accessibility Services, 575-646-6840 or sas@nmsu.edu. a. The law does not require Service Animals to wear a vest; however, NMSU encourages the use of a vest or other service animal identification. b. Persons with disabilities who utilize a service animal are not required to register with any office, nor to request an accommodation, unless an additional accommodation is needed in the academic or work setting. c. Persons with disabilities who use a service animal on university property shall not be required to pay a fee that others (without animals) are not required to pay. (e.g. pet deposits); d. In an emergency requiring transportation or relocation of an Owner, Handler or trainer of a service animal or service animal in training, to the extent practicable, accommodations shall be made for the service animal or service animal in training to remain with or be reunited with the Owner, Handler or trainer. When accommodations cannot be made that would allow the animal to remain with the Owner, Handler or trainer, the service animal or service animal in training shall be placed pursuant to the instructions provided by the Owner, Handler or trainer. e. Misrepresentation of an animal as an authorized service animal or service animal in training will be taken very seriously. See Part 5, section I. 9/20 08/25/2020 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises 2. Inquiries by University Representatives : When it is readily apparent that an animal is trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability (e.g. a dog is observed guiding a person with a visual disability), university representatives should not inquire about the service animal, unless there is a separate concern about disruption or other issue. It is recommended that faculty, staff or students consult with either the Office of Student Accessibility Services or the Office of Institutional Equity regarding any perceived issues. a. In the event that it is not readily apparent that an animal is a service animal, university representatives shall not ask about the nature or extent of the person's disability, but may make two inquiries, as permitted by guidance issued pertaining to the Americans with Disabilities Act: 1. Is the animal a service animal required because of a disability?, and/or 2. What work or task is the animal trained to perform? b. University representatives shall not ask for documentation, such as proof that the animal has been certified, trained or licensed as a Service Animal; nor shall they ask the Handler to demonstrate the tasks. c. For university programs and/or classes held at non-NMSU facilities, the Owner of the property may require notification or verification that the animal is a service animal. 3. Control, Care and Maintenance : Subject to limited exceptions required due to a Handler's particular disability, Owners, Handlers and trainers of Service Animals and Service Animals in Training shall comply with the requirements of Part 5, sections A and E relating to animal control, care and maintenance. 4. Service Animals in Training : Based on New Mexico law, Service Animals in Training shall be admitted to facilities open to the public on the same basis that a service animal would be. 5. Denial of Public Access : Any decision to exclude a service animal from a particular area of the university shall be made on a case-by- case basis, in coordination with the person with the disability; and if possible, also in coordination with either the Office of Student Accessibility Services (for students) or the Office of Institutional Equity (for employees and visitors). See Also Part 5, section A.3 above.10/20 08/25/2020 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises 6. ADA Complaint Resolution : Persons with disabilities who believe their rights under the ADA are not being honored may file either an internal complaint of disability discrimination with the Office of Institutional Equity (575-646-3635 or equity@nmsu.edu), or may file an external complaint with appropriate state and/or federal agencies. Internal complaints received will be promptly investigated and resolved. Appropriate corrective action will be taken for violations of this Rule, in correlation with the severity of the offense. C. Emotional Support Animals Permitted in Restricted Areas Federal law recognizes that under certain circumstances, the presence of a Companion Animal which provides emotional support may be granted by the appropriate university office (e.g. Office of Institutional Equity for employees and visitors; Office of Student Accessibility Services , for students) as a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability. An example of an accommodation that might be found to be reasonable, depending upon the circumstances presented, would be waiver by University Housing of its standard prohibition of Companion Animals, to permit an Emotional Support Animal to reside with its Owner with a disability. The university's standard procedures for assessing student requests for reasonable accommodation shall be applied, on a case by case basis, and result in an Accommodation Agreement that addresses the animal access issues. 1. A request for an Emotional Support Animal must be based upon medical documentation indicating that the animal's presence alleviates psychological symptoms or effects associated with the disability of its Owner/Handler. 2. While the law requires that there be a nexus between the person's disability and the comfort provided by an Emotional Support Animal, it does not require the animal to be trained to perform specific task(s) directly for their Handler. Emotional Support Animals may be permitted access only to the areas specifically identified in an Accommodation Agreement authorized by the appropriate university office or other entity. 3. Persons with disabilities authorized for an Emotional Support Animal, by either the Office of Student Accessibility Services or by the Office of Institutional Equity, shall carry a copy of the Accommodation Agreement with them. The use of a vest or other identification as an Emotional Support Animal is encouraged.11/20 08/25/2020 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises 4. In the event that it is not readily apparent that an animal should be permitted access to a particular university venue, university representatives shall not seek disability related information, and if the animal is identified as an Emotional Support Animal, may ask to see a copy of the Accommodation Agreement authorizing access, or name of the university official or other entity granting similar approval. 5. Misrepresentation of an animal as an authorized Emotional Support Animal will be taken very seriously. See Part 5, section I. 6. Control, Care and Maintenance : Owners and Handlers of Emotional Support Animals are subject to the requirements of Part 5, sections A and E relating to animal control, care and maintenance. 7. ADA Complaint Resolution : persons with disabilities who believe their rights under the ADA are not being honored may file either an internal complaint of disability discrimination with the Office of Institutional Equity (575-646-3635 or equity@nmsu.edu), or may file an external complaint with appropriate state and/or federal agencies. Internal complaints received will be promptly investigated and resolved. Appropriate corrective action will be taken for violations of this Rule, in correlation with the severity of the offense. D. Working Assistive Animals 1. Therapy Animals : Therapy Animals, also referred to as animals used in animal assisted interventions, (AAI) are distinct from Emotional Support Animals and from Service Animals and do not have the same right to public access. Therapy Animals are regulated by guidelines determined by specific associations. (e.g. Pet Partners, Therapy Dogs International, Therapaws). Visits by this type of animal to university campuses and within buildings are permitted, subject to approval from the appropriate department head, director or equivalent administrator. See NMSU Counseling Center for \"Guidelines for Animal Assisted Interventions\". 2. Law Enforcement Animals : Animals under the authority of law enforcement personnel, while actively responding to an actual or perceived event, are not subject to the provisions of this Rule. Their control, care and maintenance is governed by state and/or federal case law and is incorporated into the NMSU Police Department, Law Enforcement Canine Handbook , or other policies and procedures applicable to the specific law enforcement agency that owns the working animal. E. General Animal Welfare Requirements 12/20 08/25/2020 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises NMSU abides by guidelines associated with basic animal welfare and promotes quality of life for all companion and assistive animals on University Premises. The following principles listed below apply to the animals within the scope of this Rule, in order to ensure their physical, mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, Owners/Handlers shall comply with applicable county ordinance and state law. See Do\u00f1a Ana County Ordinance . The five freedoms listed at 1-5 below, were adapted from the Farm Animal Welfare Council's Five Freedoms originally developed to set standards for livestock welfare; however, they encapsulate the basic principles that are expected to be applied at NMSU to companion and assistive animals: 1. Freedom from hunger and thirst : Companion and assistive animals shall be provided ready access to fresh water and be provided with a diet to maximize short and long term health. 2. Freedom from discomfort : Because Service Animals are at their Handler's side for a large part of each day, it is anticipated that the basic care of providing adequate shelter will be maintained. All companion and assistive animals residing or otherwise permitted on University Premises shall be provided adequate shelter. 3. Freedom from pain, injury, or disease : The Owner/Handler of the companion or assistive animal will ensure the physical health of the animal, including but not limited to avoidance of locations that may involve the use of hazardous materials (certain science labs) or interaction with NMSU livestock or horses; extended walking on asphalt or cement surfaces during summer months; as well as regular vet check-ups and vaccinations or titer testing for the following: rabies, distemper, parvovirus and bordetella. If the animal is unable to be vaccinated for health reasons, the Owner/Handler needs to have a document from the treating veterinarian stating that this is the case. 4. Freedom to express normal behavior : The life of a service animal is one of work. However, its Owner/Handler should ensure that the animal be provided with an appropriate level of \"down-time\" or \"play- time\" in order to maintain the service animal's mental well-being. The use of positive training techniques is encouraged. 13/20 08/25/2020 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises 5. Freedom from fear and distress : Service Animals may be exposed to people, situations, or surroundings that companion and other assistive animals would not be exposed to. For example, very crowded noisy hallways in university buildings. It is the responsibility of the animal's Owner/Handler to ensure that the animal has received effective training so that the animal not only behaves appropriately in these settings, but that the animal has had positive experiences while being exposed to these settings so it does not become stressed. Leaving companion and other assistive animals confined in quarters alone for extended periods of time may be a violation of this Rule, depending upon the specific circumstances. 6. Other special issues to consider when tending to the welfare of Service Animals include : a. Respect for the aging of the animal, including any signs of cognitive or physical impairment, must be shown, including consideration of the appropriate time to for retiring the animal from service duties; b. Related to the provisions of Part 5, subsection E.5 above, Owners/Handlers should be aware of the potential sources of chronic stress to the animal, and consider the impact that such stress may have on the animal. This necessitates that the Owner/Handler pay attention to the warning signs of chronic stress in their service or other animal and take appropriate action to lessen the impact of the stress. This is particularly true if the animal is expected to work for long periods of time in unpredictable settings doing stressful work (i.e., attending a football game where there are fireworks or cannon shots while being surrounded by many people, or having to perform physically or psychologically demanding duties). c. Additionally, Owners/Handlers are subject to the provisions of Part 5, section A.3.a, regarding situations which pose potential health or safety risks to others or to their animal. Owners and Handlers are encouraged to consider potential hazards carefully, and in advance, in order to decide whether or not an accommodation within an academic setting or workplace will be necessary or feasible. The Owner or Handler should communicate as early as possible with the faculty member, employer or other person with authority if it appears a modification to protocols or to physical environments may be necessary for the protection of other persons or the animal. F. Establishment of Companion and Assistive Animals Committee14/20 08/25/2020 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises The Board of Regents hereby establishes the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee as a standing \"university board\" as defined by RPM 2.30 . Complaints and other matters of concern relating to the interpretation, application or enforcement of this Rule, or corresponding procedures, may be submitted to this committee for resolution. The committee's authority to review and resolve complaints concerning animals on campus is supplemental to other grievances which might be filed. 1. Authority : The Companion and Assistive Animals Committee shall serve both as an advisory resource to the individual Rule administrators regarding the application and enforcement of this Rule, as well as a body that will assist the university community with dispute resolution as needed for issues involving animals on campus. The committee shall have no authority relative to teaching or research animals under the authority of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, governed by distinct federal regulations. Other than its advisory function, the committee shall have no authority to take action in matters where another university department has jurisdiction to act, such as the NMSU Police Department (a criminal case involving an alleged vicious animal) or the Office of Institutional Equity (exclusion of a service animal resulting in a complaint of discrimination in violation of the ADA). 2. Membership : The Companion and Assistive Animals Committee shall be comprised of: each Rule administrator identified in Section C.; one or more faculty or staff invitees of the Rule administrators, who have knowledge or expertise regarding service, companion and other assistive animals; the chair of the IACUC Committee or designee (ex officio), and a representative from the Office of General Counsel (ex officio). 3. Meetings : The Companion and Assistive Animals Committee may be convened by any of its members, at any time necessary for the resolution of issues pursuant to this Rule. Representatives from the community colleges and or other faculty, staff or students in need of an advisory opinion or other assistance from the committee may submit their issue in writing or request to present in person to the committee. G. Dispute/Complaint Resolution15/20 08/25/2020 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises Any person may bring an issue of a Rule violation or other problem with an animal on campus to the attention of any of the individual Rule administrators (See Part 3 above), and/ or directly to the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee. 1. Elements of Complaint or Other Concern : To the extent possible, complaints and other letters of concern shall provide date, time, and location of any alleged violation or incident; the party or parties charged, if known; any witnesses, if known; any other relevant facts; as well as the relief sought by the complainant. 2. Complaint Prioritization : Complaints and other letters of concern will be processed in the order they are received, unless there is a health or safety risk involved, in which case, it will be expedited. 3. Receipt and Routing for Initial Review : The recipient of a complaint or other letter of concern shall coordinate with the chair of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee, and route it for initial review by the appropriate Rule administrator. Initial review may involve: a. Investigation of the facts by the chair of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee, in coordination with the appropriate Rule administrator; b. Exploration of avenues for resolution of the issues raised, including discussion, community education, mediation or other methods. c. If the Rule administrator is able to resolve it in accordance with the Rule/procedures under their jurisdiction, the matter shall be closed. d. If an issue is not resolved within 7 business days, it may be forwarded by any of the involved parties (the complainant, the respondent, the Rule administrator, the chair of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee) to the full Companion and Assistive Animals Committee for consideration and further action. 16/20 08/25/2020 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises 4. Committee Review : If the complaint or concern is not resolved by the Rule Administrator or by the chair of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee through discussions with or between the parties, the chair may convene all the members of the committee to consider the matter. a. The committee shall hear from all parties. Contact shall be made through notice by personal delivery, email, other electronic means, or by US mail to the most current address on record with the university, if any. A copy of the complaint or other letter of concern shall be included with the communication, inviting comment or attendance at a meeting. Each party shall respond in writing indicating their preference. b. If they do not wish to attend the meeting/hearing at which the matter will be discussed, the involved parties may submit a written position statement in lieu of attendance to be considered by the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee. c. The Companion and Assistive Animals Committee or its individual members may be in a position to procure relevant evidence, and may contribute such to the hearing of the matter, in the interest of obtaining a fair result, provided that all parties are informed about the material being considered, and have the opportunity to review and/or rebut it. d. After consideration of the relevant facts, including submissions received from the involved parties, a majority of a quorum of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee will issue a decision, either verbally to the parties at the close of the meeting/hearing, or by way of a written decision within 7 business days from the date the hearing was held. e. The meeting/hearing shall be recorded. f. The decision of the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee shall be final. H. Education of University Community The Rule administrators, working in conjunction with the Office of Institutional Equity and/or the NMSU Office of Student Accessibility Services, will ensure that appropriate training is provided to faculty, staff and students regarding the law's requirements for non-discriminatory equal access, in order to increase mutual understanding and to reduce misunderstanding and/or conflict about where different types of animals are permitted to be on campus.17/20 08/25/2020 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises I. Misrepresentation of Animal as an Authorized Animal The New Mexico Service Animal Act, NMSA 1978, Section 28-11-6 et seq, makes it a crime to knowingly present an animal as a service animal or service animal in training when it does not meet the definition. Additionally, falsification of documentation or other misrepresentation of an animal as a service animal, service animal in training, Emotional Support Animal or other animal permitted under these policies, in order to gain access to university facilities not otherwise open to Companion Animals, will be taken seriously. If reported or suspected, the appropriate university office will investigate. Administrative, disciplinary and/or criminal action will be pursued as warranted by the investigative findings. J. Conflicts Involving Assistive and Companion Animal s It is recognized that presence of animals on campus may from time to time create problems for others. For example, the presence of a service animal, other assistive animal or Companion Animal may negatively affect others with allergies, respiratory impairments and other conditions. 1. The facts relevant to each conflict situation will be assessed in order to balance the rights of each affected party, and to the extent feasible, the rights of each party will be honored, with or without accommodation of policies, procedures, course schedules etc. 2. When a conflict involves two animals, the public access rights of a service animal or service animal in training will likely prevail. Note : The New Mexico Service Animal Act makes it a crime to intentionally fail or refuse to control an unrestrained animal, which animal interferes with or obstructs the Owner, trainer, or Handler of the service animal or service animal in training. 3. When a conflict involves any person and either the Owner, Handler or trainer of a service animal or service animal in training; or involves any person and the service animal or service animal in training; the rights of the Owner, Handler or trainer and/or the rights of the service animal or service animal in training will likely prevail. Note: The New Mexico Service Animal Act makes it a crime to intentionally interfere with (i.e. harassment or obstruction) with the use of a service animal or service animal in training. 4. Conflict resolution will be managed by the Office of Student Accessibility Services or the Office of Institutional Equity, as appropriate, for conflicts involving Service Animals and animals permitted as Emotional Support Animals; those offices may utilize the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee in an advisory capacity.18/20 08/25/2020 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises 5. Conflicts involving Companion Animals may be directed to the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee for resolution by that committee. PART 6: RELATED PROCEDURES AND FORMS Consistent with RPM 1.10 and ARP 1.10 , the policy administrators, in consultation with the Companion and Assistive Animals Committee, and approval from their respective vice president or equivalent administrator, may issue supplemental procedural guidelines and/or forms. Such procedures shall not conflict with this Rule, and are intended to facilitate the implementation, application, and enforcement. Such procedures and forms shall be posted at an appropriate NMSU website, and linked from this Section.

Furthermore, this policy clarifies application throughout the NMSU system by identifying the distinct types of forums, as well as to describe the reasonable restrictions, if any, which may be imposed in order to protect the university's teaching, research and service operations, and student activities from significant disruption and interference. PART 2: SCOPE This policy applies to all people, and throughout the NMSU system (at all campuses, facilities and other real property under the operation and control of the NMSU Board of Regents, to include university sponsored events off-premises). Commercial solicitation is not covered by this policy and is governed by ARP 14.92. PART 3: POLICY ADMINISTRATOR The President at each campus shall have primary responsibility for the administration of this policy, on behalf of the NMSU Board of Regents. Parties responsible for implementing and applying this policy also include, but are not limited to: 1/16 08/25/2020 3.63 - Freedom of Expression A. Provost and Executive Vice President B. Deans of the Colleges and Libraries and Graduate School C. Dean of Students, including the Office of Campus Activities D. Associate Vice President of Facilities and Services E. Director of Athletics F. Director of Housing and Campus Life G. Director of Special Events H. Manager or Building Monitor within any university facility PART 4: DEFINITIONS For purposes of administering this policy, the following definitions apply: A. Affix means to stick, to anchor, or to fasten to something else, regardless of whether or not it leaves a mark or causes damage. B. Commercial Speech is Speech that proposes a commercial transaction; the audience consists of prospective consumers, and the content of the message is business related in character. C. Content Neutral means without regard to the viewpoint or message. Content Neutral restrictions are those based on reasonable time, place, and manner rather than the content or viewpoint of the message. D. Forum is a term used by the U.S. Supreme Court to help describe the extent to which Content Neutral restrictions on free expression may legally be applied. The three types described in this policy are: traditional open public forum; limited public forum and non-public forum. These terms apply not only to physical areas, but also to electronic communication and websites. The type of forum will be determined by the nature of the space being used, its traditional usage, official designations, and the circumstances relating to the nature of an event or function taking place in that location. For example , if a normally public forum were reserved for a specific event (following applicable university procedures) that might convert the location to a limited or non-public forum during the event for which it was reserved; conversely, areas such as special collections within the university are typically non-public forums, but may become limited public forums for certain special events.2/16 08/25/2020 3.63 - Freedom of Expression E. Social Media means computer- mediated tools that allow people to create, share, or exchange information, ideas, videos, and pictures in virtual communities and networks. F. Speech is written, spoken, and other forms of expression of thoughts, ideas, or positions, generally related to issues of public interest. G. University Premises , sometimes referred to simply as \"campus,\" means all campuses, facilities, land, buildings, or other indoor or outside space owned, leased or otherwise under the operational control of NMSU. University owned property leased to other entities and not under the operational control of NMSU are not considered University Premises for purposes of this policy. H. Unprotected Speech means Speech that is not afforded First Amendment protection, such as Commercial Speech that is false or misleading. Other examples include fighting words, child pornography, defamation, and libel. PART 5: POLICY STATEMENTS New Mexico State University aspires to be an intellectually open campus. Free exchange of ideas is a reflection of the university's public land-grant heritage, interest in diverse points of view, and commitment to excellence in education and research. NMSU encourages free expression and peaceful assembly, provided they do not disrupt the university missions or functions. The type of Forum, described below, will determine the level of restriction, if any, which may be imposed on free expression activities within the Forum. Restrictions must be Content Neutral, typically geared to time, place and manner. The type of Forum for a given location may vary, based on the circumstances relating to the nature of an event or function scheduled to occur at the location. A. Public Forums are areas that traditionally have been open to the public, such as parks, sidewalks, and lobbies as well as other areas that become public Forums by university designation. Free expression and civil discourse are encouraged in public Forums, and any regulation of expression within a public Forum must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.3/16 08/25/2020 3.63 - Freedom of Expression B. Limited Public Forums are areas open to the public or a segment thereof (including through the purchase of admission), but where there is a specific purpose. The necessities of confining a Forum to the limited and legitimate purpose for which it was created may justify some limitations that are narrowly tailored to allow the event or activity to continue and/or achieve its intended purpose. Any limitations must be consistent with the spirit of this policy. Legitimate limitations include subject matter and classification of participants (students, student government representatives, faculty, etc.). Limitations must be reasonably related to a definite and substantial university interest. Any limitations must be Content Neutral, and aimed solely at reducing or preventing disruption to the activity that would cause a definite and measurable interruption to the intended purpose, or protecting other clearly compelling university interests (e.g., public safety). If a limited public Forum serves more than one purpose, the university may prioritize the purposes for which it may be used, e.g. a campus auditorium may give priority to theater productions. Expression within a limited public Forum is permitted consistent with the Procedural Guidelines administered by the Office of Campus Activities. C. Non-Public Forums are areas not open to the general public and where expression by those permitted to be there may be reasonably limited, in a Content Neutral manner, to that which is compatible with the purpose and nature of the location. (Examples include faculty and administrative offices, classrooms, residence hall rooms, and archive and special collections of libraries.) D. Disruption of university functions or activities : Regardless of the type of Forum, free expression activities and events shall not materially or unreasonably interfere with the education, research, public service, and outreach missions of the university, office operations, or sleep of residents. E. Modes of Free Expression : The university recognizes that there are many different modes of free expression, including distribution and posting of literature; group Speech activities such as rallies, parades and demonstrations; electronic sound amplification, chalk, symbolic Speech (e.g. nudity, fire, and/or weapons); and electronic communication. The limitations described in the Procedural Guidelines pertaining to the various types of expression are intended to safeguard personal safety and the university's missions, and not to hamper freedom of expression. See Part 6.4/16 08/25/2020 3.63 - Freedom of Expression F. Respect for Rights of Others 1. Prohibition of Third Party Interference with Right to Free Expression : Except as provided elsewhere in this policy, university employees, students, and other members of the public shall not interfere with the rights of freedom of expression by others permitted by this policy. Alleged violations of rights afforded by the U.S. and N.M. Constitutions, recognized by this policy, will be taken seriously and investigated promptly and objectively. 2. Retaliation Prohibited : Retaliation against individuals who have exercised the rights granted by the First Amendment, recognized through this policy, is strictly prohibited. Any such claim should be reported immediately to an appropriate university official to register a complaint. Generally, the Office of the Dean of Students and the Office of Human Resource Services-Employee and Labor Relations administer student and employee grievances, respectively. Such claims will be taken seriously, investigated independently, and if substantiated, will be grounds for corrective or disciplinary action, appropriate to the circumstances. G. Respect for University Property and Functions : In exercising the right of free expression and peaceful assembly, individuals must also accept the responsibility of following the laws related to the safety of people and property. Outdoor and indoor activities must follow all applicable fire codes and other local, state, and federal laws. See Part 6, regarding Procedural Guidelines, which may clarify limitations intended to safeguard missions and personal safety, and not to hamper free expression. 5/16 08/25/2020 3.63 - Freedom of Expression H. Interface with other laws and regulations : There is inherent tension that exists between competing public policies affecting individual rights. A detailed examination of statutes and regulations which protect individuals from sexual harassment, discrimination, hostile environment and other discriminatory conduct is beyond the scope of this Freedom of Expression policy. This policy is not intended to insulate persons from accountability for their actions if their conduct discriminates, harasses or otherwise creates a hostile environment based on any class protected by federal and state anti-discrimination laws. ( See Also ARP 3.25 - Discrimination, Harassment and SexualMisconduct on Campus ). Nothing in this policy is intended to provide a defense in any action against a third party by an alleged victim of defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy, assault, or any other civil or administrative claim. 6/16 08/25/2020 3.63 - Freedom of Expression I. Dispute Resolution : The successful implementation of this policy will depend upon the university community's education and engagement, including but not limited to understanding which types of planned activities require advance permission, and what to do if an event or expressive activity is questioned. The Procedural Guidelines (See Part 6) provide some hypothetical scenarios within the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's) to provide guidance about how this policy should be applied. Because time will often be of the essence when issues arise involving this policy, the informal methods listed below are available to supervisors, students, employees and members of the public in order that individuals may seek a policy clarification or interpretation in advance, in order to resolve issues in a mutually professional and amicable manner, rather than through more adversarial grievance or litigation methods. These methods include and are not limited to: 1. A single point person will be designated by each NMSU campus president to serve as the liaison between members of the university community and/or the public and the Policy Administrators listed under Part 3, in order to resolve issues expeditiously. 2.

As a dealer in ideas, the teacher or researcher comes often in conflict with prevailing belief of large segments of society and even with those of colleagues. Yet, because of the practical benefits of scholarly activity, it is profoundly important that this diversity of ideas be not only tolerated, but encouraged. The right to support unorthodox positions, arrived at through scholarly investigation, free from coercion or reprisals, is fundamental to the continued progress of society. The right to pursue unpopular lines of inquiry and express new and unaccepted ideas falls within the framework of a special set of guarantees called academic freedom. In granting these guarantees, society expresses a willingness to risk the consequences because history confirms that the risk is outweighed by the benefits stemming from such a policy. Scholars are entitled to full freedom in the conduct of their research and publication of the results, and full freedom in the classroom to discuss those topics in which they are professionally experts as determined by their credentials. The exercise of this freedom carries with it the burden of corollary responsibilities. Scholars must not knowingly misrepresent facts. They must be careful in their teaching not to introduce controversial matter bearing no relationship to their subjects. They must exercise appropriate restraint and guard against distortions and inaccuracies. Outside their academic roles, as private citizens, scholars have no special privileges. When they speak or write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline, but their special position in the community imposes special obligations. As persons of learning and educational officers, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances. Hence they should at all times be accurate, should exercise appropriate restraint, should show respect for the opinions of others, and should make every effort to indicate that they are not speaking for the institution. Institutions of higher education are conducted for the common good and not to further the interest of either the individual scholar or the institution as a whole. The Board of Regents recognizes that it is not possible to define, with any great precision, the limits of academic freedom1/2 08/25/2020 3.70 - Academic Freedom in the complex world of ideas. The gray areas are practically endless and the final judgment of what is acceptable and reasonable must be left by society to the academic community itself. The scholar's own colleagues and institution must bear the brunt of public criticism, have the most to lose from withdrawal of public trust, and are, therefore, in the best position to balance the issues of academic freedom and responsibility.

D. Review and Decision by College and Registra r: 1. The College Academic Officer will consider the facts outlined in the petition, review the student's academic records and other relevant information, and issue a written recommendation. The recommendation will indicate whether or not the request justifies a late course registration change, in accordance with the criteria set forth above. Issues to be considered when determining whether to approve the petition include whether the circumstances prevented the student from dropping the course(s) within the drop/withdrawal deadline, and inconsistencies, if any, relating to which courses were requested to be dropped. 2. The College Academic Officer will forward the petition with their recommendation to both the student and to the Registrar. Where the College Academic Officer disapproves a petition, this is the notification to the student of the decision, which may be appealed as set forth below. 3. In instances where the College Academic Officer recommends in favor of the waiver, the Registrar will then accept or decline the recommendation within no more than 30 days (if additional time is needed, an extension may be granted upon request to the relevant major dean or community college president). 4.

Appeal to Provost for Final Review : 1. If the petition for a waiver of the deadline is declined by either the College Academic Officer or the Registrar, the student may seek a final review of the matter by submitting a written appeal within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the decision. The written appeal will include the student's position statement regarding why the waiver request was improperly denied. 2. The student, or a person authorized to act on behalf of student, must submit the written appeal to the relevant College Academic Officer, who will forward the appeal to the Office of the Provost, including all documentation relating to the decision. The College Academic Officer and the Registrar each have the option to also submit a response to the appeal, with a copy delivered to the student. 3. The provost or designee will consider the points made in the appeal, the documentation relating to the decision being appealed and any response to the appeal and will then issue a final decision to the parties within 30 days after receipt of the appeal upholding, modifying or reversing the decision. The student, the relevant College Academic Officer, Registrar, University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services, and University Accounts Receivable will be notified of the decision, and in the case of a modification or reversal, the Registrar will process any course registration change mandated by the decision. F. Amendment of Student Educational Record : Upon approval of a waiver of the deadline and the processing of a post-deadline registration change, in those cases where the students record is amended to provide a course withdrawal (rather than a drop), the student will receive a \"W\" grade unless the course instructor and the College Academic Officer recommend an \"I\" grade as more appropriate.

PART 2: DEFINITIONS A.Credit Hour : Conventionally, the \"Carnegie\" Credit Hour is defined as one Class Hour of contact time (with an expectation of two hours of outside work) per week over a 15 week semester. B.Class Hour : A Class Hour must be a minimum of 50 minutes. A class must meet at least 750 minutes a semester for one credit (2250 minutes for the standard 3 credit lecture class). PART 3: REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CREDIT HOUR CALCULATION In accordance with federal guidelines, academic Credit Hours for a course are determined by the amount of time students are engaged with the course content. NMSU's established equivalency for courses bearing academic credit reasonably approximates and is not less than: 1/3 08/25/2020 4.23 - Credit Hour Calculation; Variable Credit CoursesA. One semester hour of credit is awarded for 750 minutes (12.5 hours) of faculty instruction and a minimum of 1800 minutes (30 hours) of independent student work. Students must be engaged in course activities for 2550 minutes (42.5 hours) per Credit Hour (e.g. a fifteen week semester is equivalent to one 50 minute period of instruction and two hours of out-of-class work each week), or B. At least an equivalent amount of work, as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practicum, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of Credit Hours. C. For hybrid and online courses, which do not meet the faculty contact requirements, credit is awarded based on the equivalent face-to-face course or by assessing the amount of work required by the student. D. For laboratory courses or courses that contain laboratories, 2P is equal to 100 minutes of laboratory time for a 15 week term (1P is equal to 50 minutes). For example, a course consisting of 3-cr. (2+2P), would require at least 100 minutes of lecture and 100 minutes of laboratory per week for 15 weeks. E. One semester credit of field experience requires a minimum of 40 hours of direct experience. Cooperative education credits and limits are determined by the department overseeing the cooperative education. F. For undergraduate research experiences a minimum of 360 minutes per week for 15 weeks is equivalent to 1 credit. PART 4: LISTING OF COURSES IN THE CATALOG(S) A. Use of the Term \"Variable\" : The term variable in the class schedules and catalogs shall be reserved for the following courses only: 599, 600, 699 and 700. B. Listing of Credits : Courses showing variable credits X-Y (for example, 1-3) are limited to a maximum of 9 credits. That is, they may be listed for 1-9 credits, but not 1-10. Following the course description or title there should be a statement in regard to the maximum credit which may be taken for any given semester and the total maximum credits.2/3 08/25/2020 4.23 - Credit Hour Calculation; Variable Credit CoursesC.

Individual instructors may elect whether to use fractional grading (pluses and minuses) in assigning letter grades. For some courses, instructors are required to report Early Performance grades ( See Part 5 below ), and at the conclusion of all courses, instructors are required to report a final grade reflecting the instructor's assessment of each student's performance. The NMSU grading system is expressed in letters which carry numeric value used in calculating the cumulative grade-point average, as shown in this table:University Grading System Letter Grade Grade Points per Unit of Credit A+ 4.0 A 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 1/10 08/25/2020 4.55 - Grade Reports C- 2.0 D+, D, D- 1.0 F 0 Grades that are not calculated into Grade Point Averages W- Withdrawal 0 N- Grade not submitted 0 CR- Credit authorized, but not letter grade0 IP- In progress 0 RR- Progress in undergraduate course 0 PR- Progress in graduate research 0 S- Satisfactory work 0 U- Unsatisfactory work 0 I- Incomplete work 0 AU- Audit 0University Grading System Letter Grade Grade Points per Unit of Credit S grades are grades that are satisfactory to the professor and are normally equivalent to the letter grade of C- or higher. PART 2: GRADE DESIGNATIONS OTHER THAN A-F1 1 2/10 08/25/2020 4.55 - Grade Reports A. Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) : Each academic college may designate courses in which the grading will be on a basis of S or U for all students enrolled in the courses. Credits in designated S/U courses are not included in the limitations on the number of S/U credits a student may take, and are not subject to the student eligibility requirements described below.S/U grading allows the student to attempt to earn course credit without having a course grade included in their grade point average calculations. Under S/U grading, the instructor assigns an S grade for satisfactory achievement of the course learning objectives (normally equivalent to the letter grade of C- or higher) and a U grade for unsatisfactory performance in the class. 1. Undergraduate Students : The S/U option must be elected as part of the course registration and may not be added once the course registration period closes. Other than honors courses and courses officially designed as S/U, the following limitations apply to courses in which the S/U option is elected. a. No more than 7 credits per semester or 4 credits per summer session. b. Not to exceed a total of 21 credits towards a degree. c. Not a required course for the student's major. 2. Graduate Students : With an approval from their advisor and department head, graduate students in good academic standing may elect the S/U option, at the time of registration, for courses taken outside the major department, subject to the regulations stated below: 1. No more than a total of 6 credits of elected S/U courses are permitted in the master's degree. 2. Doctoral candidates may take an additional 6 credits under the S/U option after application to candidacy. B. RR Grade: The letter grade of RR is assigned only in undergraduate developmental courses (CCDE, CCDL, CCDM & CCDR) and indicates that the student has made substantial progress toward completing the requirements of the course. It carries neither penalty nor credit, so a student must re-enroll and successfully complete the course in order to earn credit. The grade of RR may be received only once in any given course, and is a permanent notation on the student's transcript. C. W Grade : The letter grade of W (Withdrawal) is assigned only in courses when the student withdraws or is administratively dis-enrolled from the course after the last day to drop the course. The W grade is permanent. D. I Grade : The letter grade of I (Incomplete) is assigned for passable3/10 08/25/2020 4.55 - Grade Reports work that could not be completed due to circumstances beyond the student's control that develop after the last day to withdraw from the course. In no case is an I grade to be used to avoid the assigning of D, F, U or RR grades for marginal or failing work. Examples of appropriate circumstances include documented illness, documented death or crisis in the student's immediate family, unexpected military deployment and similar circumstances. Other job-related circumstances are generally not appropriate grounds for assigning an I grade. Under no circumstances should the instructor retain any medical records or indicate the specifics of any medical condition in the academic records.The refusal to grant an I grade may be appealed in the same manner as any other final grade.To assign an I grade, the instructor must complete the \"I Grade Information Form\" and have the form delivered to the Associate Dean of the college under which the course is taught. The instructor must indicate on the form whether the student will be given the option to complete the remaining coursework and have the I grade changed to the earned letter grade. If so, the instructor should indicate the steps necessary to complete the remaining coursework. The I grade form should either be signed by the student in person, or the Associate Dean must send a copy of the document to the student's official NMSU email address, as recorded in the University Student Records Office, with a notation on the form that the student was not available for signature. The I grade will be permanent in instances where (1) the instructor did not provide an option to complete the coursework, (2) the instructor left NMSU prior to completion of the coursework and grade change, or (3) the student failed to complete the coursework by the relevant deadline, and the instructor did not indicate that the I grade would be changed to the earned grade upon failure to complete. In such instances, the student will be required to re-enroll in the course to receive credit (in which case the permanent I grade and the subsequent earned letter grade will both appear on the transcript). The student is entitled to have the I grade removed from the transcript only if, within 12 months or any earlier deadline established by the instructor on the \"I Grade Information Form\" and prior to graduation, the student completes the remaining coursework, as specified on the Form, in a manner satisfactory to the instructor. If the student fails to complete the coursework, the instructor may change the I grade to any appropriate grade (including D, F or U) only if the instructor stated that this would occur on the \"I Grade Information Form.\" The instructor should assign whatever grade was earned for the entire course.4/10 08/25/2020 4.55 - Grade Reports To change the I grade, the instructor must complete a \"Change of Grade Form,\" obtain the signature of the Associate Dean for the course, and submit the form to the University Student Records Office. E. Grading in Research - PR : Grading in Research - In grading both master's and doctoral research, thesis and dissertation work in progress, the instructor reports for each enrollment period the grade PR (progress) or U (unsatisfactory) rather than a traditional letter grade.These assigned grades are permanent notations on the student's transcript. Only those credits graded PR (Progress) accumulate toward the minimum number of research credits required.PR indicates that the student has devoted an adequate amount of time to the work scheduled but does not indicate the quality. U indicates that the student has stopped work or is doing work of unacceptable quality.At the conclusion of the final examination, or when the thesis/dissertation is submitted for the final signature of the graduate dean, the instructor will report the final S or U grade for the research. If a student accumulates a total of two U (unsatisfactory) grades in courses numbered either 598, 599, 600, 699 or 700, the student will be placed on Academic Probation I. If three U (unsatisfactory) grades are reported for these courses, the student will be dismissed from the Graduate School. PART 3: GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA) Grade point average (GPA) calculations are based solely on courses taken at NMSU or under an approved National Student Exchange. The hours for any course for which no traditional letter grade is given will be included in the total number of earned hours, but is not computed in the grade-point average. Traditional letter grades are those which are used in the grade point average determination, traditional grades are A+ through F grades. In computing the overall grade-point-average, the total credits for the traditional letter grades that have been assigned is divided into the total number of grade points earned. PART 4: MINIMUM GRADE REQUIREMENTS5/10 08/25/2020 4.55 - Grade Reports A. Undergraduate Students : Undergraduate degrees require a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher for degree completion. Although D+, D, or D- can be considered passing, some departments have higher grade requirements for the courses within their program and/or their program as a whole. Students should check with their departments regarding specific course grading requirements for their particular degree program. B. Graduate Students : 1. Graduate degrees require a cumulative graduate G.P.A. of 3.0 or higher for degree completion. Although B- and C grades (including C+ and C-) earned at NMSU may be counted toward the requirements for a graduate degree in some programs, this grade does not reflect acceptable graduate-level performance and may cause the cumulative G.P.A. to fall below the 3.0 required for graduate students. Some departments have higher grading requirements for courses in their programs. 2. Courses in which a student earns a D or F grade do not ever satisfy graduate degree requirements; however, these grades will be calculated in determining the students' cumulative grade- point average. To obtain academic credit, students must retake courses in which a grade of D or F was earned. PART 5: EARLY PERFORMANCE AND PROGRESS GRADING A. Six-Week Early Performance Reporting 1. All instructors of courses numbered 100-299 will submit grades for work completed as of the sixth Friday following the date classes begin, for the regular 16-week fall and spring semesters. This requirement does not apply to summer terms nor mini- semesters. Instructors must submit the six-week early performance grades by 5:00 p.m. on the Tuesday following the sixth Friday. 2. In courses numbered 300 or higher, the posting of Six-Week Early Performance Grades is optional. 3. Early Performance grades will only be used for student retention efforts, to facilitate opportunities for students to address performance issues.6/10 08/25/2020 4.55 - Grade Reports B. Academic Progress Reports Upon Student Request : Prior to the last day to withdraw from a course, upon request by the student, instructors will provide information to students about their progress in the course. PART 6: DEADLINE TO SUBMIT FINAL GRADES The deadline for submission of final grades will be 5 p.m. on the second working day after the last day of classes at the end of the semester or as assigned by the official academic calendar, whichever is later. Final grades are recorded on the student's transcript. PART 7: POSTING GRADES: PROTECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION A. Protection of Personally Identifying Information : Protected personally identifying information, such as names, social security numbers and/or Banner I.D. numbers, in whole or in part, shall not be used for the purpose of publicly posting student grades, unless specific written permission (signed and dated) has been obtained from the student prior to grades being posted. B. Posting of Grades : It is permissible to publicly post student grades without consent only if it is done in a manner that is not personally identifiable - e.g., the faculty member assigns a unique identifier to each student for this purpose, and the identifier is kept confidential and known only to the student and the faculty member. PART 8: RETENTION OF GRADING RECORDS Individual assignments and exams that are not returned to students should be retained by the instructor or department through the end of the subsequent regular semester. The records used to compute individual final grades should be retained for two years after the completion of a course. If7/10 08/25/2020 4.55 - Grade Reports a final grade is appealed, these records must be kept for at least two years after the completion of the appeal. Departments, colleges or the library may require that records be kept for longer periods. PART 9: EFFECT OF CHANGE IN GRADE ON ACADEMIC STANDING A. Effect of Change in Grade : The effect of a change of grade on a student's academic standing (scholastic warning, probation or suspension) depends on the date the transaction is officially recorded on the student's academic record. If the transaction is recorded before the student begins another semester, the grade change (such as replacing the I grade with an earned grade) is included in the grade- point average calculation in order to establish the student's academic standing. If the transaction is recorded after the student begins another semester, for the purpose of calculating academic standing, the new grade is included with any other grades earned for the semester in which the grade change is processed. 8/10 08/25/2020 4.55 - Grade Reports B. Repeating Courses for Change in Grade : Single courses may be attempted for a total of three times. Students who do not pass a course within three attempts must obtain permission from their Academic Associate Dean to enroll in the course. Academic colleges and departments may enforce additional restrictions regarding the number of times a course can be repeated. For purposes of a change in grade, attempts will not include \"W\" (Withdrawal) grades. Courses that have variable credits and/or have a published maximum repeat allowable for student enrollment are excluded from this policy. 1. Undergraduate : Undergraduate students may repeat courses, for a change in grade, when the original grade earned was a D or F. Once a grade of C- or better is earned, the course will then be substituted in the calculation of the grade-point-average and students will no longer be able to repeat that course for change of grade purposes. Student transcripts will continue to show the grade awarded for each course attempt, but only the higher grade will be included in the GPA calculations. If the student's original grade was a D and the student repeats the course, but receives an F, the second grade will not be substituted for the original. Repeat options apply only to courses that were completed prior to the time a student was awarded a degree. 2. Graduate : Graduate students may repeat courses to achieve a higher grade, but the grade assigned for each attempt will remain on the transcript and will be counted in the grade point average calculation.

The rule also authorizes the policy administrator to issue standard operating procedures (SOPs) to facilitate implementation by students, faculty and administrators. A summary or other graphic describing this rule and the SOPs will continue to be published in the campus catalogs. PART 2: RULES GOVERNING TRANSFER CREDIT 1.General Requirements: Credit will be awarded for transfer courses as follows: 12/02/2021 4.61 - Transfer Credit2 / 71. 1. Grades earned in courses taken at other institutions are not included in the calculation of the NMSU GPA, except for grades earned by approved National Student Exchange students. 2. A grade of D or better is required to grant NMSU credit for courses identified as having an NMSU equivalent. 3. Colleges or departments may require a grade of C- or higher for courses required in their programs. 4. Each college determines which transferred courses are applicable toward a degree or a minor. 5. Transcripts may need to be reevaluated when students transfer from one NMSU campus or College to another. 6. Currently enrolled students must obtain prior approval from their academic department head and dean before courses taken at another institution will be applied toward meeting NMSU graduation requirements. 7. Requests for transfer of credits earned at a non-U.S. university must include a professional foreign credit evaluation report from a member institution of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES) . 8. Courses for which NMSU does not have a direct equivalent may be transferred for elective credits (\"E\") in accordance with the SOPs. 9. Requests for transfer credit based on graduate course work at other institutions at NMSU must have prior approval from the department head and the dean of the Graduate School before credit will be applied at NMSU. All requirements as to accreditation, course level, grades and other elements will apply. Request for Transfer of Graduate Credit forms are available online at: https://gradschool.nmsu.edu/Current%20Students/Graduate%20Forms .html 12/02/2021 4.61 - Transfer Credit3 / 72. Credit Transferred from other Institutions: Transfer credit for courses taken at other accredited institutions will be initiated by the University Student Records Office based on the evaluation levels in the SOPs associated with this policy. For courses not listed or when equivalencies are not clear, the decision will be made in collaboration with the Departmental Faculty with subject matter expertise. Transfer credit based on course equivalency of courses transcripted by other institutions will be based on where the course was actually taken. For example, a course taken at a workplace for which college credit was later awarded by an accredited institution would be treated as credit from a non-accredited institution. Credits from non-accredited institutions must be evaluated by Departmental Faculty from the relevant department after two semesters, provided the student is in good academic standing. 3. Periodic Review of Departmental Equivalents/Effective Date: Every three years, or more frequently as needed, all Departmental Faculty will review the previously approved transfer credit course equivalencies for accuracy and potential update. Such revisions may only be applied for future terms after submission of a memo to the registrar and confirmation of the transfer credit based on course equivalency. 12/02/2021 4.61 - Transfer Credit4 / 74. Credit for Prior Learning : Nontraditional students often come to a postsecondary institution bringing prior knowledge from years on the job, corporate or military training, non-college training programs, or self-study . NMSU will assess that learning and determine whether it is equivalent to the learning outcomes a student is expected to have gained in college coursework, and award credit (or advanced standing) to that student. Transfer credit based on prior learning will be assessed consistent with credit recommendations from the American Council on Education (ACE); using national standardized tests and/or as described in procedural requirements described in more detail in the SOPs associated with this policy. Transfer credit is subject to Title IV maximum time frame limits. (Seehttps://fa.nmsu.edu/terms-and-conditions) 1. Methods: The methods for assessing credit for prior learning are: 1. Credit by Examination (e.g. CLEP, AP, PEP, DANTES); 2. Credit for Military Service; 3. Workforce certifications and other workforce training documentation, which potentially may be addressed in an articulation agreement between an outside entity and NMSU (e.g. New Mexico Fire Academy). 2. Effect of Transfer Credit on GPA: Credit for Prior Learning will not be calculated into the student's GPA, and must not duplicate previously awarded credit. NMSU course repeat rules apply to transfer credit. Upon transcription of transfer credit for a NMSU course, the student will not be permitted to repeat that course for a grade that will be calculated in their GPA or affect their academic standing. 3. Evaluation Standards: Departmental Faculty will apply the Carnegie Rule of Credit when evaluating requests for credit based on prior learning. See ARP 4.63 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/4-63/). Departmental Faculty make the final determination on the total number of credits that may be awarded for prior learning, up to a maximum of CPL credits equaling no more than 50% of the credits required to obtain the credential or degree the student is pursuing, unless otherwise approved. 4. CPL Transfer Credit Decision: The decision of whether credit should be awarded CPL transfer credit rests with the Departmental Faculty teaching in the subject matter department, subject to any final review . Once the CPL transfer credit decision is final and confirmed by the University Student Records Office, the approved transfer credit will be applied consistently and equitably for similarly situated students. 12/02/2021 4.61 - Transfer Credit5 / 75. Appeal of Transfer Credit Decisions: An aggrieved student or faculty member may seek review of the transfer credit decision from the college dean, through the associate dean for academics in accordance with the timelines and process set forth in the SOPs associated with this policy . PART 3: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 1. Student: It is the student's responsibility to provide the necessary materials for consideration by Departmental Faculty of their requests for transfer credit based on course equivalencies from other institutions or based on prior learning credit. 2. Departmental Faculty: Departmental Faculty review and decide requests for transfer credit that are not already listed in course equivalencies, subject to the registrar's confirmation, and to any final review that may be requested pursuant to Part 2, Section C. 5 above. Departmental Faculty are also responsible for conducting periodic reviews of the course equivalencies within their subject matter expertise (See Part 2, Section B.) 3. University Student Records Office: The registrar is the head of the University Student Records Office. This office maintains the database of courses commonly transferred from other institutions and their NMSU equivalents and awards transfer credit based on these equivalencies. Courses not listed in the registrar's database will be individually evaluated by the University Student Records Office in consultation with the appropriate Departmental Faculty as needed. PART 4: FEES AND STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES 1. Authorization to Issue SOPs : The Office of University Student Records, in consultation with the University Program Academic Committee and the Office of the Provost as needed, is authorized to issue and post standard operating procedures (SOPs), including forms, templates, FAQs or other guidance, to facilitate the implementation of this rule. 12/02/2021 4.61 - Transfer Credit6 / 72. Fees: Exam fees are posted on the various testing services' websites, and may be linked for convenient reference by University Student Records at its website (https://records.nmsu.edu). Challenge exams are administered at the same cost as tuition for the course being challenged. NMSU Administrative processing fees, if approved in the future by appropriate university officials, will be posted by the policy administrator. PART 5: DEFINITIONS The terms listed below are defined for purposes of this policy and will be capitalized to denote such. 1. Credit for Prior Learning (CPL) Credit for Prior Learning (CPL) is a term used to describe the result of evaluations determining college-level learning that a student has acquired outside of a formal college course, for college credit. 2. Departmental Faculty: Departmental Faculty are individual faculty in the relevant academic units who have the appropriate credentials and subject matter expertise to assess the equivalency of the requested transfer credit. 3. University Program Academic Committee: The university wide committee with representative membership from academic administration from each NMSU campus.

The decision to participate in an articulation agreement with another institution(s) rests with the faculty. B. For those articulation agreements that are initiated by the New Mexico Higher Education Department, the administration will appoint a representative to the HED Statewide Articulation Task Force. The representative will consult closely with faculty in individual departments on discipline-specific course equivalencies prior to signing any articulation agreements. Department faculty must approve any changes which affect how credit is awarded in their discipline prior to implementation. Faculty approval is not required if the proposed changes are already reflected in the Course Transfer Matrix established by the University Student Records Office. ( See Transfer Credit in Undergraduate Catalog) C. In cases where a change in the current HED Articulation Agreement will affect the university's general education requirements, the representative will consult closely with the General Education Committee prior to signing any articulation agreements. The General Education Committee must approve any changes affecting the structure of the university's general education curriculum prior to its implementation. D. For those articulation agreements initiated by a university department or college, the initiating department or college will consult closely with the faculty in individual departments on discipline-specific course equivalencies prior to signing any articulation agreements. Department faculty must approve any changes in how credit is awarded in their discipline prior to implementation. Faculty approval is not required if the proposed changes are already reflected in the Course Transfer Matrix established by the University Student Records Office. ( See Transfer Credit in Undergraduate Catalog) 1/3 08/25/2020 4.62 - Articulation Agreements E. The Board of Regents endorses the concept of articulation between 2 and 4-year colleges and universities. At the university, the evaluation of transfer students' transcripts has been done by one central office for over 15 years. By centrally evaluating these transcripts, the majority of the problems with respect to articulation have been resolved. In addition, the university has prepared academic transfer guides for all two-year institutions in the state of New Mexico. To promote the continuous efficient, forward progress of students through the educational system of New Mexico, the board endorses practices and matrices which facilitate the intrastate transfer of credit and support the development and implementation of a statewide articulation plan. To this end, students awarded the Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree from an accredited New Mexico postsecondary institution will be accepted at the junior level* in baccalaureate degree-granting institutions. *Students will be allowed to register as juniors. They may be required to take lower division coursework to fulfill specific baccalaureate degree requirements. This interpretation will be published in catalogs and student transfer guides.

PART 2 - DEFINITIONS 1.Credit Hour: Conventionally, the \"Carnegie\" Credit Hour is defined as one Class Hour of contact time (with an expectation of two hours of outside work) per week over a 15 week semester. 2.Class Hour: A Class Hour must be a minimum of 50 minutes. A class must meet at least 750 minutes a semester for one credit (2250 minutes for the standard 3 credit lecture class). PART 3 - REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CREDIT HOUR CALCULATION In accordance with federal guidelines, academic Credit Hours for a course are determined by the amount of time students are engaged with the course content. NMSU's established equivalency for courses bearing academic credit reasonably approximates and is not less than: 1. One semester hour of credit is awarded for 750 minutes (12.5 hours) of faculty instruction and a minimum of 1800 minutes (30 hours) of independent student work. Students must be engaged in course activities for 2550 minutes (42.5 hours) per Credit Hour (e.g. a fifteen week semester is equivalent to one 50 minute period of instruction and two hours of out-of-class work each week), or1/4 08/25/2020 4.63 - Credit Hour Calculation; Class Schedules and Catalogs 2. At least an equivalent amount of work, as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practicum, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of Credit Hours. 3. For hybrid and online courses, which do not meet the faculty contact requirements, credit is awarded based on the equivalent face-to-face course or by assessing the amount of work required by the student. 4. For laboratory courses or courses that contain laboratories, 2P is equal to 100 minutes of laboratory time for a 15 week term (1P is equal to 50 minutes). For example, a course consisting of 3-cr. (2+2P), would require at least 100 minutes of lecture and 100 minutes of laboratory per week for 15 weeks. 5. One semester credit of field experience requires a minimum of 40 hours of direct experience. Cooperative education credits and limits are determined by the department overseeing the cooperative education. 6. For undergraduate research experiences a minimum of 360 minutes per week for 15 weeks is equivalent to 1 credit. PART 4 - LISTING OF COURSES IN THE CATALOG(S) 1. Use of the Term \"Variable\": The term variable in the class schedules and catalogs shall be reserved for the following courses only: 599, 600, 699 and 700. 2. Listing of Credits: Courses showing variable credits X-Y (for example, 1-3) are limited to a maximum of 9 credits. That is, they may be listed for 1-9 credits, but not 1-10. Following the course description or title there should be a statement in regard to the maximum credit which may be taken for any given semester and the total maximum credits. 3. Published Format: In the published class schedule the word variable following a course shall be applied to those courses in paragraph A. above. Courses referred to in paragraph A. above will be scheduled 1- 3, 1-4, etc., according to the maximum credit which may be taken for any given semester. PART 5 - APPROVAL OF NEW COURSE OFFERINGS 2/4 08/25/2020 4.63 - Credit Hour Calculation; Class Schedules and Catalogs 1. Authority of Chair of Associate Deans Academic Council : The chair of the Associate Deans Academic Council may approve the offering of new courses on a one-time-only basis if the courses are to be used in programs with special outside funding, or under the following circumstances: 1. The course responds to a special circumstance that could not be anticipated (g. , to take advantage of the expertise of someone hired in a professorial chair, such as the Gerald Thomas Chair). 2. The course responds to specific needs in a grant recently received. 3. Changes in certification requirements dictate immediate changes in the curriculum. 2. Review by University Curriculum Committee: College deans are to urge department heads to submit to the University Curriculum Committee special topics courses at the lower division, upper division and (if applicable) graduate levels. 3. Approval Authority of Associate Deans Academic Council: Associate Deans Academic Council's approval of course changes for the ensuing catalog automatically authorizes scheduling of these courses during the semesters preceding the publication of the catalog, if requested by so indicating on the course change form on the linemarked starting date .

Any undergraduate or graduate student who believes that they have been treated unjustly by an NMSU process or person may seek redress through the appropriate university process. If there is a specific policy or rule applicable to the subject matter of the student's concern, grievance or complaint (hereinafter \"grievance\"), that policy or rule and its procedures will govern. This rule provides general principles governing student grievances (Part 2); identifies the areas where a specific grievance process is available to the student (Part 3); and sets forth a general student non-academic grievance procedure to govern when no specific grievance resolution process applies (Part 4). If unsure about which process applies to a particular situation, students may obtain guidance from the dean of students or designee in the office of Student Life. PART 2: GENERAL PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO ALL STUDENT GRIEVANCES Unless in direct conflict with a specific provision in the other rules cited in Part 3, which provide distinct procedures for resolving certain types of student grievances, the following general principles apply: A.Day : When used in this rule, a day means a university business day, Monday through Friday (8:00 am to 5:00 pm), excluding official NMSU holidays and closures. 1/9 08/25/2020 5.05 - Student Grievance Procedures B. Official Correspondence : Communications relating to grievances may be delivered in person, via email using the official NMSU email account, or by U.S. mail to the address maintained in official NMSU records. C. Impartiality of Fact Finders and Decision Makers : Grievances will be investigated and resolved professionally by an objective individual not directly involved in the matter. When a conflict of interest or other type of bias is alleged, senior administration will assist to recommend or take action to ensure the appointment of an impartial decision maker. D. Legal Representation : The purpose of this rule is to allow the parties to resolve grievances at the lowest administrative level in a fair and expeditious manner, without the need for legal counsel. Grievance proceedings at NMSU are not legal proceedings and formal rules of evidence are not applicable. If any party, including the university, elects to utilize legal counsel, the attorneys may attend any meeting or proceeding to advise their client, but must not actively participate in the hearing or speak for the client. E. Non-Retaliation : Students will not be treated adversely for having filed a grievance or participated in the grievance resolution process. Claims of retaliation will be taken seriously and investigated promptly outside of the grievance process. If retaliation is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. F. Prompt Resolution : The time required to resolve a grievance will vary depending upon the nature of the claim and the extent of investigation required. The grievance resolution procedures identified in Part 3 include time deadlines which apply for that process. Grievances filed pursuant to the general student non-academic grievance process set forth in Part 4 below should be finally resolved within sixty (60) Days of the first formal filing, including the appeal process, without extenuating circumstances and notice thereof. G. Retention of Student Grievance Records : Documentation relating to student grievances will be maintained by the dean of students or designee within the office of Student Life, or by the official(s) responsible for administration of the grievance procedures identified in Part 3, with notification to the dean of students, for a minimum of the records retention period required by New Mexico law and regulations (NMAC 1.21.2.1 et seq), and no sooner than three years from the filing of the grievance, as required by NMAC 5.99.1.19 B.

Time Deadline to Initiate Grievance : Absent extenuating circumstances, a student must initiate action pursuant to this procedure within sixty (60) Days following the date that the alleged incident or issue occurred or became known to the student, whichever is later. A failure by the university to respond to the student within the applicable time limits set forth below will entitle, but not require, the student to proceed to the next step in the process. B. Grievance Steps: 1. Step 1 (Informal Grievance Resolution) : The aggrieved student may (but is not required) to attempt an informal resolution directly through written correspondence or in person discussion with the involved staff member. If the matter is not resolved informally, the student may proceed to Step 2. 2. Step 2 (Resolution of Written Grievance): The Student must submit a written grievance to the appropriate unit director or department head, who will typically serve as the grievance officer. In cases where the unit director or department head has involvement in the events leading to the grievance, the grievance may be submitted directly to the cognizant dean or vice president, who will then serve as the grievance officer, or will appoint another individual to serve in this capacity. a. The student's grievance should be in the form of a memo and clearly identify that it is a grievance, using the word \"grievance\" in the subject line. The grievance memo should also include the following: (1) identification of the respondent(s) by name and job title, if known; (2) the issue or allegations that form the basis for the grievance and points in support of the grievant's position; (3) names of individuals with personal knowledge of the facts; and (4) a statement of the relief sought or the desired outcome. 6/9 08/25/2020 5.05 - Student Grievance Procedures b. After confirming that none of the processes identified in Part 3 applies to the facts alleged in the grievance, the grievance officer will conduct additional fact finding to ascertain all relevant facts. Typically, the grievance officer will facilitate a meeting between the involved parties, or will meet with each individually. Students are entitled to bring any support person of their choice to any meeting called for the purpose of grievance resolution; such support person is not permitted to actively advocate nor speak for the grievant, unless permitted as an approved disability accommodation. After consideration of the relevant facts, the unit head or department head will issue a written decision to the student and to the named respondent(s). c. Step 2 will be concluded within twenty (20) Days of the date the grievance was received by the unit director or department head, absent extenuating circumstances and notice to the student. 7/9 08/25/2020 5.05 - Student Grievance Procedures 3. Step 3 (Appeal; Final Grievance Decision) : The decision of the unit director or department head may be appealed within five (5) Days from receipt of the written decision, by submitting a written Notice of Student Grievance Appeal to the relevant campus president who will act as, or appoint another individual to serve, as the appeal officer. a. Upon receipt of the Notice of Student Grievance Appeal, all records pertaining to consideration of the grievance will be forwarded to the appeal officer by the grievance officer. b. The appeal officer will review the matter on appeal and issue a final decision on behalf of the university. c. As part of the appeal review process, the appellant and the parties involved in the grievance will be permitted to submit their position relative to the issues raised in the Notice of Student Grievance Appeal and to rebut the information submitted by the other parties to the appeal. d. Solely at the discretion of the appeal officer, the student and the unit director or department head and/or other involved parties may be requested to attend a meeting in person to summarize their respective positions relative to the grievance decision on appeal, and to answer questions. e. The appeal officer will consider the grievance record and any additional information offered by the parties and will issue a final decision supported by the facts found by a preponderance of the evidence standard. The final decision may uphold, reverse or modify the decision of the grievance officer. Absent extenuating circumstances and notice to the student, the final decision will be issued no later than twenty five (25) Days from the date the grievance record was received by the office of the appeal officer.

This rule sets the essential expectation for academic honesty throughout the university system. This rule provides definitions and roles/responsibilities, and addresses general process issues such as confidentiality, protection from retaliation, avoidance of conflict of interest, timeliness, types of sanctions, and level of Evidence required to prove an academic integrity violation. B.Companion Rule (ARP 5.11) Provides Procedures: This rule must be read in conjunction with ARP 5.11 - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic Misconduct , which provides the specific procedures by which allegations of student academic misconduct will be investigated and resolved. Those procedural steps include: initial response upon information indicating a violation of academic integrity, fact-finding investigation, evaluation of the facts and determination of level of sanction, presentation to student for acceptance of responsibility or request for hearing, hearing and decision and opportunity for a final review if a Level II Sanction is proposed. ARP 5.10 and ARP 5.11 and appendices are collectively referred to as the Student Academic Code of Conduct. ( See Appendix ARP 5.11 - A, for flowchart diagramming the code's procedural steps). PART 2: NOTICE TO STUDENTS REGARDING ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS 1/11 08/25/2020 5.10 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Academic IntegrityThe Student Academic Code of Conduct applies throughout the NMSU system, and will be posted on the websites of the Office of the Dean of Students and the Graduate School, and may be published in the student handbook and academic catalogs by way of restatement, summarization, cross reference or electronic link. At the beginning of each academic semester or session for each course or academic program, faculty members provide a syllabus or program handbook with expectations for academic performance required by their course or program. Each student is required to comply with the Student Academic Code of Conduct, applicable ethical and other standards required by the specific discipline, as well as the specific requirements stated on each course syllabus or program handbook. PART 3: EXPECTATION OF HONESTY IN ACADEMIC MATTERS NMSU students are expected to maintain high academic, ethical, and professional standards of conduct, which requires honesty in all academic matters. Academic dishonesty may take a variety of forms, including but not limited to those listed below. (See Appendix ARP 5.10-A ). A. Cheating or Assisting to Cheat : Cheating, knowingly assisting another in committing an act of cheating, having knowledge of cheating by others and not reporting it, or other form of academic dishonesty. Cheating as used in the Student Academic Code of Conduct includes but is not limited to deceiving, tricking, defrauding, and/or otherwise taking unfair or unethical advantage of a situation to benefit someone's grade, academic standing or status. B. Misrepresentation : Misrepresentation, including non-disclosure when disclosure is required, in the completion of applications or other university records. An example of this would be concealment by a student of the fact they had attended another college or university, with associated failure to cause the registrar of that institution to submit the required transcript, whether or not credit was earned. 2/11 08/25/2020 5.10 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Academic IntegrityC. Plagiarism : The use of another person's work without acknowledgment, making it appear to be one's own. 1.

Academic Misconduct Report Form : A checklist provided by the Office of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs for use by the AI Investigator to document the allegations, the findings and the outcome in matters of alleged academic misconduct (See Appendix ARP 5.11 - B). C. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt : Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is the evidentiary standard applied in criminal cases presuming the accused to be innocent unless the fact finder is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant's guilt. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is a stricter burden of proof than Clear and Convincing Evidence, the standard to be applied in assessing whether or not the Student Academic Code of Conduct has been violated. 3/11 08/25/2020 5.10 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Academic IntegrityD. Clear and Convincing Evidence : Clear and Convincing Evidence is the amount of Evidence required by of the Student Academic Code of Conduct to prove an academic integrity violation. Clear and Convincing Evidence is that which makes it highly probable or reasonably certain that the alleged misconduct occurred. To prove a fact by Clear and Convincing Evidence requires Evidence more than a \"Preponderance of the Evidence\" and less than \"Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\". The Evidence must instantly tilt the scales in the affirmative when weighed against the Evidence in opposition. E. Course/Program Level Academic Misconduct : Course/Program Level Academic Misconduct is that which would affect a student's academic standing in a course or academic program, and may include allegations such as plagiarism on a course assignment, cheating on an exam, or alteration of a faculty member/academic administrator's grade book. For Course Level Academic Misconduct, the faculty member or appropriate academic administrator associated with the course or academic program will be responsible as the AI Investigator. F. Day : When a time limit refers to \"Day\", it refers to university work days rather than calendar Days (Monday through Friday), and excludes official university holidays and closures. G. Evidence : Evidence is the proof presented by the involved parties in support of their respective positions which the fact finder(s) assess for reliability and credibility. The Evidence takes a variety of forms and may consist of: 1. Documentation, 2. Testimony from the involved party or from witnesses, based on personal knowledge or professional expertise, 3. Video or audio recording, or 4. Other relevant information. H. Level I Sanction : Level I sanctions for intended for first time violations by undergraduate students and for less serious (e.g. unintentional) breaches of academic integrity. Level I sanctions are limited to one or more of the following: 1. Verbal warning issued in coordination with the Academic Conduct Officer, to ensure the student signs the Academic Misconduct Report Form, acknowledging receipt of the warning, and for central documentation; 2. Requirement to re-do an academic assignment; 3. Imposition of a failing grade on an assignment; or 4. Reduction of final grade in course by one letter grade.4/11 08/25/2020 5.10 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Academic IntegrityI. Level II Sanction : Level II sanctions are imposed for first time violations by graduate students, and for repeat violations and more serious breaches of academic integrity by undergraduate students. Level II sanctions are limited to one or more of the following: 1. Written reprimand issued in coordination with the Academic Conduct Officer, to ensure the student signs the Academic Misconduct Report Form, acknowledging receipt of the warning, and for central documentation; 2. Imposition of a failing grade in the course; 3. Disciplinary probation for a specified time period; 4. Disciplinary suspension for a specified time period; 5. Disciplinary dismissal for a specified time period; or 6. A notation of academic misconduct on the student's official transcript. J. Informal Meeting : An informational meeting scheduled by the Academic Conduct Officer once the facts and an appropriate sanction have been determined, to allow the parties to discuss the findings, any additional or disputed facts, and to explore whether or not the student wishes to accept responsibility and the sanction proposed, or whether the matter needs to be set for a hearing for disputed facts to be resolved by the Hearing Panel. K. Preponderance of the Evidence : Preponderance of the Evidence is an evidentiary standard in some civil cases and is a lower burden of proof than Clear and Convincing Evidence, the standard to be applied in assessing whether or not the Student Academic Code of Conduct has been violated. New Mexico law defines Preponderance of the Evidence as the greater weight of the Evidence, or that something is more likely true than not true. L. Student : Each undergraduate and graduate student has a responsibility to report any observed or reasonably suspected academic misconduct to the relevant faculty member or academic administrator or to the Academic Conduct Officer, as well as a duty to cooperate in any investigative or administrative proceeding as may be requested or required by those charged with administering the Student Academic Code of Conduct. M. Student Academic Code of Conduct : ARP 5.10 - Academic Integrity and ARP 5.11- Procedures to Respond to Allegations of StudentAcademic Misconduct together constitute the NMSU Student Academic Code of Conduct. 5/11 08/25/2020 5.10 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Academic IntegrityN. University Level Academic Misconduct : University Level Academic Misconduct is academic misconduct other than Course/Program Level Academic Misconduct.

If the student needs assistance in identifying someone to serve as advisor, the ASNMSU Supreme Court Justice will designate someone to serve in such capacity on the student's behalf. The student advisor must not actively advocate or participate in the proceedings. PART 6: GOOD FAITH AND PROTECTION FROM RETALIATION All individuals involved in the processes outlined in the Student Academic Conduct Code must act with honesty of intention when reporting, investigating and taking administrative action relating to alleged violations. Individuals who believe they are being retaliated against because they have in good faith reported a suspected violation, investigated a claim of academic dishonesty, cooperated in an investigation, testified or provided8/11 08/25/2020 5.10 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Academic Integrityother Evidence during a hearing, conducted a hearing, imposed or proposed a sanction, issued a determination or decision, or otherwise taken action authorized by the Student Academic Code of Conduct, must report the retaliation promptly. If the claim is against a student, it should be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students. If the claim is against a faculty member or other employee, it should be reported to the Office of Human Resource Services. Allegations of retaliation will be investigated independently and objectively; corrective and/or disciplinary action will be administered as warranted by the findings. PART 7: TIMELINESS AI Investigators and other officials with responsibility under the Student Academic Code of Conduct will perform their duties in a timely manner, which may include seeking an extension of time. The first request for an extension by either party will generally be granted by the Academic Conduct Officer. Second or subsequent requests for time extension from a party may be granted by the Academic Conduct Officer with consent from the other party, or when reasonable cause is shown. If the AI Investigator, any hearing official (Hearing Panel or provost and senior vice president for academic affairs or designee) or the Academic Condu ct Officer reasonably requires an extension of time, a notice will be sent to the parties, informing of the extended date by which the action will be taken, with weekly status reports until the action is concluded. All time extensions and status reports will be documented by the Academic Conduct Officer for the record. PART 8: CONFIDENTIALITY An allegation of academic dishonesty is a serious matter, and may cause harm to a student's prospective academic or professional career. The internal investigation, hearing processes, and sanctions imposed, if any, will be administered using discretion and kept confidential on a \"need to know\" basis. Any university representative or student who becomes privy to9/11 08/25/2020 5.10 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Academic Integritythe matter must maintain confidentiality. If other students are involved (e.g. as a witness), they will be instructed to maintain confidentiality. See Also ARP 5.11, Part 2, A. (Anonymous Reports). PART 9: FAIRNESS AND AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST A. Fairness Generally : NMSU officials will perform their duties required by the Student Academic Code of Conduct in a thorough and impartial manner. No individual involved in an alleged violation of the Student Academic Code of Conduct shall seek to directly or indirectly influence the outcome or obtain relief from an NMSU official. B. Resolution of Perceived and Actual Conflicts of Interest : As early as possible in the process, actual and perceived conflicts of interest should be disclosed or otherwise brought to the attention of the Academic Conduct Officer or provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, if the conflict involves the Academic Conduct officer. If a person alleged to have a conflict of interest will not voluntarily recuse themselves from an official role or duty, a decision will be made by the Academic Conduct Officer or the provost, as appropriate, to ensure a fair hearing process. The issue to be decided will be whether a reasonable person would believe that the facts presented would render the person accused of having the conflict to be unable to serve impartially. If an individual recuses themselves or is excused, alternate Hearing Panel members will be selected from the Student Academic Conduct Board, or if it involves the Academic Conduct Officer or the provost, the provost or chancellor will designate an alternate, respectively.

Chief Academic Officer for NMSU : The provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, as the chief academic officer for the university system ( See RPM, Policy 6.00 ) delegates the responsibility for holding students accountable in instances involving student academic misconduct to the officials identified in the Student Academic Code of Conduct. B. Companion Rule 5.10 - Academic Integrity : This rule must be read in conjunction with Rule 5.10 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Academic Integrity , which sets the essential expectation for academic honesty throughout the university system, provides definitions, roles and responsibilities, and addresses general process issues such as confidentiality, protection from retaliation, avoidance of conflict of interest, timeliness, types of sanctions, and level of Evidence required to prove an academic integrity violation. Rules 5.10 and 5.11 and appendices are collectively referred to as the Student Academic Code of Conduct. C. Overview of Rule 5.11 Procedures : This rule applies when faculty, academic administrators or the University Student Records Office officials observe, suspect or receive a third party report about possible academic misconduct. It provides a fair, expeditious and streamlined process by which allegations of academic misconduct will be resolved. See Appendix ARP 5.11 - A, a flowchart which diagrams the procedural steps, including initial response, fact- finding investigation, evaluation of the facts and determination of level of sanction, presentation to student for acceptance of responsibility or request for hearing, and the hearing and final review processes through final decision. 1/13 08/25/2020 5.11 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic Misconduct PART 2: INITIAL RESPONSE TO ALLEGATION A. Anonymous Reports : Anonymous complaints must be investigated. The anonymity of the reporter may affect the ability to investigate, but does not preclude an investigation. Reporters may be assured that confidentiality will be maintained to the extent possible; however, due to the need to interview witnesses and report to supervisors, absolute confidentiality is not possible. All university personnel and students involved in investigative, disciplinary, hearing or final review processes are required to maintain confidentiality. See Also ARP 5.10, Part 8 (Confidentiality). B. Determination of AI Investigator : To determine who should investigate an alleged occurrence of academic misconduct will depend upon whether it occurs in the context of a course or academic program, or whether it occurs more generally within the university. See ARP 5.10, Part 4, Definitions E. and N. Typically, the faculty member in coordination with academic administration will investigate, because the majority of the cases involve Course/Program Level Academic Misconduct. C. Use of Academic Misconduct Report Form : The Academic Misconduct Report Form is to be used by the AI Investigator to facilitate the investigation and subsequent administrative action. (See Appendix ARP 5.11 - B). No later than five Days of learning of the possible academic misconduct, the AI Investigator should document the pertinent facts and allegations on the form and confidentially transmit a copy of the partially completed form to the Academic Conduct Officer. D. Determination of Applicable Process : Sometimes, ARP 11.30 - Addressing Allegations of Misconduct in Research or ARP 5.15 - Degree Revocation or Expulsion from University may be implicated, which rules provide distinct investigation and hearing processes. The Academic Conduct Officer, in consultation with the Office of General Counsel as necessary, will assist the AI Investigator to determine the applicable rule at any stage of the investigation, typically after some fact finding. 2/13 08/25/2020 5.11 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic MisconductE. Notification to Student : Unless one of the exceptions in the subsections below applies, the Academic Conduct Officer will notify the involved student(s) about the allegations either in person or via secure official NMSU email. Notice (in the form of the partially completed Academic Misconduct Form) will be given no later than five Days from the Academic Conduct Officer's receipt of the allegations from the AI Investigator. The notice must refer the student to ARP 5.10 and 5.11 1. Notice need not be provided to the student if the Academic Conduct Officer concludes that even if the allegations asserted on the academic misconduct form were true, that the facts would not constitute a violation of academic integrity. In such circumstances, the Academic Conduct Officer will close the matter and notify the AI Investigator, and forward the documentation to the Dean of Students. 2. If the Academic Conduct Officer concludes that due to the nature of the allegations, notification to the involved student(s) would impede the investigation (e.g. Evidence might be destroyed, Evidence of collusion might be compromised). In such circumstances, the Academic Conduct Officer will coordinate with the AI Investigator and provide notice with sufficient time for the student to be able to respond to the allegations during the investigation. F. Notification to Dean(s) : When an investigation is commenced or at an appropriate time thereafter ( See E. 2. immediately above), the Academic Conduct Officer will determine the appropriate deans to inform them that a case involving a student in their college or library is pending. The graduate dean will be notified for graduate students; the dean of students will be notified when an undergraduate student is involved. PART 3: FACT FINDING INVESTIGATION 3/13 08/25/2020 5.11 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic MisconductA. Each Case is Different : Depending upon the nature of the allegations and complexity of each case, the time required for each investigation will vary. Complex cases may involve the gathering of documentation, interviewing third parties, assessing witness credibility, consulting with experts in the pertinent field, or pursing other methods and techniques aimed at discovering relevant Evidence. Other cases may not be complex, nor involve an abundance of Evidence. B. Expeditious Investigation and Resolution : It is intended that these matters will be resolved as expeditiously as possible, typically within 15 Days after the AI Investigator informs the Academic Conduct Officer of the violation of academic integrity. Time extensions may be sought, particularly for complex cases, pursuant to ARP 5.10 Part 7. C. Interview of Student During Investigation : At the appropriate time(s), depending upon the nature of the case, the charges and the evidence will be discussed with the student, to give the student an opportunity to provide additional facts, including identification of witnesses not yet interviewed who may have relevant information. PART 4: EVALUATION OF FACTS AND DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE SANCTION A. Evidentiary Standard : Clear and Convincing Evidence must be found to conclude that a violation of academic integrity has occurred. (See ARP 5.10 Part 4, Definitions D. and G.) B. Educational Requirement : Any violation of academic integrity may result in a requirement to participate in the Academic Integrity Education Program ( See ARP 5.10 Part 4. Definition A.), which may be in combination with a Level I or II sanction. ( See ARP 5.10 Part 4. Definitions H. and I.) C. Determination of Appropriate Level of Sanction : The level of sanction for an offense substantiated by an investigation will depend on the severity of the offense. An offense is considered more serious when it is a second or subsequent offense. Level I sanctions are imposed for lesser offenses by undergraduate students. Level II sanctions are imposed for serious offenses, including repeat offenses by undergraduate students. Graduate students will receive a Level II sanction for any violation of the Student Academic Code of Conduct, even for a less serious or first offense.4/13 08/25/2020 5.11 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic Misconduct1. The AI Investigator and Academic Conduct Officer must confer about the investigative findings and discuss whether they support a finding of an academic integrity violation, and if so, what type of sanction would be appropriate. If they do not reach consensus, the Academic Conduct Officer jointly with the AI Investigator will contact the appropriate dean(s) for guidance. 2. If it is concluded that the facts do not support a finding of an academic integrity violation by Clear and Convincing Evidence, the matter will be closed and the Academic Conduct Officer will record the final disposition of the matter as \"allegations not substantiated/case closed\" on the Academic Misconduct Report Form. The Academic Conduct Officer will send a copy of the form to the student, with an invitation to meet to discuss, at the student's discretion. Neither the fact of an investigation nor the lack of finding will be reflected on the student's official academic record. 5/13 08/25/2020 5.11 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic Misconduct3. If it is concluded that the facts support a finding of an academic integrity violation by Clear and Convincing Evidence, the AI Investigator will complete the Academic Misconduct Report Form indicating the facts found and the Level I Sanction to be imposed, or the Level II Sanction being proposed, attach copies or reference the supporting evidence (e.g. documentation or description of anticipated witness testimony), and send to the student, with a duplicate copy to the Academic Conduct Officer. The student must be informed that Level 1 Sanctions will be imposed (unless otherwise agreed at the Informal Meeting), in contrast with Level 2 Sanctions which are proposed pending final resolution. The student is required to respond on a form provided by the Academic Conduct Officer indicating one of the following : a. The student accepts the findings and the sanction [case will be closed and sanction imposed ]; b. The student accepts the findings, but contests the sanction [case will be set for Informal Meeting] ; c. The student contests the findings, but accepts the sanction despite not agreeing with the factual findings [case will be closed and sanction imposed] ; or d. The student contests both the findings and the sanction [Level 1 sanction will be imposed unless timing for imposition is otherwise modified during the Informal Meeting; Level 2 sanction remains proposed and case will be set for Informal Meeting] . 4. If the student does not submit the written response within 10 Days, the Academic Conduct Officer will send the parties a notice of Informal Meeting. 5. If either party does not appear for the Informal Meeting and absent emergent or other circumstances beyond the person's control, the Academic Conduct Officer will close the matter in favor of the individual who appeared for the Informal Meeting. PART 5: INFORMAL MEETING The purpose for the Informal Meeting is to bring the parties together to discuss the facts which support the finding of an academic integrity violation and the sanction, findings and sanction, explore possible6/13 08/25/2020 5.11 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic Misconductresolution, and inform about the next steps in the process. A. Mutual and Final Resolution : 1. If after discussion, the student elects to accept responsibility for the findings and the sanction, or disputes the facts yet accepts the sanction, an informal resolution will be documented on the Academic Misconduct Report Form or a supplement thereto, and must be signed by the parties. 2. If as a result of the discussion, the student provides evidence not available previously during the investigation or other mitigating facts that warrant modification to the findings or to the sanction, this will be documented by addendum to the Academic Misconduct Report Form. If the student accepts the sanction after modification to either the findings or to the sanction, the parties shall sign the addendum indicating their approval for the matter to be closed without further hearing. B. Partial Mutual Resolution : If the addendum modifying the Academic Misconduct Report Form as indicated above only partially resolves the dispute, the addendum signed by the parties must clarify the remaining issues to be heard. C. Level I Sanction or Findings Contested : If the findings or a Level 1 Sanction is contested, the Academic Conduct Officer will set the matter for hearing. Additionally, the Academic Conduct Officer may consider and grant any specific request that might be made relating to the timing or logistics of the imposition of the Level 1 Sanction, after hearing the position of each party relative to such request. D. Level II Sanction or Findings Contested : If the findings or a Level II Sanction is contested, the Academic Conduct Officer will set the matter for hearing. E. Coordination regarding Hearing Date : If the matter is contested, before the Informal Meeting is adjourned, the Academic Conduct Officer will obtain the parties' availability for the hearing to be set with a Hearing Panel. PART 6: HEARING TO CONTEST FINDINGS OR SANCTION 7/13 08/25/2020 5.11 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic MisconductA. Notice of Hearing : The Academic Conduct Officer will send notice of the hearing to the student and to the AI Investigator within five Days of the Informal Meeting, to take place no later than twenty Days from the date of that meeting, unless agreed to otherwise by the parties. The notice of hearing must be delivered via secure official NMSU email, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties. The notice must identify the date, time and location for the hearing. It must also identify the members of the Hearing Panel by name and job title, to facilitate early resolution of conflicts of interest. B. Pre-Hearing Exchange of Evidence : No later than 5 Days prior to the hearing, the parties must electronically submit to the Academic Conduct Officer and to the other party a list of witnesses and copies of the documentation they intend to present at the hearing. The Academic Conduct Officer will distribute to the Hearing Panel. If either party needs assistance in obtaining the cooperation of a witness who is either a student or an employee, the Academic Conduct Officer will work with either the Dean of Students, Graduate School Dean or Human Resource Services to ensure that the witness is notified and arrangements made for the witness to attend the hearing. Telephonic or other electronic participation should be permitted for the convenience of the witness. C. Hearing must be Recorded : The Hearing Panel and the Academic Conduct Officer must coordinate to ensure that the Evidence presented by all parties is preserved for the record, by audio or other method of recording. Documents should be identified for the record by the party who submitted the evidence. The university is not responsible to produce transcripts of the hearings, but the Academic Conduct Officer will provide a copy to the parties upon request. D. Burden of Proof : The burden of proving the academic conduct violation by Clear and Convincing Evidence is on NMSU. The AI Investigator or other academic investigator, on behalf of NMSU, must present the Evidence to the Hearing Panel first. Time will be reserved to allow NMSU to rebut Evidence presented by the student. The Hearing Panel must allot sufficient time to each party to present their case, and may set reasonable limitations as needed to maintain order and to complete the hearing in a reasonable amount of time, based on the complexity of each case.8/13 08/25/2020 5.11 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic MisconductE. Presentation of Evidence by the Parties : The parties may each present evidence to the Hearing Panel in the form of documentation, witness testimony, their own testimony, as well as in the form of questions to the other party relating to their evidence or testimony or questions to the witnesses called by the other party. The Hearing Panel may but is not required to ask questions of the parties and the witnesses. Student Advisors ( See ARP 5.10, Part 5. G.) must not actively advocate during the hearing. F. Maintaining Order During Hearing : The Hearing Panel members, or Hearing Panel chair if one is identified, or the Academic Conduct Officer are authorized to take action to maintain order and decorum during the hearing, and may recess as may be necessary or requested by the parties. G. Deliberations Outside Presence of Parties : At the conclusion of the hearing, the parties will be excused, and the Hearing Panel will deliberate and reach a majority decision. Absent a time extension (See ARP 5.10 Part 7), the Hearing Panel will issue its decision in writing within ten Days following the date of the hearing. 1. If the Hearing Panel finds an academic integrity violation, the decision must describe the Clear and Convincing Evidence in the record which supports the panel's findings and the sanction. A sanction imposed or proposed and contested by the student shall not be increased in severity by the Hearing Panel. 2. If the Hearing Panel finds insufficient evidence to support the charges, the Hearing Panel must describe the lack of Clear and Convincing Evidence. If the Hearing Panel finds insufficient evidence to support the charge and a Level I Sanction had already been imposed, the Hearing Panel must direct that the sanction be reversed. (Level II Sanctions should not have been imposed yet.) H. Decision Final for Level I Sanction : For Level I Sanctions ( See ARP 5.10 Part 4. Definition H.), the Hearing Panel's decision is final. I. Decision with Level II Sanction Must Advise of Right to Final Review : In cases where the Hearing Panel imposes a Level II sanction ( See ARP 5.10 Part 4. Definition I.), the decision must provide a reference to the parties' right to seek a final review of the findings or sanction consistent with Part 7 below. 9/13 08/25/2020 5.11 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic MisconductPART 7: RIGHT TO FINAL REVIEW OF LEVEL II SANCTION BY PROVOST and SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT for ACADEMIC AFFAIRS A. Initiation of Final Review : A student or the AI Investigator may request a final review by the Office of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs in matters involving Level II Sanctions by submitting a request for final review, attaching a copy of the Hearing Panel's decision, to the Office of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs within 5 Days after receipt of the decision. A copy of the request for final review must also be sent to the Academic Conduct Officer and to the other party. B. ACO Assembles Hearing Record for Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs : Upon receipt of the request for final review, the Academic Conduct Officer will assemble the hearing record (the Academic Misconduct Form, documentation presented by the parties and the recording of the hearing) and deliver to the Office of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. If the Academic Conduct Officer cannot provide the record within ten Days after receipt of the request for final review, the parties and the provost or designee must be notified about the need for additional time, and must notify all parties in writing when the hearing record has been delivered. C. Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Review and Final Decision : The provost and senior vice president for academic affairs will review the hearing record and issue a written final decision on behalf of the university within 20 Days after the date of receipt of the hearing record, absent notification to the parties that an extension of time is necessary, in which case the parties will be kept apprised of the status on a weekly basis until the final decision is issued. The provost or designee may uphold, reverse or modify the Hearing Panel's decision, based on Clear and Convincing Evidence in the record or based on substantial procedural error having the potential to materially affect the outcome of the hearing. The final decision will be issued to the parties, with a copy to the Academic Conduct Officer, confidentially via hand-delivery or secure official NMSU email and U.S. Mail. 10/13 08/25/2020 5.11 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic MisconductPART 8: IMPLEMENTATION OF SANCTIONS; INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL REPORTING DUTIES A. Timing for Imposition of Level II Sanctions : Level II Sanctions will be not be imposed until after the hearing and any final review has been completed. In the event the sanction involves a suspension or dismissal, implementation of the sanction may be deferred to the end of a semester, at the discretion of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. B. Administrative Action Pending Completion of Sanction : The student must comply with any sanction imposed by acceptance of responsibility at the Informal Meeting or by imposition after hearing and/or final review. University officials may take administrative action necessary to ensure that the terms of the sanction are completed before the student will be permitted to continue formal studies or extracurricular activities at NMSU (register for next semester, receive certificates or diplomas etc.) C. Impact of Allegation/Investigation on Pending Studies : Unless the disciplinary sanction specifically provides for an interim suspension for campus safety reasons, the pendency of an investigation or proceedings under the Student Academic Conduct Code will not prevent a student from attending classes they are currently enrolled in or completing extracurricular commitments. D. Findings Recorded in University Student Records Office : A finding of an academic integrity violation becomes part of the student's educational record maintained by the University Student Records Office. E. ACO Reports Final Outcome to Dean(s) : The Academic Conduct Officer will report the final outcome of each academic conduct matter to the relevant deans (e.g. course dean, major dean, library dean, honors dean, Dean of Students, graduate dean). F. ACO Reports Final Outcome to Dean of Students : In all cases, the Academic Conduct Officer will report the final outcome to the University Student Records Office and to the Office of the Dean of Students, for purposes of coordinating the update necessary to the student's educational records, and also for compliance with the institution's student conduct reporting obligations. 11/13 08/25/2020 5.11 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic MisconductPART 9: REQUESTS BASED ON NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE A. Requests Based on Alleged New Evidence : In addition to the provision at Part 5 B. above, whereby new evidence may be brought to the AI Investigator's attention during the Informal Meeting and result in amendment to the Academic Misconduct Report Form, if a party claims to have discovered new evidence relevant to the case after the completion of the investigation or other step in the proceedings which the party claims would have altered the outcome reached as of that point, it will be submitted to the Academic Conduct Officer, along with a specific request for action (e.g. request to re-open investigation, to re-open hearing or to set aside final decision). B. Review by ACO : The Academic Conduct Officer will consider whether or not that evidence reasonably should have been discovered previously, and whether the proffered evidence would have materially altered the outcome. The Academic Conduct Officer will allow the other party to provide a position statement on the request. After consideration of the position of each party, the Academic Conduct Officer is authorized to decide the appropriate procedural response and may consult with the Office of General Counsel prior to issuing a response to the parties. C. ACO Determines Relief : If the Academic Conduct Officer determines that the evidence proffered was not reasonably discoverable during the investigation, and is likely to materially alter the outcome, the Academic Conduct Officer may direct that the matter be stayed pending re-opening the investigation, re-convening the hearing or conducting a new hearing, depending upon the circumstances, to consider the additional evidence. If the final decision has been issued, the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs and Academic Conduct Officer will confer prior to the issuance of the decision on the proffered new evidence.

For the purpose of this procedure, grievances are limited to alleged violations of university policy or procedures by the university or its employees, disputes with faculty and/or alleged unfair treatment. This rule is typically used to appeal a grade the student feels was not justified. Under no condition should this rule be used when the student has allegedly violated the Student Social or Academic Code of Conduct or a contractual agreement, and at no hearing should either party have a lawyer. Any student who believes that they have been unjustly treated within the academic process may proceed as far as necessary in the steps detailed below. Should the alleged grievance not involve a faculty member or course, the student is to appeal directly to the department head or associate dean for academics in whose area or college the alleged grievance occurred. 1. Appeal to the faculty member: The student is to submit a written appeal to the faculty member within 30 days after the start of the grading period following the grading period in which the alleged grievance occurred. If the alleged grievance occurs during a summer grading period, the student is to submit an appeal no later than 30 days into the fall grading period following the summer grading period in which the alleged grievance occurred. The faculty member and the student are to discuss the problem. Within ten working days of receipt of the student's written appeal, the faculty member will send a written decision to the student and department head or appropriate unit designee. Should the course under appeal be a library course, the student or faculty member should appeal to the associate dean of the library as the next step.1/3 08/25/2020 5.13 - Undergraduate Student Academic Grievances 2. Appeal to the department head or appropriate unit designee: If a decision satisfactory to the student cannot be reached, the student may submit a written appeal to the department head or appropriate unit designee in which the course in question was taught. This is to be done within ten days of the receipt of the faculty member's written decision. The faculty member, the department head or appropriate unit designee, and the student are to meet to discuss the problem. Within ten days of this meeting, the department head or appropriate unit designee will send a written decision to the student and faculty member. 3. Appeals to the associate dean for academics or associate dean of the library: If a satisfactory decision cannot be reached among the department head or appropriate unit designee, the faculty member, and the student, the student or the faculty member may submit a written statement of appeal to the associate dean for academics of the college in which the course was taught. This is to be done within ten working days after the receipt of the written decision by the department head or appropriate unit designee. The associate dean may request a written recommendation from an Academic Appeals Board. Should this be the case, the Academic Appeals Board will conduct a hearing with the student and faculty member (not necessarily at the same time) to review the merits of the appeal. They may also ask for supporting evidence for or against the appeal. The Academic Appeals Board will submit its written recommendation to the associate dean within five working days following the conclusion of their review process. The associate dean may meet with the student, faculty member, and department head or appropriate unit designee to discuss the appeal (not necessarily at the same time). Within ten days from the last meeting, the associate dean will send their written decision to the student, faculty member, department head or appropriate unit designee, and dean. 4. Appeals to the dean: The dean of the college or the library in which the course is taught, or in whose college the alleged grievance occurred, may at the dean's discretion review the appeal upon the written request of the student or faculty member and render a final decision. An appeal to the dean is the last step in the appeals process and the dean's decision cannot be appealed further. Should the dean choose not to review the appeal, the decision of the associate dean for academics or associate dean of the library will be final.2/3 08/25/2020 5.13 - Undergraduate Student Academic Grievances 5. Exceptions to the time involved: The associate dean for academics or associate dean of the library may waive the normal time frame for appeals for compelling reasons. Regardless of circumstances, academic appeals must be initiated with the course instructor within two years of the conclusion of the grading period in which the course was taken. 6. Enrollment: A student need not be enrolled at the university to initiate an appeal. B. Academic Appeals Board : Within each college of the university and the library, an Academic Appeals Board will be appointed by the associate dean for academics to hear student appeals. Each Academic Appeals Board will consist of three faculty members and two students. C. Maintenance of records : Instructors and/or departments must keep records used to compute individual grades for two years after the completion of a course. If a grade has been appealed, these records must be kept for at least two years after completion of the appeal. Departments, colleges, or the library may require that records be kept for longer periods.

Any graduate student who believes that he or she has been unjustly treated within the academic process may proceed as far as necessary in the following steps to resolve the grievance or grade appeal. B.Steps in Grievance Process : In general, there are three levels at which an graduate student's academic grievance can be addressed: 1. Step 1: the course instructor or advisor, 2. Step 2: the department head, or 3. Step 3: the dean of the Graduate School. If the initial grievance is with an instructor or advisor, the process begins at Step 1. If the initial grievance is with a departmental committee, the process begins at Step 3. In all instances, the process must begin at the lowest possible level. C.Procedures: 1. Under normal circumstances, the student should discuss the issue with the instructor/advisor. 2. If the student is unable to resolve the issue through consultation with the faculty member, the student must submit a written memorandum detailing the grievance to the course instructor or advisor within 10 calendar days of the beginning of the following full (i.e., fall or spring) semester. The person to whom the memorandum is addressed must respond in writing within ten calendar days to the student. 1/4 08/25/2020 5.14 - Graduate Student Academic Grievances 3. If the student is not satisfied with the response from Steps 1-2, the student must submit a written appeal to the department head within ten working days of the initial decision. If the student is initiating the appeal at the departmental level, the student must do so, in writing, within ten calendar days of the beginning of the following full (i.e., fall or spring) semester. The department head must respond in writing within ten working days to the student, the instructor or advisor (if one is involved), and the dean of Graduate School. 4. If the student is not satisfied with the response from Steps 1-3, the student must submit a written grade appeal letter to the academic dean's office of the college where the course is taught. If it is a grievance against a faculty member, then the academic dean's office where the course is taught would be that of the faculty member's college. The student has ten calendar days after receiving the decision of the department head. The associate dean of the given college has ten days to collect the necessary documents to make a decision on the student's appeal or grievance. Please note that additional days may be required to collect information from the faculty and/or student involved in the case. The academic dean's office where the course is taught may convene an ad hoc committee to investigate the case. 2/4 08/25/2020 5.14 - Graduate Student Academic Grievances 5. If after the fourth step the student or any of the other parties involved is still not satisfied with the response, the student must present to the dean of the Graduate School within ten working days a formal letter that provides specific details regarding the nature of the grievance. Copies of all documents including course materials and grades must accompany the letter. In the letter, the student can request that their case be presented to the Graduate Student Appeals Board. After receiving a letter complaint (not an email), the dean of the Graduate School will determine whether the complaint has merit. The graduate dean will do so after reviewing the letters from the faculty member, the department head and the office of the academic dean as well as the materials from the student and all those involved in the case. If the graduate dean determines that the appeal does not have merit, the dean will inform the appellant and other parties, in writing, within ten working days of receiving the appeal. Please note that additional days may be required to collect information from the faculty and/or student involved in the case. If the graduate dean decides that the appeal does have merit, the dean will convene the Graduate Student Appeals Board, normally within three weeks. The Graduate Student Appeals Board will conduct, within 60 days of their convening, whatever investigations and deliberations are necessary, and will forward to the dean of the Graduate School a recommendation to resolve the grievance. 6.

Rules 5.20 through 5.26 of the Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU (ARP) collectively constitute the SSCC, which clarifies student rights and responsibilities, and the role of Student Life, overseen by the Dean of Students. Academic misconduct (e.g. cheating on an exam, plagiarism) is outside the purview of the SSCC and is governed by ARP 5.10 and 5.11 (the Student Academic Code of Conduct (SACC). The Dean of Students oversees student conduct matters for the NMSU system, including its community colleges, through the NMSU vice-president for student success. Any requirement to be fulfilled by the department of the Dean of Students under the SSCC may be addressed by the dean of students, or dean of student's designee at any campus. The SSCC establishes core values which support the standards of social conduct expected of NMSU Students. Violations of the standards, when proven by a preponderance of the evidence, will result in a consequence commensurate with the nature of the violation, and the severity of the resulting harm or level of risk of harm created. The SSCC also establishes procedures for: 1) reporting suspected or observed misconduct, 2) fact finding, 3) educational conferences, 4) issuance of Charge, and 5) hearings, sanctions and appeals. The SSCC is organized as follows:1/9 08/25/2020 5.20 - SSCC - Overview of Student Social Code of Conduct (SSCC) 5.20 SSCC - Overview of Student Social Code of Conduct (SSCC) PART 1: INTRODUCTION PART 2: CORE VALUES PART 3: DEFINITIONS AND ROLES PART 4: ADMINISTRATION OF SSCC 5.21 SSCC - Student Rights and Responsibilities 5.22 SSCC Conduct Standards 5.23 SSCC - Interim Measures 5.24 SSCC - Amnesty for Emergency Reporting PART 1: PURPOSE PART 2: REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES PART 3: SITUATIONS JUSTIFYING GRANT OF AMNESTY PART 4: AMNESTY CONDITIONED UPON COMPLIANCE PART 5: LIMITATIONS ON GRANT OF AMNESTY 5.25 SSCC - Consequences for Violation PART 1: STUDENT CONDUCT RECORD PART 2: TYPES OF SANCTIONS PART 3: GUIDELINES FOR IMPOSING SANCTIONS PART 4: PETITION FOR RELIEF FROM INDEFINITE SANCTION 5.26 SSCC - Conduct Case Procedures PART I: GENERAL GUIDANCE PART 2: CASE INITIATION PART 3: EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE2/9 08/25/2020 5.20 - SSCC - Overview of Student Social Code of Conduct (SSCC) PART 4: ASSESSMENT OF FACTS; ISSUANCE OF FORMAL CHARGE PART 5: PRE-HEARING PROCEDURES PART 6: HEARING PROCEDURES PART 7: SANCTIONING CONFERENCE IN 3.25 CASES (DISCRIMINATION AND TITLE IX) PART 8: APPEAL PROCEDURES PART 2: CORE VALUES The core values that underpin the social conduct standards set forth in ARP 5.22 are as follows: A.

Respec t: NMSU Students show consideration and positive regard for each other and for members of the community, through their words and actions. E. Responsibility : NMSU Students accept responsibility for their own conduct and its impact upon self, others and the community, seeking guidance and assistance as necessary and appropriate.

The Dean of Students (or community college designee), has authority to open and pursue conduct cases, including conducting or directing investigations, educational conferences, assessment of facts and sanctions, pre- hearing tasks and hearings including the imposition of sanctions, under these circumstances: 1. Alleged Student misconduct occurs on NMSU Property; or 2. Alleged Student misconduct has a substantial nexus with NMSU Property or a substantial impact on a member of the University Community. Such an impact is recognized when the misconduct: a. substantially interferes with or causes substantial harm to the NMSU mission, its finances, or reputation; b. occurs at or in connection with an NMSU sponsored event; c. involves an NMSU official or volunteer acting in their official capacity; or d. creates a threat to the safety and security of NMSU property or any member of the NMSU Community. 3.

Concurrent NMSU Disciplinary Proceedings : Based on a Student's role within the NMSU Community, the Student may be subject to more than one set of conduct standards and consequences for the same misconduct. Examples of dual or multiple roles students may have include that of a campus resident, student athlete, member of ROTC or other student organizations, enrollment in dual credit courses or Early College High School. The various rules and processes related to each of these roles apply independently from the SSCC, and may occur concurrently; the outcome of one may or may not affect the outcome of the other process. 3. Concurrent SSCC Cases and Court Proceedings : Misconduct under this SSCC may result in proceedings under both the SSCC and civil or criminal law. Generally, an SSCC conduct case proceeds without regard to the pendency or status of any criminal investigation or other legal proceedings. Determinations made or sanctions imposed as a part of an SSCC process shall not be subject to change because criminal charges were dismissed, reduced, or resolved in favor of or against the criminal law defendant.

B.Fairness of SSCC Proceeding : Students have the right to notice that they are accused of misconduct in violation of the SSCC, and a fair and impartial process in the investigation and determination of the SSCC case. The specific procedures are described in ARP 5.26 - SSCCProcedures . C.Policy Compliance : Students are deemed to have knowledge of and are responsible for abiding by NMSU policy, rules and regulations (arp.nmsu.edu and rpm.nmsu.edu ), including but not limited to this Student Social Code of Conduct and the Student Academic Code of Conduct ( ARP 5.10 and 5.11 ). D.Non-Discrimination : Students have the right to an academic and work environment free of illegal discrimination. The NMSU Notice of Non-Discrimination is available here: https://equity.nmsu.edu/notice-of-non-discrimination/.

To request an accommodation, the Student may contact the Dean of Students directly at 575-646-1722, or the Student Accessibility Services at 575- 646-6840 (V/TTY) or sas@nmsu.edu. F. Sanction Compliance : Students must complete all sanction(s) accepted or imposed by the Hearing Officer or Appeal Officer, as appropriate, and notify the Dean of Students that the sanction(s) has been completed. G. Supportive or Protective Relief : Students may request interim academic or personal supportive or protective relief from OIE or DOS as appropriate, based on the specific circumstances relating to a conduct case. (See ARP 23-Interim Measures ) H. Use of NMSU Email Account : Students are required to check their assigned NMSU email account regularly for official correspondence relating to student status. Students are responsible for reading and responding to communications sent to their NMSU email account. A failure to participate in an SSCC conduct case based on a lack of actual knowledge of items delivered to the Student's NMSU email account is not a viable excuse or defense.

The imposition of an Interim Measure is not an indication of responsibility for a violation of the SSCC, nor a substitute for a Sanction. Interim Measures may remain in effect after the conclusion of a student conduct case. A.Nature of Interim Measure: 1. Supportive or protective measures are instituted through the Office of Institutional Equity in coordination with the NMSU Title IX Coordinator, or designee, in response to allegations of sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, or any other form of protected class discrimination. The Dean of Students may also initiate an Interim Measure in a Title IX matter consistent with Section D. below. 2. Protective measures (e.g. No Contact Orders) are instituted through the Dean of Students, or other authorized NMSU officials, in response to direct threats to the health, safety or welfare of a student or other member of the NMSU community (See ARP 16.21 - No Trespass Directive - Restricted CampusAccess ). 1/4 08/25/2020 5.23 - SSCC Interim Measures B. Examples of Interim Measures: 1. referrals to counseling or other service/resources; 2. extensions of time and other course-related adjustments; 3. modification to work or class schedules, including authorized leaves of absence; 4. campus escort services; 5. restrictions on contact between the individuals; 6. No Trespass Directive (See ARP 16.21 ); 7. other directives restricting activities on campus, changes in dining or housing arrangements; 8. increased security and monitoring of certain areas of campus; and 9. other similar accommodations. C. Purpose and Timeframe : Interim Measures support students affected by alleged violations of the SSCC, or provide for the safety and protection of members of the NMSU Community. To ensure that an Interim Measure remains necessary and effective, Interim Measures should be reassessed periodically. D. Initiation of Interim Measure : An Interim Measure may be requested by any concerned person or university official, including the involved party or the Case Administrator. 2/4 08/25/2020 5.23 - SSCC Interim Measures 1. Requests should be directed to the Dean of Students, except in conduct cases alleging unlawful discrimination (e.g. Title IX), in which case they should be directed to the Office of Institutional Equity. a. If the Dean of Students receives a request for Interim Measure relating to a Title IX or involving protected class discrimination, the Dean of Students (or community college vice president for student success) will immediately contact OIE, and may issue an Interim Measure, if appropriate, to remain in place until OIE either confirms or modifies the Interim Measures. b. The parties affected by an Interim Measure will be notified about the imposition of an Interim Measure as soon as possible. c. When imposing Interim Measures, NMSU will strive to minimize any negative impact on the affected student's education. d. To address any hardship that may result from imposition of an Interim Measure, a person subject to an Interim Measure may request reconsideration and/or modification of its terms and conditions by submitting a written petition to the vice president of student success. The scope of the review of the petition is limited to any hardship created by the Interim Measure, and should specify the relief being sought (e.g. actions requested to mitigate the hardship). The petition and the resulting decision will not address the merits of the underlying SSCC conduct case. E. Termination of Interim Measure : An Interim Measure remains in place until expiration of a period specified in the written Notice, or until modified by the office that instituted the measure if no termination date was indicated (based on either periodic monitoring by the issuing office), or upon the decision of the vice president for student success following a hardship review.

This rule encourages Students to seek help or emergency medical assistance for individuals suffering from alcohol or drug induced medical emergencies and for those victimized by sexual misconduct or other violence. Grants of amnesty as provided by this rule support Students who act responsibly to care for the welfare of others. PART 2: REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES A. When a Student observes that a person's health or safety is in jeopardy or appears to be at risk from alcohol or drug consumption, the Student should immediately seek medical assistance by calling 911. B. When a Student witnesses or is a victim of sexual misconduct or other violence, the witness or victim should immediately seek assistance by calling 911. In cases of rape or other injury, a victim should also obtain immediate medical attention from a qualified provider. PART 3: SITUATIONS JUSTIFYING GRANT OF AMNESTY 1/3 08/25/2020 5.24 - SSCC Amnesty for Emergency Reporting To encourage the reporting of potential medical emergencies resulting from alcohol or drug use, as well as the reporting of sexual misconduct or other violence that often occurs in connection with alcohol or drug use, NMSU grants amnesty from alcohol or drug related student disciplinary Charges to the following individuals: A. Students who seek emergency medical assistance for a potential drug or alcohol medical emergency in accordance with Part 2, provided that the reporting Student stays with the person at risk until medical assistance arrives and cooperates with all emergency personnel; B. Students who are witnesses or victims of sexual misconduct or other violence, and report such conduct in accordance with Part 2 above; and C. Students receiving assistance based on the emergency reporting. PART 4: AMNESTY CONDITIONED UPON COMPLIANCE A grant of amnesty is conditional; the Student must participate in a subsequent educational program deemed appropriate for the circumstances by the dean of students. In the event the Student fails to complete the educational requirements or other more extensive conditions imposed in the event of a second or subsequent grant of amnesty, such non-compliance will void the grant of amnesty, and subject the Student to action under the SSCC. PART 5: LIMITATIONS ON GRANT OF AMNESTY Any amnesty granted pursuant to this rule applies only to Student Social Code of Conduct prohibitions on the use of drugs and alcohol. This rule does not preclude nor prevent other appropriate police or legal action. Additionally, the amnesty protection is not applicable to violations of other NMSU policies that warrant disciplinary action (e.g. possession of false ID, disruptive or combative behavior, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct, sale of controlled substance, or property damage).

Despite the designation as a \"verbal warning\", the Respondent is asked to acknowledge receipt of the warning in writing. B. Written Warning : A written warning is used for minor and moderate level infractions and conduct conducive to being addressed through progressive discipline. This Sanction conveys, by formal written memo, that the Respondent's conduct did not meet NMSU standards and a change in behavior is necessary to avoid additional or more serious Charges and/or Sanctions. C. Disciplinary Probation : Disciplinary probation is a status assigned for a defined period of time for an infraction that does not create an ongoing threat or risk of harm to the NMSU Community.

Deferred Suspension : A deferred suspension may be appropriate when, but for mitigating circumstances, the misconduct would have resulted in a suspension for a defined period of time. A deferred suspension should indicate the time period that the suspension would have been for, and the deferment period should correspond to the same time period. A deferred suspension is granted subject to specified conditions. If during the period of the deferred suspension, the Respondent fails to honor the conditions set, or is found to have committed another violation of NMSU policy, the suspension previously deferred is effectuated in accordance with \"Suspension\" below. 3/7 08/25/2020 5.25 - SSCC Consequences for Violation L. Suspension : The Respondent's enrollment is suspended for a specified period of time, not to exceed one calendar year from the date of Notice.

PART 3: GUIDELINES FOR IMPOSING SANCTIONS The level of sanction is determined based on several factors. Sanctions will be commensurate with the nature of the violation and, for first and less serious violations, progressive discipline may be used as an educational tool designed to encourage behavioral change. In cases involving Title IX or other discriminatory misconduct, the Sanctions must effectively stop the offensive or harmful misconduct, prevent its re-occurrence and address its effects.4/7 08/25/2020 5.25 - SSCC Consequences for Violation A. Level of Sanction : The imposition of disciplinary Sanctions will be administered fairly and consistently, with consideration given to the following factors: 1. Prior Conduct Record: Whether the Respondent has received warning or other disciplinary Sanction for prior SSCC violations. 2. Seriousness of Conduct: The nature of the infraction and the extent of personal injury or property, financial or reputational damage caused, or the degree to which the misconduct created an unreasonable risk of serious injury or damage (whether or not injury or damage actually resulted). 3. Aggravating Factors: Aggravating factors may include pre- meditation, evidence of mal-intent or conscious disregard for the rights and welfare of others. 4. Mitigating Factors: Mitigating factors may include the absence of aggravating factors, youth, genuine remorse and acceptance of responsibility, mental incompetency or other medical conditions. B. Duration of Sanction : If the Sanction imposed is probation, loss or restriction of NMSU privileges, suspension or dismissal, then the time period will clearly be stated, and to the extent feasible, will correspond to the NMSU academic schedule (e.g. semesters, compressed course schedule).

A. Petition Requirements: The petition should explain why NMSU may expect the Respondent's conduct to comport with the SSCC in the future, including any actions Respondent has taken since the events giving rise to the Sanction that demonstrate a heightened level of personal responsibility.5/7 08/25/2020 5.25 - SSCC Consequences for Violation B. Other Factors Considered: Other factors to be considered include: 1. the nature of the violation, including the severity of personal injury, property or other damage caused and the level of risk created by Respondent's actions or inactions; 2. the academic accomplishments and status of the Respondent; 3. the best interest of the involved parties and of the institution of NMSU. C. Review of Denial of Petition: If the petition is denied, the Respondent may seek a final review from the vice president of student success who will review the same factors before rendering a final decision.

Inform about SSCC Process: The Case Administrator explains the SSCC process to the Students, and answers any questions from the Student. 3. Fact Finding: If after being informed that any facts the student shares may be used in support of disciplinary action under the SSCC, the Student wishes to discuss the case, the Case Administrator will document the information received, including exculpatory facts, and accept any records that the Student may provide in response to the allegations. 4. Facilitate Resolution: Through full and informed discussion, the Case Administrator assists the Student in deciding whether or not to accept responsibility for the alleged misconduct or, in the alternative, to allow the SSCC conduct process to continue. 4/16 08/25/2020 5.26 - SSCC Conduct Case Procedures B. Timing and Notice of Educational Conference: A Student accused of misconduct is notified and afforded an Educational Conference within a reasonable time after allegations are made or sufficient facts are known to the Dean of Students to appoint a Case Administrator to initiate a case. Generally, unless there are circumstances reasonably justifying a longer time period, this will occur within sixty (60) Days from the date the Dean of Students receives the report or complaint of alleged misconduct or Report of Inquiry from OIE in a 3.25 case. 1. A minimum of five (5) Days' Notice will be given to the Student prior to an Educational Conference. 2. The Notice includes a link to the SSCC (ARP 5.20 through ARP 5.26), and informs the Student of the following: a. the date, time and location for the conference, b. the fact that the Student is the subject of an SSCC conduct case, c. the specific factual misconduct allegation(s), and d. the potential Charge(s). e. the right to review, prior to the Educational Conference, the evidence collected as of that date relating to the alleged misconduct. 3. Where a Student is properly notified of an Educational Conference and fails to either (1) request an alternate date/time or (2) appear and participate at the Educational Conference, the Case Administrator will document the failure to appear and proceed in accordance with the SSCC. 5/16 08/25/2020 5.26 - SSCC Conduct Case Procedures C. Outcome of Educational Conference: Except in 3.25 cases investigated by OIE, the Case Administrator documents the facts asserted and evidence submitted by the Respondent, and the outcome of the Educational Conference. The possible outcomes include: 1. Respondent Rebuts/Case Dismissed: The Student provides persuasive information refuting the alleged misconduct and the Case Administrator determines that there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that the Student violated the SSCC, and the SSCC case is dismissed. This outcome does not apply in 3.25 cases. 2. Respondent Accepts Responsibility/Case Concluded: The Student, after being fully informed of the allegations and the potential Sanctions, accepts responsibility for the findings as determined by OIE or for the non-3.25 alleged misconduct and commits to fulfill the proposed Sanction. The Respondent completes and signs a form provided by the Dean of Students indicating acceptance of the proposed Charge and corresponding Sanction discussed in the conference, thereby concluding the conduct proceeding under this rule, with no right to appeal. 3. Case Proceeds: When Respondent neither accepts OIE's findings in a 3.25 case, nor accepts responsibility or provides exculpatory information in a non-3.25 case, the case proceeds to the next phase in the student conduct process. In a 3.25 case, the next phase is a sanctioning conference. In a non-3.25 case, the next phase involves issuance of a formal charge if supported by the evidence. PART 4: ASSESSMENT OF FACTS; ISSUANCE OF FORMAL CHARGE A. Evidence Collection: If the matter is not resolved in the Educational Conference, the Case Administrator obtains reports from any other offices that investigated the allegations (e.g. OIE, Housing, NMSU Police), and if the matter was not formally investigated by another unit, conducts any necessary additional investigation to ensure a full understanding of the incident or event.6/16 08/25/2020 5.26 - SSCC Conduct Case Procedures B. Assessment of Facts: 1. Once the relevant evidence (documents and witness statements) is available and complete, the Case Administrator assesses whether or not a violation of the SSCC is supported by at least a Preponderance of the Evidence. 2. If the evidence does not support the alleged violation, no formal Charge will be issued. 3. If the evidence supports the alleged violation by at least a preponderance of the evidence, a formal Charge will be issued. C. Issuance of Formal Charge: The Case Administrator sends a formal Charge describing the alleged misconduct, the section of the SSCC violated, and the range of Sanctions for said violations. The formal Charge may be combined with the Notice of the Hearing. The formal Charge must inform the Respondent of the right to schedule a time to review, before the hearing, the list of witnesses and any evidence that will be presented at the hearing. PART 5: PRE-HEARING PROCEDURES Upon receipt of a Respondent's written request for a hearing on a formal Charge, the following pre-hearing procedures apply: A. Designation of Hearing Officer : The dean of students designates the Hearing Officer for the SSCC conduct case, provides the Hearing Officer with a copy of Charge determination, and gives Notice of the appointment to the Respondent and any Complainant. The appointment is subject to the following: 1. A Hearing Officer may recuse themselves if they believe there is a conflict of interest sufficient to affect their ability to hear the case fairly and impartially. For example, a conflict of interest may result from a personal relationship with, or knowledge of the case relating to, the Complainant, Respondent or a witness. 2. A Complainant or Respondent may request a different Hearing Officer, based on facts indicating the potential for a conflict of interest or potential bias, by submitting a request in writing to the dean of students, or if the conflict involves the dean of students, Student Life's vice president for student success. An alternate Hearing Officer will be appointed when the facts are found to create a reasonable concern for potential bias.7/16 08/25/2020 5.26 - SSCC Conduct Case Procedures B. Role of Case Administrator : At the hearing, the Case Administrator facilitates the presentation of evidence relating to the alleged misconduct to the Hearing Officer, including coordination of the presentation of evidence gathered by other departments (e.g. Housing, Office of Institutional Equity). C. Duties of Hearing Officer : Consistent with the SSCC, the Hearing Officer's responsibilities include: resolving pre-hearing procedural issues; convening and conducting the fact finding hearing; issuing a written decision based upon the Preponderance of the Evidence standard, informing the Respondent and any Complainant of the right to appeal; and organizing and preserving the hearing record. The Hearing Officer makes arrangements to create an audio recording of the hearing which becomes a part of the hearing record. The Hearing Officer may also arrange for a Notary Public to place the witnesses under oath during the hearing. D. Resolution of Pre-Hearing Procedural Issues : The designated Hearing Officer determines if the case is ready to proceed at the scheduled date and time. The Hearing Officer resolves pre-hearing issues and concerns raised by a party, and provides the Case Administrator and the Respondent the opportunity to provide input. Examples of issues that commonly are raised that should be resolved before the hearing include: 1. Confirmation that all potential conflicts of interest have been disclosed and addressed; 2. Requests for reasonable accommodations based on disability; 3. Requests for time extensions; 4. Requests for procedural modifications in the interest of fairness or safety; 5. The Respondent has been provided the opportunity to review the list of witnesses and the evidence that will be presented at the hearing; 6. Resolution of any issues relating to witness availability: Case Administrators and Respondents are responsible to arrange for their respective witnesses to attend the hearing. If the witness is a Student or an NMSU employee and refuses to attend the hearing voluntarily, upon written request from the Case Administrator or the Respondent, the dean of students or designee will issue an NMSU Directive to Appear , to facilitate the witness' participation in person or by phone. 8/16 08/25/2020 5.26 - SSCC Conduct Case Procedures PART 6: HEARING PROCEDURES A. Hearing Purpose: The hearing provides the opportunity for a neutral factfinder to evaluate the available evidence as presented by the Respondent, any Complainant who chooses to participate, and the Case Administrator (or other NMSU official), to determine whether or not the SSCC violation(s) alleged in the Charge are supported by a Preponderance of the Evidence, and, where a violation is found, to review the Sanctions imposed by the Case Administrator. B. Notice of Hearing: Unless a shorter time is consented to by the parties, a minimum of ten (10) Days' Notice of the hearing date, time and location must be given to the Respondent, any Complainant, and to the Case Administrator. 9/16 08/25/2020 5.26 - SSCC Conduct Case Procedures C. Witnesses : The following procedures will apply when witnesses are called by a party to the SSCC conduct hearing: 1. Questioning of Parties: In order to preserve the educational atmosphere and to avoid creation of an adversarial proceeding, questions for witnesses are submitted to and asked through the Hearing Officer. 2. Obligation to Testify: Witnesses who are NMSU Students or employees must attend a hearing when directed (NMSU Directive to Appear) by the Dean of Students. Failure to attend may result in a separate employee or student disciplinary action for the uncooperative individual. 3. Testimonial Evidence: The Hearing Officer may require witnesses to take an oath to tell the truth, administered by a Notary Public. The Hearing Officer may exclude the use of written witness statements if the lack of an opportunity to cross examine the witness in front of the Hearing Officer is deemed prejudicial. If a necessary witness is unavailable or cannot reasonably appear, and the Hearing Officer determines that the written or recorded statement regarding the events pertaining to the issue are more probative than prejudicial, then such written statements may be allowed. Upon request, the Hearing Officer will continue the hearing to allow a party to question the witness providing written or recorded testimony. 4. Exclusion of Witness from Proceeding: The Respondent and Complainant, if any, are entitled to attend the hearing during all presentation of evidence. Other witnesses are required to wait outside the hearing room until they are called to testify and are required to leave the hearing room once dismissed by the Hearing Officer. D. Conduct of Hearing : The Hearing Officer convenes the hearing at the designated date and time, and ensures that the proceeding is audio recorded, including the resolution of any pre-hearing issues. Before the presentation of the case commences, the Hearing Officer provides the parties with an overview of the hearing process to the parties. 1. Resolution of Pre-Hearing Issues: The Hearing Officer asks parties if all pre-hearing issues have been resolved. If they have not been, the Hearing Officer addresses these issues first. If resolution of a prehearing issue will substantially impact the hearing process or outcome, the hearing should be re-set to another date and time while the parties are still present.10/16 08/25/2020 5.26 - SSCC Conduct Case Procedures 2. Opening Statements: The Hearing Officer provides each party an equal opportunity to present a brief opening statement to describe their position and the evidence they will present that supports their position relative to the Charge or the proposed Sanction. Opening statements are not required, may be limited in time by the Hearing Officer, or may be waived the parties altogether. 3. Evidence in Support of Determination: The Hearing Officer calls first on Case Administrator, or the alternate NMSU official, to present evidence and call witnesses in support of the determination on the Charge and the imposed Sanction. Respondent is given the opportunity to submit questions related to the evidence or witnesses presented by the Case Administrator, to be asked through the Hearing Officer. 4. Rebuttal: The Hearing Officer calls on Respondent to present evidence including personal testimony and the testimony of witnesses to rebut the Charge, evidence presented by Case Administrator, or proposed Sanction. The Case Administrator is given the opportunity to submit questions related to the evidence or witnesses presented by the Respondent, to be asked through the Hearing Officer. 5. Hearing Officer Questioning: The Hearing Officer may ask any question of any party or witness relating to the Charge, the evidence, or the proposed Sanction. 6. Evidentiary Issues: The hearing is not a legal proceeding and the rules of evidence used by courts do not apply to SSCC hearings. The Hearing Officer has discretion to make decisions about the relevance or admissibility of evidence, however, the exclusion of evidence should be rare and only to address possible prejudice or improper conduct by a party. If evidence is excluded, a party may summarize on the record the anticipated testimony or proffered evidence and its relevance to the case. 7. Closing Statements: The Hearing Officer provides each party an equal opportunity to present a closing statement to summarize or comment on the evidence presented and how it supports their position relative to the Charge and the proposed Sanction. Closing Statements are not required, may be limited in time by the Hearing Officer, or may be waived the parties altogether.11/16 08/25/2020 5.26 - SSCC Conduct Case Procedures E. Decision by Hearing Officer: Within five (5) Days from the date the hearing was concluded, the Hearing Officer will issue the written decision to the Respondent with factual findings and imposing a sanction, if appropriate. The Hearing Officer decision will comport with the following: 1. Findings of Fact. The decision memo or letter must clearly identify the Hearing Officer's findings of fact in support of the decision. 2. Decision to Dismiss. If the Hearing Officer does not find the Respondent responsible, the decision must state that the Charge is dismissed, and no conduct record results. 3. Sanction Review. If the Hearing Officer finds the Respondent responsible, the Hearing Officer will also review and impose appropriate Sanction(s), taking into consideration any Sanction previously proposed or imposed, the evidence presented by the Respondent, and the factors listed in ARP 5.21 Part 3. 4. Appeal Rights: The Hearing Officer's decision must inform the Respondent and the Complainant, if any, of their right to appeal the decision as provided below. 5. Time Deadlines: If the Hearing Officer needs more than time to issue the decision, a time extension may be requested. (See PART 1 above). F. Maintenance of Hearing Record : The Hearing Officer organizes and preserves the record of the fact finding hearing, including pre-hearing correspondence and notices, the audio recording, and exhibits or other evidence, labelled by the party who introduced it. The hearing record is transferred to the Dean of Students and is maintained as required by the state's record retention laws and NMSU policy. PART 7: SANCTIONING CONFERENCE IN 3.25 CASES In 3.25 cases, in lieu of the hearing process described above in PART 6, once the Office of Institutional Equity has issued findings and a determination in support of a violation of ARP 3.25, the case is referred to the dean of students for a sanctioning conference with a designated Hearing Officer.12/16 08/25/2020 5.26 - SSCC Conduct Case Procedures A. Purpose of Sanctioning Conference : The focus of the sanctioning conference shall be the determination of an appropriate Sanction(s) for a violation of ARP 5.22 Sections F.(Discrimination), G. (Discriminatory Harassment) or W. (Sexual Misconduct). B.

D. Sanction Decision and Delivery : The Hearing Officer will take into consideration information shared by the Report of Inquiry, information provided by the Respondent, nature of the incident, aggravating or mitigating circumstances, prior disciplinary history, similar cases and Sanctions imposed, educational and developmental impact for the student, and factors listed in ARP 5.21. 1. The Sanction decision will be delivered to all parties (respondent and complainant) simultaneously, meaning without substantial delay between the notifications to each. 2. Notification will be made in writing and may be delivered by one or more of the following methods: in person by the Haring Officer (or designee); mailed to the local or permanent address of the student as indicated in NMSU records; or emailed to the student's NMSU issued email account. Once mailed, emailed and/or received in-person, such notice will be presumptively delivered. E. Appeal Rights : The Hearing Officer's decision must inform the Respondent and the Complainant of their right to appeal the Sanction decision as provided below (Part 8). PART 8: APPEAL PROCEDURES 13/16 08/25/2020 5.26 - SSCC Conduct Case Procedures A. Notice of Appeal; Time Limit : A Respondent or a Complainant may appeal the Hearing Officer's decision by sending a Notice of Appeal in writing to the dean of students, within five (5) Days from receipt of the Hearing Officer's determination in either a PART 6 fact finding hearing or a PART 7 sanctioning conference. The dean of students submits the Notice of Appeal to the NMSU official designated to serve as the Appeal Officer, and ensures that each party receives a copy of the Notice of Appeal. B. Grounds for Appeal/Standard of Review: The purpose of the appeal process is to provide a limited, final review based on the hearing record, to determine if there was a substantial miscarriage of justice in the resolution of the case. To avoid summary dismissal, the appealing party must assert at least one of the following grounds for appeal, and establish that, but for the asserted grounds, a different outcome would have resulted. 1. Procedural error: Significant procedural error occurred in the processing of the case that resulted in a substantial likelihood that the outcome was affected. 2. Conflict of Interest or Bias: Objective facts demonstrate that a decision-maker was biased or had a conflict of interest of such significance that a reasonable person would not believe that the decision maker could be objective in making the decisions regarding the case. 3. Arbitrary or Capricious: The record does not reveal evidence from which a reasonable person could find that the Student engaged in the alleged misconduct by a Preponderance of the Evidence; accordingly, the decision appears to be arbitrary or capricious. 4. New Evidence: New significant evidence was discovered that was not reasonably available or discoverable at the time of the hearing, which presents a substantial likelihood that it would have affected the decision. 5. Nature/Level of Sanction: The level or nature of the Sanction imposed is not appropriate for the level or nature of the violation the Respondent is found responsible for. C. Opportunity for Non-Appealing Party to Respond : The non- appealing party may, but is not required to, submit a responsive document to the Appeal Officer providing their position on any issue raised in the Notice of Appeal within ten (10) Days from their receipt of the copy of the Notice of Appeal. The Appeal Officer considers any response from a non-appealing party before deciding whether to accept the appeal for the record review.14/16 08/25/2020 5.26 - SSCC Conduct Case Procedures D. Summary Dismissal: The Appeal Officer determines if the Notice of Appeal was timely submitted, and whether the Notice sufficiently states appropriate grounds for review of the hearing decision. If the Notice of Appeal is not timely or does not provide any description of how one of the required grounds for appeal applies to their SSCC conduct case, the appeal is summarily dismissed. E. Appeal Review: If the appeal is accepted for a record review, the following procedures will apply: 1. The Appeal Officer notifies the Dean of Students, the Respondent and the Complainant, if any, that the appeal is accepted for review. 2. The Dean of Students ensures that the hearing record is transmitted to the Appeal Officer within three (3) days of receiving the notification. 3. The Appeal Officer reviews the hearing record, including the evidence submitted by the parties, any relevant policies or law, and the arguments raised in the Notice of Appeal and any response submitted by the non-appealing party. 4. Within twenty (20) Days from the date of receipt of the SSCC hearing record, the Appeal Officer issues a final appeal decision based upon evidence in the record. The decision may uphold, modify or reverse the decision of the Hearing Officer, or in extraordinary circumstances, if necessary to ensure a just and impartial resolution, may remand the matter for a new hearing. The decision of the Appeal Officer is final. 5. The Appeal Officer provides Notice of the decision to the Respondent, the Complainant (if any) and the Dean of Students. The Appeal Officer assembles the appeal record and transfers both the hearing record and the appeal record to the Dean of Students for record retention purposes. 6. The Dean of Students is responsible for taking necessary steps to implement the decision of the Appeal Officer.

This Part describes how a student may provide that consent; Part 6 addresses exceptions from this general rule. A. NMSU officials, through the University Student Records Office, may disclose student educational records with the student's consent. 10/18/2021 5.40 - Access to Student Educational Records -FERPA Compliance 5 / 1 0B. A student is deemed to have consented to disclosure of limited information, referred to as Directory Information, unless the student opts out of the university's Directory. (See Part 6. A.) C. Additionally, a student may wish to allow third parties access to student educational records, for a variety of reasons. A form to facilitate documentation of the student's consent and waiver of privacy rights under FERPA is located at the mynmsu portal. Any signed FERPA consent, release or waiver will be honored by the University Student Records Of fice upon receipt and verification that it was signed by the student. PART 6: EXCEPTIONS TO REQUIREMENT FOR STUDENT CONSENT FERPA permits the disclosure of educational records without the student's consent when certain exceptions apply.

Consistent with NMSA 1978, \u00a7 22-11-25.1 E., both the Return to Work retiree, and NMSU shall pay to the fund an amount equal to the amount of the member contributions that would have been required under NMSA 1978 \u00a7 22-11-21 if the re-employed member had been a non-retired employee. Contributions paid pursuant to this section shall not be refunded to the employer or to the employee. C. Return to Work Provision As described below, the NM ERB does not consider limited employment with an LAU to fall within the Return to Work Program. 4/8 08/25/2020 6.15 - Re-Employment of Retirees1. ERB retirees, which includes both DBP and DCP retirees, may work for an LAU without satisfying the Return to Work Program requirements if the retiree works an amount equal to 0.25 FTE (i.e., 25% of the full- time equivalency). See Rule NMAC 2.82.2.11 (B). (Retirees working under the .25 FTE provision, whether from the Defined Benefit Plan or the Alternative Retirement Plan must be working .25 or less than a Full time Equivalency.) A retiree who works under the Return to Work Provision is not required to apply for the Return to Work Program and will not have to pay member contributions. Time worked under the Return to Work Provision does not qualify for the 12 consecutive month break in service or layout required for the Return to Work Program. If the retiree's workload exceeds 25% of what is considered full time employment, the retiree no longer is eligible for the provision. The retiree member's retirement benefit will be suspended for the duration of the employment and will return to active status. See Also Part 5. subsections E. 2 and 3 below. 2. As indicated above, Alternative Retirement Plan retirees may work for an LAU pursuant to the NM ERB's Return to Work Provision. Retired Alternative Retirement Plan participants who exceed the limitations of the Return to Work Provision will be required to pay contributions (non-refundable) at the rates established for active members as required by NMSA 1978 \u00a7 22-11-25.1 (E). See Also Executive Director's Policy Regarding Contributions By Retirees Working Pursuant to the Return to Work Program, Return to Work Contribution. See Also Part 5. subsections E. 2 and 3 below. D. Consequences for Violation of NM Educational Retirement Law 1. If a NM ERB retiree returns to employment without first completing twelve consecutive months of retirement or otherwise fails to complete other requirements for the Return to Work Program, the retiree's retirement benefits may be immediately suspended, and the retiree will also be required to pay the fund a sum equal to the retirement payments received while the retiree was ineligible, plus interest at the rate set by the Educational Retirement Board. 2. Retirees under the Alternative Retirement Program who return to work also must comply with the Return to Work Program or the Return to Work Program Provision. See Section 22-11-25.1 (E) NMSA 1978 of the Educational Retirement Act and all applicable NM ERB Return to Work rules, including Rule NMAC 2.82.5.15 and Rule NMAC 2.82.2.11 (B). See Also Executive Director's Policy, Return to Work Contribution.5/8 08/25/2020 6.15 - Re-Employment of Retirees3. Before the retiree's monthly retirement benefits will be resumed, the retiree member must certify to the NM ERB that the retiree has ceased the employment that would violate the Return to Work rules. 4. If the retiree member desires to re-qualify for the Return to Work program, the retired member shall complete the required minimum break in service. E. Additional Requirements for Re-Employment of NM ERB Retirees 1. Upon re-employment under the NM ERB Return to Work program, NM ERB retirees, which includes both DBP and DCP (Alternative Retirement Plan) retirees, shall provide to the Office of Human Resource Services, a copy of the approval granted by the NM ERB, finding the retiree eligible for participation in the Return to Work program. 2. Upon re-employment, and in accordance with the state's rule on the Return to Work provision, NM ERB retirees, which includes both DBP and DCP (Alternative Retirement Plan) retirees, shall be limited to working an amount equal to the 0.25 FTE (i.e., 25% of the full-time equivalency) in a fiscal year. It shall be the responsibility of the retiree to ensure that the NM ERB Return to Work Provision limits are not exceeded; NMSU will not be responsible for any administrative consequences imposed by the NM ERB in the event that the limitations of the exception are exceeded. 3. NM ERB retirees, which includes both DBP and DCP (Alternative Retirement Plan) retirees, who work for more than one local administrative unit covered by ERB are obligated to inform each employer about all NM ERB-covered jobs. The law requires the earnings of all NM ERB-covered jobs to be combined in the determination of whether the retiree complies with the Return to Work Provision limit on the 0.25 FTE. NM ERB retirees who work more than 25% of the full time equivalency (FTE), will be returned to active status in the Defined Benefit Plan, even if the retiree originally retired under the Alternative Retirement Plan . To avoid disruption in receipt of retirement benefits, the NM ERB retiree should ensure that the percentage FTE worked do not exceed the limits set by the NM ERB. See Part 5. subsection E. 2 above.6/8 08/25/2020 6.15 - Re-Employment of Retirees4. NM ERB retirees shall be subject to the same hiring policies and procedures as other prospective applicants, if re-employed, including the competitive hiring process required for certain positions. However, NM ERB retirees returning to faculty positions may only be employed as college non-contract faculty. 5. NM ERB retirees who are hired in a regular or non-regular term position will accrue the same number of annual leave days per fiscal year (prorated based on FTE) as regular employees. All earned annual leave must be used or forfeited by June 30th of every fiscal year. Retirees will not be paid any annual leave upon termination of employment with the university.

This rule is guided in part by the state's personnel administration, which prohibits state agency employees from hiring, promotion, or direct supervision of a person related (by blood or marriage) within the third degree; as well as by other university policies requiring disclosure of personal conflicts of interest, with appropriate action to manage or avoid the conflict. PART 2: RELATIONSHIPS WHICH CREATE A PERSONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST Persons related to each other may be employed at NMSU, conditioned upon compliance with this rule. The following types of Relationships are presumed to create a personal conflict of interest. For purposes of this rule, family is defined more broadly than in ARP 3.02 Part 2 E. and ARP 8.47.

This does not include persons sharing a facility or residence (such as a boarding house), and there is no emotional or intimate relationship. 3. Business Partner, defined as a person with whom one shares an ownership interest in a business or commercial venture. PART 3: RULES This rule promotes objective employment decisions, while also requiring the disclosure and management (when feasible) of personal conflicts of interest based on Relationship. Additional laws, regulations or contract provisions may also apply; the university will adhere to the strictest rule, law or provision. Depending upon the nature of the conflict, the timing and circumstances relating to the disclosure, the work unit or type of employment, or additional compliance requirements, it may not be feasible to manage certain personal conflicts of interest. In such cases, one or more of the employees involved in the conflict of interest will be subject to separation from service. A. Scope of Application : This rule applies throughout the NMSU system for all NMSU officials and employment classifications (e.g. regular and temporary faculty, staff and students, including post docs, work-study and graduate or teaching assistants), as well as for all types of volunteer affiliates ( ARP 2.55 - NMSU Recognition of Affiliated Individuals ). 2/6 08/25/2020 6.17 - Avoidance of Nepotism and Personal Conflicts B.

Research faculty are listed in the university catalogs under their assigned departments and are eligible for privileges accorded other faculty, such as ID cards, library privileges and faculty parking. F. They are eligible to apply for membership in the graduate faculty and, if accepted, supervise theses and dissertations or serve as the dean's representative while a member of the graduate faculty. G. Research faculty may serve as principal investigators on grant proposals. H. At the discretion of their department head or equivalent administrator, they may retain their research faculty status without pay while funding is being sought. PART 3: EXTENSION ASSOCIATE An individual hired into a Cooperative Extension Service position in regular or non-regular status, full-time or part-time, funded principally (50 percent or more) by grants or other non-permanent funds may be designated an extension associate. A. An individual hired with less than the master's degree may also be designated as extension associate and be given the courtesy title of college instructor, college assistant professor, college associate professor, or college professor. B. An extension associate cannot obtain tenure. C. When an extension associate either receives a master's degree and/or recurring state funds become available, an extension associate may be considered for appointment to tenure-track status following normal appointment rules. D. Extension associates may be notified of nonrenewal with proper notice: those in the first year of service will have 3 months' notice prior to their anniversary date; those in the second or more years of service will have 6 months' notice prior to their anniversary date. PART 4: PRIOR SERVICE 3/10 08/25/2020 6.35 - Non -Tenure Track Faculty Appointments Non-tenure-track faculty have duties and/or qualifications and/or expectations different from tenure-track faculty. Consequently, service in the non-tenure-track position will not normally count towards tenure in any subsequent tenure-track appointment. PART 5: EMPLOYMENT BASE AND STATUS The fixed-period base for employment of a non-tenure-track faculty member is a time period that may be a semester, an academic year, or a fiscal year, and the amount of assigned effort may be figured on the basis of hours per week, credits per semester, or credits per academic year. A. The full-time hourly basis is 40 hours per week. B. The full-time credit basis is 12 credits per semester or 24 credits per academic year, except in the community colleges, where the full-time credit basis is 15 credits per semester or 30 credits per academic year. C. The full-time equivalent (FTE) fraction for a non-tenure-track faculty member employed on an hourly basis is the ratio of the number of hours assigned per week to the basis of 40 hours/week. The FTE fraction for a non-tenure-track faculty member employed on a credit hour basis is the ratio of the number of credits allocated during the applicable base period to the full-time credit basis applicable for that base period. An FTE fraction of .75 or greater is considered full-time, while an FTE fraction less than .75 is considered part-time. D. A non-tenure-track faculty member employed as temporary and averaging an FTE of .67 per college or more over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible to be considered for a regular non- tenure-track appointment after appropriate advertising. If not converted to regular appointment, the employee's FTE must average less than .67 per college during each of the ensuing 2 consecutive academic years. E. A temporary faculty member averaging less than .67 FTE per college over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible for renewals of temporary appointments after appropriate reviews and approvals. F. Temporary appointments require an appointment end date on the hiring form no later than 1 calendar year after the hiring date. All temporary appointments are limited to 1 year at a time.4/10 08/25/2020 6.35 - Non -Tenure Track Faculty Appointments G. If there is no break in service, both regular and temporary non-tenure- track appointments may be renewed without advertising, after appropriate reviews and approvals. PART 6: SPECIAL APPLICATION FOR NON-TENURE- TRACK TEMPORARY COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY A non-tenure-track faculty member employed as temporary and averaging an FTE of .67 per college or more, over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible to be considered for a regular non-tenure-track appointment after appropriate advertising. (For benefits, See Salaries/Benefits) If not converted to regular appointment, the employee's FTE must average less than .67 per college during each of the ensuing 2 consecutive academic years. A temporary faculty member averaging less than .67 per college over 2 consecutive academic years may be eligible for renewals of temporary appointments after appropriate reviews and approvals. PART 7: QUALIFICATIONS Qualifications for appointment of non-tenure-track faculty are to be determined in such a manner as to be flexible enough to meet the particular needs of each unit utilizing such faculty, but minimum qualifications shall be a master's degree or equivalent experience in the field or related field for the junior ranks of instructor and assistant professor, and an earned doctorate or equivalent experience in the field or related field for the senior ranks of associate professor and professor. ( See ARP 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of all NMSU Instructors onRecord .) PART 8: APPOINTMENT AND NONRENEWAL 5/10 08/25/2020 6.35 - Non -Tenure Track Faculty Appointments Each regular or non-regular non-tenure track faculty member will be given a copy of the employing conditions, generally as an offer notification. At the time of first hire at the university, each regular or non-regular non-tenure- track faculty member should read this section of the rules and procedures, as well as the non-tenure-track promotion procedures of the appropriate college. A. Nonrenewal of a non-tenure-track appointment may be without implication of criticism or specification of cause. B. An appointment end date on the initial offer notification constitutes written notice of the end date of the appointment. In such a case, the individual concerned should be informed as soon as possible whether the individual will be offered subsequent employment following the appointment period, either as a renewal of a regular appointment or in non-regular status. C. Successive year renewals of regular appointments that specified an appointment end date may be made without advertising the position. D. If a regular appointment is not renewed for at least the succeeding semester, then it must be re-advertised. 6/10 08/25/2020 6.35 - Non -Tenure Track Faculty Appointments E. The minimum written notice of nonrenewal of a regular appointment that does not include an appointment end date on the offer notification will be as follows: 1. During the first year of service in regular status (9- or 12-month basis), 3 months' notice will be given before the end of the academic year (9-month employees) or the fiscal year (12-month employees). 2. After the first year of service, 6 months' notice before the end of the academic year (9-month employees) or the fiscal year (12- month employees) will be given. 3. Non-tenure-track faculty members employed without an ending date whose employment is contingent upon the availability of non-I&G funds shall be given at least 30 calendar days' notice of nonrenewal. 4. Providing proper notice of nonrenewal is given, the university does not have any legal obligation to provide funding for any non-tenure-track faculty member beyond the current appointment period. However, employing units are strongly encouraged to attempt to maintain a stable job environment for this type of appointment. 5. A non-tenure-track faculty member may be dismissed for cause at any time that the member's conduct becomes inimical to the students, the faculty, the educational program, or the university. 6. The provost and senior vice president for academic affairs must approve any involuntary termination for cause. 7. A non-tenure-track faculty member will have the right to appeal human resources decisions, which directly affect the member, according to university appeals procedures. ( See ARP 3.25Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct on Campus ; ARP 10.60 Faculty Grievance Review and Resolution ; and ARP 10.50 Faculty Alleged Misconduct Investigation, Discipline and Appeals Processes ) 8. Any non-tenure-track faculty member who proposes to resign shall give written notice to the immediate supervisor at the earliest time possible. PART 9: VOTING PRIVILEGES 7/10 08/25/2020 6.35 - Non -Tenure Track Faculty Appointments The tenured and tenure-track faculty in employing units of the university will decide which types and ranks of non-tenure-track faculty may vote on (1) routine departmental matters, and (2) policy matters. Should a question arise whether an issue is a routine departmental matter or a policy matter, the tenured and tenure-track faculty will decide. Non-tenure-track faculty will not vote on any faculty personnel matters. PART 10: GUIDELINES As a guideline, the total FTE of non-tenure-track faculty with the job titles of college instructor, college assistant professor, and college associate professor shall not exceed 25 percent of the total FTE for tenured, tenure- track, and non-tenure-track faculty on the main campus (community colleges excluded). Distinction will be made, if possible, between teaching and non-teaching non-tenure-track faculty in any given monitoring period. PART 11: MONITORING During each fall and spring semester the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs shall provide the following data to the chair of the Faculty Senate: The number of individuals employed by the university holding academic rank by headcount and FTE, by contract type (tenured, tenure-track, non-tenure-track), by job title and rank for each academic rank unit on the main campus, for each of the community colleges, and for all other organization units. Where these numbers include individuals whose primary employing unit is different from the academic rank unit, these data will be footnoted appropriately. The chair of the Faculty Senate will present these data to the Committee on Committees for analysis and monitoring with respect to the above guidelines. PART 12: EXEMPT EMPLOYEES HIRED AS PART TIME FACULTY8/10 08/25/2020 6.35 - Non -Tenure Track Faculty Appointments Exempt employees who wish to teach a university class for remuneration may do so if the class meets outside regularly scheduled working hours (normally 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday) and approval has been obtained from the employees supervisor and the Dean, Vice President or Campus President. Exempt employees teaching a course for remuneration during his/her regular working hours is normally inappropriate, and rather, a percentage of the person's regular salary should be paid by the beneficiary unit for the duration of the teaching service.

PART 2: RECRUITMENT CONSIDERATIONS The recruitment process for a post doctoral appointment shall include consideration of any individual who expresses an interest in such an appointment. Advertising on a local, national or international basis is optional. PART 3: TERMS OF APPOINTMENT Appointments contemplate 1.0 FTE employment for at least one (1) year, renewable annually, and not to exceed a total of five (5) years, absent an exceptional circumstance. Exceptions to reduce FTE percentage, to not less than .50 FTE, or to deviate from the minimum term of one (1) year or the maximum term of five (5) years, will require the written approval from the appropriate dean or equivalent administrator and the vice president of research. The annual term of employment shall be specific in the appointment letter or in other Office of Human Resource Services documentation. The postdoctoral appointee shall receive the benefits and privileges associated with regular employment, including leave accrual.1/3 08/25/2020 6.42 - Post - Doctoral Appointments PART 4: ANNUAL RENEWAL REQUIRED (LACK OF RENEWAL CONFIRMS END OF TERM APPOINTMENT) Sixty (60) days advance notice of annual renewal shall be given. A failure to give timely notice shall not prevent a renewal, but lack of notice of annual renewal constitutes confirmation of the end date specified on the annual appointment letter or other Office of Human Resource Services documentation. PART 5: TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT PRIOR TO END OF APPOINTMENT TERM An annual post doctoral appointment may be terminated prior to the end of the termination date specified in the appointment letter or other Office of Human Resource Services documentation for two reasons: A. For just cause, in accordance with the university's procedures governing involuntary termination of regular faculty; or B. Loss or reduction in funding affecting the position. PART 6: GRIEVANCE RIGHTS If it becomes necessary for an individual holding a post doctoral position to file a grievance, the faculty grievance procedure at ARP 10.60 FacultyGrievance Review and Resolution will apply.

PART 2: ADMINISTRATION OF GRADUATE SCHOOL REGULATIONS The dean of the Graduate School is responsible for the administration of the Graduate School's regulations. PART 3: APPOINTMENT TO GRADUATE FACULTY Staff members qualified to perform the functions of the graduate faculty are nominated by the heads of their departments for approval by the cognizant dean and the dean of the Graduate School. Before an individual is appointed to the graduate faculty, evidence of creative activity, in addition to the doctoral dissertation, is required. In implementing this approach, the department heads, the deans and the dean of the Graduate School will review all members of the graduate faculty in their colleges and invoke the review clause on individuals not meeting the minimum requirements. The Graduate Council shall maintain a standing committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments comprised of three senior graduate faculty currently serving on the Graduate Council. The standing committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments shall review and make recommendations to the dean1/3 08/25/2020 6.43 - Graduate Faculty Appointments of the Graduate School on appointment of faculty nominees to the graduate faculty. This standing committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments also shall review appointment criteria as needed. Approval will be granted in recognition of the staff member's active interest in graduate work as demonstrated by continual study, creative activity, and successful teaching. Appointment to the graduate faculty will normally require that the individual have an earned doctoral degree. PART 4: REVIEW AND RENEWAL OF GRADUATE FACULTY DESIGNATION The qualifications of each new member of the graduate faculty will be given comprehensive review by the department head, cognizant dean, and the dean of the Graduate School at the end of 3 years. The qualifications of each graduate faculty member will be reviewed every 3-5 years by the department head, cognizant dean, the Graduate Council standing committee on Graduate Faculty Appointments, and the dean of the Graduate School. PART 5: QUALIFICATIONS FOR GRADUATE COURSE TEACHING ASSIGNMENTS Selection of instructors to teach courses at the 450-499 level is left to the department head and college dean; however, such persons must have at least a master's degree. Any exceptions to this policy, rules or procedures must have prior written approval of the dean of the Graduate School. Graduate students may not assign grades to other graduate students in courses numbered above 450. Selection of individuals to teach courses numbered 500 and above is left to the department head and the college dean. The individual must have an earned doctorate, or a master's degree with extensive experience, and have evidence of creative activity. Any exceptions to this policy, rules or procedures must have the prior written approval of the dean of the Graduate School. (See next section for 600 level courses.)2/3 08/25/2020 6.43 - Graduate Faculty Appointments PART 6: QUALIFICATIONS FOR GRADUATE COMMITTEE SERVICE Members of the graduate faculty chair all graduate committees, direct master's theses, direct doctoral dissertations, teach 600-level courses, serve as representatives of the dean of the Graduate School, serve on educational specialists' exams, and serve on doctoral exams.

Teaching : This element is difficult to define precisely, but is commonly considered to include the teacher's knowledge of the field; awareness of development in the field; skill in arousing interest and evoking responses in students; skill in stimulating students to think critically, to understand the interrelationship of fields of knowledge and the application of knowledge to human problems; skills in integrating domestic and international knowledge and insights into class content; and skill in raising students' awareness about the domestic and international social, political, economic, and ethical implications of their courses of study. B. Research: This element is composed, in part, of the person's research or other creative work that indicates professional merit and interest. The results of this activity will find expression normally through accepted channels or media in the respective professional fields or in the person's teaching. Teaching and research are ordinarily closely related; it is difficult to comprehend how a person can teach well without having firsthand understanding of how the knowledge of the field is discovered. The research performance of faculty will be based on domestic and/or international scholarly activity. Annual performance evaluation of any faculty member will recognize that success in research may require long-term efforts. Promotion and tenure and annual performance raises will give equivalent consideration to research effort and success, whether domestic or international.1/9 08/25/2020 6.51 - Qualification for Faculty Appointment, Generally6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of Record arp.nmsu.edu /6-50 PART 1: PURPOSE As authorized by RPM 6.10 , this Rule establishes the minimal faculty qualifications required of NMSU Instructors of Record. PART 2: DEFINITIONS A.Subfield : A component of the discipline in which the instruction is delivered. The focus is on the course being taught and the general appropriateness of the Instructor of Record's qualifications with reference to such courses. The key consideration is whether a degree in the field or a focus in the specialization appropriately matches the courses the Instructor of Record would teach in accordance with the conventions of the academic field. B.ABD : All But Dissertation C.Instructor of Record : Includes employees hired into any faculty position, including full and part-time faculty, tenured, tenure-track and non-tenure track faculty, temporary faculty, faculty teaching dual credit and credentialed graduate students. Non-credentialed teaching assistants enrolled in a graduate program, whose teaching is supervised by faculty, for the purposes of this Rule are not considered to be an Instructor of Record, but will be listed as the Instructor of Record in the schedule of classes, and considered as such for all other purposes. D.NMSU Entity : NMSU Entity, sometimes also referred to as \"unit\", is a general term which may refer to a college, an academic department or any other individual unit within the NMSU System, including but not limited to agricultural experiment stations1/11 08/25/2020 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of RecordE. One Level Above : One Level Above refers to the degree being earned by the student and the degree Instructor of Record's degree credentials. For this rule, One Level Above for occupational education/career and technical education is a bachelor's degree. For non-occupational undergraduate courses, One Level Above is a master's degree. In graduate courses, One Level Above is the terminal degree that field. (See Part 3. B. for details and exceptions.) PART 3: REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO FACULTY QUALIFICATIONS Each NMSU Entity will ensure that its Instructors of Record have the academic preparation, the appropriate discipline, the expertise and sufficient training and/or equivalent professional experience in the area in which they teach. All Instructors of Record must meet or exceed the minimal institutional qualifications set forth in this Rule, as well as applicable requirements of accrediting bodies and state agencies. NMSU acknowledges that in order to maintain Higher Learning Commission (HLC) accreditation, the institution must be compliant with HLC minimal standards relative to faculty qualifications. A. Teaching and Learning/Quality, Resources and Support : The institution will provide: 1. An adequate number of, and appropriately qualified, Instructors of Record and staff to provide high-quality educational programs (including dual credit, contractual and consortial programs), instruction and student services. 2. Sufficient number and continuity of Instructors of Record to carry out classroom and non-classroom roles, including oversight of curriculum and expectations for student performance, establishment of academic credentials for instructional staff and involvement in assessment of student learning. 3. Sufficient processes and resources for Instructors of Record to remain current in their disciplines, adept in their teaching role, and engaged in ongoing professional development. B. Teaching and Learning/Qualifications and Credentials Required of the Instructors of Record :2/11 08/25/2020 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of Record1. Primary indicators of Instructor of Record qualifications are credentials earned. Credentials refer to degrees earned that establish the Instructor of Record's credibility as a content expert and thus competence to teach college-level content. Specifically, degrees and certificates from accredited institutions or otherwise reputable and established institutions of higher education and other areas of professional education and training provide evidence of appropriate credentialing. 2. Degree completion in a specific field enhances the depth of subject matter knowledge. All Instructors of Record should have completed a program of study and possess a degree in the discipline or Subfield (as applicable) in which they teach and/or for which they develop curricula, with coursework at least One Level Above that of the courses being taught or developed. In terminal degree programs, an Instructor of Record should possess the same level of degree for which they are providing instruction. In some cases, extensive and appropriate professional or research experience may be used to establish equivalent tested experience that may be considered in determining qualification to teach particular content. 3. Instructors of Record teaching any non-occupational undergraduate courses, including general education and dual credit, will hold a master's degree or higher in the discipline or the Subfield. If the Instructor of Record holds a master's or higher degree in a discipline or Subfield other than that in which they are teaching, the Instructor of Record must have completed a minimum of 18 graduate credit hours in the respective discipline or Subfield. A Master of Education degree or similar broad based degree will be considered appropriate qualification for Instructors of Record when it can be demonstrated that the content of that Instructor of Record's degree is sufficiently related to the discipline of the course (See Subsection B. 8. below). High school teaching experience alone is not acceptable as evidence for the content knowledge needed for discipline-specific college courses, or for discipline-specific experience. 4. Instructors of Record who do not have the minimal qualifications as described above, must meet exception criteria, and receive prior approval to begin or continue teaching. (See Subsections B. 7. and B. 8. below).3/11 08/25/2020 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of Record5. Instructors of Record teaching occupational courses (e.g. in career and technical education programs, college-level certificate programs, and occupational associate degree programs) should hold a bachelor's degree in the field and/or a combination of education, training and tested experience. In these cases, professional certificates and/or industrial experience will be identified as appropriate qualifications. (See Subsections B. 7. and B. 8. below ). It is appropriate to consider training and tested experience for instruction of technical and occupational courses. Such consideration is particularly relevant in fields where the associate's degree is the terminal degree, or where there is no degree beyond a high school diploma. Qualifications for occupational courses are applicable even in instances where technical/occupational courses may transfer into a bachelor's degree program. 6. Instructors of Record teaching in a graduate program should hold the terminal degree determined by the discipline and have a record of research, scholarship or achievement appropriate for the graduate program; or have a master's degree, equivalent scholarly experience and creative activity appropriate for the graduate program in which they teach. (See Subsection B. 7. below). In addition, Instructors of Record guiding doctoral education should have a record of scholarship and preparation to teach at the doctoral level. Research and scholarship should be appropriate to the program in which they teach, as determined by the program faculty. 7. Standardized Discipline Specific Qualification through Equivalent/Tested Experience : Instructors meeting minimal levels of qualification based on factors other than minimal degree thresholds must meet the minimal thresholds of equivalent experience/research pre-determined by program faculty, approved through the department head/equivalent, dean/equivalent, community college Vice President for Academic Affairs and provost and senior vice president for academic affairs.4/11 08/25/2020 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of Record8. Individual Discipline Specific Qualification through Equivalent/Tested Experience : Exceptions to the requirement to meet the pre-determined and approved minimal qualifications may be granted in accordance with the steps below, on a case by case basis. Exceptions will be granted only when equivalent expertise and knowledge has been clearly established. a. Department head/equivalent must submit a written request and justification for exceptions, based on the candidate's qualifications, to the college dean or community college Vice President for Academic Affairs. b. If the dean/equivalent or community college Vice President for Academic Affairs supports the request, they must forwarded the request, expressing their support for the hire and justification to the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, who makes the final decision on all requests. c. Documentation for individual exceptions, including the original credentials, will be maintained in Human Resource Services (HRS). Original documents from community college hires will be maintained by the appropriate community college's Human Resources office, with copies maintained at NMSU-Las Cruces HRS. PART 4: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES A. Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs : The provost and senior vice president for academic affairs is ultimately responsible for the verification and validation of the credentialing requirements for all Instructors of Record within the NMSU System. This is accomplished through coordination with, and in reliance upon, the senior academic administrators at each campus (academic deans and community college vice presidents for academic affairs), and with assistance from their respective HR offices.5/11 08/25/2020 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of RecordB. Academic Dean/ Division Dean through Community College Vice President Academic Affairs : During the hiring or renewal process, the academic dean, or division dean through the community college Vice President of Academic Affairs, are responsible for validation of Instructor of Record credentialing documents and for ensuring that qualifications align with course assignments for their college or community college division. Prior to an Instructor of Record's appointment with NMSU, the academic dean or community college division dean examines and approves the prospective Instructor of Record's credentials to ensure compliance with institutional and accreditation requirements. The academic dean or the division dean, through their respective community college vice president of academic affairs, will forward verified documentation, including official transcripts and translation and evaluation of foreign transcripts as needed, to HR. C. Academic Department Head or Community College Equivalent : Prior to assignment of an Instructor of Record, the department head or equivalent at the community colleges examines the prospective Instructor of Record's credentials to verify that the Instructor of Record meets the position requirements. The qualifying degree is the primary indicator that qualifies the Instructor of Record to teach a particular course. If an exception is being sought for a particular course new to the faculty member, the department head or equivalent must forward the documentation required for exceptions through the dean or community college Vice President for Academic Affairs to the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs for approval prior to the course being taught. 6/11 08/25/2020 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of RecordD. Instructors of Record : All Instructors of Record are required to provide appropriate documentation to verify their credentials. 1. Credentials include but are not limited to: resume/curriculum vitae, official transcripts, appropriate licenses or certifications, verification of work related to teaching experience and if required, documentation of equivalent/tested experience to justify alternative credentialing. 2. The cost to obtain official credentials (including necessary translation and evaluation of transcripts from institutions outside of the United States) and copies of licenses and certifications must be borne by the prospective faculty member. 3. Instructors of Record who are teaching in disciplines that require licensure and/or certification are responsible to provide documentation of licensure and certification to the department head or equivalent community college division dean. It is the responsibility of the Instructor of Record to acquire and maintain discipline-required licensure(s)/certification(s). 4. The institution may request updated documents from its faculty members to maintain credentialing records. E. ABD Instructors of Record : ABD Instructors of Record must provide an official transcript or other equivalent credentials with their terminal degree posted within one (1) year of appointment. F. Human Resources (HR) : The Human Resources office is each institution's designated repository for faculty credentials, and is responsible for maintaining official documentation of faculty credentials (including official transcripts and other documentation relevant to the faculty member's teaching qualifications). Prior to new appointments and subsequent with continued appointments, the dean will forward all such documents to HR. The dean will be notified of any discrepancies or incomplete documentation. In such cases the dean must submit the required credentialing documents for all Instructors of Record as soon as possible, and no later than the university's official census day. PART 5: PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES7/11 08/25/2020 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of RecordA. Requirement for Official Transcripts or Other Equivalent Credentials : It is the responsibility of each faculty member/Instructor of Record to provide official transcripts/credentials to NMSU. 1. Transcripts that are classified as unofficial will not be accepted in lieu of official transcripts. NMSU criteria for determining the authenticity of transcripts and other credentials includes: a. The issuing institution's official seal; b. Signature of the appropriate authorizing agent, preferably the institution's registrar; c. The institution's official stationary; d. The institution's watermark or other identifier; e. The date of issue. 2. Credentials from institutions outside of the United States must be translated and evaluated for equivalency by either a reputable external agency, or if available, by a qualified internal NMSU employee. Final approval must be granted by the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. B. Transcripts or Equivalent Credentials from Non-Accredited Institutions : Individuals whose qualifying degree is from a non- accredited institution in the United States (U.S.) will be considered on a case-by-case basis. When hiring such individuals, additional criteria must be considered, including the degree issuing institution's reputation, whether the institution is accredited or recognized by other agencies or organizations, and a thorough evaluation of the candidate's course work and experience. If such a hire is deemed desirable, the department head or equivalent must fully evaluate the faculty member's educational background and experience and document the findings in a memorandum to the dean. If the dean agrees that the individual possesses the appropriate academic preparation and experience, the dean or equivalent will forward supporting documentation with the request to hire. C. Additional or Updated Information Requests : NMSU may require an Instructor of Record to provide additional or updated documentation; it will be the responsibility of the Instructor of Record to respond in a timely manner. 8/11 08/25/2020 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of RecordD. Documentation Required Pending Receipt of, or In Lieu of, Official Credentials : On rare occasion for circumstances which inure to the benefit of the students and not convenience to administration nor to the Instructor of Record, an Instructor of Record may be permitted to commence teaching prior to receipt of official credentials and/or an official evaluation of such credentials, provided that unofficial credentials have been provided and have otherwise been authenticated. 1. In such cases, a copy of the request for official credentials must be included in the Instructor of Record's qualifications documentation. 2. In the interim, the hiring department head or equivalent will verify the Instructor of Record's degree and major field of study by contacting the awarding college/university. 3. The department head or equivalent will also attempt to confirm receipt of the credential request, and will document if there is any type of hold on the release of the credentials. 4. When the official credentials arrive, they will be forwarded to HR and placed in the Instructor of Record's file. 5. Official credentials must be submitted to HR no later than the official census day of the hiring semester. 6. In cases where an Instructor of Record's degree granting institution does not provide official credentials, the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs will render a determination after considering the academic record presented and other relevant facts and evidence pertaining to an Instructor of Record's credentials and qualifications. 9/11 08/25/2020 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of RecordE. Consequences for Non-Compliance with this Rule 1. If after the university's official census day, all required documentation relating to faculty credentials, including but not limited to the official transcript and the external evaluation of international transcripts (if applicable), has not been received by HR, the Instructor of Record will be deemed to have not met credential requirements, and will not be eligible for reappointment the following semester. a. If the documentation is received after census day, the candidate may be reconsidered for eligibility for reappointment, depending upon the circumstances for the delay in receipt of credentials, at the discretion of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. 2. Because proper credentials are a condition of employment, NMSU reserves the right to remove an Instructor of Record from a teaching or other academic assignment immediately if evidence is discovered which substantiates dishonesty materially affecting the Instructor of Record's purported academic ( See ARP10.50 ) Details Scope: NMSU System Source: ARP Chapter 6 | HR - Hiring, Work Rules and Assignments Rule Administrator: Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Last Updated: 03/14/2017 Related Cross-Reference: RPM 6.10 - Faculty and Academic Administrators ARP 10.50 - Faculty Alleged Misconduct Investigation, Discipline, and Appeals Processes Revision History: 10/11 08/25/2020 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of Record2017 Recompilation, formerly Rule 5.14 03/14/2017 Rule approved by Chancellor \u00a9 2017 New Mexico State University - Board of Regents 11/11 08/25/2020 6.50 - Faculty Credentials Required of NMSU Instructors of RecordC. Service : This element includes the person's general contributions to the organization and development of the university, and services to any local, state, national, or international agency or institution needing the specific benefits to be derived from the person's professional knowledge and skills. PART 2: SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS FOR APPOINTMENT (MAIN CAMPUS) In the following statements of required time in each rank, IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THE PERIODS STATED ARE TO BE CONSIDERED AS MINIMUM AND NOT AS MAXIMUM, UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. It is recognized that the time served in a rank at another institution should be taken into consideration. It is also recognized that the evidence of competence differs for various fields, to some extent, and standards of judgment cannot be rigidly uniform. A. JUNIOR RANKS 1. Instructor : This rank should be given to persons with advanced training who have demonstrated scholarly/creative ability. Usually, the individual will not yet have demonstrated ability to do both teaching and research independently. An instructor must have knowledge of the particular course materials and should have some intellectual vision; but need not be expected to have acquired a significant understanding and original point of view or philosophy of the general subject. In addition to such general considerations, as stated above, the specific degree requirements for this rank will normally be the master's degree or the equivalent, and except under unusual circumstances the instructor will be encouraged to be studying toward a terminal degree. 2/9 08/25/2020 6.51 - Qualification for Faculty Appointment, Generally2. Assistant Professor : To be considered for this rank, a person must have demonstrated ability in the field. It is strongly believed that a relationship exists between teaching and research, and that a good teacher or researcher must constantly remold the materials of the courses or projects in the light of new knowledge derived from the person's own creative scholarship as well as that of others. An assistant professor may be expected to have a thorough command of the subject matter of some segment of the general field of the discipline, in addition to a comprehension of the whole. In addition to such general considerations as stated above, specific degree requirements for advancement or promotion to the rank of assistant professor and, of course, applicable to the senior ranks as well, NORMALLY will be the doctor's degree. Outstanding experience and recognition in the profession outside the academic field may be considered as the equivalent of the degree requirement. B. SENIOR RANKS Appointment or promotion to either senior rank should represent an implicit prediction on the part of the department, college, and the university that the individual so appointed will make sound contributions to teaching and learning during the remainder of the individual's life. Senior rank status should occur only after careful investigation of the candidate's promise in scholarship, teaching, research, leadership, and learning. By this statement it is meant that serious attention must be given to the caliber of the candidate's professional stature, for this will probably be the key factor in determining the extent to which past performance in teaching and creative work may be expected to carry on through continuing and enlarged contributions. Services rendered to communities and agencies or organizations in the person's professional capacity shall be considered in assessing qualifications for advancement to senior ranks. 3/9 08/25/2020 6.51 - Qualification for Faculty Appointment, Generally1. Associate Professor : This person's views contribute to departmental policy. An associate professor should have competence and mature outlook over a fairly large part of the whole field. To be considered for this rank a person should expect to serve for at least 4 years as an assistant professor under normal circumstances. A candidate for an associate professorship is expected to have demonstrated capacities in the lower ranks and should offer evidence that teaching and research have kept abreast of times in method and subject matter; that a greater degree of maturity has been attained and that there has been a retention of interest in competent teaching and research. Furthermore, the candidate must have shown evidence of productivity and competent scholarship beyond that completed for the degree of the doctorate. 4/9 08/25/2020 6.51 - Qualification for Faculty Appointment, Generally2. Professor : Appointment of individuals to professorships is obviously the most critical step in determining the future of the academic caliber of the university. There should, therefore, be clear understanding of the functions and qualifications of individuals in this rank. A professor through teaching, creative activity, and service should have demonstrated substantial command of the whole field, sound scholarship, and a mature view of the discipline. Appointment or promotion to professor should not be considered to be forthcoming merely because of years of service to the university (it should not be expected based on any number of years as an associate professor) or because a continuous contract is achieved. Rather, a person being considered for a professorship is expected to have maintained all of the qualities and conditions required for tenure and the associate professor rank. In addition, a professor should exhibit special stature in the discipline, leadership and substantial strength in all areas- teaching, creative activity, and professional service. In the recommending procedures the department head and the faculty member shall submit information as follows: a. Special Stature in the Discipline : i. Teaching Performance : Data indicating performance, including innovation, enthusiasm, and contributions to activities designed for the improvement of instruction. Peer and student evaluation may be useful ingredients in determining teaching performance. ii. Creative Activity : Lists of publications, exhibits, recitals, etc. Peer evaluation both on and off campus. The direction of graduate students where appropriate to the individual's discipline. iii. Professional Service : Information showing involvement in state, regional, national, and international groups within the field and contributions to the university. Objective data showing prestige and recognition among the practitioners of the discipline. iv. Leadership : Information showing initiative, perseverance, and originality and skills in human relations. Initial appointments for faculty employed with the rank of professor may also include continuous contract. 5/9 08/25/2020 6.51 - Qualification for Faculty Appointment, GenerallyPART 3: GENERAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR APPOINTMENT (COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM) The following qualifications are listed in the order of their relative importance: teaching is more important than professional service; professional service is more important than other service; other service is more important than research. referendum A. Teaching : This element is commonly considered to include the teacher's knowledge of the field; awareness of and the application of developments in the field; skill in arousing interest and evoking responses in students; skill in stimulating students to think critically, to understand the interrelationship of fields of knowledge and the application of knowledge to human problems; and skill in awakening students to a realization of the social, political, economic, and ethical implications of their study. B. Professional Service : This element includes, above all, the faculty member's service with respect to the organization, development, and welfare of the community college and the university. This element also includes service to any individual or group needing the specific benefits of the faculty member's professional knowledge and skills. C. Other Service : This element allows a faculty member to be recognized for service to the general welfare of the community which is interrelated with the welfare of the community college. D. Research: Research or other creative work is not required at the community colleges. However, those faculty members who produce research and/or creative work should be encouraged, and such work should be considered for appointment, promotion, and tenure considerations. The academic credentials of all community college instructors will be reviewed by the community college program coordinators (when appropriate), division heads, and the chief instructional officer to meet the guidelines established by the main campus departments. Instructors must also be approved by the campus executive officer and the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. PART 4: SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS FOR APPOINTMENT (COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM)6/9 08/25/2020 6.51 - Qualification for Faculty Appointment, GenerallyIn the following statements of required time in each rank, it should be emphasized that the periods stated are to be considered as minimum and not as maximum, under normal circumstances. It is recognized that the time served in a rank at another institution should be taken into consideration. It is also recognized that the evidence for various fields, to some extent, and standards of judgment cannot be rigidly uniform. A. JUNIOR RANKS 1. Instructor : This rank should be given to persons with the necessary education and/or experience to teach within the community college concept. 2. Assistant Professor : To be considered for this rank, a person must have demonstrated the ability to teach effectively in the person's field. It is strongly believed that a good teacher must constantly remold the course or project materials in light of new knowledge derived from the teacher's own creative scholarship, as well as that of others. To be considered for this rank, a person should expect to serve at least 3 years as an instructor under normal circumstances. An assistant professor may be expected to have a thorough command of the subject matter of some segment of the general field of the discipline, in addition to a comprehension of the whole. B. SENIOR RANKS Appointment or promotion to either senior rank should represent an implicit prediction on the part of the community college that the individual so appointed will make sound contributions to teaching and learning during the remainder of the individual's life. It should be made only after careful investigation of the candidate's promise in teaching, professional service, other service, and, if applicable, research and/or creative service. By this statement, it is meant that serious attention must be given to the caliber of the candidate's professional stature, for this will probably be the key factor in determining the extent to which past performance in teaching and service may be expected to carry on through continuing and enlarged contributions. 7/9 08/25/2020 6.51 - Qualification for Faculty Appointment, Generally1. Associate Professor : An associate professor occupies a position adjunct to that of the professor. This person's views contribute to community college policy. An associate professor should have competence and mature outlook over a fairly large part of the professor's whole field. A candidate for an associate professorship is expected to have demonstrated capacities in the lower ranks and should offer evidence that the candidate's teaching has kept abreast of times in method and subject matter, that a greater degree of maturity has been attained, and that there has been a retention of interest in competent teaching and service.

Rather, a person being considered for a professorship is expected to have maintained all the qualities and conditions required for tenure and for the rank of associate professor. Additionally, a professor should exhibit special stature in the professor's discipline, in leadership, and in both teaching and service.

The faculty and administration recognize that quality education is based on and will occur as the result of interaction and contact between professionally competent faculty and adequately prepared students. Statements in this manual which are concerned with assignment of faculty load and with the award of academic credit are expressed generally in terms of the amount of contact occurring between faculty and students. In practice, many academic efforts, having little or nothing to do with the amount of contact per se , are nevertheless quantified and rewarded in terms of the credit hours. Such cases are covered by prior approvals among students, faculty and administrators. This Rule is based on the following: PART 1: TEACHING Refers to activities related to courses given in a current term, such as meeting scheduled classes, grading, preparing lectures, evaluating students, reading student papers, academic advising, supervising teaching assistants, and supervising laboratories. Ordinarily, scheduled class meetings will equal at least 750 minutes per semester per credit hour. Refers to the statewide non-credit teaching activities of members of the Cooperative Extension Service, and other university faculty members, such as conducting seminars, meetings, workshops and consultations with ranchers, farmers, businessmen, homemakers, community leaders and other citizens of the State, and the preparation of educational materials- bulletins, newsletters, news articles, radio and television programs, and self- teaching programs. PART 2: RESEARCH AND OTHER CREATIVE ENDEAVORS1/3 08/25/2020 6.60 - Faculty Assignments - GeneralRefers to activities in the faculty member's area of responsibility related to a specific project, such as performing a professional skill, writing or developing research proposals, statistical consulting, writing articles and/or books and/or reviews, creating a new art form(s), performing departmental and/or sponsored research, giving recitals, maintaining an artistic skill. PART 3: PROFESSIONAL AND PUBLIC SERVICE Refers to activities related to maintaining expertise in a professional field and activities performed to benefit the community outside the institution, respectively. Specific activities in this category include attending professional meetings and/or seminars, editing a journal, serving as an officer in a professional society, consulting, performing professionally as in plays or orchestras, participating in lectures or seminars for the public, and involving oneself in community activities such as civic clubs, agricultural or urban extension services. PART 4: INTERNAL UNIVERSITY ACTIVITIES A. General contact with students, such as : counseling; preparing recommendations; participating in social interaction; recruiting students; sponsoring student organizations; meeting with parents; attending student recitals; coaching intramural or intercollegiate athletics; directing the band, orchestra, student plays, debate team, or other student groups. B. Committee participation, such as : attending departmental meetings; Faculty Senate; promotion and tenure committees; planning committees; or admission committees. C. Administrative duties, such as : performing the duties of a department head, dean, vice president, or any other administrator; keeping records; preparing minutes; writing and answering memoranda; assigning faculty course loads; preparing budgets; gathering data; helping during registration; interviewing candidates for faculty positions; advising on library purchases; escorting visitors.2/3 08/25/2020 Assignments - GeneralDetails Scope: NMSU System Source: ARP Chapter 6 | HR - Hiring, Work Rules and Assignments Rule Administrator: Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Last Updated: Not Available Related Cross-Reference: Revision History: 2017 Recompilation, formerly Rule 5.20 \u00a9 2017 University - Board of Regents 3/3 08/25/2020 6.60 - Faculty Assignments - General6.61 - Assignments - Teaching Load arp.nmsu.edu /6-61 PART 1: PURPOSE Faculty members perform a wide variety of tasks determined by the requirements of their discipline and by the mission of the university. Accordingly their workload will vary from individual to individual and over time for a particular individual. The purpose of this Rule is to establish a fair and equitable allocation of workload among faculty taking into account the interests of the faculty and the needs of the university. Recognizing the complex role played by faculty in the university setting, the primary responsibility for establishing workloads shall rest with the departments or equivalent administrative unit. PART 2: SCOPE OF APPLICATION The rules set out here apply to faculty time financed from instruction and general (I & G) funds. Faculty time not financed by I & G funds is not covered by these rules. Faculty time partially funded from I & G shall be prorated. PART 3: TEACHING LOAD, GENERALLY, FOR NMSU LC FACULTY A faculty member employed on the Las Cruces (Main) Campus budgeted exclusively from I&G funds will normally be responsible for the equivalent of teaching 12 credits per semester. The faculty member may be expected 1/5 08/25/2020 6.61 - Assignments - Teaching Loadto participate in some scholarly and creative activity, professional and/or public service, or internal service to the university. Significant work of this kind reduces the faculty member's responsibility for formal instruction. PART 4: TEACHING LOAD, GENERALLY, FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY The teaching load for community college faculty members will usually be the equivalent of 15 credits a semester or from 27 to 30 credits an academic year The teaching load shall be prorated for short courses or courses taught over part of a semesters. PART 5: EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF WORKLOAD A. Executive Administration: The provost and senior vice president for academic affairs and Chancellor shall seek to allocate faculty resources among departments or equivalent administrative units, taking account of internal and external constraints, so as to distribute workload in a fair and equitable manner. Factors that may be considered in allocating resources include accreditation, workloads at peer institutions, national disciplinary norms, and retention of faculty, the needs of new programs, credit hour production, legislative mandates, and other factors. B. Dean or Equivalent : Within each college or equivalent unit, the college dean or equivalent administrator shall seek to allocate faculty resources within their college or equivalent unit in order to achieve a fair and equitable workload. When inequitable workloads arise, it shall be the responsibility of the dean or equivalent administrator to rectify the inequality. PART 6: DEPARTMENTAL WORKLOAD POLICY 2/5 08/25/2020 6.61 - Assignments - Teaching LoadA. Departments and equivalent units will specify how they determine teaching loads. Departmental or equivalent unit workload policy will be 1) developed by the department faculty in collaboration with the department head and approved by the dean or equivalent administrator, 2) contained in written departmental guidelines, and 3) distributed to all faculty in the department. Department guidelines shall clearly specify the method by which teaching load is distributed. The dean or equivalent may ask for revisions to the departmental workload policy. B. In determining teaching load, the departmental or equivalent unit workload policy shall consider the impact of : courses with a lab component; career path of the instructor; tenure and promotion; workloads at peer institutions; national disciplinary norms; faculty retention; relative proportion of graduate and undergraduate instruction; supervision of master's theses or doctoral dissertations; student advising and retention activity; mentoring activity, individual faculty member's scholarly and creative productivity; service productivity; new preparations; method of course delivery; class size; help from graduate assistants; administrative and/or service assignments; team teaching; and methods of grading. Given the importance of graduate programs to the mission of the university, special consideration must be given to support of graduate programs. Other factors specific to particular departments or disciplines may also be considered. PART 7: ANNUAL DETERMINATION OF INDIVIDUAL FACULTY TEACHING LOAD/RIGHT TO APPEAL The teaching load for each faculty member will be determined annually by the department head or equivalent administrator through a process that follows established departmental or equivalent unit policy and involves an element of negotiation. The agreed upon teaching load for each faculty member will be articulated in writing and signed by the faculty member and the department head or equivalent administrator, and shall be included in the faculty member's personnel folder. If agreement on these responsibilities cannot be reached, the faculty member may appeal the case in accordance with university procedures. ( See ARP 10.60 FacultyGrievance Review and Resolution ) In an appeal situation, if a change in 3/5 08/25/2020 6.61 - Assignments - Teaching Loadacademic responsibilities will affect the faculty member for more than one semester, the appeals procedure must have been completed before the reassignment can be made or continued. PART 8: CONSIDERATIONS FOR VARIANCE The percentage breakdown of time allocated to each academic activity may vary among faculty members. A. The allocation will be based on the average time required for the satisfactory performance of the activity. B. Courses such as thesis, dissertation, research, special problems and independent study are not automatically considered to be the equivalent with teaching typical graduate or undergraduate courses. When such activities are included in the teaching load, the department head or equivalent administrator and the affected faculty member shall collaboratively determine course equivalency consistent with the department teaching load policy. C. In collaboration with faculty in their department or equivalent unit, and subject to approval by the college dean or equivalent administrator, department head or equivalent administrator may make adjustments to faculty teaching loads if those adjustments increase load equity and are at least revenue neutral. Adjustments to teaching loads within programs should result in or maintain load equity, should respect the career paths of faculty, and should not place an extra teaching burden on junior faculty who are preparing for tenure review. When a faculty member is assigned special duties above the normal load, arrangements will be negotiated between the faculty member and concerned administrators to determine the amount of additional compensation, if any, to be received. D. When considering individuals for tenure, promotion in rank, merit pay increases, research/service awards, and/or endowed chairs/professorships, departmental workload policy and an applicant's teaching load history must be presented to reviewing bodies and individuals. An applicant's teaching load and its potential impact on scholarly and creative activities, and service must be considered in the review process. 4/5 08/25/2020 6.61 - Assignments - Teaching LoadPART 9: COOPERATION The successful application of these guidelines depends upon maintaining goodwill between faculty and administrators.

Departments will use the following guidelines in determining summer teaching assignments within the department's FTE summer allocation: PART 1: PRIORITIES A. The first priority must be student and program needs. As resources permit, courses needed by the students to complete programs in a timely fashion should be offered. B. After student needs, continuing tenured and tenure-track faculty will have priority in teaching assignments. PART 2: DEVELOPMENT OF DEPARTMENTAL POLICY Departments will have the flexibility to develop their own policies after priorities #1 and #2 above have been met. The departmental policy must be written and available to all departmental faculty and other interested parties. The departmental policy must adhere to existing university policies, rules and procedures related to summer teaching (e.g., generally, faculty members will be employed in one 6-week period only). PART 3: ALLOCATION AS RELATES TO DEPARTMENT HEADS No summer session faculty allocation is used for 12-month department heads who teach in the summer. 1/3 08/25/2020 6.62 - Faculty Assignments - Summer Session PART 4: SCHEDULE Two 6-week sessions will be scheduled between the end of the spring semester and the beginning of the fall semester. Colleges and departments offering courses numbered 450 and above, designed primarily to meet the needs of teachers have permanent approval to offer courses on a 5-week schedule. During the first summer session, the 5-week option schedule begins after the first week of instruction. In the second summer session, the 5-week option schedule ends after the fifth week of instruction. It is recognized that students may be registered in both 5-week and 6-week courses. Graduate students in a combined registration may not register for more than 6 credits. PART 5: FACULTY TEACHING-NORMAL Because the summer schedule must be prepared well in advance, and summer funding is always uncertain, early agreements regarding summer teaching must be identified as tentative. (No actual commitment is made until approvals are completed on an E-Hire Form Permission to Offer section). Full load for 6 weeks is 4.5 semester credits or equivalent. (For community college faculty the full load for 6 weeks is 6 semester credits or equivalent.)

The major elements of the strategy being used to internationalize our university are: A. Defining international goals/objectives. B. Determining specific actions/activities relating to goals/objectives. C. Identifying individuals/units which have lead responsibilities for implementing activities. D. Formulating a strategy for the implementation of activities. PART 2: INTERNATIONALIZATION POLICY The current emphasis is seeking a balance between the concepts of cooperation and competition. This new emphasis places a major responsibility on the U.S. universities for providing relevant educational experiences for their students so that they are equipped to compete, become gainfully employed, and participate effectively as citizens in the new and emerging world environment. The principal purpose of university's internationalization strategy is to systematically and incrementally change the institution to better serve current and future needs of the institution's clientele. 1/3 08/25/2020 6.63 - Faculty Assignments - International PART 3: ASSIGNMENT OF FACULTY TO INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS The nature and requirements of the international assignment will be carefully reviewed and understood by university administrators and the faculty member before beginning the assignment. Accomplishments during assignment to international projects will be given consideration in evaluating annual performance, merit increases, promotion, and advancement to continuous contract. In future evaluations, consideration may be given to how knowledge and insight gained during an international assignment are integrated into the faculty member's teaching, research, and outreach responsibilities after returning from this assignment.

The number of exchanges in any period will be limited only by the resources available to support exchange, and to the extent which exchanges can positively affect the teaching, research and service programs of the college. Faculty will be encouraged to consider international exchanges and sabbaticals. PART 2: LENGTH Exchanges may be for any length of time subject to the approval of the cognizant administrators. PART 3: COMPENSATION The university will continue to pay the exchange participant's salary and fringe benefits during participation in an approved exchange program. The participant, in effect, remains under contract with the university. A faculty or staff member preparing for exchange, or on exchange, will be considered the same as a continuing faculty or staff member for the purposes of annual salary incremental decisions. Individuals and departments may propose other approaches to compensation, depending upon the particular exchange circumstance.1/3 08/25/2020 6.64 - Faculty Exchange PART 4: PROMOTION, LEAVE, AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Exchange participants will not lose rights or progress toward promotion, tenure, and sabbatical leave considerations by virtue of their participation in an exchange program.

All academic departments are administered by department heads under the cognizance of the college dean, graduate dean, if appropriate, and the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. PART 1: DEPARTMENT HEAD INCREMENT It is the policy of the university to provide additional stipends for those administering the academic departments, based upon the number of full- time faculty, part-time faculty, and graduate assistants supported from instruction and general funds. It is understood that this increment is included in the original offer to department heads just joining the faculty and is relinquished if the individual gives up the department head responsibilities. PART 2: FACULTY RANK Department heads are academic administrators, with faculty rank, but eligible for consideration under all policies applying to the faculty. For example, some department heads have been promoted to a higher rank and some have been tenured, but obviously the promotion and tenure considerations were in keeping with their positions as members of the faculty. PART 3: LENGTH OF APPOINTMENT1/3 08/25/2020 6.71 - Department Head Appointments For department heads who are 12-month employees, the year is from July 1 to June 30. Department heads that have negotiated a 9-month appointment come under the policies of the regular faculty with respect to all pay and fringe benefits and normally are excluded from summer teaching. Department heads observe the administrative calendar. PART 4: SALARY DETERMINATION When an internal candidate is selected, department head salary normally is determined by multiplying the 9-month faculty salary by 12/9 and adding the department head increment.

PART 1: ACADEMIC LEADERSHIP The department head is expected to be the academic leader of the departmental faculty. The department head is responsible for ensuring that highly qualified faculty are employed. Also, the department head ensures that official transcripts, including highest degree earned are obtained for every new faculty member's official personnel file (routed through the office of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs). Insofar as possible, the kind of atmosphere in which the faculty can do their best work in teaching, research, and service should be maintained. PART 2: FACULTY DEVELOPMENT Leadership of the faculty implies working closely with the faculty on the development and sustenance of departmental courses and the stimulation and encouragement of faculty development. A performance evaluation of each faculty member will be carried out at least once a year and should be made in the positive vein of professional development. Evaluation of the progress of tenure-track faculty should be made in consultation with senior department faculty and in accordance with the highest national standards of faculty performance.1/5 08/25/2020 6.72 - Department Heads Responsibilities, Including TeachingPART 3: PROFESSIONAL CONTACTS The department head is responsible for encouraging the national and international professional contacts of the faculty within the constraints of the departmental budget. This implies appropriate travel and bringing well- known professionals to the campus. PART 4: TEACHING SUPPORT The department head has no more important task than ensuring teaching excellence. Encouragement and support of good teaching must be given to faculty, especially new faculty. Copies of current syllabi will be maintained in the department head's office. The department head is responsible for ensuring an effective departmental evaluation of teaching, and for advisement of student departmental majors. PART 5: EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT The department head must ensure the effective administration of the department, including keeping the faculty fully informed of department, college, and university matters. Routine and special reports, including grade reports and other matters, must be handled accurately and on time. Effective supervision and development of the department budget is important. The department head will keep the faculty informed on budgetary matters. All research and program contracts should be carefully supervised, both for fiscal integrity and academic appropriateness. PART 6: DEPARTMENTAL ADVOCATE/COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STEWARD 2/5 08/25/2020 6.72 - Department Heads Responsibilities, Including TeachingThe department head is expected to be an advocate of the department, yet at the same time appreciate the concerns and priorities of the college and university. The most important department activities in the development of faculty, programs, research, and service are done in close partnership with the office of the dean of the college. PART 7: LIAISON TO DEAN The department head is responsible to the dean of the college for all the activities of the department. The dean should be kept apprised of all department activities and problems. PART 8: POLICY COMPLIANCE The department head is responsible for ensuring that department, college, and university policies, rules and procedures are enforced. PART 8: ROLE IN RECRUITMENT The department head will inform the search committee chair if an underutilization memorandum is received from the Office of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs for purposes of meeting affirmative action goals. The Search Committee Guidelines will be provided by the department head for tenure-track faculty positions. PART 9: SUPERVISION OF GRADUATE ASSISTANTS Graduate assistants are recommended for appointment by the department head. The appointment requires approval of the college and graduate dean. Three letters of recommendation are required for the approval. Specific orientation and training of graduate assistants are the3/5 08/25/2020 6.72 - Department Heads Responsibilities, Including Teachingresponsibilities of the department head. Graduate assistants work under the close supervision of faculty. The policy on academic freedom does not apply to the service expected of graduate assistants. The assignment of teaching duties to graduate assistants is the responsibility of the department head. Such assignment requires that the department head ascertain that the graduate assistant is fully qualified and that the work performed by the graduate assistant be closely supervised by a member of the faculty responsible for monitoring the assigned tasks associated with the graduate assistant's teaching responsibility. Only those graduate assistants proficient in English may be assigned to teaching or teaching- related activities.

During each academic semester, faculty will be available, physically or virtually, for meetings called with reasonable advance notice and for assignments by the department head or appropriate academic administrator. The academic semester begins on the faculty return date identified on the academic calendar and ends on the date final grades are due. Nine month faculty who do not accrue annual leave are relieved of this expectation during the academic breaks (e.g. Spring Break and Thanksgiving Holiday). B. In the event of illness or other reasonable justification, faculty who will be unavailable for meetings or their office hours designated for students will as soon as reasonably possible, notify the department head or other academic administrator for alternate arrangements and/or student notifications to be made. C. In the case of an occasional absence, the general practice is for another member of the department to substitute until the faculty member returns. Faculty who will be absent from campus for more than 3 days due to illness or any other FMLA qualifying event must also notify the FMLA office. In cases where FMLA leave is approved, the department head or appropriate academic administrator will make arrangements for course coverage. PART 2: FACULTY OFFICE HOURS FOR STUDENTS 1/3 08/25/2020 6.86 - Faculty Availability and Office Hours for StudentsA. Faculty members will facilitate meetings requested by students and will be available in person or virtually for their students during the entire academic semester, with the exception of the academic breaks for nine month faculty. The purpose of faculty office hours is to set aside time for students. During this time, faculty will be present in their assigned office, if any, and prioritize students' needs. Consistent with the requirements in ARP 4.45, faculty will not meet students at private off-campus locations to conduct academic or university business, even if requested by the student, except as a reasonable accommodation vetted through Student Accessibility Services or the Office of Institutional Equity and notice to the department head or appropriate academic administrator. B. Each academic department or program establishes the number and nature (e.g. in person or virtual) of office hours appropriate to support students in its courses. C. Once office hours are determined, they will be published in the course syllabi and in the academic department office or posted on their office door.

The rule also supports Goal 4 of the NMSU LEADS 2025 Strategic Plan, Build a Robust University System. Specifically, this rule promotes the ability to get work done most productively by balancing work requirements with the needs of university employees. This rule provides policy and procedural guidance for supervisors and employees who wish to explore either short or longer-term AWA, including telework, flextime, a staggered work schedule or compressed work week. PART 2: DEFINITIONS A.Compressed Work Week : An AWA which condenses more than one standard work week into fewer days (such as a 4.5 work week, with four 9-hour days and one 4-hour day per week, or four 10-hour days with two days off per pay period). B.Flextime : An AWA that allows an employee to alter the start and/or end time of their workday. Employees must work the same number of hours as they would under their regular schedule. C.Short-Term Work Modification : An Ad Hoc (as needed) AWA, such as working from home during a short-term project, inclement weather or on the road during business travel. These arrangements are approved on an as-needed basis only for a limited time period. D.Staggered Work Schedule : A schedule in which employees arrive and depart workat different times in shifts. Shifts may be staggered anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours.1/8 08/25/2020 6.87 - Establishing an Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA)E. Telework : An AWA in which an employee regularly performs work at a remote workplace (such as a home, library, or co-working space). F. Workplace : A workplace is the location where someone performs the work required by their job position. Such a place can range from a home office to a large office building, classroom or laboratory. PART 3: AWA RULES Work flexibility may be accomplished through alternative work arrangements (AWA), consistent with this rule, and any supplemental operating protocols (SOPs) issued by Human Resource Services. Generally, and absent extraordinary circumstances, participation in an AWA is voluntary in nature. An AWA is implemented when compatible with NMSU business interests, and at the discretion of management, and is not an employee right or benefit. A. Work Productivity through Work Flexibility : AWA is not designed to address family care needs (See ARP 8.45 - FMLA leave), nor to replace the interactive process for accommodating persons with disabilities (See ARP 3.40 - Process for Disability Accommodation; equity@nmsu.edu). An AWA may be implemented if not incompatible with operational needs, which drive the supervisors' decisions on AWA requests. Non-work-related events and activities must not disrupt or interfere with work at any approved remote workplace. NMSU Human Resources staff is available to provide guidance as needed to supervisors as they review, process and implement AWA requests. (See Part 4, Procedures below) B. NMSU Policies and Departmental Work Rules Apply : The use of an AWA does not alter an individual's employment relationship with the university, nor the employee's obligation to honor the terms and conditions of employment, such as the employee's position description, salary, benefits, vacation, leave and overtime rules, and compliance with applicable university and departmental policies, rules, procedures and other directives. 2/8 08/25/2020 6.87 - Establishing an Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA)C. Responsibility for Administration of AWA: Supervisors are responsible for monitoring and verifying employee performance, time and attendance. (See Part 4 E. and F. below.) The ultimate authority for AWA lies with the senior leadership (chancellor, vice chancellor, campus presidents, senior vice presidents, deans and vice presidents) who have the authority to determine how best to achieve the work that is required by their unit(s) and staff members, including where and when the work occurs. They may delegate that authority to others (e.g. supervisors, etc.). D. Eligibility: Some job functions are capable of being performed remotely, including administrative functions, online teaching, training, and meetings. Other job functions must take place on campus; employees in positions with these job functions will not be eligible for telework, although they may be eligible for flextime, a staggered work schedule or a compressed work week. When considering requests for AWA, supervisors will assess whether or not the employee exhibit the following traits: 1. excellent time management skills; 2. strong written and verbal communication skills; 3. works well with limited supervision; 4. are present, responsive, available, connected, and productive; and 5. a history of strong work performance (meeting or exceeding expectations) E. AWA During Declared Disasters or Emergencies: Conditions existing during a pandemic infectious disease outbreak or other declared emergency will justify a temporary imposition of employee teleworking. Examples of such conditions include: 1. Temporary closure of buildings on campus due to social- distancing mandates or shelter-in-place; 2. Unavailability of childcare due to school or daycare closure. 3. Heightened medical risk of harm to the employee, or to a member of the employee's household, related to an exposure to infectious disease; F. Non-discrimination : Decisions on AWA requests and related issues will comply with applicable employment laws and will not discriminate on the basis of any protected class (See ARP 3.25).3/8 08/25/2020 6.87 - Establishing an Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA)G. Performance of Job Duties while Subject to an AWA: Employees working pursuant to an AWA must continue to accomplish their regular job duties professionally, effectively and cooperatively. 1. Employee will: a. check in with the supervisor to discuss status and open issues; b. be available for teleconferences, scheduled on an as- needed basis; c. be available to come into the office if a business need arises; d. Disallow business invitees at a home workplace used for telework (business and academic meetings and activities must occur at NMSU in a workplace suitable for the required meeting or activity); e. request supervisor's approval in advance of working any overtime hours (if employee is non-exempt); and f. request supervisor approval to use vacation, sick, or other leave in the same manner as when working at employee's regular NMSU workplace. g. remain accessible during the AWA work schedule; 2. Supervisors are encouraged to support the AWA employee by: a. encouraging goal-setting and organizational planning b. giving appropriate and timely feedback c. incorporating the employee into daily workflows and meetings d. communicating AWA arrangements with their core team e. utilizing shared calendars f. managing by measuring results and outcomes g. trusting the employee's ability to perform 4/8 08/25/2020 6.87 - Establishing an Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA)H. Equipment : Supervisors and employees should discuss any equipment or technology access the employee will need to telework. NMSU has no obligation to provide hardware for AWA arrangements. Employees must protect NMSU-owned equipment, records, and materials from unauthorized or accidental access, use, modification, destruction, or disclosure. In the event of equipment failure or service interruption, the employee must notify employer immediately to discuss alternate assignments or other options. 1. AWA employees are expected to have: a. consistent availability by cellphone or landline; and b. fluency in Zoom, Microsoft Office 365 SharePoint, Teams, and other relevant software. c. consistent access to a laptop or desktop with high-speed internet; I. Data Security and Confidentiality: Employees working pursuant to an AWA must maintain the security and confidentiality of institutional data and comply with all software licensing agreements. Sensitive data should not be placed on a personal computer or device but instead should be accessed via secure technology and in accordance with NMSU data security protocols. Employees, along with their supervisors, should create formal plans for maintaining the security and confidentiality of university records while working remotely. J. Safety: Employees with an AWA are expected to maintain their remote workplace in a safe manner, free from safety hazards. Injuries sustained by the employee in a remote office location and in conjunction with the employee's regular work duties are subject to the NMSU workers' compensation policy (See ARP 8.72 - Workers'Compensation Benefits and Other Assistance ), and subject to the requirement to notify their supervisor about on the job injuries as soon as practicable. The employee is liable for any injuries sustained by unauthorized visitors to the employee's alternate workplace. (See Part 3 G. 1. e. above) NMSU retains the right to make prearranged, on- site inspections of the alternate workplace during scheduled work hours. K. Periodic Assessment of AWA : The AWA arrangement should be evaluated by the supervisor on an ongoing basis to ensure that employee's work quality, efficiency, and productivity are not compromised by the AWA arrangement described herein, and to determine whether the AWA should continue to remain in effect ( See Part 4 G. below for Duration of AWA ). 5/8 08/25/2020 6.87 - Establishing an Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA)PART 4: AWA PROCEDURES In addition to the basic procedures below, Human Resource Services may issue supplemental operational protocols (SOPs), including but not limited to instructions and forms. The SOP's will be posted at https://hr.nmsu.edu. A. Requests for AWA: The AWA form is required for participation in the AWA program. AWA requests should be submitted by employees to supervisors on this form. If the employee's supervisor or other member of management is requesting or requiring an AWA, the AWA form will also be used to document the AWA. B. Supervisory Review : 1. Upon receipt of an AWA request, the supervisor should review the rules above and assess operational needs and job compatibility with the proposed AWA. In addition to the factors listed under Eligibility above (See Part 3 D.), supervisors should consider feasibility as it relates to the work requirements or deadlines; University LEADS 2025 goals; and generally whether the work is capable of being accomplished pursuant to an AWA, without negatively impacting the performance of the employee's unit. 2. AWA requests will be evaluated by supervisors based on the individual circumstances presented by each employee's position and job duties. For non-exempt employees, AWA will be implemented in accordance with Article 28, Section 1 of the collective bargaining agreement between NMSU and American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Local 2393 and university administrative rules and procedures as may also apply. Supervisors should document the basis/es supporting AWA decisions to facilitate consistency and fairness in their application of this rule. C. Approval Required : The proposed AWA and completed form, which may be an electronic workflow e-form, must be approved by the employee's supervisor before implementation. Copies of the forms will be filed with the work unit and with the Human Resource Services Department.6/8 08/25/2020 6.87 - Establishing an Alternative Work Arrangement (AWA)D. AWA Trial Period/Modification or Termination: If AWA is approved or otherwise implemented, it is recommended that the employee and supervisor establish a trial period and metrics to measure success of the AWA arrangement. At the conclusion of the trial period, the employee and supervisor should discuss whether or not a longer-term AWA will meet the operational needs. Either the employee or the supervisor may suggest a modification, and either may terminate the AWA, unless it was imposed as a result of a declared pandemic or other official emergency. E. Timekeeping and Leave: AWA non-exempt employees are required to maintain accurate time records and supervisors are accountable for management of those records. All AWA employees (exempt and non- exempt) are expected to report to work as scheduled unless otherwise notified. Regular leave policies and procedures should be followed for employees who are unable to report to work (annual and/or sick leave should be used). Pursuant to established NMSU policies, employees must obtain supervisory approval before taking leave. F. Authorization for Overtime (OT) and OT Reporting: In accordance with university policy (See ARP 7.20 - Staff Overtime Pay or CompTime ) and the university's collective bargaining agreement, supervisors must authorize the working of hours by FLSA non-exempt employees that will exceed 40 in a work week. FLSA non-exempt employees will be paid overtime or comp time at the overtime rate for hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours per workweek. Supervisors should apply effective management measures that ensure that non-exempt employees do not work during unauthorized time periods, and be mindful of the timing and communication to such employee via email and text messaging. Employees in exempt (salaried) positions are exempt from overtime regulations. G. Duration of AWA: AWAs remain in effect until terminated, or through the end of the fiscal year. The AWA may be renewed by completing a new AWA Form at the beginning of each new fiscal year (July 1). An AWA does not constitute an employment contract and does not create a property interest in employment.

Normally, the daytime shift receives the base rate of pay; the second shift (swing) receives a $.10 per hour pay differential; the third shift (graveyard) receives a $.40 per hour pay differential. Any granting of differentials other than those specified must have specific approval of the Office of Human Resource Services. Payment is reported on Form 302 for employees rotating shifts. A Personnel Action Form is used for non-rotating shift employees. The comment section of the Personnel Action Form should note the base salary and shift differential separately. In order to be eligible for a shift differential, an employee's normal work schedule must extend more than 3 hours into the swing or graveyard shift. An employee is eligible for shift differential pay only for those hours extending into the swing or graveyard shift. PART 2: AREA DIFFERENTIAL PAY Occasionally, employees are sent on temporary duty to locations outside their normal work area. When the cost of temporary lodging and food exceeds the normal per diem rate, the supervisor may request a temporary adjustment to the employee's base pay during the absence to compensate for this loss. Such requests should be submitted to the Office of Human Resource Services. Adjustments in the in-hire rate for nonexempt employees to a rate above the entry rate to compensate for areas or positions in which the university's entry level salary is not competitive may be considered by the Office of Human Resource Services.

PART 2: PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE A. Management should attempt to schedule staff and faculty such that excessive overtime and hardship to the employee is avoided; the hardship differential pay addresses those situations where this cannot be avoided. B. Extraordinary working conditions include situations when the employee is required to work an inordinate number of hours beyond the normal forty (40) hour work week, or to work under unusually risky and/or hazardous conditions, or to work away from home through a holiday. Such working conditions should not be the norm, and payment of extra compensation is justified due to the significant hardship placed on the employee during the period of time necessary to meet the work objective. C. In order to receive hardship differential pay, the appropriate dean, vice president or designee and the Office of Human Resource Services must approve it in writing. 1/2 08/25/2020 7.12 - Hardship Differential PayD. The amount of the hardship differential pay will be a differential over and above the employee's regular salary, to be paid for the duration of the project. 1.

Employees serving any type of probationary period may not transfer outside of their organizational unit without obtaining a written release from their current supervisor. PART 2: FACULTY TRANSFERS Normally there are four types of transfers of faculty members within various agencies of the university: A. A faculty member leaving an instructional/research department to serve in a different instructional/research department. Under these circumstances, the individual may be given credit toward a continuous contract for the years served in the earlier department. With proper departmental and college vote, and the completion of a Contract Status Form by the new department, tenure may be transferred with a faculty member from one department to another. B. The transfer of a faculty member from a non-instructional division to an instructional division or vice versa. Under these circumstances, years of service in the prior position will not necessarily count toward a continuous contract in the new position. Proven performance in the first position, under these circumstances, might not assure that the individual would be able to render satisfactory professional service in the new area of assignment. C. The transfer of a faculty member from the university community college campuses to an instructional division on the main campus or vice versa. Under these circumstances, years of service in the prior position will not necessarily count toward a continuous contract in the new position or assure appointment in an equivalent rank. Proven performance in the community college or main campus position might not assure that the individual meets the rank requirements of the new position. D. The transfer of a faculty member from one community college to another: Under these circumstances, the individual may be given credit towards a continuous contract and rank for the years in the previous community college.

This program establishes a Sick Leave Bank for eligible participating university employees affected by a personal medical emergency, and who have insufficient paid sick or annual leave to cover required work absences. Only university employees who are eligible to accrue sick and annual leave may elect to participate in the Sick Leave Bank benefit. B. A personal medical emergency is defined as an unusual and catastrophic medical or immediate family medical emergency that is likely to require an employee's absence from duty for a prolonged period of time and to result in a substantial loss of income because of the unavailability of paid leave. C. Only those items allowable under the university Sick Leave Rules are covered by the Sick Leave Bank. D. The bank allows employees to share the risk of severe circumstances by donating to a common pool of leave. E. Members of the pool are required to enroll in the long-term disability insurance program as a protection against income loss while recovering from a severe medical condition. The long-term disability policy covers total disability after a waiting period of 135 consecutive calendar days or 100 work days. F. The maximum a recipient can receive from the Sick Leave Bank is 70 days per personal emergency with no more than one withdrawal from the bank per fiscal year or per personal emergency. No more than 70 days can be withdrawn for a particular medical condition. G. Employees would be wise to maintain a balance of at least 30 days of combined sick and annual leave to cover them during the first 30 days of personal emergency or total disability. The Sick Leave Bank does not provide for the first 30 days of the personal emergency; these are the responsibility of the employee and are covered by the employee's sick and annual leave or leave without pay.

Leave will be earned from the first day of employment and may be used as it is earned. D. Hours worked over 40 hours per week do not accrue either annual or sick leave. E. Employees may accrue and bank 100 working days (800 hours) of accumulated sick leave (prorated for less than full-time employees and for any partial months by annual 9-month employees). On July 1 every year, any employee who has accumulated more than 100 working days of sick leave will have the sick leave balance reduced to 100 days. F. A department may require supporting documentation for any usage of sick leave any time abuse of sick leave is suspected.

Annual leave will be applied (if available) against sick leave in excess of the allotted sick leave days, but sick leave will not be applied against annual leave in any case. H. Sick leave accrued after July 1, 2016, will have no cash value and will not result in a payout benefit. 1/4 08/25/2020 8.43 - LOA - SickI. Those employees who accrued more than 600 hours of sick leave prior to July 1, 2016 will retain the sick leave payout benefit that was in place on June 30, 2016, but only with respect to those hours accrued prior to July 1, 2016. This sick leave payout benefit shall be referred to as a \"grandfathered\" benefit. Any employee with a grandfathered sick leave payout benefit who terminates, retires or converts from a 12- month pay base to an academic faculty pay base will be paid, in accordance with the formula in effect on June 30, 2016, for any then remaining grandfathered sick leave benefit (calculation based on the lesser of the leave balance on July 1, 2016 or the leave balance on the date of separation). The formula in effect on June 30, 2016 stated: payment will be made at a rate of 50 percent of the employee's straight-time hourly salary, multiplied by the number of sick leave hours accrued over 600, to a maximum of 200. The payment may not exceed 50 percent x hourly rate x 200.

For this purpose, dependents are defined as spouse, children, or immediate family members any of whom normally reside in an employee's household and who are dependent upon the employee for support and maintenance. A physician's statement may be required to support the usage of sick leave for the employee or dependents. Employees on Family and Medical leave must use any available sick leave concurrently with Family and Medical leave, pursuant to ARP 8.45. An employee will not be compensated for a missed day from work if the employee does not have accrued paid leave available.

If granted, the recipient of such leave shall be required to sign a supplementary contract agreeing to return to the employing university unit and to serve for a minimum of 2 years. Failure to do so would require immediate full refund of all salary paid by the university during the leave. Normally, no individual may receive more than one such leave with pay. In the case of a non- tenured faculty member, time used for educational leave (with or without pay) will not apply toward the probationary period. The time granted for educational leave with pay will not normally exceed the time allowed for a sabbatical leave. The following options apply : A. One semester at no reduction in annual salary. B. One full academic year at half salary. (Those within 5 years of retirement may wish to request full salary for 1 semester or a 6-month period and personal leave without pay for the other half.) Semester II (spring) of 1 year and Semester I (fall) of the following year, at l/4 annual salary for each semester of leave. PART 2: EDUCATIONAL LEAVE WITHOUT PAY1/2 08/25/2020 8.52 - LOA - Educational (With and Without Pay) Any regular full time exempt staff member or faculty member on regular appointment with rank of instructor or above is eligible for and may request an educational leave of absence without pay after 3 years of service, normally for the purpose of taking coursework toward a degree, professional licensure or certificate which is related to the individual's university job assignment. If the leave is approved, all annual leave should be used before the educational leave without pay begins. The individual's sick leave balance at the beginning of the leave remains on hold during the period of the leave. The university will contribute the employer's portion of insurance premiums during the leave period. A faculty member on educational leave without pay, on continuous or temporary contract, will be required to notify the department head in writing 90 days before the educational leave without pay terminates, or 30 days after notification of salary and position, whichever is later as to the date of return to academic service on the faculty. In the absence of such notification, the department head may immediately initiate proceedings for termination of the contract.

These benefits must be detailed in the application. PART 2: USE OF ACCRUED ANNUAL LEAVE If the leave without pay is approved, all annual leave should be used before the professional leave without pay begins.

All departments and colleges including community colleges are encouraged to participate fully in the sabbatical program. PART 2: QUALIFICATIONS AND OPTIONS Application for sabbatical leave may be made by any tenured full-time faculty member (above the rank of instructor) with at least 12 regular semesters of full-time service at the university without a sabbatical. A faculty member who is in the last year of the probationary period may be considered for sabbatical leave if a favorable decision on tenure has already been made. Sabbatical leave may be taken in conjunction with earned annual leave, personal leave, or educational leave without pay. Personal leave and educational leave without pay must comply with university policies. In instances where, for good and sufficient institutional reasons, a sabbatical leave is delayed (not to exceed 2 years), the faculty member will become eligible for a succeeding sabbatical leave after an equivalently reduced period. A faculty member should be given as much notice as possible if a sabbatical leave cannot be approved for the time frame requested. Sabbatical leave is available under the following options : A. One semester at no reduction in annual salary.1/5 08/25/2020 8.54 - LOA - Sabbatical B. One full contract year at 60 percent salary (Those within 5 years of retirement should consult the Employee Benefits Office about the possible negative impact on the retirement benefit formula.) C. Semester II (spring) of 1 year and Semester I (fall) of the following year, at 30 percent annual salary for each semester of leave. When a person has served as both a 9-month and 12-month employee in the 6-year period immediately prior to the requested sabbatical, the amount of time allotted for the sabbatical will be prorated. A faculty member employed on a continuing basis on a 12-month contract may take a 6-month leave at full salary or a 12-month leave at 60 percent salary. PART 3: APPLICATIONS Sabbatical leave will not be granted automatically upon the expiration of the necessary period of service. Rather, a qualified faculty member shall, normally at least 6 months in advance of the leave, submit an application and proposed leave program to the department head or chair, with evidence of research, creative activity, or other academic achievement, including publications, to support the program of work which is planned for the sabbatical period. Also, this program shall give reasonable promise of accomplishing the major purpose of the leave. Request for a sabbatical leave should be accompanied by a detailed explanation of the benefits to the faculty member, university, and the state resulting from the sabbatical leave. For main campus faculty, the approval of the cognizant dean, is required. For community colleges, the approval of the division dean, CAO and CEO are required. In addition to the work plan, the leave application should include: (1) a statement regarding choice of options; (2) departmental verification that during the applicant's absence, teaching, research, and service duties can be managed by the department; (3) a statement concerning compensation to be received during the leave. A faculty member on sabbatical leave at full pay usually will not take other paid employment during the leave; and (4) a clear statement of the benefit of the proposed leave to the university. A person on sabbatical at 60 percent time usually will not take more than 40 percent time employment. However, it is recognized that such employment may be necessary for or enhance the leave. In such cases, a request to take compensated employment should be included in the proposal submitted and must have administrative approval. The evaluation of an application should be based2/5 08/25/2020 8.54 - LOA - Sabbatical on whether the planned program satisfies the aims and goals explicitly set forth in the Purpose statement above. These aims and goals may be independent of geographical location of the leave activities and, therefore, the place of the faculty member's residence during leave should be only one factor in considering the merits of the application. However, to ensure that the sabbatical experience provides opportunities not otherwise available to the main campus faculty member, the sabbatical period will normally include a component of study/work away from the home institution. PART 4: RELATED CONDITIONS Time toward each new sabbatical begins immediately after return to full- time service regardless of the semester of return. The sabbatical leave will not adversely affect salary increases or promotions. Institutional participation in faculty retirement and group insurance will be continued for staff on sabbatical leave with pay. A faculty member on sabbatical leave may request, through the department head, travel support for participation in professional meetings. Consideration will be given if the faculty member is an officer of the professional organization or is to participate in some other significant way. Educational or other leaves are excluded as time counted toward eligibility for sabbatical leave. Twelve-month faculty will accrue annual and sick leave (at 60 percent for those on 60 percent pay) and will report annual and sick leave as usual. PART 5: DEPARTMENTAL IMPLEMENTATIONS Long-range department plans should consider the necessity of, and provide for, temporary absences for sabbatical leave. The initial leave discussions and concomitant management of duties is primarily a matter for discussion and approval by the concerned department. However, in transmitting the final leave request to the dean and provost, the department head should provide assurance that all student needs will be served by the department during the faculty member's absence. In some departments, the absence of one faculty member might place an undue load on the other department members. After a department has taken every step possible to plan for3/5 08/25/2020 8.54 - LOA - Sabbatical sabbatical leaves, it should submit its proposal to the dean for consideration. The administration will attempt to accommodate these special cases. PART 6: PROCEDURES A. At least 6 months prior to the requested leave period (exceptions to be considered on a case-by-case basis), application for sabbatical leave is submitted to the department head on a Request for Leave Form and includes the supporting materials detailed in the Application section. B. Preliminary approval is obtained when signatures of the department head, cognizant dean, dean of the Graduate School are affixed to the Request for Leave Form. For community college faculty, preliminary approval is obtained when signatures of the department chair, division dean, CAO and CEO are affixed to the Request for Leave Form. A supplementary contract, stipulating that the faculty member is obligated and agrees to return to the university to serve a period of 1 year, and failure to do so would require immediate full refund of all salary paid by the university during the leave, is prepared and sent to the faculty member. Upon receipt of the signed supplementary contract, final approval of the leave is granted and the faculty member is notified. PART 7: POST SABBATICAL OBLIGATIONS Sabbatical leaves will be approved only with the clear understanding that at the completion of the sabbatical and/or supplemental leave, the faculty member will return to the university for a period of service of 1 year. Failure to do so will require immediate full refund of all salaries and benefits costs paid by the university during the sabbatical, and repayment for any annual leave accrued and used during the extended leave. Within the first semester upon return from the sabbatical, the main campus faculty member shall submit to the provost, through the department head and dean a full report of the research, creative work, publications, or other results of the period of leave. This final report should contain a brief summary of the proposal, including a review of the objectives, as well as a4/5 08/25/2020 8.54 - LOA - Sabbatical summary of what was accomplished. An explanation should be given in the event that some objective(s) were not met. This report will be incorporated in the faculty member's annual written report and may be used in the annual performance evaluation process. The dean will forward the report with both the dean's and department heads comments to the provost regarding the overall value of the sabbatical to the faculty member and to the university and indicating the extent to which the sabbatical plan was accomplished. Community College faculty will submit a similar report to the Campus President through their immediate supervisor.

At this time the department head confers with new faculty members concerning the recording of objectives and goals and the general use of the form. In the case of continuing faculty members, the department head or faculty may request a conference for the purpose of revising or updating objectives previously agreed upon. Department heads will share the above agreements in writing with the faculty member. 1/3 08/25/2020 9.20 - [Pre-AY18/19] Faculty Performance Evaluation B. Department heads are expected to meet with all new and returning faculty members regarding progress toward promotion and tenure and to certify in writing to the appropriate dean that these meetings have occurred. Specific evaluative comments in each of the three areas of performance are required, as well as separate comments about progress toward tenure and toward promotion. C. Student evaluations considered as part of performance evaluations, may not include numerical ratings, letter grades, or other \"scores\" of specific aspects of the course, the course as a whole, or of the instructor. D. Each faculty member completes a written form detailing and citing accomplishments in the broad categories of teaching, research and/or creative scholarship, and service during the performance evaluation period. The type, method of collection, and disposition of evidence regarding effectiveness of teaching is of particular importance, and faculty should consult with department heads concerning collection of this evidence. The performance evaluation form, along with any supplemental material, is submitted by each faculty member to the faculty member's department head. E. The department head reviews the faculty performance forms, prepares a written evaluation based upon accomplishments reported as compared with previously set goals and objectives (a copy of this report will be shared with the faculty member), and confers with appropriate deans to achieve consensus on the written recommendation and the prepared summary to be discussed with the faculty member. Following the conference with the dean, the department head meets with the faculty member to discuss all aspects of the performance evaluation, addressing separately the person's progress toward promotion, progress toward tenure, strengths, and weaknesses. This conference also serves to set goals and objectives for the ensuing year. No mention shall be made at this conference of the recommendation in terms of dollars. These goals and objectives will be placed in writing, with a copy to the faculty member. F. At community colleges with program coordinators, the coordinator performs the duties of a department head in the evaluation process. The coordinator will confer with the community college executive officer, who in turn confers with the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. G. Department heads formulate recommendations where appropriate regarding promotion and tenure on the basis of policies stated in this manual. These are communicated to the college dean.2/3 08/25/2020 9.20 - [Pre-AY18/19] Faculty Performance Evaluation H. Each college generates its own time schedule for accomplishing the above items, within the parameters of the university calendar. I. It will be the function of the Faculty Senate to legislate policy, rules or procedures regarding the Faculty Performance Evaluation System.

Promotion and tenure decisions are the means by which NMSU rewards and retains its most valued scholars, sustains excellence in its instructional disciplines, and fulfills its mission to advance knowledge. The quality of faculty accomplishments in teaching and advising (or its equivalent), scholarship and creative activity, extension, outreach and service largely determines the quality of the university as a whole. The granting of tenure or promotion to associate or full professor represents a prediction by the university that the individual concerned will continue to make substantial contributions to the profession and the university. B. The processes involved in promotion and tenure rely upon basic principles in order to be effective. Above all, the promotion and tenure processes must be fair, transparent, and participatory. These values mean that decisions must be made without regard to race, national origin, gender, gender identity, age, disability, political beliefs, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, special friendships, or animus towards candidates, taking care to avoid conflicts of interest, structural, institutional, or habitual thoughts and patterns that could lead to discrimination. NMSU values the richness that inquiry based upon intellectual and cultural differences brings to the university community. 1/3 08/25/2020 9.21 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - IntroductionC. Each principal unit must develop written standards by the end of the Spring Semester of 2008 based on criteria developed by that principal unit subject to the approval of the dean or equivalent administrator. Criteria and procedures must be clear and readily available to all participants and must be followed by all participants at each level of the process (See Combined P & T Rules Through 08/12/2018 or Combined P & T Rules After 8/12/2018 ). Therefore, it is imperative that clear standards for annual performance evaluation, promotion, and tenure be articulated and broadly publicized. Applicants for tenure or promotion must be judged on their performance of the duties assigned to them, following agreed-upon allocations of effort. The process needs to involve broad consultation by groups and individuals with successively broader views of the mission of the university, and provide the opportunity for appeal. In order to achieve fairness, transparency, and broad-based participation, all of the parties must base decisions on the documentation called for by this rule. D. This rule relies on the four types of scholarship defined by Ernest L. Boyer (1990) in his book \"Scholarship Reconsidered\", namely, the scholarships of discovery, of teaching, of integration, and of engagement. Broadening the definition of scholarship (See ARP9.24 Part 2 Scholarships and Creative Activity ) reflects the changing roles of faculty members in teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity, extension, outreach and service. E. This rule (formerly policy) takes effect at the beginning of the Fall Semester, 2008.

PART 1: FACULTY PARTICIPATION (fka 5.90.3.1) The selection and retention of faculty members are of utmost importance to the quality of the university, the achievement of university goals, and the future of the institution. In order to ensure a fair process for recognition of excellent faculty, it shall be the policy of the university to allow faculty members to vote on the promotion or tenure of departmental colleagues, exercising collegial judgment based on an established set of criteria. PART 2 TRANSPARENCY OF PROCESS (fka 5.90.3.2) A. Access to Promotion and Tenure Policies/University Posting : For faculty members to trust the promotion and tenure process, they need to have a clear idea of what is expected of them, how they will be evaluated, and the rules of the process. To this end, the university website will include a specific link to the university-wide promotion and tenure rules and procedures, professional ethics related to promotion and tenure, the appeals process, and links to college , department, or division policy statements. 1/13 08/25/2020 9.23 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Guiding PrinciplesB. Departmental and Principal Unit Postings 1. To promote the transparency of the process, each principal unit shall post on its website its written policy document aligned with the Guiding Principles, Criteria, and Policies outlined in these rules and procedures. 2. Websites will also contain links to the university's promotion and tenure documents, as well as to each of the department websites. 3. In addition, each department shall post on its website its current statement of goals, objectives, and expectations as these relate to promotion and tenure (sometimes called a functions and criteria statement). These shall be agreed upon by the faculty in each department and approved by the responsible dean or comparable administrator. C. Policies to be Provided to Eligible Faculty : A written copy of promotion and tenure policies will be given to all tenure-track, tenured, college and research faculty who are eligible for consideration for promotion or tenure. (See Combined P & T RulesThrough 08/12/2018 or Combined P & T Rules After 8/12/2018 ) D. Conflict of Interest (fka 5.90.3.2.1) : (See RPM 3.00 Conflicts of Interest - Ethical Conduc t and ARP 3.13 Conflicts of Interest Arising from Consensual Relationships ) PART 3: PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (fka 5.90.3.3) The annual performance evaluation is a component of the promotion and tenure process. This multi-layered evaluation system relies on consistency at each level of review. The performance of each faculty member, including college faculty, will be reviewed at least once a year. The performance evaluation provides documentation of expectations and a record of faculty performance relative to stated expectations. The form of the evaluation is determined by the college or community college and shall align with promotion and tenure expectations. ( See ARP 9.25 Part 1 Performance Evaluations and ARP 9.36 - [Pre- AY 18/19] Post-Tenure Review ) PART 4: 2/13 08/25/2020 9.23 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Guiding PrinciplesA. Service to Mission : The amount of effort that faculty members regardless of rank or position devote to the various aspects of their duties necessarily varies, and any fair promotion and tenure process will recognize these variations. A successful process considers whether the faculty member is effectively serving the mission of the university, as defined by a department's criteria and the individual's agreed upon goals and objectives. This means, for example, that the efforts of a faculty member made in response to administrators or committees are taken into account during promotion and tenure evaluation and are not discredited. B. Fairness Despite Variance in Duties : One faculty member may devote more time to teaching at one point than at another. The efforts of two faculty members may vary at the same points in their careers according to their particular strengths and department needs. Faculty assignments in different departments will also vary. It is fundamentally unfair, for example, to expect the same amount of scholarship and creative activity, service, extension, or outreach from a faculty member teaching one class a semester as from another faculty member teaching three classes a semester or several large lecture classes. C. Equitable Treatment : In order to ensure equitable treatment, every faculty member will complete an allocation of effort statement as part of the annual evaluation process. ( See also ARP 6.61 FacultyAssignments - Teaching Load ) When determining the allocation of effort, decisions must be made without regard to race, national origin, gender, gender identity, age, disability, political beliefs, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, special friendships, or animus towards candidates. Further, for the allocation of effort statement to be accurate and useful, administrators at all levels must understand and take an active role in avoiding institutional factors that could produce an undue burden on untenured faculty members and those from underrepresented groups in the allocation of effort process. D. Use of Allocation of Effort Statement : Each college shall develop and use an allocation of effort statement as specified in ARP 9.25 Part 1 Performance Evaluations. These statements shall be a part of the faculty member's tenure and/or promotion portfolio, and all aspects of the agreed upon efforts shall be factored into the recommendation made at each step of the process. PART 5: THE PROFESSORIAL RANKS (fka 5.90.3.5)3/13 08/25/2020 9.23 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Guiding PrinciplesA. Instructor 1. Demonstrates expertise within their discipline through practical, applied, and/or related experience. 2. Individuals new to this rank may not have demonstrated ability to conduct independent scholarship and creative activity, but there must be substantive evidence of likely success at university teaching or its equivalent. 3. Instructors may be working toward a terminal degree. 4. An instructor's job description primarily relates to teaching or its equivalent and usually does not include scholarship and creative activity. 5. An instructor is not eligible for tenure, except at the community colleges. B. College Faculty : A person holding a college faculty appointment is eligible for advancement in rank but not eligible for tenure. C. Assistant Professor 1. Normally holds the highest terminal degree in their field of expertise. 2. Outstanding experience and recognition in a professional field may be considered the equivalent of the terminal degree. 3. An assistant professor is expected to have a thorough command of the subject matter of some segment of the discipline, in addition to a comprehension of the whole. 4. Assistant professors are tenure-track faculty members hired on a yearly, renewable contract for a maximum of seven years. 5. During the sixth year, assistant professors typically are evaluated for promotion and tenure simultaneously, having submitted their portfolio at the beginning of that year. 6. However, an assistant professor may elect to apply for tenure or promotion at any time with the written approval of department head and dean or their equivalents. 7. The application for tenure may occur only one time. 4/13 08/25/2020 9.23 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Guiding PrinciplesD. Associate Professor 1. An associate professor is often a mid-career faculty member who has been awarded tenure. 2. If a faculty member is initially employed at the rank of associate professor without tenure, the probationary period may vary depending upon agreements stipulated in writing at the time of initial hire. 3. Once tenured, associate professors may hold this rank indefinitely or apply for promotion. 4. Promotion to professor should not be considered to be forthcoming merely because of years of service to the university, or because tenure has previously been awarded. 5. In accordance with the principal unit's timelines, a faculty member may present a promotion portfolio in any given year. 6. An associate professor must demonstrate competence, continuous progress, and maturity over a large part of the academic field. 7. It is expected that evidence showing high quality of teaching and scholarship and creative activity has been provided and is current. E. Professor 1. A professor, sometimes referred to as a \"full professor,\" has established disciplinary, intellectual, and institutional leadership. 2. The professor demonstrates command and a mature view of the disciplinary field as evidenced by teaching and advising (or its equivalent) or similar experience, scholarship and creative activity, service, extension, or outreach. 3. Faculty members initially hired at the rank of professor are often given tenure on appointment. PART 6: FLEXIBILITY IN TENURE-TRACK (fka 5.90.3.6) Normally, before being considered for tenure, eligible faculty members serve six consecutive probationary years. The probationary period begins with the first year of the contract. Note that according to ARP 6.30 C. 3., \"New tenure-track faculty reporting for duty after the last Friday in September (12-month employees) or the second Friday in October (9-month employees) will not receive a temporary contract....\" The first contract will be issued at the beginning of the next contract period, which will constitute 5/13 08/25/2020 9.23 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Guiding Principlesthe first year of the probationary period toward tenure. During the sixth year, a case for tenure and/or promotion is made by the faculty member and considered by the university. Those achieving tenure are awarded a continuous contract at the end of their sixth year, while those not awarded tenure are given a one-year terminal contract for their seventh and final year of employment at NMSU. There may be exceptions, however, to shorten or lengthen the normal six-year probationary period. A. Credit for Prior Service (fka 5.90.3.6.1) 1. Faculty members with previous teaching and advising (or its equivalent), service, extension, outreach, scholarly, and/or administrative experience at another institution may have some or all of that experience taken into consideration on appointment at NMSU. 2. With executive vice-president and provost approval, and particularly when tenure has been granted to a candidate at another institution, tenure may be accorded at the time of initial appointment to the university. 3. Prior probationary service at another institution may count towards the six-year probationary period at NMSU, but usually only up to a maximum of three years. 4. Any expedited schedule must be recommended by the department head and dean and agreed to by both the executive vice-president and provost and the faculty member at the time of appointment. 5. The details of such credit for prior service, the resulting length of the probationary period, the timing of any third-year review, and the period for the tenure application process, shall all be stated unambiguously in the appointment letter. B. Extension of the Probationary Period (fka 5.90.3.6.2) When requested in writing within one year of the qualifying event by the faculty member, leaves of absence can lead to postponement of the tenure decision date; however, modifications in that date require the recommendation of the department head and dean and the approval of the executive vice-president and provost. Faculty responsibilities may be negotiated when the extension is requested. An extension may be granted up to two times, so long as the total pre-tenure probationary period does not exceed eight years. Exceptions to this limit can be made under extraordinary circumstances if approved by the executive vice-president and provost. Candidates must be held to the same standards of performance when the probationary period has been extended as6/13 08/25/2020 9.23 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Guiding Principlescandidates whose probationary period was not extended. The probationary period may be extended, upon written request, under the following circumstances: 1. Leave of Absence without Pay : Probationary faculty members may request in writing a leave of absence without pay, usually not to exceed one academic or fiscal year. Prior to initiating the leave, affected faculty may request in writing a probation extension of one year. 2. Military Leave of Absence : Involuntary induction into the armed forces entitles the faculty member to a leave of absence to cover the term of military service. Such leave constitutes valid grounds for requesting an extension of the tenure decision date. Similarly, a faculty member's voluntary participation in a military reserve program may lead to periodic or prolonged absence sufficient to affect the faculty member's performance ( e.g., annual active duty training, or active duty training or participation when a reserve unit is called to active duty) that constitutes valid grounds for extension of the tenure decision date. 3. Medical Leave of Absence : Probationary faculty members with a serious personal illness or providing prolonged, substantive care for a chronically ill family member may request in writing an extension of the tenure decision date, usually for one year. 4. Family Leave of Absence or Exceptional Family Responsibilities : Upon written request, probationary faculty members who become parents will receive a one-year automatic extension of the tenure decision date. Such an extension does not require that the faculty member take a leave of absence. 5. Catastrophic Events : Probationary faculty who have experienced a catastrophic event such as a fire or flood or who must aid family members in such situations may request in writing an extension of the tenure decision date. 6. Jury Duty : Prolonged jury service, when significantly affecting a faculty member's performance, constitutes a valid reason to petition for extension of the tenure decision date. 7. Other, as Negotiated : Extensions for other reasons may be negotiated. C. Reduction of the Probationary Period (fka 5.90.3.6.3)7/13 08/25/2020 9.23 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Guiding Principles1. Tenure Upon Initial NMSU Appointment : Faculty members who have worked in a teaching and advising (or its equivalent), service, extension, scholarly, and/or administrative role at another institution may have some or all of that work taken into consideration on appointment at NMSU. With executive vice-president and provost approval, and particularly when tenure has been granted to a candidate at another institution, tenure may be accorded at the time of initial appointment to the university. 2. Expedited Tenure Schedule : Prior probationary service at another institution may count towards the six-year probationary period at NMSU, but usually only up to a maximum of three years. Any expedited schedule must be recommended by the department head and dean and agreed to by both the executive vice-president and provost and the faculty member at the time of appointment. The details of such credit for prior service, the resulting length of the probationary period, the timing of any third-year review, and the period for the tenure application process, shall all be stated unambiguously in the appointment letter. In such instances, no extension of the probationary period will be granted unless the request falls in one of the categories mentioned in in subsection B. above, Extension of the Probationary Period. 3. Committee, Department Head and Dean Supported Appeal for Early Tenure Review : Current faculty may request the length of the probationary period be shortened. Such an appeal requires the written request of the faculty member, positive recommendations of the department promotion and tenure committee as determined in the spring review, department head, and dean. If this tenure application is not successful, the candidate's contract is not renewed according to the provisions of Rule ARP 9.43. D. Part-Time Faculty and Tenure (fka 5.90.3.6.4) 8/13 08/25/2020 9.23 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Guiding Principles1. Retention of Tenure Upon Move from Full Time to Part Time : Tenured, full-time faculty members who move to part-time status may retain tenure. a. Retention of tenure in such a case requires the written request of the faculty member, positive recommendations of the department head and dean, and approval of the executive vice- president and provost. b. While this rule encourages departments to accommodate reasonable requests for part-time appointment, part-time appointments are not an entitlement, and requests may be turned down. c. Pending availability of funding and the approval of the department head, dean and executive vice-president and provost, the faculty member may return later to full-time tenured status. ( See subsection 4. below) 2. Procedural Guidelines a. When a full-time, tenure-track position becomes part time, the time in rank is prorated based on full-time equivalent (FTE). b. As with full-time faculty, the maximum probationary period for part-time faculty members is the equivalent of six FTE years, with the tenure decision to be made before the end of the six full-time years of service. For example, a tenure-track candidate with a 0.50 FTE appointment must apply for tenure at the end of the 11th year. c. Part-time tenure-track faculty must be held to the same standards of performance relative to FTE as full-time faculty. d. If denied tenure, a faculty member on part-time appointment has only one year of continued part-time employment beyond the denial. 3. Regular Part Time Appointment Defined : Faculty members whose regular appointments are less than 0.50 FTE do not accumulate probationary time toward tenure. 4. Return from Part Time to Full Time : When recurring state funding is available, a tenure-track, part-time faculty member may apply for a full-time tenure track position and, if hired, apply earned tenure-track FTE from prior years toward tenure and promotion in the full-time position. E. Joint Appointment (with Dual Primary Responsibilities (fka 5.90.3.6.5)9/13 08/25/2020 9.23 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Guiding PrinciplesIn appropriate circumstances, a faculty member may be appointed in two departments or colleges. The faculty member with a joint appointment has a memorandum of understanding from all involved units. The memorandum of understanding stipulates the expected workload and allocation of effort distributed between the two departments; identifies the principal unit where tenure resides or will reside if applicable; defines the responsibilities of the faculty member in each unit; and indicates the term of appointment. The memorandum must explain the process for performance and promotion and tenure reviews, renewal of the joint appointment, and salary increases. Each unit must provide recommendations in annual, probationary, tenure, and promotion reviews. In joint appointments with centers or institutes, the tenure home must reside in a principal unit. In joint appointments with two or more academic units, one unit must be designated, by mutual agreement, as the tenure home. PART 7: MID-PROBATIONARY REVIEW (fka 5.90.3.7) Tenure-track faculty members may request a formal mid-probationary review by those principal units that make such an option available. The mid-probationary review is an optional opportunity to obtain feedback on the tenure-track faculty member's performance and is used to identify specific activities to enhance the candidate's progress toward promotion and tenure. The review is formative, intended to assist tenure-track faculty in achieving promotion and tenure and should take into account the allocation of work effort during the three years reviewed and be based upon the principal unit's criteria. The outcome must not be used as a determinant for setting merit pay or for contract continuation decisions. Principal units should see ARP 9.25 Part 4 for additional information PART 8: COMMUNITY COLLEGES, LIBRARY, AND COLLEGE FACULTY (fka 5.90.3.8) The community colleges (other than Do\u00f1a Ana Community College, whose division committees function as department committees), and the library faculty should begin their promotion and tenure deliberations with a 10/13 08/25/2020 9.23 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Guiding Principlescommittee that acts as a college-level committee. Specific variations are described below. A. Community Colleges (fka 5.90.3.8.1) 1. Mission and Corresponding Emphasis in Evaluation Process : The mission of NMSU's community colleges is to provide open access to quality education and support economic and cultural life in prescribed service areas. Community colleges provide traditional liberal arts education, vocational and technical training, contract training, community interest classes, and developmental education. Every effort is made to keep programs and curricula flexible, in order to accommodate varied and expanding community educational needs. Since the community college's primary role is the dissemination of information, more emphasis is placed on teaching and advising (or its equivalent), in the evaluation process. 2. Tenure Committees : Due to their size, the organizational structure for tenure review at the Alamogordo, Carlsbad, and Grants campuses consists of a tenure committee at each campus that evaluates and makes recommendations to the campus executive officer. B. The Library (fka 5.90.3.8.2) : The NMSU library faculty is expected to meet university requirements for academic appointment and promotion and tenure considerations. For these purposes, the category of librarianship is equivalent to the teaching and advising category. The NMSU Library places the highest value on the element of librarianship. Librarianship includes, but is not limited to the organization of knowledge, the understanding and use of technology as it relates to the information field, teaching, library management, service delivery, and building collections. 11/13 08/25/2020 9.23 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Guiding PrinciplesC. College Faculty (fka 5.90.3.8.3) : College faculty may hold ranks as described in Part 5, the Professorial Ranks, above and are eligible for promotion. A college faculty position can be converted to a tenure- track position when sufficient recurring funds are available and a national search is conducted. In relation to the promotion of college faculty, an understanding of the following guiding principles is necessary: 1. Criteria for Promotion : College Faculty should be evaluated for promotion based on the allocation of their effort to the areas of teaching and advising, service, scholarship and creative activity, or extension and outreach, service, and the relative mix of these duties. 2. Development of Promotion Procedures : Colleges must develop specific promotion procedures for their college faculty. The protections for College Faculty are the same as those given tenure-track faculty and tenure faculty in ARP 9.25 Parts 1, 4, and 8. 3. Representation on Committee : Committees for promotion of college faculty must include college faculty representation. 4. Appropriate Standards for Promotion : The different role played by college faculty should be recognized in the promotion process, and the standard for promotion should be appropriate given the role of college faculty.

The relative importance of each of these areas varies according to the cumulative allocation of effort statements. Each area is vital to the university's ability to achieve its mission, and the performance of a faculty member will be viewed as an indication of future contributions. PART 1: TEACHING AND ADVISING (fka 5.90.4.1) A.Elements of Teaching as Essential Criterion : Teaching is central to NMSU's mission. For those who teach, effectiveness in teaching and advising is an essential criterion for tenure and for advancement in rank. The teaching and advising category includes all forms of university-level instructional activity, as well as advising undergraduate and graduate students, both within and outside the university community. Such activities are commonly characterized by the dissemination of knowledge within a faculty member's area of expertise; skill in stimulating students to think critically and to apply knowledge to human problems; the integration and application of relevant domestic and international, social, political, economic, and ethical implications into class content; the preparation of students for careers in specific fields of study; and the creation and supervision of appropriate field or clinical practicum's.1/8 08/25/2020 9.24 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Criteria B. Responsibilities of Teaching and Advising : Teaching and advising responsibilities may include, but are not limited to, preparation for and teaching of a variety of courses, seminars, and other academic learning experiences; non-credit workshops and informal instructional activities; course and program development; team or collaborative teaching; web-based instruction, both on and off campus; supervision of student research, performances, or productions; service on graduate student program and research committees; field supervision and administration of field or clinical experiences; production of course materials, textbooks, web pages and other electronic aids to learning; and others. C. Forms of Faculty Advising : Faculty advising may take the form of assisting undergraduate or graduate students in the selection of courses or careers, assisting learners in educational programs on and off campus, mentoring students, serving as faculty adviser to student groups, research and teaching advising, as well as other forms. D. Evaluation of Teaching (fka 5.90.4.1.1) : 1. Evidence By Which Teaching Effectiveness is Assessed : Teaching is a complex and multifaceted activity. Therefore, several forms of evidence should be used to assess comprehensively teaching effectiveness. Each form of evidence should carry a weight appropriate to its importance in evaluating teaching. Such documentation must demonstrate command of subject matter, continuous growth, and development in the subject field, the ability to organize material and convey it effectively to students, assessment of student learning, revision and updates of curricula, and the integration of scholarship (for faculty who produce scholarship) and service with teaching. Materials appropriate for evaluating teaching should include: (a) evidence from the instructor, (b) evidence from other professionals, (c) evidence from students, and (d) evidence of student learning. 2. Principal Units To Develop Guidelines : Each principal unit is to create clear guidelines for its teaching faculty that define teaching responsibilities and specify required evidence documenting teaching effectiveness. Specific data to be included in the evaluation packet will be determined by each principal unit.2/8 08/25/2020 9.24 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Criteria E. Evaluation of Advising (fka 5.90.4.1.2) : For promotion and tenure considerations, performance in such activities must be documented and evaluated. Each principal unit is to create clear guidelines regarding the responsibilities and documentation requirements for its faculty who advise. PART 2: SCHOLARSHIP AND CREATIVE ACTIVITY (fka 5.90.4.2) A. Rationale : Scholarship and creative activity involves discovering and creating, teaching and disseminating, and applying knowledge and skills to worldly concerns. This understanding is grounded in Boyer's concept of the four scholarships: (1) the scholarship of discovery involves processes, outcomes, and the passionate commitment of the professoriate and others in the university to disciplined inquiry and exploration in the development of knowledge and skills; (2) the scholarship of teaching involves dynamic, reciprocal, and critically reflective processes among teachers and learners at the university and in the community in which their activity and interaction enriches and transforms knowledge and skills, taught and learned; (3) the scholarship of engagement refers to the many and varied ways to responsibly offer and employ knowledge and skills to matters of consequence to the university and the community; and (4) the scholarship of integration is the process by which knowledge and skills are assessed, interpreted, and applied in new and creative ways to produce new, richer, and more comprehensive, insights, understanding, and outcomes. B. NMSU Definition of Scholarship and Creative Activity : Scholarship and creative activity is both activity and product, employing dynamically interacting processes of discovery and creation, teaching and dissemination, engagement and application, and integration, in the pursuit of fulfilling the mission and vision of NMSU. Products developed through these processes, are public, open to peer review, and available for use by others. Scholarship and creative activity can take many forms, including but not limited to refereed publications. At NMSU's community colleges, scholarship and creative activity includes scholarship that is also evidenced by professional development activities that disseminate knowledge to the college's learning communities.3/8 08/25/2020 9.24 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Criteria C. Acknowledgement of Land Grant Mission : This definition reflects the university's mission as the state's land-grant university, serving the needs of New Mexico's diverse population through comprehensive programs of teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity, extension and outreach, and service. It addresses the breadth and diversity of scholarly and creative activity among faculty, staff, and students through which this mission is fulfilled. D. Use of Technology is a Factor in Evaluation Categories : The dissemination and creation of scholarly work using technology is becoming increasingly important. Accordingly, it is important that promotion and tenure committees recognize this when evaluating a candidate's portfolio. The rapid pace at which technology changes makes it difficult to use a single set of evaluation criteria to fit all cases encountered. Technology often crosses the rigid boundaries of teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity, service, extension, and outreach, and as such, it must be evaluated in as many of these categories as appropriate. Flexibility in evaluation of the candidate's technology efforts is paramount. Reviewers must be aware of expectations placed on the candidate at the time of hiring and during annual reviews and are encouraged to evaluate technology- based scholarship and creative activity using appropriate criteria. 4/8 08/25/2020 9.24 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Criteria E. Evaluation of Scholarship and Creative Activity (fka: 5.90.4.2.1) : All scholarly activity and outcomes, regardless of funding source, must consider the following criteria adapted from Diamond: 1. The activity's purposes, goals, and objectives are clear. The objectives are realistic and achievable. It addresses important questions in the field. 2. The activity reveals a high level of discipline-related expertise. The scholar brings to the activity a high level of relevant knowledge, skills, artistry, and reflective understanding. 3. Appropriate methods are used for the activity, including principles of honesty, integrity, and the methods have been chosen wisely, and applied effectively. It allows for replication or elaboration. 4. The activity achieves its goals and its outcomes have significant impact. It adds consequentially to the field. It breaks new ground or is innovative. It leads to further exploration or new avenues for exploration for the scholar and for others. 5. The activity and outcomes have been presented appropriately and effectively to its various audiences. 6. The activity and outcomes are judged meritorious and significant by one's peers. 7. The scholar has critically evaluated the activity and outcomes and has assessed the impact and implications on the greater community, the community of scholars and on one's own work. The scholar uses this assessment to improve, extend, revise, and integrate subsequent work. PART 3: EXTENSION AND OUTREACH (fka 5.90.4.3) Extension and outreach are essential to the university's mission because they disseminate information to the public; help the state by promoting economic development through the dissemination of new technologies and best practices; and serve as a basis for sustainable, community-oriented, informal education that addresses local needs through faculty affiliated with each county government in New Mexico. The central role of extension and outreach is recognized in that several principal units are dedicated to these functions. There are also numerous faculty members in other units for whom extension and outreach are major components of their duties.5/8 08/25/2020 9.24 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Criteria A. Evaluation of Extension and Outreach (fka 5.90.4.3.1) 1. Collaborative Effort: Extension and outreach work is collaborative by nature. Faculty should provide evidence of collaboration with whomever necessary to identify local needs, garner resources, discover and adapt new knowledge, design and deliver programs, assess clientele skill changes, and communicate program results. Collaborative effort should also include networking with other university faculty in identified areas of program discovery, development, and delivery, including applications to teaching and advising where appropriate. 2. Evaluation Guidelines : To evaluate extension and outreach scholarship the following guidelines are recommended: a. Faculty must provide evidence of extension and outreach scholarship in order that these [collaborative] efforts are recognized. b. The documentation should provide evidence that the work is: i. creative and intellectual; ii. validated by peers; iii. communicated to stakeholders; and iv. have an impact on stakeholders and the region. c. Components of extension scholarship include : i. developing programs based on locally identified needs, concerns, and/or issues; targeting specific audiences; ii. setting goals and objectives for the program; iii. reviewing current literature and/or research for the program; iv. planning appropriate program delivery; v. documenting changes in clientele knowledge, behaviors, attitudes, and/or skills; vi. conducting a reflective critique and/or evaluation of the program; vii. validation of the program by peers and/or stakeholders; and viii. communication of results to stakeholders and decision makers. PART 4: SERVICE (fka 5.90.4.4)6/8 08/25/2020 9.24 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Criteria Service is an essential component of the university's mission and requires that the faculty member contribute to the organization and development of the university, as well as provide service to any local, state, national, or international agency, organization, or institution needing the faculty member's professional knowledge and skills. A. Evaluation of Service (fka 5.90.4.4.1) :The type and amount of service that a faculty member performs should be determined in consultation with the appropriate administrator(s). All relevant activities in which a faculty member participates should receive appropriate consideration for promotion and tenure decisions. Service contributions should be evaluated based on how they are applied and how they draw upon the professional expertise of the faculty member. PART 5: LEADERSHIP (fka 5.90.4.5) In demonstrating leadership, candidates must show that they are having an impact as evidenced by the candidate's scholarship and creative activity, and by contributions to the advancement of the university which may include administrative roles in which considerable and well-documented contributions to the university have been made. A. Evaluation of Leadership (fka 5.90.4.5.1) : Leadership is characterized by: (1) contribution to the mission of the college or university and to the faculty member's profession; (2) participation in the distribution of responsibility among the members of a group; (3) empowering and mentoring group members; and (4) group's decision-making process.

(See Also ARP 9.33 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure: The Professorial Ranks ) This Rule also provides guiding principles (Part 2), the elements required to be in each Principal Unit's Performance Evaluation policies (Part 4), and procedural guidelines relating to annual performance evaluation of the regular faculty (Part 5). ( See Also ARP 6.71 DepartmentHead Appointments and ARP 6.35 - Non-tenure Track Faculty Appointments .) PART 2: GUIDING PRINCIPLES RELATING TO ANNUAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (See Also ARP 6.61 Faculty Assignments - Teaching Load ) A.Service to Mission : The amount of effort that faculty members regardless of rank or position devote to the various aspects of their duties necessarily varies, and any promotion and tenure process will recognize these variations. A successful process considers whether the faculty member is effectively serving the mission of the university, as defined by a department's criteria and the individual's agreed upon goals and objectives. This means, for example, that the efforts of a faculty member made in response to administrators or committees are taken into account during promotion and tenure evaluation.1/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular FacultyB. Consideration for Variance in Duties : The efforts of two faculty members may vary at the same points in their careers according to their particular strengths and department needs. Faculty assignments in different departments will also vary. For example, a department or program must not impose similar expectations for scholarship and creative activity, service, extension, or outreach from a faculty member teaching one class a semester as from another faculty member teaching three classes a semester or several large lecture classes. C. Equitable Treatment : In order to ensure equitable treatment, every faculty member will complete an Allocation of Effort statement ( See Part 4. B. 1. below) as part of the Annual Performance Evaluation process. When determining the Allocation of Effort, decisions must be made without regard to race, national origin, gender, gender identity, age, disability, political beliefs, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, special friendships, or animus towards candidates. Further, for the Allocation of Effort statement to be accurate and useful, administrators at all levels must understand and take an active role in avoiding institutional factors that could produce an undue burden on untenured faculty members. PART 3: THE FOUR AREAS OF FACULTY EFFORT: TEACHING AND ADVISING, SCHOLARSHIP AND CREATIVE ACTIVITY, EXTENSION AND OUTREACH, AND SERVICE A. Evaluation Emphasizes Four Areas of Faculty Effort Serious attention must be given to performance in the Four Areas of Faculty Effort : teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity, service, and extension and outreach. The relative importance of each of these areas varies according to the cumulative Allocation of Effort statements. Each area is vital to the university's ability to achieve its mission, and the performance of a faculty member will be viewed as an indication of future contributions. B. Leadership May Be Considered in Each Area of Faculty Effort While a faculty member's performance must be evaluated through their contributions to the Four Areas of Faculty Effort, leadership is an important component. Leadership must not be considered as a separate area to be2/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular Facultyevaluated. Rather, when applicable, its value should be considered in how they affect performance in one or more of the Four Areas of Faculty Effort. C. Teaching and Advising 1. Description of Teaching and Advising Activities : a. Elements of Teaching as Essential Criterion : Teaching is central to NMSU's mission. For those who teach, effectiveness in teaching and advising is an essential criterion for tenure and for advancement in rank. The teaching and advising category includes all forms of university-level instructional activity, as well as advising undergraduate and graduate students, both within and outside the university community. Such activities are commonly characterized by the dissemination of knowledge within a faculty member's area of expertise; skill in stimulating students to think critically and to apply knowledge to human problems; the integration and application of relevant domestic and international, social, political, economic, and ethical implications into class content; the preparation of students for careers in specific fields of study; and the creation and supervision of appropriate field or clinical practicums. b. Responsibilities of Teaching and Advising : Teaching and advising responsibilities may include, but are not limited to, preparation for and teaching of a variety of courses, seminars, and other academic learning experiences; non-credit workshops and informal instructional activities; course and program development; team or collaborative teaching; web-based instruction, both on and off campus; supervision of student research, performances, or productions; service on graduate student program and research committees; field supervision and administration of field or clinical experiences; production of course materials, textbooks, web pages and other electronic aids to learning; and others. c. Forms of Faculty Advising : Faculty advising may take the form of assisting undergraduate or graduate students in the selection of courses or careers, assisting learners in educational programs on and off campus, mentoring students, serving as faculty adviser to student groups, research and teaching advising, as well as other forms. (See Also ARP 9.32 Part 8, \"University Library Faculty\") 3/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular Faculty2. Evaluation Criteria for Teaching and Advising : a. Evidence to Assess Teaching Effectiveness : Teaching is a complex and multifaceted activity. Therefore, several forms of evidence should be used to assess comprehensively teaching effectiveness. Each form of evidence will be weighted according to appropriate to its importance in evaluating teaching. Such documentation must demonstrate command of subject matter, the ability to organize material and convey it effectively to students, and assessment of student learning. It may also demonstrate revision and updates of curricula, and the integration of scholarship (for faculty who produce scholarship) and service with teaching. Materials appropriate for evaluating teaching should include : (a) evidence from the instructor, (b) evidence from other professionals, (c) evidence from students, and (d) evidence of student learning. It is not necessary for all four types of evidence to be used, but in accordance with state law, at a minimum, student evaluations and one other form of evidence must be used. Student evaluations considered as part of performance evaluations, may not include numerical ratings, letter grades, or other \"scores\" of specific aspects of the course, the course as a whole, or of the instructor. b. Principal Units to Develop Guidelines : Each Principle Unit is to create clear guidelines for its teaching faculty that define teaching responsibilities and specify required evidence documenting teaching effectiveness. Specific data to be included in the evaluation packet will be determined by each Principle Unit. c. Evaluation of Advising : For evaluation promotion and tenure considerations, performance in such activities must be documented and evaluated. Each Principle Unit is to create clear guidelines regarding the responsibilities and documentation requirements for its faculty who advise or mentor. D. Scholarship and Creative Activity: 1. Description of Scholarly and Creative Activities :4/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular Facultya. Rationale : This understanding is grounded in Boyer's concept of the four scholarships: i. The scholarship of discovery involves processes, outcomes, and the passionate commitment of the professoriate and others in the university to disciplined inquiry and exploration in the development of knowledge and skills; ii. The scholarship of teaching involves dynamic, reciprocal, and critically reflective processes among teachers and learners at the university and in the community in which their activity and interaction enriches and transforms knowledge and skills, taught and learned; iii. The scholarship of engagement refers to the many and varied ways to responsibly offer and employ knowledge and skills to matters of consequence to the university and the community; and iv. The scholarship of integration is the process by which knowledge and skills are assessed, interpreted, and applied in new and creative ways to produce new, richer, and more comprehensive, insights, understanding, and outcomes. Boyer, Ernest L. (1990). v. Scholarship reconsidered : Priorities of the Professoriate. New York: Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. b. NMSU Definition of Scholarship and Creative Activity : Products developed through these processes, are typically public, open to peer review, and available for use by others, but may also include classified projects, protected intellectual property or other confidential materials. Scholarship and creative activity can take many forms, including but not limited to refereed publications and patented intellectual property. At NMSU's community colleges, scholarship and creative activity includes scholarship that is also evidenced by professional development activities that disseminate knowledge to the college's learning communities. 5/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular Facultyc. Acknowledgement of Land Grant Mission : This definition reflects the university's mission as the state's land-grant university, serving the needs of New Mexico's diverse population through comprehensive programs of teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity, extension and outreach, and service. It addresses the breadth and diversity of scholarly and creative activity among faculty, staff, and students through which this mission is fulfilled. 2. Evaluation Criteria for Scholarship and Creative Activity : All scholarly activity and outcomes, regardless of funding source, must consider the following criteria adapted from Diamond: a. The activity's purposes, goals, and objectives are clear. The objectives are realistic and achievable. It addresses important questions in the field. b. The activity reveals a high level of discipline-related expertise. The scholar brings to the activity a high level of relevant knowledge, skills, artistry, and reflective understanding. c. Appropriate methods are used for the activity, including principles of honesty, integrity, and objectivity. The methods have been chosen wisely, and applied effectively. It allows for replication or elaboration. d. The activity achieves its goals and its outcomes have significant impact. It adds consequentially to the field. It breaks new ground or is innovative. It leads to further exploration or new avenues for exploration for the scholar and for others. e. The activity and outcomes have been presented appropriately and effectively to its various audiences. f. The activity and outcomes are judged meritorious and significant by one's peers. g. The scholar has critically evaluated the activity and outcomes and has assessed the impact and implications on the greater community, the community of scholars and on one's own work. The scholar uses this assessment to improve, extend, revise, and integrate subsequent work. Diamond, Robert M. (2002). Serving on promotion, tenure, and faculty review committees: A faculty guide, 2nd ed. Bolton, MA: Ankar Publishing. E. Extension and Outreach:6/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular Faculty1. Description of Extension and Outreach Activitie s: a. The central role of extension and outreach is recognized in that several Principle Units are dedicated to these functions. There are also numerous faculty members in other units for whom extension and outreach are major components of their duties. b. Collaborative Effort : Extension and outreach work is collaborative by nature. Faculty should provide evidence of collaboration with whomever necessary to identify local needs, garner resources, discover and adapt new knowledge, design and deliver programs, assess clientele skill changes, and communicate program results. Collaborative effort should also include networking with other university faculty in identified areas of program discovery, development, and delivery, including applications to teaching and advising where appropriate. 2. Evaluation Criteria for Extension and Outreach : Faculty must provide evidence of the collaborative and other efforts to receive recognition in this Area of Faculty Effort. a. The documentation should provide evidence that the work is: i. creative and intellectual; ii. communicated to stakeholders; and iii. have a beneficial effect on stakeholders and the region. b. Components of extension include : i. developing programs based on locally identified needs, concerns, and/or issues; targeting specific audiences; ii. setting goals and objectives for the program; iii. reviewing current literature and/or research for the program; iv. planning appropriate program delivery; v. documenting changes in clientele knowledge, behaviors, attitudes, and/or skills; vi. conducting a reflective critique and/or evaluation of the program; vii. validation of the program by peers and/or stakeholders; and viii. communicating results to stakeholders and decision makers. F. Service7/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular Faculty1. Description of Service Activities : Service is an essential component of the university's mission and requires the faculty member to contribute to the organization and development of the university, as well as to provide service to local, state, national, or international agencies, organizations or institutions which may benefit from the faculty member's professional knowledge and skills. 2. Evaluation Criteria for Service Activities : The type and amount of service that a faculty member performs should be determined in consultation with the appropriate administrator(s). All relevant activities in which a faculty member participates should receive appropriate consideration for promotion and tenure decisions. Service contributions should be evaluated based on how they are applied and how they draw upon the professional expertise of the faculty member. PART 4: REQUIREMENTS FOR PRINCIPAL UNITS' EVALUATION POLICIES A. Policies Performance evaluation policies of the Principle Units must: 1. State that Performance Evaluations are conducted annually. 2. Include a timeline consistent with the timeline for promotion and for tenure as described in ARP 9.25 Part 9, \"University Timeline for Promotion and Tenure.\" 3. Require that each faculty member meet with their department head or comparable administrator annually regarding progress toward promotion and tenure as appropriate, the recording of objectives and goals, and the department faculty evaluation format. 4. Describe the process for the faculty member to submit a written statement in response to the annual performance evaluations. 5. Outline process for transmitting the performance evaluation, along with any supporting material, from the faculty member to the faculty member's department head. 6. Describe a process for transmitting a written copy of the department head review to the individual being reviewed and, along with the faculty member's written statement, if any, to the dean or equivalent administrator.8/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular Faculty7. Include a certification from the department head indicating that the Annual Performance Evaluation meeting with the faculty member occurred. The performance evaluation will not be considered final until the meeting has occurred and been documented, typically by the signatures of the Department Head and the faculty member. B. Performance Evaluation Forms Performance evaluation forms in the Principle Units must include the following elements: 1. Allocation of Effort Statement : a. Use of Allocation of Effort Statement : Each college shall develop and use an Allocation of Effort statement as specified here and in ARP 6.61. These statements shall also be a part of the candidate/faculty member's tenure and/or promotion Portfolio, and all aspects of the agreed upon efforts shall be factored into the recommendation made at each step of the process. b. The allocation percentages will be negotiated by the faculty member and the department head in alignment with the departmental workload policy and ARP 6.61, and will be approved annually by the faculty member's department head and dean. If agreement cannot be reached, the dean or equivalent administrator may assign the Allocation of Effort, and the faculty member may appeal through existing university procedures. c. The Allocation of Effort statement and assigned percentages may be altered during the year with the mutual agreement of the faculty member, department head, and dean to reflect changing circumstances, such as service on a particularly time-consuming committee or grant, time for scholarship and creative activity, emergency teaching and advising assignments, etc. 9/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular Facultyd. At the minimum, the Allocation of Effort statement will contain the following elements : i. Percentage of effort to be devoted to the Four Areas of Faculty Effort. The total percentage shall be 100%, but any category may be zero percent. ii. A statement of what the Principle Unit considers a full teaching and advising load. iii. If the Principle Unit utilizes a weighting, ranking, or scoring system, the value assigned to each category must be indicated. The values must be calculated proportionately to the faculty member's Allocation of Effort. 2. Current Position Description. 3. Submission from Faculty Member : A written section submitted by the faculty member detailing and citing accomplishments in relation to the Four Areas of Faculty Effort. 4. Written Review by Department Head : A written review from the department head including specific commendations, concerns, and recommendations in each of the areas of performance, as well as separate comments about progress toward promotion and tenure. PART 5: PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES FOR ANNUAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION A. The performance of each regular faculty member, including College Faculty, Research Faculty, and library faculty, must be reviewed at least once a year. The Annual Performance Evaluation provides documentation of expectations and a record of faculty performance relative to stated expectations in Allocation of Effort documents. B. Each college and community college determines and uses its own performance evaluation form ( See Part 4.B. above, \"Performance Evaluation Forms\"). Early in each fall semester the department head supplies each faculty member with a form. At this time the department head confers with new faculty members concerning the recording of objectives and goals and the general use of the form. In the case of continuing faculty members, the department head or faculty may request a conference for the purpose of revising or updating objectives previously agreed upon. Department heads will share the above agreements in writing with the faculty member.10/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular FacultyC. Department heads are expected to meet with all new faculty members regarding progress toward promotion and tenure and to certify in writing to the appropriate dean that these meetings have occurred. Returning faculty members or their department heads may request an annual meeting regarding progress toward promotion and tenure. Specific evaluative comments in each of the three areas of performance are required, as well as separate comments about progress toward tenure and toward promotion. D. Each faculty member completes a written form or digital database detailing and citing accomplishments in Four Areas of Faculty Effort, of teaching, research and/or creative scholarship, service, and extension and outreach during the performance evaluation period. The type, method of collection, and disposition of evidence regarding effectiveness of teaching is of particular importance, and faculty should consult their with department head concerning collection of this evidence. The performance evaluation form, along with any supplemental material, is submitted by each faculty member to the faculty member's department head. E. The department head reviews the faculty performance forms, prepares a written evaluation based upon accomplishments reported as compared with previously set goals and objectives (a copy of this report will be shared with the faculty member), and confers with appropriate deans on the written recommendation and the prepared summary to be discussed with the faculty member. Following the conference with the dean, the department head meets with the faculty member to discuss all aspects of the performance evaluation, addressing separately the person's progress toward promotion, progress toward tenure, strengths, and weaknesses. This conference also serves to set goals and objectives for the ensuing year. These goals and objectives will be placed in writing, with a copy to the faculty member. At community colleges with program coordinators, the coordinator performs the duties of a department head in the evaluation process. F. Department heads, along with departmental promotion and tenure committees, college dean, and college promotion and tenure committees formulate independent recommendations where appropriate regarding evaluation on the basis of policies stated in this manual. These are communicated to the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. G. Each college generates its own time schedule for accomplishing the above items within the parameters of the university calendar.11/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Regular FacultyDetails Scope: NMSU System Source: ARP Chapter 9 | HR - Performance Evaluation, Promotion and Tenure Rule Administrator: Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Last Updated: 05/20/2019 Related Cross-Reference: ARP 6.35 - Non-tenure Track Faculty Appointments ARP 6.61 - Assignments - Teaching Load ARP 6.71 - Department Head Appointments ARP 9.25 - [Pre-AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure - Policies ARP 9.32 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure: Purpose and Guiding Principles ARP 9.33 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure: The Professorial Ranks Combined P & T Rules Through 08/12/2018 (PDF) Combined P & T Rules After 08/12/2018 (PDF) Revision History: 05/20/2019 Amendment [FSP Prop 16-18/19] approved formerly part of Rule 5.86 (AY18/19) 05/10/2017 Adoption approved by Chancellor, with 08/13/2018 Effective Date 10/21/2015 former Policy 5.86 replicated by Board of Regents as initial Rule 5.86 07/15/2008 Amendments to Policy 5.90 ratified by Board of Regents, with 08/01/2008 effective date Prior revision history as Policy 5.86 not available12/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular Faculty\u00a9 2017 New Mexico State University - Board of Regents 13/13 08/25/2020 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] - Regular Faculty9.32 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure: Purpose and Guiding Principles arp.nmsu.edu /9-32 PART 1: PURPOSE Promotion and tenure decisions are the means by which NMSU rewards and retains its most valued scholars, sustains excellence in its instructional disciplines, and fulfills its mission to advance knowledge. The quality of faculty accomplishments in teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity, extension and outreach, and service, (collectively referred to as the Four Areas of Faculty Effort), largely determines the quality of the university as a whole. The processes involved in promotion and tenure must be fair, transparent, and participatory. For additional rules and principles relating to promotion and tenure, See Cross References listed in the box at end of this Rule. PART 2: NATURE OF PROMOTION AND TENURE REVIEWS 1. The integrity of the promotion and tenure processes relies upon consultation by and between groups and individuals with successively broader views of the mission of the university, participation by the involved faculty member, who has an opportunity to seek redress for perceived violations of policy, rules or procedure which might unfairly affect the outcome. ( See ARP 9.34, Part 1 - Principal Unit Committees; ARP 9.35 , Part 5 - Roles and Responsibilities in Promotion and Tenure Reviews and Part 9 - Right to Seek Redress for Violation of Faculty Evaluation, Promotion and Tenure Rules.) In order to achieve fairness, transparency, and broad-based participation, all of the parties must base decisions on the documentation described in the NMSU Rules on Faculty Evaluation, Promotion and Tenure.1/6 08/25/2020 9.32 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure: Purpose and Guiding Principles2. The NMSU Rules on Faculty Evaluation, Promotion and Tenure are based in large part on the four types of scholarship defined by Ernest L. Boyer , namely, the scholarships of discovery, of teaching, of integration, and of engagement. At NMSU, Boyer's definition of scholarship has been broadened to reflect the changing roles of faculty members in teaching and advising, scholarship and creative activity, extension and outreach, and service. See ARP 9.31 Part 3.D. (Scholarship and Creative Activity) 3. Applicants for tenure or promotion must be reviewed on their performance of the duties assigned to them, following agreed-upon allocations of effort. ( See ARP 9.31 Part 2 ; ARP 6.61 Faculty Assignments - Teaching Load ) PART 3: FACULTY PARTICIPATION The selection and retention of faculty members are of utmost importance to the quality of the university, the achievement of university goals, and the future of the institution. In order to ensure a fair process for recognition of excellent faculty, it shall be the policy of the university to allow faculty members to vote on the promotion or tenure of departmental colleagues, exercising collegial judgment based on criteria established for promotion and tenure by the Principal Units and consistent with the NMSU Rules on Faculty Evaluation, Promotion and Tenure. PART 4: TRANSPARENCY OF PROCESS Faculty members are entitled to know what is expected of them, how they will be evaluated, and the rules of each applicable process.[1] 2/6 08/25/2020 9.32 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure: Purpose and Guiding PrinciplesA. Promotion and Tenure Information to be Provided to Eligible Faculty : Upon hiring of a regular faculty member, the department head or head of the Principle Unit, will provide the faculty member with electronic copies of applicable promotion and tenure policies, including departmental, college (or comparable equivalent) and university (See Combined P & T Rules Through 08/12/2018 or Combined P & T Rules After 8/12/2018 ). The department head, or head of the Principle Unit, will provide, electronically, a similar packet of materials to faculty members eligible to be considered for promotion and/or tenure during the spring semester prior the academic year in which the application for promotion and/or tenure will be made. B. Notice of Principal Unit Functions and Criteria Statement or Equivalent : Each departmental Principal Unit shall post on its website its current statement of goals, objectives, and expectations as these relate to promotion and tenure (sometimes called a functions and criteria statement). These shall be agreed upon by the faculty in each department and approved by the responsible dean or comparable administrator. C. Notice of Principal Unit Promotion and Tenure Policies and Procedures : Each Principal Unit shall post on its website its written promotion and tenure policy document, which must be in alignment with the NMSU Rules on Faculty Evaluation, Promotion and Tenure. In addition, they must post the link to the Office of the Provost's website. D. Notice of NMSU Rules on Faculty Evaluation, Promotion and Tenure : The Office of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs will post the current and previous editions of the NMSU Rules on Faculty Evaluation, Promotion and Tenure on its website. It will also post other relevant information pertaining to the annual promotion and tenure review processes, including but not limited to forms, to explain and facilitate the process for candidates and academic administrators alike. PART 5: AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST University faculty and academic administrators involved in the review and recommendation or decision making processes relating to an application for promotion or tenure shall not have any conflict of interest that would3/6 08/25/2020 9.32 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure: Purpose and Guiding Principlesrender them unable to perform their duties in a fair, impartial and equitable manner. See Also conflict of interest rules ARP 3.00 - 3.13 and ARP 3.25 Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct on Campus . PART 6: STATEMENT ON VALUE OF DIVERSITY; COMMITMENT AGAINST DISCRIMINATION NMSU values the richness that inquiry based upon intellectual and cultural differences brings to the university community. NMSU administrators recognize that all employment decisions must be made without regard to race, national origin, gender, gender identity, age, disability, political beliefs, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, special friendships, or animus towards candidates, taking care to avoid conflicts of interest, structural, institutional, or habitual thoughts and patterns that could lead to disparate treatment, including prohibited discrimination and undue preferential treatment. ( See Also conflict of interest rules ARP 3.00 - 3.13 and ARP3.25 Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct on Campus .) PART 7: COMMUNITY COLLEGES The mission of the NMSU community colleges is to provide open access to quality education and support economic and cultural life in prescribed service areas. Community colleges provide traditional liberal arts education, vocational and technical training, contract training, community interest classes, and developmental education. Every effort is made to keep programs and curricula flexible, in order to accommodate varied and expanding community educational needs. Since the community college's primary role is the dissemination of information, more emphasis is placed on teaching and advising, in the evaluation process. Due to their size, the organizational structure for tenure review at the Alamogordo, Carlsbad, and Grants campuses consists of one tenure committee instead of two. (See ARP 9.34) PART 8: UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FACULTY 4/6 08/25/2020 9.32 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure: Purpose and Guiding PrinciplesUniversity library faculty are expected to meet university requirements for academic appointment and promotion and tenure considerations. For these purposes, the category of librarianship is equivalent to the teaching and advising category. The University Library places the highest value on the element of librarianship. Librarianship includes, but is not limited to the organization of knowledge, the understanding and use of technology as it relates to the information field, teaching, library management, service delivery, and building collections. PART 9: COLLEGE AND RESEARCH FACULTY College and Research faculty may hold ranks as described in ARP 9.33 and are eligible to be considered for promotion. The distinct roles of the College and Research Faculty should be recognized in the promotion process, and the standards and criteria for promotion should be appropriately adjusted. Committees for promotion of College and Research Faculty must include college faculty representation.

The six year probationary period may be reduced or extended, in accordance with the guidelines in Part 2, and with the proper approvals. The probationary period begins with the first contract for a full academic year. See Also ARP9.40 - Tenure Track Faculty - Pre-Tenure Period . PART 2: FLEXIBILITY IN TENURE-TRACK This Part describes the circumstances which may justify modification of the six year term of the pre-tenure probationary period. 1/17 08/25/2020 9.35 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure Reviews... A. Credit for Prior Service : Faculty members with previous teaching and advising, service, extension, outreach, scholarly, and/or administrative experience at another institution may have some or all of that experience taken into consideration on appointment at NMSU, provided that the department head, dean and provost and senior vice president for academic affairs and faculty appointee agree at the time of the appointment. The details of any agreed upon credit for prior service shall be documented unambiguously in the appointment letter, including but not limited to: the years of prior service being credited, the resulting length of the probationary period, the timing for any Mid- Probationary Review, and the expectation relating to the timing for the tenure application process. Dependent upon the nature of the prior experience or the qualifications of the faculty applicant, examples which would justify granting credit for prior service include and are not limited to: 1. When tenure has been granted to a candidate at another institution, tenure may be accorded at the time of initial appointment to the university. 2. Up to three years of prior probationary service at another institution may count towards the six-year probationary period at NMSU. B. Extension of the Probationary Period : When requested in writing within one year of the qualifying event by the faculty member, leaves of absence can lead to postponement of the tenure decision date; however, modifications in that date require the recommendation of the department head and dean and the approval of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. Faculty responsibilities may be negotiated when the extension is requested. An extension may be granted up to two times, so long as the total pre-tenure probationary period does not exceed eight years. Exceptions to this limit can be made under extraordinary circumstances if approved by the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. Candidates must be held to the same standards of performance when the probationary period has been extended as candidates whose probationary period was not extended. The probationary period may be extended, upon written request, under the following circumstances: 1. Leave of Absence without Pay : Probationary faculty members may request in writing a leave of absence without pay, usually not to exceed one academic or fiscal year. Prior to initiating the leave, affected faculty may request in writing a probation extension of one year.2/17 08/25/2020 9.35 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure Reviews... 2. Military Leave of Absence : Involuntary induction into the armed forces entitles the faculty member to a leave of absence to cover the term of military service. Such leave constitutes valid grounds for requesting an extension of the tenure decision date. Similarly, a faculty member's voluntary participation in a military reserve program may lead to periodic or prolonged absence sufficient to affect the faculty member's performance (e.g., annual active duty training, or active duty training or participation when a reserve unit is called to active duty) that constitutes valid grounds for extension of the tenure decision date. 3. Medical Leave of Absence : Probationary faculty members with a serious personal illness or providing prolonged, substantive care for a chronically ill family member may request in writing an extension of the tenure decision date, usually for one year. 4. Family Leave of Absence or Exceptional Family Responsibilities : Upon written request, probationary faculty members who become parents will receive a one-year automatic extension of the tenure decision date. Such an extension does not require that the faculty member take a leave of absence. 5. Catastrophic Events : Probationary faculty who have experienced a catastrophic event such as a fire or flood or who must aid family members in such situations may request in writing an extension of the tenure decision date. 6. Jury Duty : Prolonged jury service, when significantly affecting a faculty member's performance, constitutes a valid reason to petition for extension of the tenure decision date. 7. Other, as Negotiated : Extensions for other reasons may be negotiated. C. Faculty Request for Early Tenure Review : A Request for Early Tenure Review is initiated in writing by the faculty member, and requires positive recommendations from the Department Promotion and Tenure Committee (as determined in the review of progress toward promotion and/or tenure), department head, and dean; followed by approval by the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. If an Early Tenure Review application is not successful, the candidate's contract will not be renewed, consistent with the provisions of ARP 9.40 - Tenure Track Faculty - Pre-Tenure Period. 3/17 08/25/2020 9.35 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure Reviews... D. Changes Between Full and Part Time Employment : 1. Tenure track faculty members whose regular appointments are less than 0.50 FTE do not accumulate probationary time toward tenure. 2. When a full-time, tenure-track position becomes part-time, the time in rank is prorated based on full-time equivalent (FTE). As with full-time faculty, the maximum probationary period for part- time faculty members is the equivalent of six FTE years, with the tenure decision to be made before the end of the six full-time years of service. For example, a tenure-track candidate with a 0.50 FTE appointment must apply for tenure at the end of the 11th year. Part-time Tenure-Track Faculty must be held to the same standards of performance relative to FTE as full-time faculty. If denied tenure, a faculty member on part-time appointment has only one year of continued part-time employment beyond the denial. 3. When recurring state funding is available, a tenure-track, part- time faculty member may apply for a full-time tenure track position and, if hired, apply earned tenure-track FTE from prior years toward tenure and promotion in the full-time position. 4. Tenured, full-time faculty members approved to move to part- time status may retain tenure. Retention of tenure in such a case requires the written request of the faculty member, positive recommendations from the department head and dean; followed by approval of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. While this rule encourages departments to accommodate reasonable requests for part-time appointment, part-time appointments are not an entitlement, and requests may be turned down. Pending availability of funding and the approval of the department head, dean and provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, the faculty member may return later to full-time tenured status. PART 3: MID-PROBATIONARY REVIEW Tenure-track faculty members may request, or individual units may require, a formal Mid-Probationary Review. The Mid-Probationary Review is an opportunity for feedback on the Tenure-Track Faculty member/future candidate's performance and is used to identify specific activities to enhance4/17 08/25/2020 9.35 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure Reviews... the candidate's progress toward promotion and tenure. The review is formative, intended to assist Tenure-Track Faculty in achieving promotion and tenure and should take into account the allocation of work effort during the three years reviewed and be based upon the Principle Unit's criteria. The outcome must not be used as a determinant for setting merit pay or for contract continuation decisions. Principal units should refer to ARP 9.34, Part 3 for additional information PART 4: JOINT APPOINTMENT (WITH DUAL PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES) In appropriate circumstances, a faculty member may be appointed in two departments or in two colleges. The faculty member seeking a joint appointment must obtain a signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by the department head and dean of each involved unit. The MOU must state the agreement between the involved units in the following areas : A. The units involved and the intended tenure home. It must identify the Principle Unit where tenure resides or will reside if applicable. In joint appointments with centers or institutes, the tenure home must reside in a Principle Unit. In joint appointments with two or more academic units, one unit must be designated, by mutual agreement, as the tenure home. B. Expectations for workload and Allocation of Effort, including specific responsibilities distributed between the involved units. C. The term of appointment and any other conditions of employment. D. Provisions explaining the process for the annual performance evaluation and promotion and tenure reviews, renewal of the joint appointment, and salary increases. Each unit must provide recommendations in annual, probationary, tenure, and promotion reviews. PART 5: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN PROMOTION OR TENURE REVIEWS 5/17 08/25/2020 9.35 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure Reviews... A. Candidate 1. Maintains a curriculum vitae and a cumulative personal record of the activities and accomplishments affecting the application for promotion and/or tenure. 2.

Special achievement shall be rewarded in a manner determined by each college or community college campus. For a tenured faculty member who receives two successive unsatisfactory annual reviews with identified and uncorrected serious deficiencies, this rule provides a mechanism to establish a remedial program for correcting the deficiencies. The legislation to which this rule responds is particularly concerned with the quality of teaching, and that fact shall be considered when taking any action under this rule. In particular, faculty whose teaching needs improvement will be urged to take advantage of \"programs designed to assist faculty members in enhancing their teaching skills.\" (NMSA 1978, Section 21-1-7.1) PART 2: ANNUAL REVIEWS (fka 5.87.2) 1/6 08/25/2020 9.36 - Faculty Post Tenure ReviewA. Annual Review for Tenured Faculty : Tenured faculty members annually participate in and receive an extensive examination of their teaching, their research and scholarly output, and their service as part of the annual review process conducted in accordance with ARP 9.31 - [Effective AY 18/19] Annual Performance Evaluation - Regular Faculty . This annual review document shall be labeled the Post Tenure Review of each tenured faculty member. This Post Tenure Review shall weight the three areas of teaching, scholarly work, and service in proportion to the percentage each category is given in the faculty member's allocation of effort for a given year. B. Post Tenure Review Not Applicable for Full Time Administrators : Administrators who hold tenured faculty rank are reviewed on the performance of their faculty duties (teaching, research, and service). Administrators who have no assigned faculty duties will not be reviewed under this rule. PART 3: MORE COMPLETE POST-TENURE REVIEWS (fka 5.87.3) A. Notification to Faculty Member about Deficiency : If, in the judgment of a superior, the annual review for a tenured faculty member shows a serious deficiency in the performance of that faculty member, the superior shall inform the faculty member in writing of the deficiency as well as recommend actions the faculty member might take to address the issue. B. Deficiency Not Rectified : If the deficiency or deficiencies continues for two or more years and if the faculty member has not taken the corrective actions, one of two possible courses of action may ensue: 1. The faculty member may request that the superior submit the record of poor performance and suggested actions to the other tenured faculty members of the unit for consideration in a more complete review, or 2. If the faculty member does not request the review, the superior may initiate such a review with the concurrence of a majority of the tenured faculty in the academic unit.2/6 08/25/2020 9.36 - Faculty Post Tenure ReviewC. Goal of and Procedures for More Complete Review : The more complete review shall have the aim of identifying strengths and weaknesses of the faculty member in teaching, research, and service. 1. This review shall be undertaken by the departmental promotion and tenure committee. 2. If there is no departmental promotion and tenure committee for that unit, the review will be undertaken by the equivalent college- level promotion and tenure committee as specified ARP 9.35 - [Effective AY 18/19] Faculty Promotion and Tenure Reviews: Procedural Guidelines and Timeline of this manual. 3. Student evaluations must be considered when evaluating the faculty member's teaching, along with other factors. Student evaluations considered as part of performance evaluations, may not include numerical ratings, letter grades, or other \"scores\" of specific aspects of the course, the course as a whole, or of the instructor. 4. If the reviewers conclude that the faculty member's performance is not seriously deficient, the faculty member shall be so informed and a statement of the finding placed in the faculty member's personnel file. 5. If serious deficiency is found, a specific remedial program shall be developed in consultation with the faculty member that includes procedures, criteria for evaluating progress, and a reasonable timetable. If the faculty member's teaching needs improvement, such a program might include participation in programs offered by the Teaching Academy, mentoring by a recipient of teaching awards, intensive study of videotaped classroom sessions, etc. When research and publication needs improvement, collaboration with another faculty member and participation in workshops on publishing might be indicated. However, in accordance with NMSA 1978, Section 21-1-7.1, part E(1), any remedial effort can be no shorter than two years in length. PART 4: ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM (fka 5.87.4) Whether or not a tenured faculty member accepts the recommendation to participate in a teaching or scholarly work enhancement program, and whether or not the member performs well in the program, the faculty3/6 08/25/2020 9.36 - Faculty Post Tenure Reviewmember's performance will be judged on subsequent teaching and scholarly work. PART 5: FREQUENCY OF REVIEW (fka 5.87.5) The more complete review shall not be initiated for any tenured faculty member more frequently than once every five years. PART 6: PERSISTENT TEACHING DEFICIENCIES (fka 5.87.6) If a tenured faculty member's teaching deficiencies are considered by the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs to be very serious and to have been uncorrected at the conclusion of the agreed time period, and further, if there is evidence that the faculty member's teaching performance has deteriorated since the award of tenure such that the faculty member's teaching performance is now typically unsatisfactory, the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs shall recommend loss of tenure for the faculty member in question. If tenure is to be revoked, the university shall follow the processes specified in ARP 10.50 - Faculty Alleged Misconduct Investigation, Discipline andAppeals Processes for Involuntary Termination of a Continuous Contract, subject to the safeguards of due process. PART 7: REPORTING (fka 5.87.7) Every year, each academic dean and the chief community college executive officer of each campus shall report to the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs.

All recommendations for tenure must be accompanied by notification to the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs from the dean of the result of the faculty committee vote. When tenure is awarded, it is awarded in the unit that initiated the request for tenure (continuous contract). No temporary appointment can become continuous without the official action of the university administration. PART 2: CONTINUOUS CONTRACTS A continuous appointment is not a matter of right, but is made after the pre-tenure period has been completed successfully, providing the individual's services are needed. Such an appointment is made by the issuance of a new contract at the time of continuous appointment or shortly thereafter, and the contract becomes the abiding instrument governing employment, except that the terms may be modified from time to time by endorsement. Continuous contracts are issued by the Office of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs following receipt of an approved Contract Status Form. Continuous contracts are not reissued until there is a promotion in rank. Each spring an official contract amendment (salary letter) is issued by the president's office which informs the faculty member of final performance evaluation and annual salary for the ensuing year. Once a faculty member has been appointed to a1/2 08/25/2020 9.41 - Tenure Track Faculty - Procedure for Award of Continuous Contract upon Award of Tenurecontinuous contract, that faculty member will retain continuous contract status even though the faculty member accepts appointment at less than full time.

Any tenure track faculty member intending to resign shall give written notice to the administration at the earliest time possible, but in no case later than 30 days after receipt of written notification of the terms of the next year's contract, or three months prior to the start of the following academic year, whichever is later, except when mutually agreed upon by the individual and the administration. The faculty member should inform the department head in writing. The department head will inform the dean, who in turn will notify the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. The department head should then submit a terminating Personnel Action Form at the earliest possible date. B. If a faculty member dies, their estate will receive compensation for all unused annual leave accrued at the time of death, up to a maximum of 52 working days of leave. C. If a person listed by the promotion and tenure committee does not wish to be considered for promotion or tenure, the person must so indicate to the department head in writing. However, if the person is in the fifth year of tenure-track service, withdrawal from consideration for tenure must be accompanied by written notice of resignation effective at the end of the sixth year of service (this notice must be received by the department head before the end of the fifth year of service).

A. During the trial period, non-renewal of an annual contract may be without implication of criticism or specification of cause. B. The reason for non-renewal will be stated, if so requested by the faculty member subject to non-renewal. The reason is only to be communicated if requested by the faculty member. The choice of the manner of notification (verbally or in writing) is to be made by the faculty member. The faculty member must request the reason for non-renewal prior to the end of the faculty member's contract. C. Prior to non-renewal, the department head, or comparable administrator, must consult with the promotion and tenure committee of the department before any recommendation of non-renewal is forwarded to the dean.

In appreciation for the dedication and accomplishments of sta members, the Employee Recognition Program (ERP) is established to reward and recognize those who demonstrate the professionalism and behaviors consistent with the mission of NMSU and to celebrate achievements that have an exceptional impact on the organization. Departments, colleges and divisions are encourage to develop their own programs to complement established university -level* programs. This program is exclusive of merit/performance adjustments provided during the annual salary process. *Established University - Level Employee Recognition Programs : Patricia Christmore Faculty Teaching Award Fort Bliss Federal Credit Union Award Ralph B. Crouch Award Donald Roush Award Robert L. Westhafer Award Frank Bromilow Sta and Teaching Awards University Research Council Award Stephen W. and Robert E.

Programs will be designed to recognize exceptional accomplishments for faculty and sta subject to specic achievement within specied criteria directly attributable to faculty and sta members. 01/21/21 Employee Recognition2 / 4To ensure fairness and equity, all ERP's must include an application and/or nomination/ recommendation process, dened selection criteria and a process which includes the review and recommendation of a group or a committee. If a donor serves on the committee for which his/her donation is under consideration, the donor must be in the minority of the representation on the committee in order to avoid tax consequences. All employees must have an equal opportunity to compete for bonuses and awards based on the eligibility criteria of an approved program. The Oce of Human Resources will review and approve all departmental ERP's, with the exception of awards provided from donated funds. Because of the university's status as a public employer, tax issues and state regulations, rewards are dened as either a bonus or an award . Exceptions to the following guidelines must be approved by the Oce of the provost and senior vice president for academic aairs. PART 2: BONUS A bonus is dened as recognition for exceptional performance of duties and responsibilities above and beyond the normal scope of an employee's assigned duties and responsibilities. A bonus is a one-time payment that is paid from instruction and general (I&G) funds, state appropriations and/or any appropriate restricted or unrestricted funding source. The following guidelines apply to departmental bonus programs : A. A minimum of $100.00 (net) up to a maximum of $500.00 (net) may be provided for any individual payment. B. More than one recipient per department and/or division may receive a bonus depending upon the availability of funding and eligibility. C. Bonuses paid from restricted/unrestricted funds must comply with the granting agency guidelines. D. Applicable taxes will be deducted from the gross amount. E. Bonuses will be processed using a One Time Payment Request. PART 3: AWARD An award is recognition of an exceptional achievement, work ethic and/or service which signicantly contributes to an organizational unit.

These policies and procedures are designed to provide an objective consideration of employee grievances. Employees are provided peer group representation on review boards and committees in order to ensure fair and impartial hearings of their complaints. Within each appeal procedure, notice is given as to who makes the final decision. These decisions are final and cannot be further appealed within the university structure. The Board of Regents will periodically review these policies but will not hear individual grievances. The appeals procedures are designed to resolve grievances at the lowest level possible. Prior to formal appeal, all parties should exhaust every opportunity to settle the grievance through administrative review at the department or college level.

PART 2: SCOPE This rule applies when serious misconduct, or inability to perform essential functions of the job, is reasonably suspected of any tenured, tenure track, or regular, non-tenure track faculty within the NMSU System. A. This rule does not apply to situations involving unsatisfactory job performance covered by other policies regarding the quality of teaching/advising, research/scholarship or outreach/ extension or service. (See rules governing Faculty Performance Evaluation, Promotion and Tenure and Post-tenure Review) B. This rule does not apply to situations involving the voluntary or involuntary retreat to a faculty position from an appointment as academic administrator , because such appointments are within the discretion of an executive administrator. C. This rule does not apply to situations involving non-renewal of the annual faculty contract. PART 3: RULE ADMINISTRATOR 10/18/2021 10.50 - Faculty Alleged Misconduct Investigation, Discipline, and Appeals Processes 2 / 1 7The Office of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, jointly with the Office of Human Resource Services, administers these rules and procedures. PART 4: DEFINITIONS AND ROLES A. \"Clear and Convincing Evidence\": Clear and convincing evidence means evidence that makes the fact to be proven highly probable or reasonably certain. To prove a fact by clear and convincing evidence is evidence stronger than a \"preponderance\" and yet less than \"beyond a reasonable doubt;\" for evidence to be clear and convincing, it must instantly tilt the scales in the affirmative when weighed against the evidence in opposition and the fact finder's mind is left with an abiding conviction that the evidence is true. (See Also Part 11 subsection C.) B. \"Day\": When a time limit refers to \"day\", it refers to business rather than calendar days (Monday through Friday), and excludes official university holidays. C. \"Dean\": When the rule refers to dean, it will include the equivalent ranks to dean, for academic units other than a college or library. It also will mean the designee serving in lieu of the dean, who may be designated by the Faculty Senate chair and assistant vice president for human resources, in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, due to a conflict of interest on the part of the dean or dean equivalent. The dean serves as the informal pre-determination hearing officer. (See Part 12, below). 10/18/2021 10.50 - Faculty Alleged Misconduct Investigation, Discipline, and Appeals Processes 3 / 1 7D. \"Investigative Administrator\": When the rule refers to the \"investigative administrator\", it refers to the individual who performs or coordinates the confidential investigation into the allegations against the faculty member , including issuance of the investigative report. (See Part 8 below). The investigative administrator also consults with the Office of Human Resource Services and/or Office of General Counsel regarding the appropriate level of corrective action warranted, if any; prepares the notice of proposed corrective action; and presents the matter to the pre-determination of ficer (the dean). (See Parts 8-11 below.) The investigative administrator will usually be the immediate supervisor, or academic department head. It may also mean someone designated to serve in lieu of the immediate supervisor , in the event of a conflict of interest. (i.e. if the investigative administrator is implicated in the alleged misconduct.) In cases involving alleged discrimination in violation of federal or state law or university policy , rules or procedures, it means a representative from the Office of Institutional Equity. In cases involving alleged embezzlement or other white collar type criminal activity, the investigation may be conducted by law enforcement, the Office of Internal Audit or other expert in the field. In these instances, the investigative administrator will coordinate with the involved supervisor , and HRS in order to determine the facts and the appropriate corrective or disciplinary action. E. \"Preponderance of the Evidence\" : Preponderance of the evidence means the greater weight of the evidence. To prove a fact by the greater weight of the evidence means one must be persuaded that what is sought to be proved is more probably true than not true. Evenly balanced evidence is not sufficient. (See Also Part 11 subsection C.) PART 5: OVERVIEW OF RULE This section lists generally the steps which shall guide faculty and administration in the rare instance that serious misconduct, or inability to perform essential job functions, is reasonably suspected of a faculty member. More detail regarding each process is provided throughout this rule. A. Administrative Leave . [ no time frame indicated and will vary] (See Part 7) B. Internal Investigation .

PART 6: ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION At any stage in the processes described herein, if mutually agreed to between the parties, the disputed matter may be stayed as the parties attempt to resolve the dispute through an alternate method of dispute resolution, including but not limited to the following methods: mediation, settlement facilitation, or other negotiated resolution outside of the formal hearing processes provided for herein. PART 7: ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE When a faculty member is reasonably suspected or otherwise accused of serious misconduct constituting just cause under this rule, the faculty member may be placed on paid administrative leave pending a confidential investigation, in accordance with the following protocol: A. These decisions will be made on a case by case basis by the department head or equivalent supervisor, in conjunction with the Office of Human Resource Services, and based upon the facts alleged in each matter , including the potential risk of harm to students, others or the institution. 10/18/2021 10.50 - Faculty Alleged Misconduct Investigation, Discipline, and Appeals Processes 5 / 1 7B. Approval from the assistant vice president of human resource services or designee is required to place any faculty member on paid administrative leave or to relocate, or to reassign job duties, pending the investigation. The dean will be notified about the pendency of the internal investigation, but not about the factual details. C.

A. The investigative administrator shall consult with the assistant vice president of human resources or designee and/or the university general counsel for guidance and support relating to the performance of the internal investigation. B. The faculty member accused shall be provided notice of the charges at the appropriate time during the investigation, which may be when the investigation begins, or may be later, depending upon the nature of the allegations. The faculty member shall be given an opportunity to respond to the charges during the investigation process. C. The investigation shall be documented with factual findings and supporting evidence. The evidence may consist of witness statements or summaries, documents, audio or video recordings or photographs, or other exhibits. The investigative report, including supporting documentation or other evidence, shall be delivered to the assistant vice president of human resource services. The investigative administrator shall retain the investigative work papers, investigative report and supporting documentation or other evidence in a confidential and secure location. 10/18/2021 10.50 - Faculty Alleged Misconduct Investigation, Discipline, and Appeals Processes 6 / 1 7D. The investigative administrator shall confer with the assistant vice president for human resource services and/or the office of university general counsel to decide whether or not the findings warrant corrective administrative action. E. As soon as practicable, the charged faculty member shall be informed generally regarding the results of the investigation. F. If the faculty member is exonerated by the investigation, then no documentation referencing the investigation shall remain in the of ficial personnel file, unless requested by the faculty member. G. If corrective action is going to be pursued, the faculty member will be provided a copy of the investigative report and access to the supporting documents at the time that the corrective action is formally proposed. H. In order to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good faith, report reasonably suspected misconduct, the university prohibits retaliation in any form to be taken against the reporter or any person who cooperates in the investigative process. A complaint of suspected retaliation will also be cause for the initiation of a separate internal investigation to be conducted in coordination with the Office of Human Resource Services, and if substantiated, will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. I. If the investigative report reflects that the alleged misconduct was not substantiated, the university will make efforts to restore the reputation of the faculty member, to the extent feasible and desired by the faculty member. Additionally, and depending upon the circumstances, the university may initiate a separate internal investigation in the event the investigative report indicates that the initial report of suspected misconduct or any testimony given as part of the internal investigation may have been intentionally falsified. If deliberate falsification of such a complaint or testimony is substantiated, it will be grounds for disciplinary action against the false reporter, up to and including termination of employment. PART 9: JUST CAUSE REQUIRED Just Cause, capable of being proven by the standard of proof set forth at Part 1 1 subsection C, is required before suspension without pay, reduction in salary, or involuntary dismissal may be imposed. Just cause includes dishonest behavior; gross or habitual neglect of professional responsibilities; willful violation of NMSU policy, rule or procedures; use of any improper influence to secure a promotion or privileges for individual advantage; or any other serious misconduct causing or creating the potential for harm to person, property or the institution. Just Cause 10/18/2021 10.50 - Faculty Alleged Misconduct Investigation, Discipline, and Appeals Processes 7 / 1 7may also be unrelated to any misconduct on the part of faculty, and could include a loss of licensure and/or clinical admitting privileges required for the performance of one's academic duties; or the medical inability to perform essential functions of the job. PART 10: ADMINISTRATIVE OR CORRECTIVE ACTION Corrective or other administrative action may be taken for serious misconduct or inability to perform the essential functions of one's job, if substantiated by the applicable standard of proof through the investigative fact finding process. A. The types of administrative action anticipated by this rule include one or more of the following : written warning, mandatory attendance at training, suspension without pay, reduction in salary, and involuntary dismissal. B. The range of corrective action which may be imposed for misconduct is not intended to require progressive discipline; rather, it is intended to allow the severity of the corrective action to match the seriousness of the policy , rule or procedural violation or other misconduct. The corrective action, if any , to be imposed will vary depending upon the severity of the misconduct substantiated by the investigative findings. C. The investigative administrator and the assistant vice president of human resource services shall coordinate regarding the appropriate level of corrective action or other administrative action, and if it does not warrant suspension without pay, reduction in pay, or involuntary dismissal, shall decide whether other corrective or administrative action is appropriate. D. If suspension without pay, reduction in salary or involuntary dismissal is supported by the investigative report and recommended by the investigative administrator, the due process hearing requirements outlined in the remainder of this rule shall apply. See Also Appendix ARP 10.50-A. PART 11: GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF DUE PROCESS A recommendation to dismiss from employment or to reduce salary attributable to regular faculty employment are serious corrective actions implicating one' s property rights, which is why just cause and due process are required before such action may be taken. 10/18/2021 10.50 - Faculty Alleged Misconduct Investigation, Discipline, and Appeals Processes 8 / 1 7A. Due process requires fair and timely hearing processes, before an impartial hearing official or body. The faculty member charged with misconduct and facing serious disciplinary action is entitled to a predetermination hearing, at which the relevant facts are presented by the parties, and determined by a hearing officer to be accurate prior to proceeding with the proposed corrective action. This ensures that the faculty member has had an adequate opportunity to present a defense to the claims and the evidence; it also ensures that the decision makers have an accurate understanding of the facts underlying the recommendation. B. The faculty member also has the right to a post-determination appeal to the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, as well as the right to request a final review by the Chancellor. C. At the pre-determination hearing and any subsequent appeal, the burden of proving just cause by the applicable standard of proof is on NMSU. The standard of proof shall be clear and convincing evidence for all infractions, except for disciplinary action proposed for discrimination proscribed by federal and state law, which matters are investigated by the university's Office of Institutional Equity; the burden of proof when discrimination constitutes the grounds for which the disciplinary action is being taken shall be preponderance of the evidence. (See Part 4 subsections D and E) PART 12: TIME DEADLINES AND EXTENSIONS The pre-determination, appeal and final review processes will be conducted as expeditiously as possible. A. At the request from a party, a one-time extension of the time deadline may be granted, after notice to the other party and consideration of that party' s position relative to the request. B. If the request for the time extension is from a hearing Faculty Appeals Board member, the chair of Faculty Senate may grant a reasonable extension, with notice to all parties. C. A second or subsequent request for time extension from any party or from a Faculty Appeals Board member will only be granted in exceptional cases, after consideration of the basis for the request and the respective positions of the parties. The Faculty Appeals Board or Faculty Senate chair may deny a request for extension, in the best interest of the institution, even if no party opposes it. 10/18/2021 10.50 - Faculty Alleged Misconduct Investigation, Discipline, and Appeals Processes 9 / 1 7PART 13: PRE-DETERMINATION PROCESS [25 days or less from date of issuance of notice letter or memo, unless time extension granted] A.

If the grievance otherwise states a viable grievance but is not in the requisite format, the FGRB may provide the Grievant an additional two weeks to re-submit it before it will be processed for hearing.6/21 08/25/2020 10.60 - Review of Faculty GrievancesH. Formal Grievance Hearings : When the FGRB has accepted a grievance, the FGRB Co-Chairs will designate three FGRB members (2 faculty, 1 department head) to convene as a Hearing Panel to conduct a fact finding hearing. The Hearing Panel members will be selected to provide appropriate peer representation, in terms of faculty status and familiarity with the type of work performed, to the extent possible based on scheduling availability and subject to the constraints of Part 9. D. 3. The Hearing Panel will issue findings of fact supported by a preponderance of evidence. (See Part 12) I. Periodic Policy Review : The FGRB will recommend revisions to this rule as necessary for the efficient processing and consideration of Faculty grievances. J. Attendance at Hearing : The FGRB is authorized to issue formal notices to named witnesses who are NMSU employees or retirees, requesting their appearance before the Hearing Panel. If such formal request is not honored, the FGRB will seek assistance from executive administration and the AVP Human Resource Services. Additionally, in the event there are insufficient number of FGRB members available to convene a Hearing Panel, academic administration will assist. ( See Part 9. A. below ) PART 5: ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE FGRB The Faculty Senate Chair, or their designee, and the Assistant Vice President of Human Resource Services will coordinate to provide the FGRB with the necessary clerical, administrative, and technical support it requires, which will include guidance relating to applicable time deadlines and other procedural issues that may arise. PART 6: PARTIES' RIGHT TO FACULTY CONSULTANT Either Party may enlist the aid of a Faculty Consultant whose role will be to provide guidance directly to the Party. The role of Faculty Consultant does not include actively advocating on behalf of the Party in official communications or at the formal hearing. It is the responsibility of the Party7/21 08/25/2020 10.60 - Review of Faculty Grievancesto keep the Faculty Consultant informed. If a Party requests assistance in obtaining a Faculty Consultant, the Faculty Senate Chair or their designee will appoint a senior faculty member to serve in that capacity. PART 7: PROCEDURES TO INITIATE GRIEVANCE A. Timing : Failing resolution through alternative dispute resolution, the Faculty member submits a written grievance within thirty (30) Days from the date of the action or inaction giving rise to the grievance. The thirty (30) Day deadline may be waived by the FGRB in cases alleging a \"continuing violation\" where the most recent incident alleged occurred within the thirty (30) Day period, or where ongoing and genuine efforts during the pre-grievance stage caused a delay in filing, or other good faith extenuating circumstance. B. Grievance Format : 1. The grievance will be in memo format, with the subject line indicating that it is a Faculty grievance and the Respondent(s) named therein (e.g. \"SUBJECT: Faculty grievance versus Respondents ABC and GHI\"). 8/21 08/25/2020 10.60 - Review of Faculty Grievances2. The grievance memo, limited to 5 pages excluding attachments, will: a.

Notice : If after preliminary review, the FGRB accepts the grievance for hearing, the Grievant will electronically send a copy of the grievance to: 1. The named Respondent(s); 2. Grievant's and Respondent's supervisors. PART 8: PRELIMINARY REVIEW BY THE FGRB A. Review by Quorum : Within ten (10) Days of receipt of the grievance, at least a quorum of the FGRB will convene to review the grievance and determine whether or not the Grievant has standing ( See Part 2. B. above), has filed timely (See Part 7 A. above) regarding an issue that may be grieved under this rule. (See Section Part 8 B. 2. below ) B. Decision to Accept or Decline Grievance : The FGRB will vote to either accept the grievance for formal hearing or to decline to hear the matter.

Grievances filed past the time limit, unless authorized by a waiver of the time deadline. C. Notice of Acceptance/Declination to Parties: If the grievance is declined in accordance with the above, the FGRB Co-Chair(s) will issue official correspondence to the Parties on behalf of the FGRB expressing the basis/es for the decision of the majority of the FGRB. Absent a time extension, a decision that the grievance has been declined should be sent within five (5) Days from the date the FGRB met and made its decision. PART 9: RULES PERTAINING TO GRIEVANCES 11/21 08/25/2020 10.60 - Review of Faculty GrievancesA. Time Deadlines : Faculty grievances should be processed as expeditiously as possible. 1. Requests for extensions of time may submitted in writing by any Party or FGRB official involved in the grievance process. Such requests must justify the request, copy the Parties and be addressed to the FGRB. The FGRB will grant reasonable requests for extension and notify the Parties about the new deadline. 2. If the personnel necessary for the hearing are not mutually available on the dates and times proposed for the hearing, the Co-Chair(s) may seek the assistance of the provost or the AVP of Human Resources to resolve scheduling conflicts, or time deadlines may be extended, with notice to the Parties. B. Communications : Neither party nor their Faculty Consultant may communicate in any form (e.g. verbal, written, email, text, social media) with the FGRB officials about the merits of the grievance. They may seek procedural guidance from the FGRB Co-Chair(s) or Hearing Panel Chair as needed, who will document the communications for the record. Substantive communications which inadvertently happen will be documented via memo for the record and shared with the relevant FGRB officials or Parties as appropriate. Under no circumstances will the involved Parties, witnesses or representatives or Faculty Consultants communicate with the provost or other designated final decision maker about the grievance. C. Confidentiality : Grievances relate to sensitive personnel issues and all NMSU employees and students who acquire knowledge or information relating to a grievance are asked to maintain confidentiality. The outcome of terms of any negotiated mutual agreement resolving a grievance will be only be divulged to personnel with a \"need to know\" and whose assistance is required in implementing the terms of the agreement. 12/21 08/25/2020 10.60 - Review of Faculty GrievancesD. Elimination of Potential Bias : The FGRB Co-Chair(s) and the Hearing Panel members assigned to the grievance must be able to serve impartially and fairly. The following guidelines are provided to assist the FGRB and the Parties to work through claims of alleged bias or conflict of interest, ideally in the pre-hearing stage. 1. Any FGRB member selected to serve as a member of the Hearing Panel must disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest immediately, or as soon as it is realized, in order that it may be resolved prior to convening the hearing. 2. A Party, including their representative or Faculty Consultant, must also disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest as soon as it is realized so it may be resolved prior to convening the hearing. 3. Under no circumstances will a FGRB Hearing Panel member participate in a hearing convened to hear a grievance involving a Party with whom the member has a familial, personal, or close professional relationship. A FGRB member will not hear a matter involving Faculty from their own academic department. 4. If one or more of the witnesses has a close relationship with one of the Hearing Panel members, disqualification of the Hearing Panel member from service will not be automatic; either the member will recuse voluntarily or the FGRB Co- Chairs will issue a decision in writing, based upon the specific facts of each case. 5. If the Grievant, Respondent, or a witness has had prior contact with a Hearing Panel member, disqualification from service will not be automatic; either the member will recuse voluntarily or a the FGRB Co-Chair(s) will issue a decision in writing, based upon the specific facts of each case. 6. After consideration of the relevant facts and positions of the Parties, if it is determined that a conflict exists sufficient to call into question the impartiality of the FGRB member, the resolution will be either voluntary recusal by the individual alleged to have the conflict or by substitution of a different individual by the appropriate FGRB Co- Chair. 13/21 08/25/2020 10.60 - Review of Faculty GrievancesE. Preservation of Grievance Record : 1. At the conclusion of the hearing, the FGRB members involved with the grievance will forward official correspondence pertaining to the grievance to the appropriate FGRB Co-Chair. 2. The Hearing Panel Chair, with the assistance from the Human Resource Office, Employee and Labor Relations (Employee and Labor Relations) will transmit the formal hearing record to the appropriate FGRB Co-Chair, who will compile the complete Grievance Record and forward to the office of the final decision maker. 3. The final decision maker will ensure that Employee and Labor Relations receives the complete Grievance Record for storage and maintenance in accordance with the university's records retention policies, once the final decision has been issued to the Parties. 4. The Grievance Record will not be filed in the official personnel file. The Grievance Record will be stored in a grievance file with the Office of Employee and Labor Relations. 5. On occasion, it may be appropriate to file or to cross-reference a grievance decision in the official personnel file (e.g. to justify a mandated change in salary). 6. If the Grievant prevails on an issue affecting a document contained in the official personnel file, that document will be revised and the original document will be moved to the grievance file, to document compliance with the decision on the grievance. 7. Copies of the document reflecting the final administrative action to be taken as a result of a grievance, such as resolution outside of the hearing process (e.g. alternative dispute resolution) or a final decision after formal hearing, will be stored permanently in the provost's office. 14/21 08/25/2020 10.60 - Review of Faculty GrievancesF. Prohibited Retaliation : 1. Retaliation against any person who files a formal grievance, whether accepted or not by the FGRB, or against any person involved in the grievance resolution process (e.g. witnesses, administrators) is strictly prohibited. 2. Any claims of retaliation must be reported immediately to the Assistant Vice President of Human Resource Services. 3. Allegations of retaliation for utilizing this rule or for cooperating with the administration of this rule will be taken seriously, investigated independently from the grievance; and if substantiated, will be grounds for employee discipline up to and including involuntary termination. G. Requests to Stay Grievance Proceedings : With the concurrence of the Assistant Vice President for Human Resource Services and University General Counsel, a grievance may be stayed by the appropriate FGRB Co-Chair when the Grievant is also seeking relief based upon the same set of facts in another forum, or agrees to explore alternative dispute resolution outside the scope of this rule. The matter may be later reopened or dismissed as appropriate for the circumstances. Any person affiliated with the university may submit a written request to a FGRB Co- Chair that a particular grievance be stayed. PART 10: PRE-HEARING PROTOCOLS The Co-Chairs, as determined between the Co-Chairs, will be responsible to coordinate the following pre-hearing tasks in coordination with the designated Hearing Panel Chair: A. Designation of Hearing Panel and Chair : The Hearing Panel will be appointed within ten (10) Days from the FGRB's decision to accept the grievance. The Co-Chairs will designate the Hearing Panel Chair at the time the Hearing Panel is appointed. B. Identification and Resolution of Potential COI's : The Co-Chair(s) will inform the Parties in writing of the identity of the members of the Hearing Panel, with instructions to respond in writing whether or not there is any issue involved a perceived or actual conflict of interest, so it may be addressed in the pre-hearing stage.15/21 08/25/2020 10.60 - Review of Faculty GrievancesC. Coordinate a Date/Time/Location for the Hearing and Send Notice of Hearing : In coordination with the Hearing Panel members, with Employee and Labor Relations (provides technical and administrative support such as administering the oath to the witnesses, recording the hearing and organizing the hearing documents for the Grievance Record etc) and with the Parties, the Co-Chair(s) will set a date, time and location for the grievance hearing. See Part 9 A. 2. above in the event of scheduling conflicts. The Co-Chair(s) will send Notice of Hearing to the Parties, to the director of Employee and Labor Relations, and to each Hearing Panel member of the date, time and location for the hearing. The notice may also enclose instructions and guidance for the Parties, describing how the hearing will be conducted. See Section D. below. D. Submission of Documentation and Witness Lists : The Co-Chair(s) will direct the Parties to submit via email, on the same date, the documentation they wish the Hearing Panel to consider, including a list of witnesses they intend to call, if any. The documentation must be sent to the appropriate Co-Chair and to each Party. Documents attached to a Party's position paper should be labelled and numbered as that Party's Exhibits (e.g. Grievant's Exhibit 1; Respondent's Exhibit A) Each Party should also be directed to bring a minimum of three copies of the documentation to the hearing (one for the Grievance Record, one for each named Respondent, and one for them self). E. Facilitation of Witness Testimony : If a Party indicates that one of their witnesses will not cooperate or is otherwise unavailable for the hearing, and the witness is an NMSU employee or retiree, the Co- Chair(s) on behalf of the Hearing Panel will coordinate with director of Employee and Labor Relations or executive administration to facilitate their participation. Witnesses may be permitted to participate via telephone or other electronic means, as long as the Hearing Panel and all Parties are able to hear the witness and the witness is able to hear them. Additionally, a hearing may be continued and re-convened as necessary to facilitate accepting the testimony of a witness who is not available at the designated hearing date and time, provided all Parties are in attendance to hear the testimony and to ask questions of the witness. PART 11: HEARING PROCEDURES16/21 08/25/2020 10.60 - Review of Faculty GrievancesA. Participation : Each Hearing Panel member appointed must attend and participate. Also present at the hearing will be all Parties, witnesses, and Faculty Consultants. A representative designated by Employee and Labor Relations will serve as notary to swear in witnesses and to record the hearing. Upon request from the Hearing Panel or Co-Chair(s), representatives from Employee and Labor Relations and University General Counsel office will be made available for telephonic or in person consultation. B. Hearing Record : An audio recording of the hearing, excluding the Hearing Panel's deliberations, must be made and preserved for the Grievance Record, in accordance with the university's records retention schedule, and any litigation preservation notice. The Parties are entitled to a copy of the recording upon written request, after the final written decision has been rendered. C.

D. Role of Legal Counsel : No person attending the hearing may be represented by legal counsel at the hearing. E. Closed Hearing : The hearing will be closed to the public. F. Time Allocated for Hearing : 1. The time scheduled for attendance by the Hearing Panel members will exceed the time scheduled for the hearing, to allow time following the conclusion of the hearing for the Hearing Panel members to deliberate. ( See Section K. below ) 2. The time allotted for the hearing must be sufficient for the Parties to fully present the grievance and position in response to the grievance. 3. The Hearing Panel Chair may impose reasonable time limits relating to witness testimony, in an effort to keep to the hearing timeframe decided upon following the pre-hearing process, for equity and to keep the hearing moving. If something unexpected happens and it becomes clear the time allotted is insufficient, the matter may be continued to a date and time agreed to by the Parties before adjourning.17/21 08/25/2020 10.60 - Review of Faculty GrievancesG. Conduct of Hearing : The Hearing Panel Chair will conduct the hearing fairly and impartially, consistent with this rule. The Hearing Panel Chair communicates for the panel, which may necessitate discussion outside the presence of the Parties and a vote of the panel members, if matters are in debate. The Hearing Panel Chair must maintain control of the proceeding, including evidentiary and procedural issues. For procedural issues raised by the Parties, the Hearing Panel Chair may ask the Parties to step out while the panel deliberates and decides; when the Parties return, the Hearing Panel Chair will announce the panel's decision on the record. H. Witnesses : Each Party may call witnesses. Witnesses may only be in the hearing while giving testimony. This does not apply to the Parties who must remain present, but also provide testimony. I.

The panel may elect to consult with a representative from the Office of University General Counsel or the Office of Employee and Labor Relations relating to its legal obligations or to procedure; these representatives will not provide advice on the merits of the claim. The members of the Hearing Panel may also meet after the hearing date to continue deliberations, or to confer about and finalize the findings and separate administrative recommendations, if any. PART 12: FINDINGS OF FACT SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE & RECOMMENDATIONS18/21 08/25/2020 10.60 - Review of Faculty GrievancesA. Timing : Absent notification to the Parties and the appropriate FGRB Co- Chair justifying a time extension, the Hearing Panel Chair will submit a report of the findings of fact, supported by a preponderance of the evidence, to the final decision maker (typically the provost) within fifteen (15) Days from the closure of the hearing or date of deliberations by the Hearing Panel, whichever is later. B. Preponderance of Evidence and Majority Opinion : Each finding of fact must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence and constitute the view of a majority of the Hearing Panel. A Hearing Panel member who does not agree with the majority may issue a memo explaining their viewpoint, and must include reference to the evidence they believe supports a different finding or recommended conclusion. C. Administrative Recommendations Optional : Separate from the factual findings, the Hearing Panel may, but is not required to, issue recommended conclusions or other administrative recommendations relating to or arising from the grievance.

New Mexico State University recognizes research as essential to the vitality of the university and undertakes the support of research as part of its institutional responsibility . The mission statement expresses the importance of research as one of the university's core functions: New Mexico State University is the state's land-grant university, serving the educational needs of New Mexico's diverse population through comprehensive programs of education, research, extension education, and public service . The university promotes academic inquiry and protects the academic freedom of those engaged in it. This includes the support of research and of f-campus study as potentially valuable experiences for faculty and students. These experiences may take the form of sabbaticals, internships, intensive study of specialized techniques, and conducting research at specialized facilities. These opportunities offer researchers considerable flexibility in their training and promote valuable contacts among faculty members, students, the university, industry and other research institutions. PART 2: PROTECTIONS IN RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS It is the policy of the university to protect the rights, wellbeing, and personal privacy of individuals participating in research projects, while also maintaining a favorable climate for the conduct of scientific inquiry and protecting the interests of the university. The university has established the Institutional Review Board to regulate the participation of human subjects in research, consistent with federal 12/02/2021 11.00 - Research Guiding Principles2 / 4law. (See ARP 11.01 Part 4) All research conducted at or by the university, regardless of funding source, will adhere to the requirements of the Institutional Review Board and the following tenets: A. Protection of Human Subjects Paramount : The university, including its faculty, staff, contractors and student body will be responsible for the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects. B. Avoidance of Unreasonable Health Risk : No human subject involved in a research activity will be exposed to unreasonable risk to health or well-being, in order to ensure the subject's physical and mental safety and well-being. C. Participation is Voluntary : All participation by human subjects must be voluntary; no subject will be coerced in any way to participate in a research project. A request by any subject to withdraw from a research activity must be honored promptly without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, within the limits of the research. D. Confidentiality : The confidentiality of information received from subjects in experiments or respondents to questionnaires will be protected, both during and after the conduct of a research activity, consistent with applicable law. E. Signed Consent from Participant : In research which involves more than minimal risk, or which involves substantial stress or discomfort, such risk, stress or discomfort must be carefully explained in advance to the subject. The researcher(s) must be satisfied that the explanation has been understood by the subject, and that the written consent of the subject, is obtained and kept as a matter of record. The researcher(s) will ensure that the method used to obtain informed consent (written, audio-recorded, witnessed) is the most appropriate for the participant, and for providing appropriate evidence of informed consent consistent with the approval granted by the Institutional Review Board and with applicable federal law . F. Signed Consent from Legal Guardian : Research involving certain subject populations (e.g., persons under the age of 18 or persons with impaired decision making capacity) will require a legal guardian to provide signed consent. PART 3: PROTECTIONS IN RESEARCH INVOLVING THE USE OF ANIMALS 12/02/2021 11.00 - Research Guiding Principles3 / 4As a land grant institution, it is the university's role to conduct, if not lead, research designed to optimize the use of animals in the service of man, and to advance human and animal welfare. Consistent with applicable law and regulations, the university supports the use of animals in research, education, and as agricultural resources, provided that the usage is reasonably expected to advance knowledge about human or animal welfare. It is the university's policy to meet all federal and state standards and regulations applicable to animal use. The university has established the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee to administer policies and procedures regarding university care and use of vertebrate animals. (See ARP 11.01 Research Oversight and Risk Management Part 5) Any concerns regarding the use or care of animals by the institution should be addressed to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. PART 4: PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION Research units, including but not limited to the Physical Science Laboratory , receive many sponsored awards in which information provided by the sponsor or generated by or in connection with the research effort may be considered sensitive: classified, controlled unclassified, and/or proprietary . Units keeping or using sensitive information should adopt appropriate procedures for its protection and train faculty, staff, and students whose positions require access to such information. All employees must comply with applicable laws, university policy , rules and procedures, and contractual agreements regarding non-disclosure of sensitive information. (e.g. ARP 5.40- Access to Student Educational Records - FERPA Compliance; ARP 15.11 - Acceptable Use of ICT Equipment and Resources; ARP 15.17 - Employee Access to Data and Potential Conflict of Interest; ARP 15.50 - NMSU Institutional Data Security; ARP 15.51 - NMSU Account Password Requirements; ARP 15.55 - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards; 15.60 - Management of Health Information ; HIPAA Compliance; 15.62 Protection of Federal - Identity Theft Protection; NMSU Business Ethics Handbook, and the Physical Science Laboratory's Code of Ethics and Standards of Business Conduct , p. 9.) 12/02/2021 11.00 - Research Guiding Principles4 / 4Details Scope: NMSU System Source: ARP Chapter 11 | Research and Intellectual Property Rule Administrator: VP Research Last Updated: 03/13/2019 Related Cross-Reference: ARP 11.01 - Research Oversight and Risk Management ARP 15.62 - Protection of Federal Information; FISMA Compliance Revision History: 03/13/2019 Amendment approved by Chancellor 2017 Recompilation, formerly Rule 5.94 03/14/2011 Amendments approved by Board of Regents 10/10/2011 Amendment approved by Board of Regents 12/02/2021 11.00 - Research Guiding Principles11.01 - Research Oversight and Risk Management arp.nmsu.edu /11-01 PART 1: RESEARCH FUNDING AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES A.State University Research Fund : The State University Research Fund is the designated university fund where indirect (facilities and administrative) cost recovery earned by the university is deposited. Funds to support academic research from the State University Research Fund are relatively scarce and must be used in a variety of ways (e.g., to support research, to stimulate new research, to support public service, and to support scholarly endeavors as well as the necessary administration). In general, it is desirable to keep the administrative costs at a minimum and, therefore, make available to the faculty as much support as possible for nonrecurring research expenses. It is the underlying philosophy to use this research support in a flexible manner in keeping with college and department priorities. Encouragement is given to the faculty to secure outside support for research, at the same time recognizing that it is important to provide some support to scholarly pursuits which may not attract outside funding. 1/25 08/25/2020 11.01 - Research Oversight and Risk ManagementB. University Research Institutes : 1. University Research Institutes are units that primarily perform externally funded research. They are formed by the vice president for research in consultation with the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. Generally, these units will report to the vice president for research; at the time of creating the institute, the reporting line for the unit must be determined by the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs and the vice president for research 2. University Research Institutes may be created by the university in anticipation of outside funding. They revert to college status or cease to exist if external funding does not materialize. A University Research Institute may receive some support from the State University Research Fund. Except for the Physical Science Laboratory and the Water Resources Research Institute, University Research Institutes do not directly retain a percentage of indirect cost recovery resulting from their activity. 3. Upon the recommendation of the vice president for research with concurrence of the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, a University Research Institute may revert to College Research Institute status, be reorganized, or be dissolved, and the following list modified accordingly.

The process for electing title includes completion of the requisite documentation by all parties formally allocating the IP rights between the Inventor and NMSU. G. Expenses: The funds expended or encumbered by NMSU or by its Assignee for the evaluation, protection and management of the IP, including but not limited to: NMSU administrative fees, legal fees, and marketing costs. Expenses do not include costs incurred to develop the invention. H. Individual IP: Intellectual Property in which the university has no ownership interest. Examples of Individual IP include: IP conceived and developed outside the course and scope of employment, without university resources and without corporate, federal or other sponsorship. Individual IP may also include instructional material, scholarly or artistic work created by academic personnel within the course and scope of their employment, if no more than Limited Permitted Use of NMSU resources are used in its development. (See Part 6, Section A.) Individual IP also includes University IP which the university has released from any claim of ownership. (See Part 6, Sections B. 2. and C. 5.)2/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and CommercializationI. Intellectual Property (IP): Potential patentable and copyrightable materials, Trademarks, Trade Secrets, and Software whether or not formal protection is sought. IP includes, and is not limited to, books, articles, plays, films, audio and video works, written lectures, works of art, musical compositions, laboratory manuals, demonstration devices, computer programs, apps, inventions, devices, methods, tangible properties and materials, chemical compounds, new materials or processes, instruments, and rights covering these items, such as Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks. J. Invention: All original, novel useful processes, machines, compositions, and other scholarly and artistic creations. Invention also encompasses the application of new solutions to meet unexpected or new requirements, unarticulated needs, or actual market demands, which result in more effective products, processes, services, technologies or business models and are thus more readily available to markets, governments and society. K. Invention Disclosure Form (IDF): A written notice of Invention to the IP Office. An IDF confidentially discloses the Inventor's Invention, whether or not work for hire, so that options for protection and commercialization can be evaluated and pursued. L. Inventor: The faculty member, student, employee, staff member, or other university personnel who develops an Invention. IP may have more than one Inventor; \"Inventor\" referred to in the singular throughout this rule also refers to multiple Inventors of one Invention, collectively. M. Know-How : Expert skill, information, or body of knowledge that imparts an ability to cause a desired result, is not readily available, and is confidentially held. Know-How may include tangible material (such as blueprints, formulas, instructions, patterns, specifications and Trade Secrets) or intangibles (such as manufacturing practices, marketing concepts, quality control and testing techniques) which are not common knowledge. N. Limited Permitted Use: The use of NMSU resources permitted in connection with the production of instructional materials, scholarly or artistic work, which is limited to the reasonable use of an employee's regularly assigned office or studio space; telephone, computer, printer or similar items used in the normal course of business. O. Net Earnings: For purposes of calculating the amount to be distributed, is the amount of Earnings remaining after the repayment of all Expenses.3/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and CommercializationP.

Q. Patentable Materials: Includes the following: a process, a machine, a manufacture, or a composition of matter (such as new chemical), a method, operation or series of actions intended to achieve some end or result; a device or apparatus, a thing that is made or built by a human being (or by a machine); a patentable compound of material composed of two or more different substances. Items other than Software which reasonably appear to qualify for protection under the patent laws of the United States (see 35 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) or other protective statutes, including Novel Plant Varieties and Patentable Plants, whether or not patentable thereunder. R. Sponsoring Agency: An external public or private entity responsible for funding the research and development or other efforts associated with Copyrightable or Patentable Materials. S. Trademark: Includes all Trademarks, service marks, trade names, seals, symbols, designs, slogans, or logotypes developed by or associated with any NMSU entity. (See 17 U.S.C. 1127) A Trademark is a distinctive symbol, logo, picture, sound or word used to distinguish and identify the origin or description of products. A Trademark may also include distinctive and unique packaging, color combinations, building designs, product styles and overall presentations. A Trademark provides the owner with the exclusive right to use it on the product it was intended to identify and often on related products. Service-marks receive the same legal protection as Trademarks but are meant to distinguish services rather than products. T. Trade Secret: Information including, but not limited to, technical or nontechnical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, or a list of actual or potential customers or suppliers which: (i) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. U. University IP: Intellectual Property owned by NMSU. Examples of University IP include Works for Hire, unless otherwise excepted by this rule (See Part 6, Section A.); and inventions produced using NMSU resources in excess of Limited Permitted Use.4/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and CommercializationV. Work for Hire: Intellectual Property created within the Inventor's course and scope of employment with NMSU. A work is a work for hire only if it is prepared by an employee within the scope of employment (as hired to develop); or it is specially ordered or commissioned from an independent contractor pursuant to a written agreement as defined by statutory categories. PART 3: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES The following entities are directly involved in IP, commercialization and technology transfer transactions, and are charged with the responsibilities noted: A. Arrowhead Center, Inc. Arrowhead Center, Inc. (AHC Inc.) is a 501 (c) (3) corporation established by the NMSU Board of Regents, consistent with the University Research Park and Economic Development Act. Among other activities and responsibilities, AHC Inc. is responsible for technology commercialization activities related to University IP. B. Intellectual Property Office (IP Office): The IP Office is a unit within Arrowhead Center NMSU which protects, manages, and assists with the commercialization of inventions, consistent with this rule. C. Inventor: An inventor is the source of the innovation that drives the processes under this rule. Each Inventor is required to work through their department head or equivalent and/or vice president or dean with the IP Office to ensure compliance with this rule and laws and regulations applicable to IP development, protection and commercialization. This begins with filing the Invention Disclosure Form and preliminary consultation with the IP Office, signing requisite documents, and other evaluation, protection, and commercialization activities. D. Human Resource Services: Human Resource Services (HRS) is responsible for assisting the academic and other departments by providing all NMSU employees with a copy of this rule, as it may be amended, upon hire, and for obtaining an acknowledgment in writing that they have received it and that they will abide by it.5/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and CommercializationE. Intellectual Property and Commercialization Board: The Intellectual Property and Commercialization Board (IPAC) was established in March, 2014 by the chancellor. The IPAC consists of NMSU administrators, staff, and researchers from various colleges, offices, and disciplines, and at least one representative from Arrowhead Center, Inc. See List of University Boards and associated Charter. The IPAC is authorized: 1. To make recommendations to the IP Office and vice president for research concerning NMSU IP protection and commercialization issues, including but not limited to IP policy, rules and procedures; budget; and promotion of the IP Office. 2. To serve as a hearing body to assist in the resolution of grievances on IP topics, disputes and ownership and to issue findings and recommendations to the vice president for research. 3. After evaluation of the market and commercial potential of disclosed Inventions, the IPAC votes to make a recommendation to the vice president for research on the issue of whether NMSU, through its Assignee, should Elect Title to the disclosed IP. The IPAC may also make other recommendations relating to the pursuit of IP protection and commercialization activities. F. Research Administration Services (RAS): Research Administration Services is responsible for working with faculty, staff, and students in establishing and executing contracts and agreements related to IP and technology commercialization (e.g., non-disclosure agreements [NDAs] and confidentiality agreements [CDAs]. Research Administration Services is also responsible for reviewing and, if necessary, instituting changes to contracts or agreements proposed by external partners in IP and technology commercialization-related activities. G. University General Counsel: University General Counsel is responsible for working with the IP Office and outside patent counsel in the management of NMSU IP, which may involve dispute resolution. University General Counsel is also responsible for processing NMSU Trademark applications and maintaining awarded Trademarks, with the exception of Trademarks affiliated directly with the New Mexico Department of Agriculture and Arrowhead Center, Inc. PART 4: OVERVIEW OF IP MANAGEMENT6/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and CommercializationObservations, experiments or other activities by members of the academic university community often lead to Inventions. Some of these Inventions have potential for commercialization. The IP Office assists with the protection, commercialization of these Inventions and their transfer into the marketplace. This happens in six steps, within three primary phases: 1. Research and Disclosure, 2. Evaluation and Protection, and 3. Commercialization and Licensing. New Inventions may go through all phases and steps in the process, or for a variety of reasons, the IP management process may stop, change or end at any step. The following gives a brief overview; see Parts 5-7 for detailed rules/procedures. A. Research and Disclosure (Phase 1-See Part 5): 1. Step One: Consultation with the IP Office: The Inventor, with their department head or equivalent and/or vice president or dean, or with their supervisors' approval, discusses the invention with staff from the IP Office, before public disclosure, to discuss publishing, making public disclosure, IP protection, the technology transfer process, and whether the invention is Work for Hire. Also the parties will consider and discuss preliminary tasks relating to patent eligibility and possibilities for commercialization and to explore options for moving Inventions from campus to market. If other parties will be affected by the potential future distribution of net earnings, they will be included in the conversation before decisions are finalized or action commenced. Public Disclosure of an Invention may jeopardize the ability and eligibility to protect the IP. 2. Step Two : Formal Submission of IP: The Inventor submits information about the IP in a legal document called the Invention Disclosure Form (IDF) to the IP Office for evaluation. 7/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and CommercializationB. Evaluation and Protection (Phase 2 - See Part 6): 1. Step Three : Determination of IP Ownership: The IP Office evaluates the Invention Disclosure Form and, in consultation with the appropriate dean or equivalent and other party who may be affected by a potential future distribution of net earnings, makes the preliminary determination relating to IP ownership. 2. Step Four : Election of Title: The IP Office evaluates the Invention's eligibility for protection, the market potential, and maintains the IP documentation file. The IPAC receives and reviews the IP documentation, hears from the Inventor, and makes a recommendation on Election of Title. The vice president for research considers the IPAC's recommendation, the IP documentation file, position of the Inventor, and issues a written determination indicating whether or not NMSU will Elect Title. 3. Step Five : IP Protection: The IP Office takes steps to obtain legal protection and initiates opportunities to commercialize the IP. C. Commercialization and Licensing (Phase 3 - See Part 7): 1. Step Six : Commercialization: The IP Office executes the technology transfer process, manages and administers the legal, financial and business documentation, and distributes Net Earnings generated from commercializing the University IP, when realized. PART 5: RESEARCH AND DISCLOSURE (PHASE 1) The first phase of the technology transfer process is Research and Disclosure. This Part addresses what each Inventor must do once it is realized that the Inventor's work has led to an Invention which may require IP protection. A. Step 1 - Consultation with the IP Office The first step within the Research and Disclosure phase is for the Inventor, their department head or equivalent and/or vice president or dean and any other party affected by the potential future distribution of net earnings to contact the IP Office. Communication with the IP Office staff is the first step to determining if the research has led to an Invention, with discussion of disclosing the Invention, public disclosures, funding of the research, determining ownership, eligibility for protection and the Inventions commercialization potential.8/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and CommercializationB. Step 2 - Formal Submission of IP An Invention Disclosure Form is the written notice of Invention to the IP Office that begins the formal technology transfer process. The Invention Disclosure Form confidentially discloses the Invention in its entirety so that options for protection and commercialization can be evaluated and pursued. Submission of the Invention Disclosure Form, signed by the Inventor and appropriate supervisors, begins the formal process. 1. Submission of IP : All University IP must be submitted for evaluation to the IP Office by the Inventor. Any uncertainty about whether IP is University IP should be resolved by submitting the IP for evaluation. Submission should be done using the appropriate form and in accordance with the guidelines posted at www.IP.nmsu.edu . IP Office staff will examine the disclosed materials in a timely manner and respond to Inventor to avoid a delay in publication or disclosure (as appropriate). 2. Multiple Inventors: Where multiple inventors have participated in the development of University IP, they each must sign an agreement specifying their relative contributions on a percentage basis. Where individual inventors cannot agree on their relative percentage contributions, the dispute resolution process will be utilized, in order to determine in advance the collective and individual percentages of the IP. (See Part 8) 3. University Assistance with Individual IP: Individual IP may be submitted to the IP Office to explore the feasibility of the university assisting with the protection and commercialization of the IP. If the university agrees to provide such assistance, the Inventor must assign their rights in the IP to the university, and such IP will become University IP, and processed in the same manner as any other University IP. PART 6: EVALUATION AND PROTECTION (PHASE 2) The second phase of the technology transfer process is Evaluation and Protection. Part 6 addresses determination of ownership rights, Election of Title and initiation of processes to protect the IP. A. Step 3: Determination of IP Ownership9/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and Commercialization1. Factors Relevant to Ownership Determination: The determination of IP ownership hinges in large part on whether or not the Invention is Work for Hire, falls within the exception to Work for Hire set forth in this subsection, or is Individual IP. To determine this, the terms and conditions of the Inventor's employment, and the extent to which NMSU resources, personnel, or facilities were used in the development of the Invention will be examined. Considerations may also include external funding sources and any agreement related to the creation of the IP. An invention produced as a Work for Hire is University IP, unless it is a Copyrightable Material developed by academic personnel that is an instructional material, or other artistic or scholarly work developed using no more than Limited Permitted Use of NMSU resources, in which case, the invention is not considered a Work for Hire, and will be recognized as Individual IP. (This is referred to as the exception to the Work for Hire rule.) The following is provided as guidance, with additional information and guidance available at the IP Office: a. University IP: Except as otherwise provided in this rule, if any one of these three criteria are met, the IP will be University IP: i. The IP was developed during the university employee's regular work hours; ii. The IP was developed with university resources in excess of Limited Permitted Use, or iii. The IP was developed as part of the university employee's job duties for the university. 10/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and Commercializationb. Contract Considerations: i. Grants and Contracts: Ownership of IP developed as a result of projects funded by a contract or grant properly executed by NMSU will be determined in accordance with the terms of the contract or grant. ii. Individual or Third Party IP rights recognized in an agreement executed by the board of regents, the chancellor, or the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs prior to the effective date of this rule will remain in force and effect. iii. Commencing with the effective date of this rule, No agreement purporting to bind the university with regard to IP ownership, including but not limited to grants and consulting agreements, will be valid unless the IP Office has reviewed and provided a recommendation to the vice president for research, who is a signatory to the agreement, along with the proper university official per the chancellor's Signature Authority Table (See RPM 1.30) c. Consulting Activities (See Also ARP 6.92 Faculty Consulting and ARP 6.91 Staff Consulting ) i. IP developed by a member of the faculty or by an exempt staff member (1) during that person's approved consulting activities and (2) without the use of university resources beyond the Limited Permitted Use will be Individual IP. d. Instructional Materials: i. Generally, Copyrightable Materials developed with no more than Limited Permitted Use of NMSU resources, for courses offered by NSMU, will be Individual IP. ii. Copyrightable Materials created at the request of the university under a specific contract or for supplemental pay (e.g. development of distance learning courses) will be University IP. 11/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and Commercializatione. Student Work: i. Copyrightable or Patentable Materials developed by a student to earn credit in university courses, or otherwise to satisfy university degree requirements, will be Individual IP, unless the cost of development of the materials covered by NMSU substantially exceeds the amount regularly spent assisting students in courses of the same type. In such cases, prior to initiating any effort to promote the creation and prior to incurring Expenses, NMSU will enter into an agreement with the student. ii. IP developed by a student pursuant to research activities performed under a university research contract or grant, or for which the student is compensated by the university (student employment) will be University IP, or may be third party IP as provided by contract or grant. f. Artistic, Literary and Scholarly Works: i. Generally, Copyrightable Materials developed without more than Limited Permitted Use of NMSU resources will be Individual IP. Examples include books, articles, and other publications, works of art, literature and music recordings. ii. Copyrightable Materials developed pursuant to a university research contract or grant, or for which the employee is separately compensated by the university (contract or supplemental employment) will be University IP, or may be third party IP as provided by contract or grant. g. Works for Hire: Works for Hire, unless excepted as described above, will be University IP. 12/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and Commercialization2. Procedures: a. The IP Office in consultation with the Inventor and the appropriate supervisors will consider the facts relating to the disclosed IP and render a determination of IP ownership in accordance with this rule. The determination may be contested by any involved party. (See Part 8) b. Once IP ownership has been determined and is not subject to any pending internal grievance or appeal, the parties will execute the appropriate documentation to release claim of ownership consistent with the determination: i. In the case of a determination of Individual IP, NMSU will not assert any claim to the IP, which provides the Inventor full authority to use or dispose of the Individual IP without further university involvement. ii. In the case of a determination of University IP, the Inventor will release any claim to the IP which might be asserted by the Inventor, and will provide NMSU and its Assignee full authority to use or dispose of the University IP. The Inventor will be involved throughout the technology transfer process to protect and commercialize the IP. B. Step 4: Election of Title The eligibility of the Invention for IP protection, the commercial potential of the Invention and whether NMSU will Elect Title to the Invention is also determined within the second phase of the technology transfer process (Evaluation and Protection). The following procedures apply: 1. The IP Office, in coordination with the Inventor, evaluates the eligibility for IP Protection. Inventions that are eligible for protection and have the potential for commercialization will be presented to IPAC for evaluation and recommendation regarding Election of Title. 13/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and Commercialization2. The IP Office and/or the Inventor present the disclosed IP and pertinent facts to the IPAC. The Inventor may excuse, without stating any justification, one member of the IPAC for any reason. If the Inventor or the IP Office believes that any member of the IPAC has an actual conflict of interest, and the Inventor has already excused a member, that issue will be resolved separately. IPAC Board members must be able to serve in an objective and impartial manner, which may involve the recusal of a member with a conflict or the excusal by the vice president for research and replacement of that member with a designee. 3. The IPAC will evaluate the commercial potential of University IP at or after the presentation by the IP Office and Inventor. The IPAC will issue its recommendation to the vice president for research on the issue of whether the university should Elect Title to the University IP. 4. The vice president for research is not bound to the recommendation of the IPAC. The vice president for research issues a written determination indicating whether or not the university will Elect Title, and if the determination is not consistent with the recommendation of the IPAC, explains the basis for the determination. a. If the vice president for research finds that there is adequate potential for commercial application of the technology or finds that there is a potential market for the licensing of the IP, the vice president for research will Elect Title. b. If the vice president for research finds there is not adequate potential for either licensing or commercialization, but an academic college or other NMSU entity support Election of Title based on academic value of the disclosed IP, then the Inventor and the Inventor's Dean or equivalent will contact the IP Office to initiate the process to fund the Election of Title. 5. If the vice president for research determines not to Elect Title, the vice president for research is authorized to release to the Inventor, on behalf of NMSU, any claim that might be asserted by the university to the IP. This does not apply in the instance of federally sponsored research, in which case the university's rights are transferred to the Sponsoring Agency. In such cases, the Inventor may request assignment of rights from the Sponsoring Agency. C. Step Five: IP Protection or Subsequent Return of the IP14/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and CommercializationC. Step Five: IP Protection or Subsequent Return of the IP Also within the second phase of the technology transfer process (Evaluation and Protection), NMSU through the IP Office will protect the IP. There are several manners in which IP can be protected including but not limited to the application of Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks, and Trade Secrets through protection granting agencies such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office. 1. Formal Assignment by Inventor: The Inventor will retain authorship or inventor rights, which will be recognized on the patent or copyright, but must assign ownership rights to the University IP to NMSU and its Assignee as part of protection and commercialization processes. The Inventor will execute an assignment document provided by the IP Office to protect the IP, and will cooperate in all matters relating to the IP so that the university or its Assignee is able to pursue legal protection, technology transfer and commercialization. 15/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and Commercialization2. Return by NMSU to Inventor of the Elected IP: If at least two (2) years have passed from the date the university determined it would Elect Title, or the university or its Assignee, along with the Inventor has not been successful in reaching its goals, or is not willing to expend the resources necessary to protect and commercialize the IP, then the Invention may be released to the Inventor(s) (and becomes Individual IP). a. An Inventor interested in protecting and commercializing the Invention, may engage in an agreement with the university for release of ownership rights and any financial obligations associated with the IP. b. The Inventor may request that the university and its Assignee return their rights in such IP to the Inventor. i. Such requests must be submitted in writing to the vice president for research and the IP Office. ii. If the university and its Assignee have no plans to commercialize, the vice president for research will relinquish the university's claim and assign its rights in such IP to the Inventor or Sponsoring Agency. iii. If the university or its Assignee can demonstrate progress with pursuing legal protection and/or commercialization, such request may be denied, or an agreement may be reached relating to reimbursement of the university for its Expenses prior to relinquishing its claim. PART 7: COMMERCIALIZATION AND LICENSING; DISTRIBUTION OF EARNINGS (PHASE 3) Step 6: Commercialize A. Decision regarding Business Setup : The move to establish a new company or work with an existing business is a joint decision made by the IP Office and the Inventor. B. Role of IP Office : The IP Office will manage and administer the associated legal, financial and business aspects relating to IP protection, commercialization and technology transfer for current, non-expired IP protected Inventions.16/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and CommercializationC. Marketing Strategies : The IP Office utilizes a variety of sources and strategies to identify potential licensees and commercialize Inventions. Sometimes existing relationships of the Inventor, other researchers, and IP Office staff are useful in commercializing an Invention. Inventor active involvement dramatically improves the chances of matching an Invention to an outside company. D. License Agreement : The process of commercialization may begin with a license agreement that protects NMSU's rights to ownership and enables a third party to bring the Invention to the public. E. Distribution of Net Earnings : Net Earnings received from the terms of a license or other agreement will be distributed to the Inventor and to the University as follows: 1. Earnings will first be used for recovery of all Expenses incurred by the university or its Assignee to protect, manage, and commercialize the IP (including legal, management and marketing fees and any grant awarded to the Inventor for development of their IP). 2. Net Earnings when realized will be used to repay direct costs incurred by the Inventor for producing the material under any material transfer agreement. 3. Net Earnings will be distributed as follows: the Inventor will (collectively) receive fifty percent (50%) of Net Earnings and the university will receive 50%. 4. The Net Earnings received by the university will be further distributed with 33.3% assigned to the Inventor's college or appropriate division, 33.3% to the Inventor's department, or appropriate division; and 33.3 % to the Office of the Vice President for Research. 5. Where more than one inventor contributed to the development of the IP, the Inventor's share (50%) of the Net Earnings will be distributed to each individual inventor according to their relative percentage contribution to the development of the IP, as previously established. 6. Where IP was developed with contributions from individual inventors from more than one college, division, or department, the portion of the college and department shares set forth above will be further divided in proportion to the respective individual inventor's relative percentage contribution. PART 8: DISPUTE RESOLUTION17/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and CommercializationThe following section establishes the process by which disputes relating to intellectual property rights or ownership at NMSU will be resolved. A. Dispute Resolution Process: Any party with a claim or complaint relating to IP management must utilize this rule's dispute resolution process. The IPAC will convene to hear parties' complaints as provided in this rule. Examples of types of issues which may be submitted to it include but are not limited to: ownership rights, distribution of funds, and decisions about the pursuit or non-pursuit of legal protection or commercialization. B. Initiation of Complaint: A Complaint Resolution Request form must be completed and turned in to the IP Office. The form must provide the reason for the request, the name of requestor, the details of complaint and requested resolution. A copy of the Complaint must also be sent by the complainant to the employee's dean or equivalent or to the student's supervising faculty, as appropriate. C. Administrative Hearing : The IPAC serves as the official hearing body, which hears from the parties, reviews the evidence presented and assertions made by the parties, and renders findings and recommendations to the vice president for research. Consistent with this rule, the IPAC may establish additional procedures to more specifically address mediation and/or hearing procedures for the orderly presentation and resolution of matters brought to it. When the IPAC convenes a dispute resolution hearing, the follow procedures will apply: 1. The IPAC chair will provide the parties at least ten business days' notice of the hearing date and time, and members of the hearing panel by name and job position or role in the university community. Each complainant must be given an opportunity to excuse a member from the hearing panel, for cause or no cause. Should a complainant believe there remains a conflict of interest on the part of any remaining member of the IPAC, the provisions of No. 4 below will apply. 2. The IPAC will conduct an informal hearing within 30 business days (unless this time limit is extended by the IPAC, with notice to the parties) from the date the request for a hearing is submitted by the aggrieved party. The hearing will be audio- recorded.18/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and Commercialization3. The IPAC will review the documentation or other evidence provided by each party, convene a hearing to allow the parties to present, and render written factual findings and separate recommendations, if any. 4. The IPAC will conduct a fair hearing, which includes resolution of ethical issues which might be raised concerning a member of the IPAC. Such issues (e.g., conflict of interest on the part of a member of the IPAC) should be raised and resolved prior to the hearing or as soon as it is brought to the IPAC's attention. In the event of an actual or perceived conflict, the affected IPAC member will recuse him or herself. If the IPAC member will not voluntarily recuse, the IPAC will hear from all parties and the member accused of the conflict, and vote regarding whether or not the IPAC reasonably could serve impartially and fairly in the matter at issue. 5. The IPAC will follow any additional hearing procedures it may adopt, and maintain order during the hearing process. In the absence of any additional written procedures to this rule, the chair will maintain order. Procedural questions raised by any participant will be decided by the IPAC after hearing the position of each party on the issue in contention, discussion and deliberation amongst the IPAC members. The IPAC may meet apart from the parties to deliberate on the procedural question and may consult by phone with General Counsel. The decision on the procedural question will be decided by a vote of the IPAC after re-convening the hearing with all parties. 6. The hearing will be audio-recorded; the audio recording becomes part of the dispute resolution record, along with the complaint resolution request; position statement from respondent, if any; other documentation or evidence tendered by the parties for the IPAC's consideration; and the findings and recommendations by the IPAC. The IPAC will not consider evidence outside of the hearing. Trade Secret or other confidential proprietary information or other disclosed IP which merits heightened protection from public disclosure will be labeled as such in the record. 7. To ensure impartiality, the IPAC members must not communicate with either party or associated supervisor before or at the hearing unless through the chair and with both parties present.19/21 08/25/2020 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and Commercialization8. The IPAC members are expected to respect the privacy of the parties, and the confidentiality of the disclosed IP, and will not discuss the matters in dispute with third parties, except for university officials with a legitimate need to know. The parties and their supervisors are subject to these same requirements. 9. Absent the need for a time extension being required for extenuating circumstances, with notice to the parties, the IPAC's findings and recommendations will be provided to the vice president for research within 15 business days from the date of the hearing. D. Issuance of Determination : The vice president for research will review the findings and recommendations, the record from the hearing, and issue a decision to the parties, with a copy to the University General Counsel. The decision will inform the parties of their right to appeal the decision to the Office of the Chancellor within ten business days from receipt of the decision. E. Right to Appeal; Appeal Procedures and Final Decision: The decision of the vice president for research may be appealed by either party. A written request for appeal, attaching a document outlining the basis for the appeal, must be submitted to the Office of the Chancellor, with a copy to all parties, the vice president for research and the University General Counsel, within ten business days from receipt of the decision. Any party may submit a response to the appeal document within ten business days from receipt of the copy of the request for appeal. The chancellor's review will be based on the written and audio recorded record, the argument of the parties contained in the written submissions. A final decision will be within thirty business days from date the Office of the Chancellor received the responses to the appeal and the record (to be provided by the IPAC chair), whichever is later, which time deadline may be extended based on scheduling or other circumstances, with notice to the parties.

The way in which a faculty member divides effort among these various functions does not raise ethical questions unless the university or government, industrial, or business agency supporting the research is misled in its understanding of the amount of intellectual effort actually devoted to the research in question. A system of precise time accounting is incompatible with the inherent character of the work of a faculty member, since the various functions performed are closely interrelated and do not conform to any meaningful division of a standard work week. On the other hand, if the research agreement contemplates that a staff member will devote a certain fraction of effort to the government, industrial, or business sponsored research, a demonstrable relationship between the indicated effort of responsibility and the actual extent of involvement is to be expected. Research administering agencies in the university have established simple procedures of accounting which indicate the proportion of the investigator's time spent on sponsored research. Each administering agency will inform the investigator of the procedures developed to assure that proposals are responsibly made and complied with.

This responsibility includes the conduct of the project, fiscal and administrative accountability, and adherence to the requirements of all relevant laws, regulations, policies, procedures and agreements. If a project has multiple investigators (lead principal investigator and co-principal investigators), they shall share the responsibility and accountability for leading and directing the project, both intellectually and logistically. B.Eligibility to Serve as a Principal Investigator : Eligibility to serve as a principal investigator on an externally sponsored award is generally limited to those regular employees of the university including: (a) those with faculty rank, including college faculty and research faculty as well as administrators with faculty rank such as (but not limited to) the president, provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, vice presidents, deans, and associate deans, and (b) research and development technical staff. There may be instances when it is in the best interest of the university to have other persons serve as principal investigators, such as temporary employees, affiliated faculty or emeritus faculty. Exceptions to the requirements that a principal investigator must have both (a) regular employee status and (b) either faculty rank or employment as research and development technical staff may be made with written approval of both the relevant dean or director, and the vice president for research. A student may serve as a co-principal investigator, but may not serve as the lead principal investigator on a project.1/4 08/25/2020 11.20 - Responsibilities and Accountability for Sponsored Project AwardsPART 2: SPONSORED PROJECT PROPOSAL PROCESS A. Proposal Preparation : Proposal preparation is the responsibility of principal investigators and their units, working in cooperation with Research Administration Services (RAS). The Proposal/Award Form or a similar automated system, as designated by the vice president for research, will be used by all principal investigators and project directors seeking externally sponsored project funding. This form will be processed in the early stages of proposal development. This is a mandatory form, and no research proposal will be signed or sent out from the university unless this form is signed by the appropriate administrative officers or designated representatives. Responsibility for proposal preparation includes developing budgets consistent with relevant cost accounting standards and obtaining appropriate certifications, permits ( g., for drug use), and permissions (e.g., use of humans and animals in research). B. Proposal Submission : Proposal submission is the sole responsibility of the Office of the Vice President for Research. Principal investigators should timely submit funding proposals through their unit to Research Administration Services, with sufficient advance notice to allow for their proper review, approval and submission to funding agencies. PART 3: ACCEPTANCE OF SPONSORED PROJECT AWARD Award documents are received by Research Administration Services for final review, negotiation and formal acceptance. Only the vice president for research (or designee) has the authority to accept an award, negotiate and to sign award agreements related to sponsored programs, including amendments, modifications, budget changes, principal investigator changes, and extensions to existing agreements. PART 4: MAINTENANCE OF SPONSORED PROJECT RECORDS2/4 08/25/2020 11.20 - Responsibilities and Accountability for Sponsored Project AwardsRecords of sponsored project awards and related certifications, permits and permissions, as well as of non-financial deliverable reports to sponsors, are maintained by the Office of the Vice President for Research through Research Administration Services. This includes coordinating the production, submission and retention of reports and records generated in the closeout of sponsored award agreements. Financial records of sponsored awards and related reports, invoices and financial reports, are maintained by the Office of Administration and Finance, primarily through the Sponsored Projects Accounting Office. PART 5: ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SPONSORED AWARD TRANSACTIONS Transactions on sponsored project awards shall be approved by the principal investigator and the dean, director, or designee of the college or other unit. The Sponsored Projects Accounting Office, in cooperation with the principal investigators and their respective units, fiscally monitors sponsored awards, reviews and prepares financial reports, and receives and disburses funds. PART 6: ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PROPERTY ACQUIRED THROUGH A SPONSORED PROJECT AWARD The principal investigator, department head, dean or director, and university property administrator shall be accountable for acquisitions and dispositions of equipment and other property acquired through sponsored project awards. Any such property will be recorded on the university's inventory at a minimum, for property to which the university does not acquire title, until the expiration of the award period. A determination as to whether title to property acquired under sponsored awards vests with the sponsor or with the university at the end of the award period should be included in the award agreement, rather than negotiated at award termination. The university property administrator will be kept informed of any amendment to the initial determination regarding property ownership, so that the university's inventory may be updated and the necessary final property reports prepared.3/4 08/25/2020 11.20 - Responsibilities and Accountability for Sponsored Project Awards Details Scope: NMSU System Source: ARP Chapter 11 | Research and Intellectual Property Rule Administrator: VP Research Last Updated: 03/14/2011 Recompilation, by Board of Regents \u00a9 2017 New Mexico State University - Board of Regents 4/4 08/25/2020 11.20 - Responsibilities and Accountability for Sponsored Project Awards11.30 - Addressing Allegations of Misconduct in Research arp.nmsu.edu /11-30 PART 1: DEFINITION OF RESEARCH MISCONDUCT Research misconduct is academic misconduct, dishonest behavior, or any form of unethical practices involving an act of deception whereby one's work or the work of others is misrepresented. Other terms, such as research fraud or scientific misconduct, are subsumed within the term academic misconduct. Research misconduct is distinguished from honest error and from ambiguities of interpretation that are inherent in the scientific process. The principal element of research misconduct is the intent to deceive others or misrepresent one's work. Research misconduct may also involve wrongful acts or omissions relating to non-compliance with applicable law or regulation, a failure to report known misconduct or retaliation against others involved in the reporting, investigation or correcting misconduct. Research misconduct may take numerous forms such as, but not limited to: A.Falsification of Data : Fabrication, willful suppression and/or distortion of data with the intent to falsify results. B.Plagiarism : The use of the work of another without proper acknowledgment. C.Improprieties of Authorship : Improper assignment of credit, such as excluding other authors, inclusion of individuals as authors who have not made a definite contribution to the work published, or submission of multi-authored publications without the concurrence of all authors. D.Misappropriation of the Ideas of Others : Unauthorized use of privileged information (such as violation of confidentiality in peer review), however obtained. E.Violation of Generally Accepted Research Practices : Deceptive practices in proposing, conducting, or reporting research.1/6 08/25/2020 11.30 - Addressing Allegations of Misconduct in ResearchF. Material Failure to Comply with Governmental Requirements : Serious, repeated, willful violations of governmental requirements arising from law, statute, regulation, or agreement. Regulations include, but are not limited to, those governing the use of funds, care of animals, human subjects, and biological, chemical, pharmacological, and radiological materials. G. Inappropriate Behavior in Relation to Research Misconduct : Unjust and malicious accusation(s) of misconduct, failure to report misconduct, withholding or destruction of information or evidence relevant to a claim of misconduct, or malicious retaliation against persons involved in the allegation or investigation of misconduct. PART 2: SCOPE OF RULE This rule applies throughout the university system to faculty, staff and students involved in research and research-related work regulated by federal law or sponsored externally. Such research includes, but is not limited to, research involving human subjects, vertebrate animals, biohazardous agents and/or recombinant DNA. Research projects involving the surveying of other students, university personnel, or members of the general public fall within the scope of this rule, unless exempted by federal law. Academic misconduct alleged against a student generally will not be covered by this rule, unless it falls within the above scope, and will instead be addressed pursuant to the Academic Misconduct policy housed in the NMSU Student Handbook. PART 3: DUTY TO REPORT Individuals with a reasonable factual basis to believe that a researcher has committed an act of research misconduct prohibited by this rule are obligated to report such occurrences to a supervisor not involved in the alleged misconduct. Such reports of suspected research misconduct shall be forwarded to the vice president for research for prompt investigation, and subsequent corrective action and reporting, if warranted by the investigative findings. If the reporter, the supervisor, or the vice president have reason to suspect that a crime may have been committed, the report2/6 08/25/2020 11.30 - Addressing Allegations of Misconduct in Researchshall also be made to the NMSU Police or other appropriate law enforcement for a separate and distinct criminal investigation . (See also Parts 9 and 10 below.) PART 4: PRELIMINARY INTERNAL INVESTIGATION If an appropriate oversight committee (Institutional Review Board, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Institutional Biosafety Committee, or Radiation Safety Committee) reports misconduct substantiated by an investigation with factual findings, this shall serve as the internal preliminary investigation. In all other cases, the vice president for research will refer the reported matter to the appropriate college dean and associate dean for research, or equivalents, to conduct a preliminary internal investigation into the alleged misconduct. The investigation will be conducted confidentially. Within twenty (20) business days from the initial receipt of the report of potential academic misconduct, the evidence and any recommended findings shall be forwarded to the vice president for research. During the preliminary investigation stage, the funding agency will not be notified, except as may be otherwise required by law or written agreement. PART 5: ACTION ON RESULTS OF PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION The vice president for research shall consider the evidence and the recommended findings of the preliminary investigation, and initiate further action as follows within twenty (20) business days from the date the evidence and the findings were received. A. If the vice president for research concludes that no infraction occurred, the matter will be dismissed. This decision, including all supporting documentation, will be reported to the Office of University General Counsel.3/6 08/25/2020 11.30 - Addressing Allegations of Misconduct in ResearchB. If the vice president for research concludes that an infraction occurred, but was not an unanticipated problem, did not involve serious or continuing non-compliance with federal regulations or university policy, rules or procedures, and did not involve a suspension or termination of an approval granted by the appropriate oversight committee, the vice president for research will refer the matter to the college dean or appropriate vice president for disciplinary action or other administrative corrective action, as warranted by the factual findings. C. If the vice president for research concludes that the matter may involve an unanticipated problem, a serious or continuing non- compliance issue, or a suspension or termination of an approval granted by the appropriate oversight committee, the vice president for research shall refer the matter for a confidential formal investigation, at which time the funding agency and/or the appropriate federal or state oversight agency will be notified by way of an Initial Report. The Initial Report shall indicate that either follow up reports or a final report, or both, will be forthcoming as soon as practicable under the circumstances. D. If the vice president for research concludes that a crime may be implicated, the matter shall be immediately reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency for a separate and distinct criminal investigation. PART 6: FORMAL INVESTIGATION The confidential formal investigation will be conducted by an ad hoc committee to be convened and chaired by the vice president for research. The committee shall consist of the appropriate college dean and associate dean for research or equivalents, the appropriate department head, and three faculty or exempt staff members from the University Research Council, selected by the university research council chair. Substitutions, in the event of conflict of interest, will be made by the vice president for research or the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, as appropriate. This formal investigation should be completed within two months from the date the committee is formed. The committee shall gather relevant documentation; interview witnesses with relevant testimony, including the person charged with the misconduct; preserve any physical evidence; and prepare an investigative report summarizing all4/6 08/25/2020 11.30 - Addressing Allegations of Misconduct in Researchevidence in the form of factual findings. The final draft investigative report shall be shared with the person charged with the misconduct, and that person shall be given a minimum of five business days to respond. PART 7: ACTION ON RESULTS OF FORMAL INVESTIGATION Consistent with the results of the formal investigation, the vice president for research and/or the appropriate college dean or vice president shall take appropriate, university-wide corrective action to ensure that similar incidents do not recur, and shall coordinate with the Office of Human Resource Services regarding disciplinary action, if any, to be taken. PART 8: NOTIFICATIONS AND RECORD RETENTION All documentation of the preliminary inquiry and formal investigation, if any, shall be maintained in the office of the vice president for research for at least three (3) years and must, upon request, be provided to authorized government personnel. The university shall comply with notification requirements imposed by funding agency regulations and agreements. PART 9: ANTI-RETALIATION In order to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good faith, report reasonably suspected academic misconduct in research, the university prohibits retaliation in any form to be taken against the reporter or any person who cooperates in the investigative process. A complaint of suspected retaliation will also be cause for the initiation of a separate internal investigation to be conducted in coordination with the Office of Human Resource Services, and if substantiated, will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 5/6 08/25/2020 11.30 - Addressing Allegations of Misconduct in ResearchPART 10: FALSE OR UNFOUNDED COMPLAINTS If the preliminary or formal investigative report reflects that the complaint of academic misconduct in research was not substantiated, the university will make efforts to restore the reputations of the researcher who was accused of having engaged in misconduct. Additionally, and depending upon the circumstances, the university may initiate a separate internal investigation in the event the investigative report indicates that the initial complaint or any testimony given as part of the internal investigation, may have been intentionally falsified. If deliberate falsification of such a complaint or testimony is substantiated, it will be grounds for disciplinary action against the false reporter, up to and including termination of employment.

For New Mexico law and regulations on hemp cultivation, see http://www.nmda.nmsu.edu/home/laws- regulations/agricultural-environmental-services-statutes-rules/ P ART 2: DEFINITIONS Hemp : For purposes of these guidelines, hemp is defined the same as in the 2018 Farm Bill Act: the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of the plant, whether growing or not, that contains a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. PART 3: HEMP-RELATED RESEARCH PERMITTED AT NMSU NMSU faculty may only perform research that involves hemp if such research complies with federal guidelines and state law. Hemp related research may be conducted pursuant to either the (1) Controlled Substance Act or (2) the 2014 and 2018 Farm Bills: 1/7 08/25/2020 11.50 - Hemp Research, Extension, and Outreach ActivitiesA. Controlled Substance Act : Researchers may obtain a controlled substances registration number from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). In such cases, the researcher would: 1. Register with the DEA and obtain a Schedule I registration number for the possession, use, or distribution of industrial hemp in accordance with the DEA requirements for marijuana. Upon receipt of registration number, the researcher must register with the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy. 2. Obtain research-grade hemp from a DEA-approved distributor. B. 2014 and 2018 U.S. Farm Bills : Researchers may also conduct hemp research under the federal Farm Bills of 2014 and 2018. The Farm Bill of 2014 allows institutions of higher education in a state in which such activities are legalized \"...to grow or cultivate industrial hemp for purposes of research conducted under an agricultural pilot program or other agricultural or academic research.\" For an NMSU researcher to grow, cultivate, or conduct research on industrial hemp under the Farm Bill, the research must be for the purpose of agricultural or academic research, and activities must take place within the state of New Mexico. 1. Hemp Cultivation Research Requirements: a. Principal investigators (PI) are responsible for obtaining a license from NMDA prior to possession of viable seed, plants, cuttings, etc. b. Prior to purchase or possession of material to be planted, obtain a certificate of analysis, (based solely on bud and flower, not biomass) demonstrating the source plants for seed, plants, and cuttings meet the definition of hemp measured post-decarboxylated for gas chromatography (GC), or delta 9THC (.877 * tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA)) for liquid chromatography (LC)). c. No NMSU employee may be required to participate in hemp research. Before working with hemp, an employee will be asked to acknowledge in writing the potential risks associated with the political and legal landscapes relating to hemp, as well as the complexities involved with its cultivation. For employees under the age of 18, permission from their legal guardian will be required. d. Cultivation of hemp may only take place in counties, noxious weed districts, cities or other political subdivision that allow for its cultivation.2/7 08/25/2020 11.50 - Hemp Research, Extension, and Outreach Activitiese. PIs are responsible for transportation of samples to laboratories. NMSU must not transport hemp outside of the state of New Mexico. NMSU employees must have a copy of a valid cultivation license issued by NMDA in their possession at all times when transporting raw hemp (seeds, plants, flower/bud etc.). NMSU employees are not permitted to transport hemp belonging to any third party. Staff participating in hemp related research must be informed that the handling of hemp plants may result in travel complications where drug dogs may be working. f. Upon initiation of buds and flowers, PIs must test each cultivar at least once every 10 days to determine compliance with THC levels. Non-compliant plants must be destroyed immediately. g. Non-compliant cultivars must be destroyed using a method developed in conjunction with Environmental Health Safety and Risk Management and NMSU police. Cannabis sativa with a THC concentration of greater than 0.3% (marijuana) is a controlled substance. h. PIs must keep copies of all cultivar tests and make them available to NMDA upon request. i. PIs must keep a record of destruction of non-compliant plants. The record must include the name of the plant variety, the number of plants destroyed, the date of destruction and the method of destruction. j. If cultivation is going to take place on land owned or controlled by NMSU, the PI must obtain a letter from the Chancellor authorizing the cultivation of hemp on NMSU property. 3/7 08/25/2020 11.50 - Hemp Research, and Outreach Activities2. Acquisition of Hemp from Third Parties: The following are requirements for NMSU researchers to obtain hemp, that will not be cultivated, from a third party: a. All hemp specimens must be certified independently by an NMDA approved lab, and be cultivated in New Mexico consistent with New Mexico law or from a federal DEA- approved distributor. b. All specimens must be accompanied by a Certificate of Analysis, (based solely on bud and flower, not biomass) demonstrating the source plants for seed, plants, and cuttings meet the definition of hemp measured post- decarboxylated for GC, or delta 9THC + (.877 * THCA) for LC). PART 4: EXTENSION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES A. NMSU's Cooperative Extension Service (CES) may provide information to farmers cultivating hemp who are registered with the NMDA. To ensure compliance with these guidelines, Extension employees must obtain a copy of the hemp grower's NMDA-issued license before any services are provided. CES must obtain a release from the farmer cultivating hemp releasing NMSU from liability related to NMSU's advice and any potential impact on the THC concentration of the crop. B. CES must not provide assistance for marijuana growers. NMSU employees may answer general crop questions such as what types of pesticides are safe to use on plants grown for human consumption, what types of insecticides are effective on a variety of crops for controlling a specific pest, or what type of protective personal gear are recommended when handling pesticides. C. CES is prohibited from transporting hemp for any third party. PART 5: NMSU PLANT DIAGNOSTIC CLINIC The NMSU Plant Diagnostic Clinic may accept hemp samples for identification of insect and disease problems provided the sample is accompanied by an NMDA issued hemp grower's license. Following4/7 08/25/2020 11.50 - Hemp Extension, and Outreach Activitiesconclusion of diagnostic tests, all hemp samples will be disposed of as any other plant samples. PART 6: HEMP RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS OR ANIMALS Principal Investigators (PI) conducting hemp research involving human subjects or animals are subject to the following additional requirements: A. Coordination with RAS : PI's must coordinate with Research Administration Services regarding protocols involving humans or animals. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) assists researchers and reviews protocols for research with human subjects. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) provides guidance and reviews protocols for activities involving live vertebrate animals. B. Coordination with FDA : 1. For research with humans or animals relating to clinical drugs, cosmetics, or food additives to be marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, the PI must apply for an investigational new drug (IND) application by contacting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additional information can be found on the FDA webpages. 2. The FDA strongly recommends preliminary discussions with PIs at the protocol preparation phase regarding regulatory requirements to avoid delays and non-compliance from incomplete or incorrect procedures. C. IACUC Approval: For research involving animals, the PI must obtain Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval. PART 7: FUNDING FOR HEMP RESEARCH 5/7 08/25/2020 11.50 - Hemp Research, Extension, and Outreach ActivitiesA. Funding Source : 1. In addition to the standard issues that may arise for any research funding, the source of funding (federal or state agencies, non- profit organizations, industry and private individuals) is important when conducting research on hemp. Additional scrutiny is required to assure that NMSU is not receiving any funding derived from illegal activities. Due to the nexus between hemp and marijuana, it is critical that NMSU not accept funds derived from the sale of marijuana. 2. The source of all funds for hemp research must be investigated and approved by NMSU's Research Administration Services before applying for, or accepting hemp related funding, including funding provided as gifts or donations. B. Form of Payment : All hemp research funds must come in the form of a check (no cash or money orders may be accepted).

PART 2: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE A. The goals of the NMSU Wayfinding and Signage Program are to implement a cohesive graphic identity throughout the entire Las Cruces campus by Facilities and Services. The look and style of the signs applied uniformly and accurately will create a positive first impression by displaying graphics that will assist students and first- time visitors with navigating the campus and by providing them with a sense of welcome, security and comfort. B. This document establishes parameters and provides guidelines that will maintain a unified look for all signage on campus. Collaboration and participation by interested parties (administrative staff, architects, sign designers, interior designers, campus project managers, etc) will ensure that the system remains uniform and cohesive. The design of the signage will incorporate the guidelines from the branding initiative. C. The Wayfinding and Signage Program is all encompassing. It includes directional signs from roadways, to parking, to pedestrian activities, to buildings and ultimately to final destinations. The guidelines serve the entire Las Cruces campus and will be applied to new construction as well as modifications to existing buildings.1/3 08/25/2020 12.06 - Uniform Navigation SignageD. Roadway signage will emphasize the main campus entrances and clearly identify visitor information destinations. Parking lots will be clearly marked, and campus maps and directories will be strategically placed at pedestrian entry paths adjacent to parking lots. PART 3: REQUIRED ARCHITECTURAL SIGNAGE Campus buildings will have architectural signage as follows: A. Building Identification/dimensional letters : with the official name of the building as approved by the Board of Regents placed near the main entrance(s). Address numerals may also be utilized (numerals only). All letters on buildings will be a standard size as noted in the signage guidelines. B. Building Identification/freestanding sign : with name of building, one name per building, as defined by the Naming Committee, placed near the main entrance or near the primary walkway to the main entrance in instances when the front door is obscured or when there is no appropriate location on the architecture for dimensional letters. One line of descriptive text may also be applied to the sign when needed or feasible, as defined by the Naming Committee. Address, with numerals and street name only, may also be applied to the sign panel. Signs may be single sided when parallel to the building or double faced when perpendicular to approaching traffic. C. Building Directories/wall mounted : Tenants and sub-tenants of buildings will be listed on building directories as shown in the signage guidelines. Facilities and Services will provide information and assist building managers with implementing the directory signage through the NMSU Sign Shop. Directories are recommended in lobbies of buildings at primary entrances on the first floor or ground level. Secondary directories, such as floor directories and/or elevator lobby directories, can provide further opportunity to guide visitors and provide tenant information. D. All appeals pursuant to this Rule should be directed through the university architect to the Campus Planning Committee.

Donor Restrictions : The university prefers to receive gifts free of restrictions that might affect the university's ability to utilize the gift in the most efficacious manner on behalf of the students and the NMSU community. There can be no commitment to permanent display, nor can the university commit to retain ownership in perpetuity. Every effort should be made to limit restrictions to a reasonable period, after which they will expire. Any restriction shall be documented and maintained with the records pertaining to the gift and kept on file at the Art Gallery. 2. Gift Agreement : The gift of objects or works of art needs to be formalized in a deed of gift agreement which includes statement of transfer of legal title and where applicable, copyright and literary rights and signature of the donor.

PART 8: DE-ACCESSION A de-accession is the removal of an object from the university's art collection with legal transfer of title or other appropriate action. The following de-accession process applies in the event any university department wishes to dispose of a university owned work of art. A. Requests for De-accession : The director of the Art Gallery shall present a written request for de-accession to the Art Gallery Acquisitions Committee and the University Cultural Collections Committee. The request should include a justification and a proposed destination for the work of art. Written outside appraisals will be sought for any object of significant value that is being considered for de-accession. The Art Gallery Acquisitions Committee and the University Cultural Collections Committee shall make its recommendation(s) to the NMSU Board of Regents. An object should not be de-accessioned on the grounds of taste, current or otherwise. The Art Gallery Acquisitions Committee and the University Cultural Collections Committee should discourage the sale of objects without clear justification and deter the sale of objects for revenue. 1. Reservation for Distinct Special Collection : If the director of the university museum, or the library's archives and special collections department head desire the object for a collection, the Art Gallery Acquisitions Committee and the University Cultural Collections Committee should release the object for approval by the acquisitions committee of the established collection. If the object is not desired for an established collection, the de-accession process shall continue.9/12 08/25/2020 12.50 - Art, Archives and Other Collections2. Current Restrictions on Gift of Art : Objects with mandatory donor restrictions may not be de-accessioned prior to expiration of any time limitation or until permitted by a court of competent jurisdiction. If it is practical and reasonable to do so considering the value, the Art Gallery should notify the donor if it intends to dispose of such objects within 10 years or the donor's lifetime, whichever is shorter. If there is any question as to the intent or force of the restrictions, the Art Gallery will seek advice from the university's general counsel. 3. De-accession of Objects : The manner of de-accession chosen will be in the best interest of the Art Gallery and its collection. Any profit from the de-accession will be applied to acquisitions and/or art conservation. Consideration may be given to placing the object through gift, exchange, or sale with another tax- exempt public institution. If the object is to be sold to a non- public entity, a public auction or other publicly noticed sale should be conducted. Staff and officials of the university are ineligible to purchase or otherwise acquire NMSU works of art. If any profit is accrued through the sale of an object, it shall be deposited into the NMSU Permanent Art Collections Account. 4. Respect to Artist : The de-accession of works will be accomplished in such a manner that it will not impugn the reputation of the artist or the artist's body of work. Should the de-accession of works by living artists be required, the feelings of the artist should be respected and whenever possible, the artist should be consulted regarding the de-accession of the work of art. 5. Documentation of De-accessioned Objects : Full record of all exchanges and sales will be maintained. Records of the Art Gallery shall document the de-accession process and the final destination of the object. B. Museum Items : In the absence of a specific de-accession procedure for items in the University Museum, the above art de-accession procedure shall apply. The Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences is authorized to promulgate rules and procedures for the de-accession of museum items. PART 9: ART ACQUISITION FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS10/12 08/25/2020 12.50 - Art, Archives and Other CollectionsA. New law, at NMSA 1978, \u00a7 13-4A-1 et seq , known as the Art in Public Places Act, requires one percent of the amount appropriated for new construction or major renovation or $200,000, whichever is less, to be allocated for the acquisition and installation of works of art. New Mexico Arts, a division of the New Mexico Office of Cultural Affairs administers such acquisitions. Expenditures for works of art are required by law to be contracted for separately from all other items in the new construction of the public building. B. The state's guidelines include the involvement of a Local Selection Committee, consisting of members reflecting the cultural diversity of the community and with an interest in the project. The membership typically includes a representative from the users of the building, the owner representative or designee, an architect, an arts professional or community art representative, an artist not competing for the project, and up to two community or student representatives or a member of the Board of Regents. C. The university architect, the director of the Art Gallery, and the head of the Department of Art shall serve on all Local Selection Committees as position appointments, as long as permitted by applicable state regulations. The Local Selection Committee is responsible for selection of art for the identified public building, using the public selection process and adhering to the procedures developed by the New Mexico Arts division. Those procedures may be viewed at NMAC 4.12.11.2 through 11.16. PART 10: ADDITIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY'S ARCHIVES This subsection establishes a set of standard guidelines by which records proposed for addition to the NMSU archives collection will be appraised during the acquisition process. A. Ownership and Disposal Authority : The records of the official activities of the units and staff of NMSU are the property of the institution.

The provost is ultimately responsible for effective academic facilities management, including the authority to assign, to relieve from assignment and to reassign academic space as necessary. The provost delegates to the registrar and to the Space Committee for implementation. This rule applies throughout the NMSU System, unless a campus adopts an independent space utilization and scheduling rule, which will be attached as an Appendix to this rule. This policy sets forth the process used to assign academic space for academic activities; for use of NMSU space for non-academic activities, See ARP 12.70 -Use of NMSU Facilities. PART 2: DEFINITIONS A.Course : A credit-bearing curricular offering of instruction, as approved by the University Curriculum Committee (UCC). B.Class : The period of time during which students meet to pursue a course. Classes are scheduled to meet in classrooms unless designated as online in accordance with ARP 4.69. Courses may be offered in multiple sections. 1/7 08/25/2020 12.71 - Academic Facility Space Utilization and SchedulingC. Event : any meeting, programming or function that is not a course. D. Centrally Assigned Spaces : University spaces scheduled by the academic scheduling staff in the Office of University Student Records. The official record of all assignable space resides in the approved scheduling software system. E. Departmentally Assigned Spaces : University spaces scheduled by assigned departmental staff. The official record of all assignable space resides in the Scheduling software system. F. Prime time : is Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. G. Space Utilization Ratios : This ratio is the course specific fill rate calculated as average class enrollments divided by average class enrollment capacity. Balanced course ratios are between 70% and 95% with the goal being 85%. PART 3: SCHEDULING GUIDELINES A. Centrally Scheduled Classroom Priority : 1. First priority for scheduling centrally assigned space is given to courses. Class meeting times must be scheduled using standard time blocks as defined in section B, below. Classrooms are assigned so as to best match room capacity with class enrollment. Course capacity should be a function of instructional design and pedagogy and should rarely be set at zero (0) or a particular room size. 2. Second priority for scheduling centrally assigned space is given to events, after all courses and related instructional activities have been scheduled in any given academic term. 2/7 08/25/2020 12.71 - Academic Facility Space Utilization and SchedulingB. Standard Time Blocks : To ensure ease of access for students who are having to build a schedule of classes with the least amount of conflict, and efficient utilization of classroom space on all days of the week, standard time blocks have been established. Regular-session class meetings with standard time patterns are scheduled before class meetings with non- standard time patterns. Classes meeting on a non-standard pattern must be scheduled outside of prime time. Requests for classes to be scheduled outside the standard time blocks during prime time must be approved by the college dean and the Associate Dean's Academic Council (ADAC). If approved the section will be assigned room space after all classes using the standard time block have been assigned space. Standard time blocks are determined by the Associate Deans Academic Council and maintained by the Registrar. See https://records.nmsu.edu/. Classes that have not been assigned a classroom are published in the Schedule of Classes with a TBA announcement until a classroom and time can be assigned. All class schedule information is entered into the Student Information System to capture and reflect accurate course, faculty and space related information. C. Minimum Class Size : Course thresholds are set at 10 or more for undergraduate courses and 5 or more for graduate courses. Deans have the authority to set higher thresholds for courses offered by their college. D. Prime Time : Prime time is Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Classes with non-standard patterns are to be scheduled before 8:30 a.m. or after 2:30 p.m. Classes using a one-day-only pattern and meeting for more than standard duration (e.g., three hour seminars) should be scheduled outside of prime time. Requests for classes to be scheduled outside the standard time blocks during prime time must be approved by the college dean and the Associate Dean's Academic Council (ADAC). If approved the section will be assigned room space after all classes using the standard time block have been assigned space. 3/7 08/25/2020 12.71 - Academic Facility Space Utilization and SchedulingE. Scheduling Priority : 1. Classes scheduled within standard meeting times will receive first priority in classroom scheduling. Classes scheduled outside of the standard meeting times will be assigned classroom space after those classes scheduled during standard times. Where an academic unit has departmental space assignment responsibility, that unit will be given preferential scheduling within those spaces. 2. Initial classrooms assignments are made based on pedagogical requirements and projected enrollment being equal to or greater than 85% of the room capacity. Past enrollments in comparable semesters will be considered. Classes with specialized pedagogical design are given appropriate consideration. Classes that don't meet 85% of room capacity may be moved to a smaller room with equivalent media, if available. Classes scheduled after scheduling deadlines have passed are assigned classrooms on a space-available basis. F. Course Capacities : When scheduling course meetings, it is expected that accurate course capacities be included. Inaccurate course capacities negatively impacts space utilization analytics and skew predictive scheduling analytics. Course capacity should be a function of instructional design and pedagogy and should rarely be set at zero (0) or a particular room size. No instructor or department may allow the occupancy of a classroom to exceed the limit specified by fire safety codes. The classroom capacity is fixed in the Student Information System and Scheduling Software System. It is the responsibility of the department and the instructor to ensure that actual attendance does not exceed classroom capacity. G. Room and Time Changes : Day and time changes are not allowed after students have begun to register for the term the class is being offered. Room changes are accommodated if a room is available. Departments/instructors should NOT continue to add students in the expectation that a larger room will be available. H. Class Cancellations : If a class is cancelled, the Office of University Student Records must be notified so the class can be cancelled in the Student Information System and the classroom can be returned to available status. It is the responsibility of the academic unit to notify enrolled students when a class has been cancelled.4/7 08/25/2020 12.71 - Academic Facility Space Utilization and SchedulingI. Instructor Assignments : When scheduling class meetings, instructor names must be entered in the Student Information System using the instructor's Aggie ID number. This ensures that the instructor's name will appear in the online Schedule of Classes, in other electronic applications such as online grading, and in faculty workload reports. J. Teaching Assistant Assignments : When scheduling class meetings, graduate teaching assistant (TA) names and Aggie ID numbers must be provided to the Office of University Student Records. This ensures that graduate teaching assistants receive appropriate credit for work performed and that Graduate School funding allocation reports are accurate. The TA's name will not appear in the online Schedule of Classes, unless the TA is also the instructor of record for the section. K. Final Examinations : Final written examinations, not to exceed two hours duration, are given only at the times and places established and published by the Office of University Student Records. Final examinations are generally held in the same room as class meetings. However, by prior arrangement with the Office of University Student Records, common final examinations can be scheduled and extra room locations may be booked on a space available basis. Changes in classroom location must be arranged through the Office of University Student Records. Examination codes, times, and locations are provided by the University Student Records Office and in the Student Information System. L. Specialized Classroom Needs : Needs for a specialized facility, such as laboratory demonstrations and unique media needs, are considered and accommodated whenever possible. Media-equipped (SMART) classrooms are assigned on a space available basis. Departments needing a specific classroom should indicate these needs in the \"Notes\" section of the schedule proofs. However, standard time block and prime-time designation must be observed. M. Central Use of Departmentally Scheduled Rooms : Under prior agreement with the College Dean and/or Department Chair, departmental rooms may be scheduled by the Office of University Student Records. N. Maintenance and Development of Classroom Technology in Instructional Space : Centrally scheduled classroom space is maintained by central resources. These resources are coordinated by Facilities & Services in collaboration with Information and Communication Technologies and the Office of the Provost.5/7 08/25/2020 12.71 - Academic Facility Space Utilization and SchedulingO. Accommodation/Accessibility (American with Disabilities Act Compliance) : Arrangements can be made for the change of an academic classroom due to documented accommodation and/or accessibility issues. Changes of this nature should be handled by the Office of University Student Records. P. Use of Centrally Assigned Space for Non-Class Event Purposes : The Office of University Student Records will schedule centrally assigned space for events. However, class meetings always have priority. These requests are generally not processed until two weeks prior to the start of instruction of each term and are subject to change if space is needed for instructional activity Q. Construction / Renovation: During periods of construction/renovation or in the event of an emergency, the provost may authorize exceptions to scheduling policies and require the use of departmentally assigned rooms to meet class needs. R. Change of the purpose of Classrooms : All classrooms are centrally assigned space by the registrar, unless authorized by the Office of the Provost for the exclusive use by a specific school, college or To change the designation of a classroom. See ARP 12.75 - Space UseManagement ; Change Request Procedures. 1. Request for a change in the purpose of a classroom space must be submitted to the University Space Committee by a Dean. 2. The request must fully explain and justify the requested change. 3. The request should be submitted 18 months in advance, to accommodate changes in scheduling of facilities. 4. The University Space Committee consults with the University Registrar, and others as appropriate, on the impact of the proposed change in designation or usage. 5. Any decision to change the designation of a classroom will be communicated, in writing, by the University Space Committee to the University Registrar and the Requestor. S. Conflict Resolution : In the event of conflicts, priority is given to class meetings which demonstrate the highest seat utilization based on current projections and census date enrollment for the last three terms the course was taught. Scheduling conflicts will be resolved by the Office of University Student Records in consultation with the course associate academic dean. Space utilization and pedagogical issues are factors that influence decisions.

Most routine maintenance services to I&G space are provided without charge by Facilities and Services, while as a general rule, non-routine maintenance activities are charged back to the customer. Services paid for by the NMSU entity that occupies the space are called billable services. Upon request, Facilities and Services will provide estimates for billable work. All services rendered in support of non-I & G buildings are billable. Services rendered in support of I & G buildings may or may not be billable, depending on the type of service. Facilities and Services publishes a detailed schedule of those services that are provided as well as a schedule of billable services. Each year the State of New Mexico allocates funds to be used for the renovation, repair, and remodeling of I & G buildings and infrastructures at the university (BRR funds). PART 2: COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OTHER NMSU PROPERTIES Facilities and Services provides maintenance and minor modification support, on a reimbursable basis, to any community college or off-campus site.

Pooling of Investments and Monthly Accrual of Earnings: Except as noted below, the investments of the university (including amounts held in interest-bearing demand and time deposits) are pooled in order to determine a weighted average monthly interest earnings rate. In order to compute this rate, all such investment earnings are accrued monthly, including amortizing premiums and crediting discounts on short and long-term investments. B. Allocation of Monthly Interest Earnings: The monthly earnings on these pooled investments are allocated to various university accounts in accordance with externally mandated requirements (e.g., bond resolutions) and other internal designations. Nothing herein shall prohibit separation of bond proceeds, reserve funds, or other non- discretionary funds from the pooled investment fund. The SVPAF approves all such internal designations. The allocation is based upon the monthly cash balance in each of these university funds, with the remaining balance of the pooled earnings being allocated to the unrestricted current fund. C. Percentage of Cash Balance Invested; Discretion of SVPAF: Under this method, all of these designated university funds (other than the current unrestricted fund) will be presumed to have 100% of their cash balances invested in the pooled investment account, unless the SVPAF determines that lesser percentage is to be utilized for a given fund.

B. Verify Primary Disclosure at Key Times . NMSU's Preliminary and final Official Statement must not contain any untrue statement of material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The SVPAF or designee must verify the accuracy of its primary disclosure not only during drafting and review, but also at the time of (i) posting or mailing the Preliminary Official Statement, (ii) pricing of NMSU's bonds or loans, and (iii) at the time of closing of the transaction.

The university recognizes and encourages the efforts of campus groups in this regard, but also recognizes the necessity to establish guidelines which aid in coordinating these activities to avoid conflicts, duplication, violation of laws or regulations, or activities which reflect negatively on the university . This Rule applies to fund-raising/Solicitation of individuals and business firms by Student Organizations, departments, and agencies of the university as well as other groups which are affiliates of the university. It does not pertain to proposals for research support addressed to government agencies supporting research that are covered by existing university policies and procedures. A.

Proposals shall include the purpose, budget plan, amount sought, prospective donor or donors, and a time schedule for the activity. B. Fund-raising activity proposals from recognized Student Organizations will be initiated with the director of campus activities by completing an Activity Registration Form. 10/18/2021 14.92 - Sales and Solicitation1 1 / 1 2C.

J. On- campus fund-raising involving the sale of merchandise or services must receive the prior approval of the director of campus activities in order to avoid contractual, operational, or jurisdictional conflicts. K. Expectations: It is expected that all fund-raising events held on or off campus will be conducted in a manner which reflects positively on the sponsor and the university. While it is recognized that the type of activities will vary greatly, event sponsors are urged to avoid telephone Solicitation, door-to-door sales or Solicitations, and direct collections at civic or service organization meetings off campus. These methods are often over-used and may be counterproductive. Caution is also advised in the repetitious Solicitation of businesses or prominent citizens for the same reason.

( See Part 3. B. below )2/9 08/25/2020 15.41 - Data ClassificationJ. Public Data: Data that does not fall into the Internal Data, Regulated Data or Controlled Data types. ( See Part 3. A. below ) K. Regulated Data: Data regulated by law or contract that is not Controlled Data, and if exposed to unauthorized parties, poses a risk of harm to third parties or risk of harm to NMSU interests (e.g. reputational) or exposes the university to potential liability. ( See Part 3. C. below ) PART 3: DATA CLASSIFICATION RULES Institutional Data falls into one of four distinct categories: 1) Public Data; 2) Internal Data; 3) Regulated Data; and 4) Controlled Data. These four Data Categories represent the best foundational structure to manage and protect all Institutional Data. A. Category 1- Public Data: Public Data is considered to be any data that does not fall into the Internal Data, Regulated Data or Controlled Data types. The disclosure of Public Data does not pose a risk to the institution. Public Data may be publicly accessible but does not require public access. Data integrity is the basic safeguard for which the University is responsible to ensure data is not modified. There are no restrictions on the storage or distribution of Public Data. Standards and operational protocols relating to the safeguards, handling, sharing and disposal requirements for Public Data are posted at https://datagovernance.nmsu.edu. Examples of Public Data include: 1. 1. Public Web Sites 2. Marketing Materials 3. Business Addresses 4. Salary Information 3/9 08/25/2020 15.41 - Data ClassificationA. Category 2: Internal Data : Internal Data is Data not protected by state or federal law or regulatory standards, but which if disclosed may pose a reputational risk or result in a civil action against the institution. Access to Internal Data should be limited to Trustees, Data Stewards and NMSU employee(s) with a business need. The exposure threshold for this classification of data is set at 750 records. Standards and operational protocols relating to the safeguards, handling, sharing and disposal requirements for Internal Data are posted at https://datagovernance.nmsu.edu. Examples of Internal Data include: 1. 1. Account Credentials 2. Budget Information 3. Unclassified Research and Manuscripts 4. Payroll and Employment Documentation 5. Systems & Network Diagrams 6. Strategic Information Unique to NMSU A. Category 3: Regulated Data : Regulated Data is Data that is not Controlled Data and is regulated by law or contract or, if exposed to unauthorized parties, poses a risk of harm to third parties or risk of harm to NMSU interests (e.g. reputational) or exposes the university to potential liability. The threshold for exposure of this category of data is set at one record and the exposure of 500 records of Health Information requires notification to the media. Associated protected personally identifying data elements (e.g. name, date of birth, email address, telephone number, mother's maiden name, employment history) that reasonably could identify an individual when used in combination with Internal Data elements, may be treated as Regulated Data. When assessing data, each data set must be analyzed to determine if any given combination poses a risk. Additional standards and operational protocols relating to the safeguards, handling, sharing and disposal requirements for Regulated Data are posted at https://datagovernance.nmsu.edu. Examples of Regulated Data include: 4/9 08/25/2020 15.41 - Data Classification1. 1. Social Security 2. Driver's License ID Number 3. Passport ID Number 4. Tax ID Number 5. Health Information 6. Class Schedules 7. Course History 8. Academic Actions 9. Grades, GPA and Transcripts 10. Payment Card Data 11. Bank Account numbers A. Category 4: Controlled Data: Controlled Data is specifically categorized by federal statute, executive order, or regulation as important to the nation's interest or government operations, or Data categorized as proprietary through grant, contract or non-disclosure agreements. Data access and handling requirements are restricted to those with a need-to-know, with appropriate adherence to applicable law and interpreting regulations, grant or contract provisions and university policies, standards and operational guidelines. Unauthorized disclosure of this information could have a serious adverse impact on the country, university, individuals or affiliates. Consultation and approval from Research Administration and IT security teams is required prior to holding or processing this type of Data. Additional approvals from other university authorities may also be required. Regulations, laws and standards that affect data in Category 4 include, but are not limited to, the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.), the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR 730 et seq.) and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). Controlled Unclassified Information (Executive Order 13556). Safeguards, handling, sharing and disposal requirements for Controlled data are codified in the Controlled data processing standards. Standards and operational protocols relating to the safeguards, handling, sharing and disposal requirements for Controlled Data are posted at https://datagovernance.nmsu.edu. Examples of Controlled Data include: 5/9 08/25/2020 15.41 - Data Classification1. 1. Export Controlled Data: Information or technology deemed to be sensitive to national security or economic interests and subject to federal export control regulations as promulgated by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. Export Controlled Data may be subject to restrictions that exceed the requirements for Category 4 data. 2. National Security Interest (NSI) : NSI data has been classified by a third party as having the potential to impact national security. Individuals managing or accessing NSI data must comply with all Level 4 requirements, National Security Decision Directives, any other applicable Federal Government directives and all information security procedures specified by the source agency. 3. Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) : Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with applicable law, regulations, and government-wide policies but is not classified for national security purposes under Executive Order 13526. Data that is identified as CUI in a contract or agreement is subject to the security requirements in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, \"Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations.\" Personnel receiving or generating CUI should work with the appropriate NMSU official such as Research IT, Chief Privacy Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, or Export Control Manager to ensure compliance with grant or contract information security requirements. 4. Classified Information : Classified Information is information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with applicable law, regulations, and government-wide policies for national security purposes. The NMSU Facility Security Officer (FSO) is the official authorized to receive classified information on behalf of NMSU to ensure its proper safeguarding. PART 4: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES6/9 08/25/2020 15.41 - Data ClassificationA. Issuance of Standards and Operational Protocols: Consistent with guidance from the Data Governance Board, the Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Privacy and IT Compliance Officer, in collaboration with the Data Trustees and Data Stewards, and in coordination with the university's Chief Information Officer (CIO) are charged with issuance and publication of the university's classification standards and operational protocols. In the development of these standards and operational protocols for each Data Category, they will refer to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications on securing technology as guidance. 1. Each Data Category will have a corresponding set of standards and operational protocols establishing the appropriate data security and compliance requirements and procedures, and prescribing specific controls and safeguards that reflect the data protection requirements of the institution. 2. Each Data Category standard must provide a defined methodology by which the Data Trustees and others as appropriate will assess the level of risk presented by the Data to determine the probability and extent of harm that would occur should the Data be lost, stolen, or accessed by unauthorized parties. At a minimum, it should take into account the data sensitivity, value, criticality and provisions of applicable governing regulation(s). 3. Each Data Category standard must, at a minimum, designate departmental responsibilities for implementing appropriate training and managerial, operational, physical, and technical controls for access to, use of, transmission of, and disposal of Data in compliance with this, related policies, and applicable governing regulation(s). 4. Each Data Category must contain defined clear thresholds that constitute a data breach as well as breach and incident response requirements if any, based on the circumstances of the data exposure. Data exposure below defined breach thresholds, while a security incident and a concern, may not constitute a violation of this rule. B. Application of the Standards and Operational Protocols: Once Data is created or acquired by the university, each Data Steward is responsible for assigning Data into the appropriate Data Category. The Data Steward may change the assigned Data Category based on regulatory and institutional requirements.7/9 08/25/2020 15.41 - Data ClassificationC. Shared Data Stewardship: Data with shared stewardship responsibility requires joint classification by the responsible Data Stewards. Data classification impasses will be resolved by the responsible Data Trustees and ultimately the chancellor with input from the relevant Data officials, Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Privacy and IT Compliance Officer. D. Protection of Data Pending Classification : Data not yet classified into a Data Category must be secured in accordance with the stricter standard until determined by the relevant Data Steward(s). PART 5: PERIODIC MONITORING AND REVIEW To promote adherence to this rule by all NMSU entities, NMSU may take reasonable and necessary action to assess Data security and to monitor compliance efforts. The Offices of the Chancellor, IT Privacy and Compliance or the Chief Information Officer may authorize NMSU staff or consultants to utilize IT auditing technologies to scan IT systems, including the NMSU network, servers, databases, applications, cloud storage, and other computing devices. This provision does not limit nor affect the authority of the university's Office of Audit Services to conduct independent internal audits. A. The IT auditing technologies to be used may include programs and utilities that allow for programmatic inspection of Data access, security, use, modification, maintenance and disclosure permissions. B. The results from automated scans may be centrally correlated for analysis in a secure environment. These technologies are not to be used to read the full context of the Data, but rather to match established Data use patterns. C. Information gathered through periodic auditing will maintained confidentially, to the extent permitted by law.

When feasible, the NMSU Police Department will collaborate with other involved departments (e.g. OIE) to evaluate the facts and context necessary to determine the need, if any, to issue a Timely Warning or other Emergency Notification for the protection of the university community, consistent with the department's operational guidance developed with the concurrence of the Clery Act Compliance Advisory Committee. PART 10: EVACUATION OF FACILITIES In an emergency, the incident commander ( ARP 16.01; ARP 16.10 ) will order the evacuation of any facility deemed appropriate in order to protect life. NMSU faculty, staff, and students are expected to evacuate facilities as indicated by building alarms, subject to pursuit of a reasonably prudent alternative necessary to protect themselves in the face of more imminent danger. PART 11: MONITORING OFF CAMPUS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY 6/9 08/25/2020 16.12 - Clery Act ComplianceA. NMSU does not routinely monitor criminal activity or law enforcement actions taking place outside NMSU Clery Geography. Individuals interested in finding out about off campus crime should contact the appropriate law enforcement agency with jurisdiction. B. Once each year, the NMSU Police Department will request law enforcement statistics for Clery Crimes from those outside law enforcement agencies/departments with jurisdiction over some or all of the university's Clery Geography, including but not limited to off campus properties owned or controlled by chartered student organization. The statistics provided by these outside law enforcement agencies/departments will be included in appropriate campus' Annual Security Report. PART 12: CLERY MONITORING, CRIME LOG, AND ANNUAL SECURITY REPORT A. Monitoring for Clery Compliance : On behalf of NMSU, the Police Department monitors the NMSU system entities for compliance with the Clery Act and related university policies. Policy infractions or inconsistencies in reporting will result in required training. Lack of cooperation, and repeated or flagrant violations, will be reported to the relevant campus president, for internal investigation in conjunction with Human Resource Services - Employee and Labor Relations, and may subject the responsible official to disciplinary corrective action. 7/9 08/25/2020 16.12 - Clery Act ComplianceB. Maintenance of Crime Log and Clery Crime Statistics : 1. The NMSU Police Department, and each community college with a designated security officer will maintain a public log of all criminal incidents and alleged criminal incidents reported to them. a. The log will include the nature, date, time and general location of each crime and disposition of the complainant (within the past 60 days), if known. b. Information must be readily available within two business days from date of request. c. Crime logs must be maintained for seven years, and for at least three years following the publication of the most recent amendment of any annual security report.

B. Provides mutual aid assistance to City of Las Cruces and Do\u00f1a Ana County's 15 fire districts. C. Provides EMS services at special events conducted on campus or at the request of an NMSU entity. 1/5 08/25/2020 16.15 - Fire Safety, Prevention and Emergency Medical ServicesD. DFES is also under the broader jurisdiction of the New Mexico State Fire Marshal's Office (FMO). The State of New Mexico has adopted the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standards. DFES is granted Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) from the New Mexico State FMO and is the authority in all matters dealing with fire safety for NMSU and NMSU-DACC. For other NMSU campuses and locations, the Authority Having Jurisdiction is the New Mexico State Fire Marshal, local county fire marshal or municipal fire department. E. As delegated from the New Mexico State Fire Marshal's Office, the NMSU Department of Fire and Emergency Services is the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) and performs the fire safety inspections as requested or as determined for facilities located on the NMSU-Las Cruces and NMSU-Do\u00f1a Ana Community College campuses. The inspections are conducted for the purposes of identifying and recommending corrective action to eliminate or reduce the potential for loss of life or property due to fire. The inspections are conducted utilizing State adopted National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes, with the International Building Code and International Fire Code as reference. F. NMSU Office of Environment Health and Safety is responsible for occupational fire safety and shares fire inspection duties with the NMSU Department of Fire and Emergency Services. PART 3: FIRE PREVENTION AND SAFETY, GENERALLY A. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), International Fire Code (IFC), International Building Code (IBC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards are the primary resources used in the development of the Fire Prevention Guidelines and Practices. Because the DFES is recognized as the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) in matters related to fire safety, interpretations and/or deviations may be allowed in some cases. Deviations will be evaluated and determined by DFES on a case-by-case basis. Specific issues not addressed in the Fire Prevention Guidelines and Practices may be referenced in one of the above standards, and will apply as determined by the DFES.2/5 08/25/2020 16.15 - Fire Safety, Prevention and Emergency Medical ServicesB. The Fire Prevention Guidelines and Practices is intended to facilitate the training of NMSU personnel and compliance by NMSU by restating some of the more fundamental requirements of the above referenced national and state standards and laws. Due to the risk of serious injury and/or death from fire or fire-related emergencies, students, employees, visitors and contractors shall comply with the Fire Prevention Guidelines and Practices . Any hazardous or emergency situation, even if only suspected, shall be reported to DFES. C. Fire Emergency Action and Evacuation . The NMSU Office of Environmental Health and Safety and the NMSU Fire Department shall coordinate regarding the requirements of the Fire Prevention Guidelines and Practices relating to general and specific fire evacuation plans for the protection of university students, employees, visitors and contractors from the hazards associated with a fire-related emergency which may occur on university property. Examples of fire- related emergencies that would require initiation of building evacuation include and are not limited to: 1. The smell of smoke (regardless of how small an amount), 2. The sight of smoke (regardless of how small an amount), 3. The smell of gas or other hazardous chemical, 4. Electrical equipment that is sparking, 5. Any fire, regardless of how small, even if it has already been extinguished. PART 4: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF NMSU ENTITIES A.

To heighten awareness and mutual concern for the welfare of all within the New Mexico State University (NMSU) system, which includes all campuses and work sites, and to encourage the reporting of observed Behaviors of Concern occurring in the classroom, on campus, in NMSU Housing, in the workplace, or at any other university location or sponsored event. B. To facilitate communication and coordination amongst university officials charged with maintaining a safe and secure environment for university Students, employees, and others, specifically with a focus on the avoidance of critical incidents caused by individual or group misconduct, through early detection and reporting, risk assessment and responsive action. C. To formally recognize and authorize the Conduct Assessment/Response, and Education (CARE) Committee and its subcommittee, the Behavioral Intervention Team, and to clarify their respective roles and responsibilities relative to the process by which the Behavior of Concern will be assessed for risk and determination of appropriate precautionary and/or follow up action. PART 2: SCOPE 1/11 08/25/2020 16.20 - Awareness, Assessment and Response to Behaviors of ConcernThis Rule applies throughout the NMSU system, at all university owned, controlled, or leased properties, as well as at off campus locations used for university sponsored events or activities. The Rule may also be applied, at the discretion of the Rule administrators on a case by case basis, in response to reported off-duty or off-campus conduct, depending upon the nature of the impact to university interests, including but not limited to, its Students and personnel. PART 3: RULE ADMINISTRATOR(S) The Dean of Students, NMSU Police Chief and Asst. VP for Human Resources, or their respective designees, shall administer this Rule as outlined herein; they may jointly approve any supplemental operational protocols to facilitate implementation of this Rule. The Rule administrators work closely with the Conduct Assessment/Response and Education (CARE) Committee, its subcommittee, the Behavioral Intervention Team and designated police personnel, as appropriate for each case. All NMSU supervisors shall assist, as may be requested by the primary Rule administrators, with University Community education necessary to implement this Rule. PART 4: DEFINITIONS For purposes of the administration of this Rule and corresponding procedural guidelines, the following definitions apply: A. \"Behavior of Concern\": Behavior of Concern is any behavior, including verbal, physical, written or expressed via electronic media or other mode of communication, that reasonably causes someone to be concerned about: 1. the health, safety, or welfare of the individual exhibiting the behavior; 2. the health, safety or welfare of any other individual(s) or property, or disruption in the classroom, program, or other academic or work environment.2/11 08/25/2020 16.20 - Awareness, Assessment and Response to Behaviors of ConcernB. \"Campus Resident\": Any person who lives in university housing; such individual may or may not meet the definition of \"Student\". C. \"Student\": Any person enrolled in any course or program at New Mexico State University, which includes all NMSU campuses and work sites. D. \"University Community\": The University Community includes Students, faculty, staff, Campus Residents, contractors and other vendors, volunteers, and visitors to campus. E. \"University Facility\": Any campus, college, center, building, open space or other facility or area owned by, or operated under the control of, New Mexico State University. F. \"Violence\": Violence includes, but is not limited to: murder, sexual assault, robbery assault; battery; harassing or intimidating behavior that creates a reasonable fear of harm; stalking; and/or, threats of violence made in any medium (verbal, electronic, telephonic, written, gestures, etc). It also includes all incidents of hate crimes, dating violence, and domestic violence. PART 5: GENERAL PRINCIPLES A. Early Reporting and Intervention : While potential incidents of Violence are at the forefront of concern, this Rule is intended to address individual behaviors that may be, or may become, a disruption to the environment, whether classroom, office, housing or other University Facility. Outreach at an early stage is desirable to prevent Violence in some instances, and to retain an employee or Student in more instances. This Rule is therefore designed to encourage the reporting of Behaviors of Concern before they lead to Violence or other serious harm. In the unfortunate event that a critical incident should occur, administrators are not relieved of their duties under other policies and protocols (e.g. emergency notification and response; support to victims of Violence; internal and/or police investigation into alleged misconduct; and Student/employee disciplinary action and/or punitive consequences, including arrest). 1. Any person, including university employees and Students, who observes Behavior of Concern is encouraged to submit a report under this Rule.3/11 08/25/2020 16.20 - Awareness, Assessment and Response to Behaviors of Concern2. Persons who in good faith submit a report or take other action authorized by this Rule shall not be subjected to adverse action for having done so. 3. It is acknowledged that some individuals may be both Student and employee; in those situations, action will be taken in the best interest of the individual and the institution, and may include administrative action under either Student policies/procedures or employee policies/procedures, or both. 4. As part of a larger and institution-wide commitment to a secure campus and workplace environment, the university is committed to the development of preventive measures. In addition to the work of the CARE Committee, the Behavioral Intervention Team and/or NMSU Police Chief and/or designee; other examples include: pre-employment screening, employee assistance program, Student support services, and other outreach and educational initiatives. 5. The university's Office of Employee and Labor Relations- Employee and Labor Relations provides collaborative problem- solving assistance to supervisors and employees in the area of conflict resolution in an attempt to address and diffuse tensions caused by interpersonal disputes or other reasons, before disputes in the workplace reach a level at which Violence may erupt. 6. Individuals found to have intentionally and maliciously submitted a false report may be subject to appropriate administrative, civil or criminal action. B. Retaliation Prohibited: Individuals who are found to have retaliated against any individual reporting or taking other action under this Rule, including encouraging or assisting another to report Behavior of Concern, may be subject to administrative, civil or criminal action as may be appropriate under the circumstances. C. Establishment of the CARE Committee : To facilitate implementation and administration of this Rule, the Board of Regents formally recognizes and authorizes the Conduct Assessment/Response, and Education (CARE) Committee as a standing university board, along with its subcommittee, the Behavioral Intervention Team. See Official Listof University Boards . D. Role of the CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team: The CARE Committee and Behavioral Intervention Team assess and coordinate response to reported Behaviors of Concern that do not pose an immediate threat of personal harm (to self or others), nor to 4/11 08/25/2020 16.20 - Awareness, Assessment and Response to Behaviors of Concernproperty. These committees have been established in part to facilitate the assembly of information from the distinct NMSU entities that may be privy to relevant information, in order to assist with the assessment for risk of harm. The CARE Committee defers to the Behavioral Intervention Team and other qualified professionals the decision making regarding the nature and type of appropriate responsive action. 1. The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team do not provide counseling or medical advice or services, but each may act to refer individuals to such internal or external resources, especially in situations involving victims of Violence. 2. The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team are not responsible for responding to campus emergencies. Emergency response is performed by the appropriate public safety entities (e.g. police or fire), with consequence management (continuity of operations and disaster recovery) addressed by the Central Administration Response Team (\"CART\"), consisting of university executive administrators (See ARP 16.10 EmergencyPreparedness and Response ) However, the CART or other public safety professional may request information or assistance from either the CARE Committee or the Behavioral Intervention Team as needed when responding to or managing an emergency. This provision is not intended to affect or otherwise limit the authority of the individual members of the Behavioral Intervention Team to act in their professional capacity, or to take emergency medical action as permitted by state law. 3. The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team will work with other university offices and resources to publicize, throughout the NMSU system, the purpose and functions of the committee and the protocols in place for reporting Behavior of Concern, including new employee and new Student orientation at all campuses. 4. The members of the CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team are authorized to obtain information pertaining to a matter pending review by the committee or team about individuals from supervisors of the NMSU entities and from Students for relevant information; supervisors and Students shall respond cooperatively and timely to such requests, for the benefit of the person involved as well as for that of the institution.5/11 08/25/2020 16.20 - Awareness, Assessment and Response to Behaviors of Concern5. The Office of General Counsel provides legal counsel to the CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team, and is included in their meetings as an ex officio member. 6. All members of, as well as individuals involved with, proceedings of the CARE Committee or the Behavioral Intervention Team shall maintain confidentiality at all times as required by law, including professional licensing standards regulated by the State of New Mexico. PART 6: PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES AND FLOWCHART As authorized by RPM 1.10 and former ARP 16.20 , Section F ., the following guidelines issued on April 13, 2013 supplement this Rule. See Also CARE Team . A. Review Procedures for Reported Behavior of Concern The following are the essential procedures for the reporting, initial review of reports; fact gathering; assessment of risk by professionals; and action taken in response relating to reported Behaviors of Concern. See Also the corresponding Flowchart for an overview of the process. 1. Report by Member of University Community: Members of the University Community report Behaviors of Concern that they may observe through the Office of the Dean of Students website, \"Worried About Someone?\" located at deanofstudents.nmsu.edu, or by phone to 575-646-1722, or at the on-line reporting at concernreport@nmsu.edu. If the Behavior of Concern also constitutes a crime, or more importantly, poses a potential for imminent harm to a person or property, the individual reporting the behavior should call 911 directly. B. Receipt of Report/Initial Review 6/11 08/25/2020 16.20 - Awareness, Assessment and Response to Behaviors of Concern1. Reports of Behavior of Concern shall be reviewed daily by the appropriate rule administrator: a. For Student Behavior of Concern, the Dean of Students or designee; b. For employee Behavior of Concern, the Asst. VP for Human Resources; c. For volunteer, vendor, visitor or other third party Behavior of Concern, the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee. 2. The appropriate rule administrator shall provide an abbreviated review based upon the limited facts in the report and: a. If there appears to be imminent risk of harm to self or others, the matter shall be referred to the NMSU Emergency Dispatch, for appropriate medical or law enforcement response; b. If there appears to be an immediate need, but no risk of harm, the matter shall be referred to the Behavioral Intervention Team for expedited fact gathering, assessment for risk, and responsive action. c. If there appears to be no immediate need for either administrative, law enforcement or medical attention, the matter shall be referred to the next meeting of the CARE Committee. 3. Fact Gathering: Absent an active emergency, it is the role of the CARE Committee, the Behavioral Intervention Team and the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee to seek additional information which may be known by other areas within the university and surrounding areas, and to share with all involved as appropriate, in order to best assess the Behavior of Concern and determine the level of risk of harm presented, if any. Additionally, they may, but are not obligated to, contact the individual's emergency contact listed in the NMSU Emergency Notification System to obtain additional information from family or friends that may be familiar with the individual whose behavior has been reported. The CARE Committee and the Behavioral Intervention Team members also will expedite the provision of available information to the designated NMSU Police personnel, as may be requested during emergent circumstances that arise from Behavior of Concern by a Student or employee.7/11 08/25/2020 16.20 - Awareness, Assessment and Response to Behaviors of Concern4. Risk Assessment and Case Assignment: The following evaluation classifications, identified by Deisginger and Randazzo , as adapted in this rule are used to assess any risk of harm that a Behavior of Concern may present. Cases may be assessed and re-assessed dependent upon the circumstances of each case, and as each develops. a. EXTREME RISK (Level 1): Appears to pose an immediate threat of Violence or self-harm. REQUIRES immediate containment, law enforcement or emergency medication, target protection, and/or a Threat Management Plan . Matters assessed at Level 1 will be assigned to the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee to coordinate law enforcement action and/or emergency medical assistance. The NMSU Police Chief and/or designee will take the lead in coordinating all Risk Level 1 Threat Management Plans. b. HIGH RISK (Level 2): Appears to pose a threat of Violence or self- harm but lacks immediacy or specific plan. REQUIRES a Responsive Action Plan . Matters assessed at Level 2 will be assigned to the Behavioral Intervention Team, for development of a Responsive Action Plan, which will be implemented and monitored by the Behavioral Intervention Team, in conjunction with the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee. c. MODERATE RISK (Level 3): Does not appear to pose a threat of Violence or self-harm at this time, but exhibits behaviors or circumstances that are likely to be disruptive to the community. REQUIRES active monitoring and referrals . Matters assessed at Level 3 will be assigned to the Behavioral Intervention Team, for development of a Responsive Action Plan, which will be implemented and monitored by the Behavioral Intervention Team, with assistance from the CARE Committee or the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee, as may be requested. d. LOW RISK (Level 4): Does not appear to pose a threat of Violence or self-harm at this time, nor is a significant disruption to the community expected. REQUIRES passive monitoring and referrals as appropriate . Matters assessed at Level 4 will be referred to the CARE Committee to develop a Responsive Action Plan. e. NO IDENTIFIED RISK (Level 5): Does not appear to pose a threat of Violence or self-harm at this time, nor is the person a significant disruption to the community expected. No monitoring is required. Matters assessed at Level 5 will be referred to the CARE Committee to open a file and store the information for future reference.8/11 08/25/2020 16.20 - Awareness, Assessment and Response to Behaviors of Concern5. Case Worker Responsibilities: For each Responsive Action Plan, a single case worker will be identified by the Behavioral Intervention Team or the CARE Committee as the primary contact for communications and documentation. a. The case worker shall lead and/or coordinate implementation of the plan, which shall be reviewed on a regular basis to determine effectiveness, and whether or not plan modifications are necessary. b. In the event that an individual's behavior results in arrest for criminal misconduct or hospitalization for a condition that contributed to the Behavior of Concern, the role of the case worker is to monitor the status and to work as closely as the individual will permit regarding their release and the individual's plans to return to the work or academic environment. c. The case worker will be responsible for documenting and reporting progress implementing the responsive action plan, as well any new developments, to the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee, to the Behavioral Intervention Team or CARE Committee, or chair, as appropriate. d. The Chair of the CARE Committee or the Behavioral Intervention Team will coordinate with affected faculty, staff or Students as needed, while also respecting the involved individual's wishes regarding privacy and confidentiality; when exigent circumstances exist, the law will be followed and proper documentation will be maintained. 6. Police Communication: Upon successful execution of a Threat Management Plan, the matter will be appropriately referred by the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee to the CARE Committee or the Behavioral Intervention Team for re-assessment of the risk level. 9/11 08/25/2020 16.20 - Awareness, Assessment and Response to Behaviors of Concern7. File Closure: A matter will be closed if evaluated as a level 5, and there is no further development changing that status for six months. a. A Threat Management Plan, or a Responsive Action Plan, may be modified or continued for as long as the NMSU Police Chief and/or designee or Behavioral Intervention Team decides is appropriate, and during which time the matter will remain open and pending periodic review and reporting to CARE Committee by the case worker. b. If the risk assessment indicated no need for either a Threat Assessment Plan nor for a Responsive Action Plan, the matter will remain open for a period of six months; if there are no subsequent developments during that time, the file will be closed and stored in the office of the appropriate rule administrator. c. All matter assessed or re-assessed as Level 5 will remain open for six months and if there are no subsequent developments during that time, the file will be closed and stored in the office of the appropriate rule administrator. 8. Documentation and Custodian(s) of Records: The chair of the CARE Committee and the chair of the Behavioral Intervention Team will work with the assigned case workers to ensure that proper documentation is prepared and maintained. a. The official custodian of the CARE Committee's records, including meeting notes and Level 4 and 5 cases assigned to case workers, is the Dean of Students. b. The official custodian of the Behavioral Intervention Team records, including and limited to Level 2 and 3 cases assigned to case workers, is the appropriate rule administrator for the type of individual (e.g. Student, employee or third party visitor). c. The official custodian of Level 1 Threat Management Plans and related records, and all other criminal records which might relate to cases assessed at any risk level pursuant to this rule, is the NMSU Chief of Police and/or designee. 9. Retention of Records: The documentation related to reported cases, responsive action plans (if created), and/or any administrative action taken as a result of reported or observed Behavior of Concern will be maintained for ten years following file closure, in the office of the appropriate record custodian, unless New Mexico or federal law require retention for a longer period.

It ratifies and supplements the pandemic action plan containing COVID-19 informational updates and conditions of employment relating to maintenance of a safe academic and work environment during the COVID-19 extended pandemic, published and regularly updated athttps://now.nmsu.edu/index.html. The COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols published at that site may also be referred to as the Implementing Standards and Guidelines associated with this rule. 3.Expedited Incident Response : This rule provides an expedited incident response for employees and V isitors, including an alternate administrative/disciplinary process that will apply in cases involving employees and Visitors alleged to have violated NMSU's COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols.

(ARP 5.20 - 5.26, Student Social Code of Conduct) PART 2: SUMMARY 10/18/2021 16.32 COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) - Amended 2 / 1 01. Rationale: As a general rule, members of the NMSU Community (See Definition at 3.4) are obligated to follow NMSU policies, rules and procedures. For employees, this is a condition of continuing employment. For students, it is a condition upon admission. For Visitors, it may become a condition of continuing access to campus. In the event of a policy or rule violation, administrative action may be taken in accordance with this rule commensurate with the seriousness of the violation; if criminal sanctions also apply, that is outside the scope of this rule. This rule is needed to address violations of health and safety protocols enacted during the global pandemic declared for COVID-19 that if not addressed swiftly, will fail to protect the NMSU Community from exposure to persons potentially carrying COVID-19 or one of its variants. 2. Expectations Relating to COVID-19 Safety Protocols: This rule provides the NMSU Community with the expectations for compliance with NMSU' s COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols. It also provides guidance in the event of perceived or reported non-compliance. Some of the health and Safety protocols will be mentioned generally herein, but the official source for current requirements is https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html, which centralizes the information being distributed regarding NMSU's pandemic action plan for the prevention of and protection from exposure to the risks presented by COVID-19. All members of the NMSU Community are required to read and abide by these. Other violations which might also be addressed pursuant to this rule are those that relate directly to the creation of a public health and safety risk of potential exposure to COVID-19, such as falsification of documents (e.g., vaccination, test results or other health records) or willful disregard of a supervisor's directives enforcing NMSU COVID-19 Safety Protocols. 3. Synopsis of Process for Alleged Public Health Safety Violations : This rule provides the exclusive process applicable in the event of alleged failure by employees and Visitors to abide by NMSU's COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols. If the facts support a finding of a violation, notice of these facts, along with the proposed administrative action, will be provided to the involved member of the NMSU Community to provide an opportunity for them to state their position and provide additional facts for consideration prior to administrative action being taken. After this factual review meeting, which may also be conducted through written submittals, a determination will be issued, which may be subject to appeal, as provided in Part 5. PART 3: DEFINITIONS 10/18/2021 16.32 COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) - Amended 3 / 1 01. COVID-19: A global pandemic that was declared as national emergency in March 2020, and now includes distinct emerging variants indicated to be equally or more contagious than COVID-19 by the federal Center for Disease Control and New Mexico Department of Health. 2. COVID-19 Symptoms: Fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath and sore throat. Refer to https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html for updates. 3. Direct Threat: A significant risk of substantial harm that cannot be reduced or eliminated by a Reasonable Accommodation. Whether or not someone poses a Direct Threat in the work or academic environment will be based on objective factual information, not subjective perceptions or irrational fears: 1. Duration of risk; 2. Nature and severity of the potential harm; 3. Likelihood that potential harm will occur; and 4. Imminence of the potential harm. 4. NMSU Community: NMSU officials, employees, students, as well as Visitors to campus. 5. NMSU COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols: The rules and procedures or other protocols posted at https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html pertaining to the prevention of or protection from COVID-19. 6. Reasonable Accommodation: A change in the work or academic environment that allows a person with a disability to have an equal opportunity to participate (apply for jobs, perform essential functions, enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment or academic programs and activities). 7. Visitor: A Visitor includes and is not limited to affiliates, contractors, vendors and the general public. PART 4: KEY POLICY STATEMENTS 10/18/2021 16.32 COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) - Amended 4 / 1 01. Research Based Informational Site with Instructions for Personal Conduct: NMSU is uniquely situated to have the most current access to research relating to various aspects of the COVID-19 global pandemic such as: testing, vaccinations, effectiveness, contact tracing, rates of infection, and emerging variants and re-infection. The NMSU System Chancellor has regularly issued COVID-19 emergency updates and directives (referred to in this rule as the NMSU's COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols), posted athttps://now.nmsu.edu/index.html. These protocols are based on pronouncements by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the New Mexico Governor and New Mexico Department of Health and the NMSU Board of Regents and the NMSU System Chancellor. In the event of a conflict between the requirements by these authorities relating to the work and academic environments, the NMSU guidance will govern. 2. Adherence to COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols a Condition of Employment: Unless subject to a Reasonable Accommodation consistent with COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols based on disability, serious medical condition or non-discrimination under Title VII (approved by OIE or SAS) or to an alternate work arrangement (approved by the employee' s supervisor and dean/vice president), members of the NMSU Community must adhere to the COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols published athttps://now.nmsu.edu/index.html, which apply to each member of the NMSU Community as a condition of employment, condition upon admission or condition required to conduct business with NMSU or for access to NMSU public facilities. 10/18/2021 16.32 COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) - Amended 5 / 1 03. Fundamental Principles : In addition to material posted at https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html, the following COVID-19 health and safety protocols apply in the context of COVID-19: 1. Members of the NMSU Community may be subject to additional COVID-19 protective measures adopted by individual departments, as approved by NMSU administration as advised by the CART (e.g., screening, attendance records for purposes of contact tracing) and reasonably related directives from a supervisor or employee in a position of authority (e.g., project managers, event organizers, faculty , all members of management and NMSU appointed officials). 2. Members of the NMSU Community must be honest in their dealings with the university and with those they interact with, including but not limited to: 1) when completing questionnaires or surveys from NMSU; 2) when experiencing COVID-19 Symptoms; 3) when self-isolating and 4) when seeking a Reasonable Accommodation from a required COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols. 3. As the NMSU COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols are updated, members of the NMSU Community must continue to review and follow them, unless subject to a Reasonable Accommodation. 4. Roles/Responsibilities of Supervisors and Employees in Position of Authority: All members of management including supervisors, lead employees and those in positions of authority who represent NMSU by virtue of their employment have a duty to inform, educate, and potentially warn, members of the NMSU community using the material posted athttps://now.nmsu.edu/index.html. The messaging should include that NMSU hopes to avoid having to take action to remove any person from campus, but in the face of a global pandemic such as this one, it is a necessary option in the interest of protecting the public's health and safety. Any NMSU representative invites, dares or otherwise encourages others to disregard or violate university policy, particularly in a classroom or other closed environment, is violating NMSU's COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols and putting people at risk. 10/18/2021 16.32 COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) - Amended 6 / 1 05. Reports of Violation; Assessment: Each reported violation will be assessed strictly on whether the facts support a violation of the COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols in effect at the time of the reported incident. The consequence for a violation will depend on the facts evaluated on a case-by- case basis and whether an unreasonable risk of harm, Direct Threat or actual harm was created through action or inaction. 1. Inadvertent, neglectful or other unintentional instances of noncompliance may be addressed with information and education and/or a warning from an appropriate NMSU representative, provided that no unreasonable risk of harm, Direct Threat or actual harm resulted. The administrative consequences for the same infraction may vary based on the nature of the public health risk created by the violation. For example, someone not wearing a mask inside a large conference room only occupied by one or two people would result in a less serious consequence than someone not wearing a mask inside a crowded restroom in between classes in an academic building. 2. Repeated infractions, even if not resulting in unreasonable risk of harm or Direct Threat or actual harm, will justify a more severe administrative consequence, including suspension without pay, demotion and involuntary termination (employees) or issuance of a No Trespass Directive (Visitors). 3. A deliberate refusal to abide by COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols, Direct Threat or actual harm increasing the risk to other members of the NMSU Community, and in turn affecting NMSU and the institution's obligations to protect the work and academic environments, will be addressed with more serious action, including suspension without pay, demotion and/or termination (employees) or issuance of a No Trespass Directive (Visitors), depending upon the actualities as they are determined on a case-by-case basis. 6. Non-Discrimination: New Mexico State University (NMSU) is dedicated to providing equal opportunities in our employment and learning environments. Decisions made pursuant to this rule will not discriminate on the basis of any protected category (age, ancestry, color, disability, gender identity, genetic information, national origin, race, religion, retaliation, serious medical condition, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, spousal af filiation, or protected veteran status in its programs and activities). 7. Amendment: As with any university policy or rule, the university administration reserves the right to amend it at any time. PART 5: KEY PROCESS ELEMENTS 10/18/2021 16.32 COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) - Amended 7 / 1 01. Violations of COVID 19 Health and Safety Protocols: Due the nature of the risk (spread of communicable infectious disease) and the need for swift action to maintain a safe campus, this rule authorizes an expedited, remote process by which the facts relating to violation of COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols will be heard and decided, including any proposed administrative action. This rule's expedited processes, based on failure to fulfill conditions of employment in violation of COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols, will be used in lieu of other faculty (ARP 10.50) or staf f (ARP 10.10) disciplinary processes. To the extent that consequences involve a loss of pay or job position, due process will be provided pursuant to this rule. Timelines will be reasonable and flexible, yet expedited so as to reduce or eliminate safety risks created by the violation(s). The factual review meeting also applies to Visitors to campus and the proposed administrative action will include the potential for issuance of a No Trespass Directive. 2. Factual Review Meeting When COVID19 Health and Safety Protocol violations are reported, the employee's supervisor in consultation with Employee & Labor Relations and/or the Office of the Provost (employees with faculty rank) as appropriate. For Visitors alleged to be in violation, the appropriate NMSU representative will gather the relevant facts and document them. If the facts confirm a violation, a notice will be issued outlining the facts, including witness statements if any, and the proposed administrative action, and set a date and time for a factual review meeting. The involved employee or Visitor will be given an opportunity to provide a written response and any additional facts or evidence they would like to be considered, if any, before a decision is made taking action. 10/18/2021 16.32 COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) - Amended 8 / 1 03. Decision: Once the factual review meeting is completed, a decision will be issued on behalf of NMSU explaining the factual basis/es and the policy or rule violation supporting the action to be taken. 1. For at will, non-faculty contract, non-regular (e.g., temporary, seasonal) and probationary employees, the decision following the factual review meeting will be final. 2. For decisions imposing an involuntary termination of employment, demotion or suspension without pay of a regular, non-probationary employee (above-listed types of employment excluded), the employee will be provided the opportunity to appeal. 3. In the event of an appeal, the effective date of the administrative action may be held in abeyance provided the employee agrees to use accrued leave the employee is entitled to be compensated for upon termination, or agrees to be placed on leave without pay status. 4. Non-faculty employees hired pursuant to an employment contract who may be found to have violated COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols via a factual review meeting will be subject to corrective action in accordance with their employment contract. 5. If a Visitor is found to have violated COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols via a factual review meeting and the outcome is issuance of a No Trespass Directive, the Visitor may seek any review indicated on the face of the No Trespass Directive. 10/18/2021 16.32 COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) - Amended 9 / 1 04. Appeal Hearing: By memo to the Director of Employee and Labor Relations (for non-faculty employees) or to the Associate Provost for Academic Af fairs (faculty employees), employees for whom the decision is not final (See 5.2 A. and B.) may request a de novo hearing before an appeal hearing panel. 1. The appeal hearing panel will typically be comprised of representatives from: Chancellor's Office; Human Resource Services (when involved party is non-faculty employee) or Academic Affairs (when involved party is faculty); Aggie Health and Wellness; Environmental Health and Safety & Risk Management and a faculty member informed on COVID+19. 2. The appeal hearing may be conducted through technological or electronic means. 3. The NMSU representative will present the facts which supported the administrative action taken, followed by the involved employee or Visitor presenting their position and any facts supportive of their defense to the factual findings or to the type of administrative action taken. Witnesses may be called, and the involved faculty or Visitor may elect to cross examine; legal counsel may participate. The hearing will be informal and conducted in a fair manner. 4. Any member of the appeal hearing panel may question either of the parties or any witness. 5. The appeal hearing panel may deliberate in closed session and will subsequently issue a final written decision on behalf of NMSU, based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, confirming or modifying the factual findings on whether or not NMSU COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols were violated, and upholding, modifying or reversing the administrative action. 5. Authorization of Rule Administrator Guidelines and Standards : The Responsible Administrator may issue and amend guidelines and standards corresponding to this rule, which will include incorporation by reference the COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols, posted athttps://now.nmsu.edu/index.html and may also include templates, factual review meeting process, appeal hearing process, FAQS or other illustrative documents.

Expectations Relating to COVID19 Safety Protocols: This rule provides the NMSU Community with the expectations for compliance with NMSU's COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols. It also provides guidance in the event of perceived or reported non-compliance. Some of the health and Safety protocols will be mentioned generally herein, but the official source for current requirements is https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html, which centralizes the information being distributed regarding NMSU's pandemic action plan for the prevention of and protection from exposure to the risks presented by COVID19. All members of the NMSU Community are required to read and abide by these. Other violations which might also be addressed pursuant to this rule are those that relate directly to the creation of a public health and safety risk of potential exposure to COVID19, such as falsification of documents (e.g., vaccination, test results or other health records) or willful disregard of a supervisor's directives enforcing NMSU COVI D 19 Safety Protocols. 3. Synopsis of Process for Alleged Public Health Safety Violations: This rule provides the exclusive process applicable in the event of alleged failure by employees and Visitors to abide by NMSU's COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols. If the facts support a finding of a violation, notice of these facts, along with the proposed administrative action, will be provided to the involved member of the NMSU Community to provide an opportunity for them to state their position and provide additional facts for consideration prior to administrative action being taken. After this factual review meeting, which may also be conducted through written submittals, a determination will be issued, which may be subject to appeal, as provided in Part 5. PART 3: Safety Protocols I Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) I New Mexico State University 1. COVID19: A global pandemic that was declared as national emergency in March 2020, and now includes distinct emerging variants indicated to be equally or more contagious than COVID19 by the federal Center for Disease Control and New Mexico Department of Health. 2. COVID19 Symptoms: Fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath and sore throat. Refer to https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html for updates. 3. Direct Threat: A significant risk of substantial harm that cannot be reduced or eliminated by a Reasonable Accommodation. Whether or not someone poses a Direct Threat in the work or academic environment will be based on objective factual information, not subjective perceptions or irrational fears: 1. Duration of risk; 2. Nature and severity of the potential harm; 3. Likelihood that potential harm will occur; and 4. Imminence of the potential harm. 4. NMSU Community: NMSU officials, employees, students, as well as Visitors to campus. 5. NMSU COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols: The rules and procedures or other protocols posted at https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html pertaining to the prevention of or protection from COVID19. 6. Reasonable Accommodation: A change in the work or academic environment that allows a person with a disability to have an equal opportunity to participate (apply for jobs, perform essential functions, enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment or academic programs and activities). 7. Visitor: A Visitor includes and is not limited to affiliates, contractors, vendors and the general public. PART 4: KEY POLICY Safety Protocols I Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) I New Mexico State University 1. Research Based Informational Site with Instructions for Personal Conduct: NMSU is uniquely situated to have the most current access to research relating to various aspects of the COVID19 global pandemic such as: testing, vaccinations, effectiveness, contact tracing, rates of infection, and emerging variants and re-infection. The NMSU System Chancellor has regularly issued COVID19 emergency updates and directives (referred to in this rule as the NMSU's COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols), posted at https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html. These protocols are based on pronouncements by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the New Mexico Governor and New Mexico Department of Health and the NMSU Board of Regents and the NMSU System Chancellor. In the event of a conflict between the requirements by these authorities relating to the work and academic environments, the NMSU guidance will govern. 2. Adherence to COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols a Condition of Employment: Unless subject to a Reasonable Accommodation consistent with COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols based on disability, serious medical condition or non-discrimination under Title VII (approved by OIE or SAS) or to an alternate work arrangement (approved by the employee's supervisor and dean/vice president), members of the NMSU Community must adhere to the COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols published at https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html, which apply to each member of the NMSU Community as a condition of employment, condition upon admission or condition required to conduct business with NMSU or for access to Health and Safety Protocols I Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) I New Mexico State University 3. Fundamental Principles: In addition to material posted at https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html, the following COVID19 health and safety protocols apply in the context of COVID19: 1. Members of the NMSU Community may be subject to additional COVID19 protective measures adopted by individual departments, as approved by NMSU administration as advised by the CART (e.g., screening, attendance records for purposes of contact tracing) and reasonably related directives from a supervisor or employee in a position of authority (e.g., project managers, event organizers, faculty, all members of management and NMSU appointed officials). 2. Members of the NMSU Community must be honest in their dealings with the university and with those they interact with, including but not limited to: 1) when completing questionnaires or surveys from NMSU; 2) when experiencing COVID19 Symptoms; 3) when self-isolating and 4)when seeking a Reasonable Accommodation from a required COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols. 3. As the NMSU COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols are updated, members of the NMSU Community must continue to review and follow them, unless subject to a Reasonable Accommodation. 4. Roles/Responsibilities of Supervisors and Employees in Position of Authority: All members of management including supervisors, lead employees and those in positions of authority who represent NMSU by virtue of their employment have a duty to inform, educate, and potentially warn, members of the NMSU community using the material posted at https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html. The messaging should include that NMSU hopes to avoid having to take action to remove any person from campus, but in the face of a global pandemic such as this one, it is a necessary option in the interest of protecting the public's health and safety. Any NMSU representative who intentionally incites others to disregard policy, particularly in a classroom or other closed environment, is violating NMSU's COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols and putting /arp.nmsu .edu/16-32-covid 19-health-and-safety-protocols/ 5/10 9/2/2021 16.32 COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols I Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) I New Mexico State University 5. Reports of Violation; Assessment: Each reported violation will be assessed strictly on whether the facts support a violation of the COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols in effect at the time of the reported incident. The consequence for a violation will depend on the facts evaluated on a case-by- case basis and whether an unreasonable risk of harm, Direct Threat or actual harm was created through action or inaction. 1. Inadvertent, neglectful or other unintentional instances of noncompliance may be addressed with information and education and/or a warning from an appropriate NMSU representative, provided that no unreasonable risk of harm, Direct Threat or actual harm resulted. Lack of intent is not a defense if a serious risk of harm or Direct Threat or actual harm resulted from an inadvertent or unintentional violation of the COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols. Even if the infraction were the same, the administrative consequence might be much different. For example, someone not wearing a mask inside a large conference room only occupied by one or two people would result in a less serious consequence than someone not wearing a mask inside a crowded restroom in between classes in an academic building. 2. Repeated infractions, even if not resulting in unreasonable risk of harm or Direct Threat or actual harm, will justify a more severe administrative consequence, including suspension without pay, demotion and involuntary termination (employees) or issuance of a No Trespass Directive (Visitors). 3. A deliberate refusal to abide by COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols, Direct Threat or actual harm increasing the risk to other members of the NMSU Community, and in turn affecting NMSU and the institution's obligations to protect the work and academic environments, will be addressed with more serious action, including suspension without pay, demotion and/or termination (employees) or issuance of a No Trespass Directive (Visitors), depending upon the actualities as they are determined on a case-by-case basis. 6. Non-Discrimination: New Mexico State University (NMSU) is dedicated to providing equal opportunities in our employment and learning environments. Decisions made pursuant to this rule will not discriminate on the basis of any protected category (age, ancestry, color, disability, gender identity, genetic information, national origin, race, religion, retaliation, serious medical condition, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, spousal affiliation, or protected veteran status in its programs and activities). 7. Amendment: As with any university policy or rule, the university administration reserves the right to amend it at any time. https://arp. nmsu .edu/16-32-covid 19-health-and-safety-protocols/ 6/10 9/2/2021 16.32 COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols I Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) I New Mexico State University PART 5: KEY PROCESS ELEMENTS 1. Violations of COVID 19 Health and Safety Protocols: Due the nature of the risk (spread of communicable infectious disease) and the need for swift action to maintain a safe campus, this rule authorizes an expedited, remote process by which the facts relating to violation of COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols will be heard and decided, including any proposed administrative action. This rule's expedited processes, based on failure to fulfill conditions of employment in violation of COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols, will be used in lieu of other faculty (ARP 10.50) or staff (ARP 10.10) disciplinary processes. To the extent that consequences involve a loss of pay or job position, due process will be provided pursuant to this rule. Timelines will be reasonable and flexible, yet expedited so as to reduce or eliminate safety risks created by the violation(s). The factual review meeting also applies to Visitors to campus and the proposed administrative action will include the potential for issuance of a No Trespass Directive. 2. Factual Review Meeting: When COVID19 Health and Safety Protocol violations are reported, the employee's supervisor or appropriate NMSU representative for Visitors will gather the relevant facts and document them. If the facts confirm a violation, the employee's supervisor or appropriate NMSU representative for Visitors will issue a notice outlining the facts and the proposed administrative action, and set a date and time for a factual review meeting. The notice will outline the facts, including witness statements if relied upon, and the administrative action proposed to be taken. The involved employee or Visitor will be given an opportunity to provide a written response and any additional facts or evidence they would like to be considered, if any, before a decision is made taking action. https://arp.n msu .edu/16-32-covid 19-health-and-safety-protocols/ 7/10 9/212021 16.32 COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols I Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) I New Mexico State University 3. Decision: Once the factual review meeting is completed, a decision will be issued on behalf of NMSU explaining the factual basis/es and the policy or rule violation supporting the action to be taken. 1. For at will, non-faculty contract, non-regular (e.g., temporary, seasonal) and probationary employees, the decision following the factual review meeting will be final. 2. For decisions imposing an involuntary termination of employment, demotion or suspension without pay of a regular, non-probationary employee (above-listed types of employment excluded), the decision must inform the employee of a right to appeal. 3. In the event of an appeal, the effective date of the administrative action may be held in abeyance provided the employee agrees to use accrued leave the employee is entitled to be compensated for upon termination, or agrees to be placed on leave without pay status. 4. Non-faculty employees hired pursuant to an employment contract who may be found to have violated COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols via a factual review meeting will be subject to corrective action in accordance with their employment contract. 5. If a Visitor is found to have violated COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols via a factual review meeting and the outcome is issuance of a No Trespass Directive, the Visitor may seek any review indicated on the face of the No Trespass Safety Protocols I Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP) I New Mexico State University 4. Appeal Hearing: By memo to the Director of Employee and Labor Relations (for non-faculty employees) or to the Associate Provost for Academic Affairs (faculty employees), employees for whom the decision is not final (See 5.2 A. and B.) may request a de novo hearing before an appeal hearing panel. 1. The appeal hearing panel will typically be comprised of representatives from: Chancellor's Office; Human Resource Services (when involved party is non-faculty employee) or Academic Affairs (when involved party is faculty); Aggie Health and Wellness; Environmental Health and Safety & Risk Management and a faculty member informed on COVID19. 2. The appeal hearing may be conducted through technological or electronic means. 3. The NMSU representative will present the facts which supported the administrative action taken, followed by the involved employee or Visitor presenting their position and any facts supportive of their defense to the factual findings or to the type of administrative action taken. Witnesses may be called, and the involved faculty or Visitor may elect to cross examine; legal counsel may participate. The hearing will be informal and conducted in a fair manner. 4. Any member of the appeal hearing panel may question either of the parties or any witness. 5. The appeal hearing panel may deliberate in closed session and will subsequently issue a final written decision on behalf of NMSU, based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, confirming or modifying the factual findings on whether or not NMSU COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols were violated, and upholding, modifying or reversing the administrative action. 5. Authorization of Rule Administrator Guidelines and Standards: The Responsible Administrator may issue and amend guidelines and standards corresponding to this rule, which will include incorporation by reference the COVID19 Health and Safety Protocols, posted at https://now.nmsu.edu/index.html and may also include templates, factual review meeting process, appeal hearing process, FAQS or other illustrative documents.

Although attorneys may work for NMSU in other departments, the attorneys in the UGC office are the only attorneys authorized to take a legal position or otherwise represent NMSU. The UGC's client is the institution, by and through its governing body, the Regents of New Mexico State University (NMSU), rather than the individual board members, administrators or employees. UGC coordinates, directs and reports on all legal services provided to NMSU. Any NMSU entity which seeks legal assistance from an outside attorney must coordinate that effort through UGC. NMSU maintains a list of law firms contracted to provide outside legal services to NMSU. The list is available for review by any NMSU administrator. PART 2: ACCEPTANCE OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS Only the attorneys in the UGC office are authorized to accept service of legal process in the form of summons and complaints, subpoenas, writs, agency charges, and similar official legal documents. Any NMSU personnel who are asked to sign for such documents should decline to accept, and instead direct the courier to the office of UGC. In the event that such items are received in error, the University employee accepting such documents, or their supervisor, should notify UGC immediately and deliver all original documentation to the UGC office.1/4 08/25/2020 16.40 - Legal Matters PART 3: LIABILITY COVERAGE NMSU maintains liability coverage against many legal claims through the State Public Liability Fund administered by the N.M. Risk Management Division (RMD). The General Counsel is NMSU's single point of contact with RMD regarding these claims. (The NMSU EHS & RM Department is the RMD point of contact for all internal property claims.) PART 4: LEGAL REPRESENTATION UGC is authorized to provide representation and defense for NMSU officials, employees and volunteers who may be named in a lawsuit or other legal proceeding which results from the performance of their official duties for NMSU, and to the extent authorized by state law. For covered liability claims, RMD will appoint outside counsel to represent NMSU and any NMSU officials, employees and volunteers named as defendants based on their performance of official duties and responsibilities for NMSU. Representation is provided for individuals named as defendants in both their individual and professional capacities as long as the general counsel or RMD, as applicable, determines that they were acting within their official duties and responsibilities for NMSU. PART 5: SIGNATURE AUTHORITY No university employee has authority to sign any agreement or contract with an external entity except as explicitly authorized by the Regents or the Chancellor. UGC will maintain written signature authority documentation as evidence of such authority, and will make that documentation available on the university website. For any type of document or agreement for which no signatory is specified in the signature authority document, UGC is authorized to designate the appropriate signatory.2/4 08/25/2020 16.40 - Legal MattersIrrespective of signature authority, official contracts or agreements should have the approval of the UGC as to form prior to signature. Contracts, agreements and other documents requiring signature should be routed through the relevant NMSU entities for review and comment, using a contract routing approval form. Such documented routing allows the ultimate signatory to see that the relevant units have reviewed, approved or expressed a concern, and are prepared to fulfill the obligations as set forth in the document. PART 6: ACCESS TO UNIVERSITY LEGAL COUNSEL UGC resources are directed primarily to advising the Board of Regents, the chancellor and NMSU administrators who represent the institution's management. The members of the University Administrative Council may call UGC directly to make appointments for legal consultation or document review, or may email inquiries to gencounsel@nmsu.edu. Other university employees who wish to discuss official university business with an attorney in UGC may, with the concurrence of appropriate department head/director and dean/vice president, email the inquiry or request for an appointment to gencounsel@nmsu.edu, with a copy to the immediate supervisor and the cognizant dean, vice president or associate vice president. The UGC attorneys do not provide personal legal advice to NMSU employees or students. NMSU managers and employees should not refer students and employees who have claims adverse to NMSU to UGC, but rather to the appropriate administrative office unless the individual has retained legal counsel, in which case their legal counsel should be referred to UGC.

Background : The operation of motorized Vehicles (electric or combustion engine) in a university setting is always a challenge between providing adequate access to enable the operational needs of the campus to be met versus the pedestrian nature and desired feel of a campus setting. If the rules established are too restrictive then day to day operations of a campus are harmed. If no restrictions are in place then Vehicles are daily operated in a manner that is not in the best overall interest of the institution. B. Legal Basis : State law establishes the ability for local jurisdictions to place restrictions on the operation of motorized Vehicles on controlled access areas. The enforcement of these restrictions, once established, falls to the police department. Violations of these controlled access restrictions will be cited in accordance with state law.20/30 08/25/2020 16.85 - Parking and Traffic RegulationsC. Need for Controlled Access : Operation of motorized Vehicles on sidewalks is a direct conflict with their primary intended use for pedestrian traffic. Furthermore it damages the sidewalks resulting in increased cost to maintain this infrastructure in a reasonable condition. Operation of motorized Vehicles on turf areas damages turf and trees, thereby harming the investment made in the establishment and maintenance of our landscaped areas of the campus. D. Valid Reasons for Access : There are valid reasons for operating motorized Vehicles within controlled access areas: 1. Motorized wheelchairs, personal assistive mobility devices (Segway Human Transporters), or other motorized equipment used to provide disabled access. 2. Response to emergencies. Emergencies include any action to protect human life; well-being and to prevent potential damage to property or to respond to utility outages. 3. Deliveries to or transport from specified buildings otherwise inaccessible. It is recognized that several facilities have no delivery access without travel through a controlled access area. These buildings are listed below. Access routes and access parking zones shall be established for these buildings, which shall be available for viewing at NMSU Controlled Access Area. a. Aggie Memorial Stadium b. Foreman Hall c. Academic Research C d. Guthrie Hall e. Branson Library f. Hadley Hall g. Chamisa Village h. Health and Social Services i. Computer Center j. Jett Hall k. Engineering Complex I E. Defined project specific access : Certain activities such as movement of heavy loads, athletic events, special events, projects involving the remodel or construction of campus facilities and infrastructure require, by their very nature, limited entry to controlled access areas of the campus. This access route will be established by the project manager as best possible and signed accordingly during the course of the event/project life. 21/30 08/25/2020 16.85 - Parking and Traffic RegulationsF. Use of Turf Vehicles : Maintenance of the campus turf areas requires access by specialized turf Vehicles. Nothing in this rule is intended to restrict access to turf areas by these Vehicles. G. Non-emergency Access by Police, Fire and Shuttle Vehicles : Access rights are given to Police and Fire response Vehicles for training activities and patrol activities when access will increase the safety of campus population and its real property assets. Limited access on approved routes is granted to Vehicles providing shuttle service to the NMSU campus. PART 11: UTILITY CART SAFETY PROGRAM Utility Carts . Small utility service Vehicles, herein referred to as 'Utility Carts', include golf carts, turf Vehicles and small rough terrain Vehicles that are allowed on controlled access areas and/or streets of the campus. These small utility carts are used to move people, deliver supplies, and carry tools or small equipment throughout the workplace. Operation of utility carts on sidewalks poses risks to pedestrians and therefore requires special training and responsibility to prevent incidents and potential injury. All individuals operating utility carts must be trained before using the Vehicles. Reading and understanding the Utility Cart Safety Program and responsibilities of cart operation plus additional machine specific use instruction will serve as the required training to be administered by each department or area utilizing utility carts. Other low speed Vehicles capable of exceeding 20 mph must be primarily operating over roadways, not controlled access areas. Individuals operating low speed roadway use Vehicles will be required to attend Defensive Driving and be permitted according to the NMSU Vehicle Use Procedures.

( See Also https://arp.nmsu.edu/18-05/ ) PART 3: HONORIFIC NAMINGS An honorific naming may be bestowed to individual(s) or organizations who have made exemplary or meritorious contributions to the university or to society. The recognition afforded the honoree may also include private financial contributions related to the naming opportunity. To be eligible for an honorific naming of any of the entities described in Part 1 above, the prospective honoree must not be currently employed within the NMSU System or currently hold any appointed or elected office. PART 4: NON-HONORIFIC NAMINGS Namings which are neither honorific nor involve private philanthropy on behalf of NMSU fall within the reserved authority of the Board of Regents. Such naming proposals may be proposed for consideration to the chair of the Campus Planning Committee, who will coordinate with the chancellor to appoint an ad hoc advisory committee. The advisory committee will consider the naming proposal as presented and any responses from2/7 12/09/2020 18.10 - Namings and Other Honorific Recognitionrelevant stakeholders potentially affected by the naming. The chancellor will consider the advisory committee's positions and recommendations, and make the final recommendation to the Board of Regents, pursuant to the board's reservation of authority at RPM 18.00 B. 2. (See Alsohttps://rpm.nmsu.edu/18-00/ ) PART 5: HONORIFIC NAMINGS - GENERAL GUIDANCE Consistent with this rule, the vice president of advancement, with the concurrence of the chancellor or designee, is authorized to issue and amend guidelines and procedures to facilitate the implementation of this rule for honorific and philanthropy-based namings. This includes procedures and standardized forms for the associated gift agreements, gift acceptance and receipt, pledges and planned gifts, as well as procedures to take action to remove a name should circumstances so warrant. 1. Publication of Implementing Guidelines : The implementing guidelines will be published by the vice president of university advancement or designee and linked from this rule for convenient reference at https://support.nmsu.edu/. 2. Respect for Privacy : The privacy of involved parties, including prospective honorees and donors, will be protected, with confidentiality maintained until the appropriate time for disclosure, if any. 3. Naming Approval/Removal : The approval of a proposed honorific naming, or the removal of a name based on material change in circumstance, is action within the authority of the Board of Regents or the Chancellor, as appropriate, and as they deem to best serve the interests of the institution. 4. Duration of a Naming of a Physical Entity : Typically, an honorific naming of a Physical Entity is for the life of the specific Physical Entity. Should circumstances relating to the Physical Entity materially change, the Board of Regents, in consultation with administration and donor representatives will first refer to the gift agreement in pursuit of a practicable course of action, to recognize the donor's naming gift in perpetuity.3/7 12/09/2020 18.10 - Namings and Other Honorific Recognition5. Pledges : The terms and conditions for namings which are funded as a total gift pledged to be paid over a period of time will be clearly specified in writing in a gift agreement, which must address the timing of the official naming and the consequences for not fulfilling the pledge. Generally, the naming occurs after fifty percent (50%) of the pledge has been fulfilled and received by NMSU Foundation, Inc. If the situation justifies an earlier official naming, there must be a clear, documented understanding and agreement by the donor that the naming will be altered or removed if the pledge is not fulfilled within the agreed upon timeframe. 6. Planned Gifts: A naming associated with a planned gift will be considered upon realization of the gift or upon receipt of a minimum of 50% of a cash gift. Any naming requested as a result of a planned gift must adhere to the requirements of this rule, including but not limited to the provision of the requisite documentation. PART 6: ENDOWMENTS Pursuant to the authority delegated by the Board of Regents (RPM 18.00 C.), the following, and supplemental implementing guideline, govern naming opportunities for Endowments: A. Endowments - General Provisions: The following applies to all Endowments at NMSU: 1. Endowments are invested to allow for the principal to remain intact (nonexpendable) in perpetuity, while a portion of Endowment earnings are distributed annually to support the purpose designated by the donor(s) through a formal gift agreement with the NMSU Foundation, Inc. 2. Endowments may be designated to benefit academic or non-academic positions, students, programs, physical spaces or specific academic or non- academic departments and units. They are typically named after their donor(s) or a person(s) the donor wishes to honor. 3. Endowments may be established by a one-time gift, a series of gifts, a pledge paid over a period of a specific number of years, wills, trusts, gifts of appreciated assets, or by a combination of these. Gifts can be added to an established Endowment at any time.4/7 12/09/2020 18.10 - Namings and Other Honorific Recognition4. In certain instances, which must be outlined in a gift agreement, a specific amount of the gift commitment must be received prior to the actual naming of the position, program, building, space, or project. 5. For Endowments matched by the State of New Mexico, NMSU must adhere to applicable state law. 6. Certain terms are commonly used with Endowments. The National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) uses the following definitions: 1. Permanent Endowment: \"Endowment funds are funds received from a donor with the restriction that the principal not be expendable.\" These Endowments are only subject to modification as may be allowed by law and NMSU System policies. 2. Quasi-Endowment: \"A quasi-Endowment fund is a fund that functions like an Endowment fund but which may be totally expended at any time at the discretion of the governing board.\" This may be gift funds that the donor did not specifically direct for use as an Endowment, or funds available to the institution from other sources that can be designated for an Endowment. The funds are invested in the same manner as a true Endowment and have the same payout provisions. B.Endowments - Minimum Thresholds: A naming opportunity funded through an Endowment (including but not limited to Presidential Chair, Eminent Scholar Chair, Faculty Chair, Faculty Professorship, Graduate Fellowship, Lectureship, or designated Collection) must meet the Endowment Minimum Thresholds set and amended upon the recommendation of the NMSU Foundation, with approvals from the vice president of advancement and the chancellor. A gift agreement will be signed by the donor's authorized representative and by the vice president of university advancement or designee. ( See Also Time Limits: Donor(s) will have a maximum time limit of five (5) years from the date of execution of the gift agreement to meet the minimum threshold requirement. In the event of extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the donor, an exception may be granted at the discretion of the vice president of advancement.

Therefore, to the fullest extent permitted by law and by any controlling documents, all gifts and donations to the university should be managed, invested, reinvested, and distributed by and through the NMSU Foundation. The Board of Regents recommends to all persons or corporations desiring to make gifts or donations for the benefit of the university and its respective campuses that such gifts or donations are made to NMSU Foundation, Inc. The return address furnished to donors and on all printed materials must be that of the NMSU Foundation, Inc., the Development Office, or the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement. All gifts received by the university, including gifts to any college, department or division, should be reported directly and immediately to the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement. Gifts in kind (noncash contributions) may be reported by memorandum or letter; gifts of cash or securities should be delivered promptly to the Development Office for receipting and deposit. The Office of the Vice President for University Advancement will be responsible for providing an official receipt to the donor, for appropriate acknowledgment, and for informing the appropriate campus personnel. However, departments awarding restricted gifts for student aid are entirely responsible for ensuring that all donor criteria, financial and otherwise, have been met. The board prefers that real estate and gifts-in-kind be given free of restrictions which would reduce the full range of educational benefits which could be realized from the gift. If restrictions are imposed upon the gift, or if the gift is such as to require costs of care, maintenance or upkeep, such gift must be first approved by the board or its designees before acceptance by the board. Gifts of real estate may be given through the NMSU Foundation, but are subject to the policies and the procedures of the NMSU Foundation.1/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc.PART 1: GIFT INCOME SPENDING RULES The university recognizes the importance of private gift income in providing its colleges and departments the flexibility needed to achieve its goals and objectives. The university also recognizes that different colleges and departments will have varying needs and priorities for the use of the private gift income as they continue to develop and maintain quality programs. This rule is designed to provide those areas receiving private gifts the maximum amount of latitude to address these differing goals and objectives while at the same time maintaining the fiduciary responsibility inherent in the acceptance of these funds. Gift income received by the university from any external source, including the NMSU Foundation, will be expended in compliance with these rules and procedures. In all cases, exceptions may be made if these types of expenditures are sanctioned by the Offices of the President or provost and senior vice president for academic affairs for college or university-wide functions. All expenditures must be for the enhancement or benefit of the university, in recognition of the university's official mission statement. In general, gift funds will be recorded in the current restricted fund, as they are externally restricted to purpose, even if internally unrestricted as to nature of expenditure. Only those gift funds which are received by the university for any related university purpose, without restriction of any type, are to be recorded in the current unrestricted fund. Within this rule, restricted fund income will be subdivided into restricted and unrestricted gifts based only on the level of donor specification attached to the gift, as explained below. PART 2: RESTRICTED GIFT INCOME For the purpose of this rule, restricted gift income is defined as all gift income on which the donor has placed specific restrictions beyond the general purpose for which the income is to be used. Thus, income designated for a specific college or department's general use will be classified as unrestricted gift income, as long as that college or department is given full authority to decide how the funds are to be best spent in compliance with the general guidelines detailed above. Any gift income which must be spent for a specific purpose, such as scholarships or travel reimbursement, or under any specific conditions, such as following a certain event or date, will be classified as restricted. All restricted gift income, if2/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc.accepted and expended, will be expended according to the written restrictions of the donor, without exception. The Office of the Vice President for University Advancement will be responsible for accepting these restrictions before the gift is accepted on behalf of the university. Following this approval, the documented restrictions will take precedence over the guidelines for disbursement of funds outlined below. PART 3: UNRESTRICTED GIFT INCOME For the purpose of this rule, unrestricted gift income is defined as all gift income received by the university and not classified as restricted gift income. Expenditures allowable from this category of gift income will be limited by applicable laws, statutes, and regulations, and by these administrative rules and procedures. It will be the responsibility of the Business Office to identify gifts as unrestricted, and to verify that donor's intent related to the department within the university in which the funds are to be spent is honored. PART 4: AUTHORIZATION STRUCTURE The standard approval structure in place for expenditure of non-gift funds will be followed for gift funds. All non-payroll expenditures are to be approved by the department dead (where applicable), dean or director, and Office of the Senior Vice President for Administration and Finance. All expenditures involving a payment for services rendered by a university employee will be processed through the Office of Human Resource Services, following all existing authorization requirements for the given transaction. All requests for exception to these rules and procedures will be directed initially to the Office of the Senior Vice President for Administration and Finance. PART 5: CASH DISBURSEMENT CONTROLS3/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc.All existing university internal controls will apply to disbursements made from gift funds. All requests for expenditure will be submitted on the appropriate form; separate vouchers exist for requesting disbursements directly from the university and the NMSU Foundation. All vouchers will be accompanied by invoice or receipt support, or the attestation of the individual claiming reimbursement if other documentation is not applicable. PART 6: GUIDELINES FOR DISBURSEMENTS OF FUNDS All gift income funds will be used by or for the benefit of the university in fulfilling its mission of teaching, research, and public service, including expenses sanctioned for the improvement of employee morale. All types of expenditures falling under these guidelines will be allowable, with the following exceptions: A. Any payment in conflict with existing law, statute, or regulation applicable to private gift funds B. Charitable contributions made to entities or individuals external to the university. Where appropriate, expenses incurred by separate nonprofit organizations which could have legitimately been considered university expenses, such as those incurred by a separate student organization engaged in a university -related function, may be transferred with the approval of the Office of Senior Vice President for Administration and Finance to the university. C. Any duplicate payment for goods and services, or reimbursement of employee expense. Duplicate payments include the reimbursement of actual travel expense to employees who have already received per diem payment through other sources. D. Payment for university employee services outside the payroll system. E. Gifts made to university personnel except as recognition of service to the university. F. Loans to any individual, unless the gift was made for the specific purpose of establishing a loan fund. G. Payment of fines imposed for violations of local, state, or federal law, unless resulting from university negligence. H. Memberships in organizations, country clubs, or other expenditures for any individual, where it cannot be demonstrated that the expenditure is for the enhancement or benefit of the university.4/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc. PART 7: ENDOWMENT TRUST The Board of Regents approved the revocable Endowment Trust Agreement to cover the establishment of endowments, making it possible to take money that has been privately contributed to the NMSU Foundation for endowed chairs, professorships, or lectureships and match it with monies from the State of New Mexico. The monies may be placed together into a trust, managed by the NMSU Foundation in such a way that the NMSU Foundation retains title to the private money and the board retains title to the state money in a revocable trust. The board may designate a change in trustee at its discretion at any time or may dissolve the agreement if it desires. The assignment may allow the NMSU Foundation its usual management fee as trustee. It must, however, contain provisions (1) for termination of the placement of all or part of these endowments in the trust at any time at the board's sole discretion; (2) for annual accountings; and (3) for absolute authority on the part of the board for the disposition of each of the endowments (consistent with the terms of each particular endowment). PART 8: NMSU ENDOWMENT FUND This fund, managed by the NMSU Foundation, was established to enable faculty and friends to contribute to a permanent fund to strengthen the university's academic programs. Endowment funds are permanently invested and a portion of the annual earnings are made available to support the programs selected by donors as the beneficiaries. Earnings over and above the amount available for expenditure are added to the principal. Many contributions are received as memorials from those who wish to convey their sympathy upon the death of a relative, friend, or colleague. The university provides an official receipt for all gifts, and, when contributions are made in memoriam, informs the family that a memorial gift has been made. Amounts of the contributions are not disclosed. Faculty and staff may contribute through the Foundation via payroll deduction arranged through the Office of Human Resource Services. 5/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU NMSU Foundation, Inc.PART 9: NMSU FOUNDATION, INC. The NMSU Foundation, Incorporated, is a private, nonprofit corporation whose only purpose is to accept and administer gifts in support of the university. The NMSU Foundation is a tax-exempt corporation, registered with the appropriate state and federal agencies. Contributions to the Foundation are exempt for federal income tax purposes. The NMSU Foundation works closely with the university. Its directors, who are committed to attracting private resources for the benefit of the university, serve without compensation. Contributions may be made for annual operating expenses or for the endowment. PART 10: UNIVERSITY-AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS Numerous organizations have been established to support the Board of Regents in a variety of ways and are separate, not-for-profit entities. The focus of the following policy statement is on those organizations whose primary functions are to solicit, manage, and distribute funds and other assets that are given to these organizations for the support of the university in general or specific colleges or other program areas of the university. The university recognizes advantages of these organizations, such as: A. Creating an opportunity for private individuals and organizations to invest in the enrichment of the programs with greater assurance that the benefits of their gifts supplement, not supplant, state appropriations to the institution. B. Providing a corporate structure for managing private gifts, including endowments and income-producing real property, that does not jeopardize the university's tax-exempt status, create unnecessary unrelated business tax obligations, or create additional liabilities for the university. C. Creating an effective forum for alumni and community leaders to participate in and contribute to strengthening the university through their participation in the solicitation, management, and distribution of private gifts and donations to the university.6/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc.(Other separate entities have been established for purposes unrelated to soliciting or managing gifts and donations on behalf of the university; i.e., the NMSU Research Park Corporation and Arrowhead Center, Inc., which engage in the commercialization of research productivity. However, these rules and procedures focus on those organizations created to actively engage in raising funds for the university.) PART 11: RECOGNITION Any organization formed to represent the university or any college, department, or program area of the institution will receive approval by the university to represent it to prospective donors. A condition of any recognition of an organization will be that the organization agrees to conduct its business in concert with university policy, rules and procedures applicable to such organizations. A written agreement will be executed between the university and each organization, consistent with these policies but recognizing the specific significantly performing fund-raising functions until after the date of adoption of this rule (former policy adopted 10/90) will be established as an arm of the NMSU Foundation, unless otherwise approved by the Board of Regents upon the recommendation of the Chancellor (or designee). PART 12: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE The purpose of the organization will be clearly defined as being for the sole benefit of the university, or one or more of its specific programs. In order for the university to be able to support the organizations and not be in conflict with the state's anti-donation laws, the benefits to the university from the organization will be spelled out in the agreement. PART 13: STRUCTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION7/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc.Organizations may structure themselves in any manner they deem appropriate to fulfill their role and responsibilities to the university, with the following understandings: A. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and any amendments should have the approval of the university. B. A regent, the Chancellor (or designee) may be included a s voting member of the governing board of the organization. C. Unless specifically agreed otherwise by the university and the organization, the composition of the organization's governing board will be such as to assure continuation of the organization as an independent, legal entity separate from the university. Normally, more than 50 percent of the governing board membership of the organization must be non-university employees to assure continuation of the organization as an independent, legal entity separate from the university. D. When an organization has a beneficial affiliation with an organizational unit, the university organizational unit should be expected to provide the staff support for the organization. No such organization will use funds received by the organization for the benefit of the university to employ staff independently of the university. The university and the organization may agree to allocate some of the income the organization earns to the university for the specific purpose of supplementing institutional staff support. This provision does not preclude the affiliated organization from directly retaining professional services as is deemed necessary for the organization to fulfill its responsibilities to the donors and to the university, with the understanding that the retention of fund-raising and/or public relations consultants must be approved by the vice president for university advancement. E. The affiliated organization's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws should assure the retention of the organization's legal status as a tax- exempt non-profit organization pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor statute, if applicable. PART 14: SOLICITATION OF GIFTS AND DONATIONS8/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc.Recognized affiliated organizations may organize and conduct fund-raising campaigns as they deem appropriate, except that major multi-year campaign solicitation of gifts and donations to support new academic programs or services, the major renovation of existing buildings, or the construction of new facilities may not be initiated without the prior approval of the NMSU system Chancellor. The initiation of any fund-raising campaign by any organization must be coordinated with the overall fund-raising activities of the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement to assure proper contact with potential donors. Each organization will, in concert with the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement, establish procedures for the review and acceptance of gifts and donations and for the coordination of solicitations and prospect contacts. The acceptance of any gift or donation that contains restrictions as to its use requires a matching fiscal obligation of the university, creates a future obligation of the university, or involves real property must be approved by the Chancellor (or designee). Although each organization would be expected to maintain records of gifts and donations received and to properly acknowledge such gifts, the university has designated the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement as the central record-keeping agency for all gifts and donations received on behalf of the university. The receipt of all gifts and donations must be reported to the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement. The Office of the Vice President for University Advancement is available to advise and/or assist any affiliated organization in designing and conducting fund-raising campaigns. No affiliated organizations will accept any funds intended for a university organizational unit which requires performance or service by the university. Income generated by a university program or service is revenue of the university and must be directly deposited into a university account. PART 15: MANAGEMENT OF GIFTS AND DONATIONS All gift monies, whether received directly by the university or indirectly through a university-affiliated organization, will be managed in accordance with investment policies approved by the Board of Regents. Affiliated organizations are encouraged to deposit their gift receipts with the university for the specific organization. Oversight of the funds deposited in these agency accounts is the responsibility of the organization. The university will provide all accounting services related to the funds for the organization. Short-term investment income earned by the university on9/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc.funds in these accounts will be allocated to the accounts. Gifts received in the form of endowments by any recognized affiliated organization should be assigned to the NMSU Foundation, for investment management purposes. All endowments must be managed in accordance with investment policies approved by the board. The identity of individual endowments will be maintained by the NMSU Foundation; however, endowment funds may be co-invested in a pooled funds approach. Consolidation of the endowment investment management program provides the opportunity for cost-effective management of the endowments. Endowments retained by the organizations or transferred to the NMSU Foundation through revocable trust agreements will be maintained on the organization's books. Gifts received in the form of real property will be managed in accordance with the donor's request. If the donor specifies that the property be used by the university in its gift form, such as art work, library books, real estate, etc., the property will be transferred to the university. If the donor desires that the property be used to establish an endowment, or if the gift is real property or property interest, the gift will be assigned to the NMSU Foundation, for management purposes. The NMSU Foundation may retain the real property and use the income earned to accomplish the donor's gift objectives. If the donor permits, and it is a better investment management decision to dispose of the real property, the NMSU Foundation will use the proceeds from these sales to establish the endowment. The NMSU Foundation will obtain university approval before disposing of any real property. No individual member, director, or officer of an affiliated organization should accept any gift or gratuity that is offered because of the individual's position held with the organization. PART 16: DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS Affiliated organizations will not disburse directly any funds in the form of compensation to a university employee without the express written approval of the Chancellor of the university and/or Board of Regents. Exceptions may be made for awards, recognition, etc. Any funds intended for employee compensation will be transferred to a university account and subsequently disbursed in accordance with university policies and procedures. The affiliated organizations will receive interest income earned on funds in agency bank accounts held by the university in the name of the organizations, and may use such income to cover operating expenses10/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc.directly incurred by the organizations. Organizations should establish policies for the review of any business transactions involving its members and the organization. Members, directors, and officers of the organization should disqualify themselves from making, participating in, or in any way attempting to use their position to influence decisions in which they have or would have a financial interest. Organizations will establish policies which preclude the use of any funds received or earned by the organization to support any political candidate. Organization funds will be accounted for in the university agency's fund, unless the university expressly approves the organization's separate accounting system. All separate systems will follow all university internal control policies where applicable. PART 17: REPORTS Each affiliated organization maintaining a separate accounting system will report monthly to the Office of the Vice President for University Advancement the receipt of all gifts and donations and expenditures related to these funds. Each affiliated organization will provide monthly a summary of cultivation and solicitation activities. Organizations should prepare annual reports for the university and board that include standard financial statements required of non-profit organizations and any supplemental schedules requested by the university. The organization's auditor's opinion of these statements and schedules should be included in these annual reports, if applicable. Organizations should furnish to the university copies of all forms required to be filed by law, such as Form 990 and annual reports to the State Corporation Commission. PART 18: AUDITS Organizations shall provide the university with the results of annual financial audits performed by an independent auditing firm selected by the organization. Any independent audit firm selected by an organization that is not the same firm selected by the university must provide the necessary audit confirmations and assistance to the university's external auditor upon request. Organizations not required to provide an independent audit report should furnish to the university an annual financial report signed by the11/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc.organization's president and treasurer. Audit Services staff may review all items approved by the organization's board for release to the university, with the understanding that such items and any reports related to them will fall under the organization's internal audit policy. This information will not become a part of the university's public records. The organization will not be used to provide any instructional, research, or public service activity sponsored or participated in by a university department or individual university employee in the name of university unless allowed by the university for specific purposes. Under no circumstances should an affiliated organization offer an instructional program for university academic credit. Nothing herein is intended to make any affiliated organization subject to the New Mexico Open Meetings or Public Records Acts; nor is it intended to violate any confidentiality of donor information. PART 19: INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT In recognition of the support and contributions that these university- affiliated organizations give to the university, the university may provide logistic support at no cost to these organizations, such as: A. Space for meetings and other needs that an organization may have in the conduct of its business. B. Staff support as described previously. In those regulations where university staff have a responsibility of significant support to the affiliated organization, the organization's officers should be consulted in selection and evaluation of such staff. C. Use of university's financial accounting systems for their fiscal management needs. D. Utilization of computer-based information management systems, such as donor record-keeping, etc. E. Use of the Procurement Services Office's staff when assistance is required in arranging purchases. Under no circumstances will purchases be made for the organizations through the Procurement Services Office.12/14 08/25/2020 18.20 - University Advancement - Gift Income, NMSU Endowment, NMSU Foundation, Inc.F. Recognized affiliated organizations will be given a non-exclusive license to use the name New Mexico State University and any other appropriate trademarks or trade names of the university in connection with their fund-raising activities. The university may, from time to time, deem it appropriate to provide financial support to an organization's major fund-raising campaign. PART 20: TERMINATION/DISSOLUTION OF ORGANIZATIONS Upon termination of any agreement between the university and an affiliated organization, or upon the dissolution of any such organization, all assets held by the affiliated organization on behalf of the university shall become the property of the university, or such other affiliated organization as the university shall designate. This condition shall be included in the bylaws of any affiliated organization.

Classroom Scheduling Priorities First priority for scheduling classrooms is given to credit-bearing courses. Class meeting times must be scheduled using standard time blocks as dened in section B. Classrooms are assigned to best match room capacity with class enrollment. Second priority for room scheduling is given to events and non-credit courses. B. Standard Time Blocks To ensure ease of access for students who are having to build a schedule of classes with the least amount of conflict, and ecient utilization of classroom space on all days of the week, standard time blocks have been established. Classes should start on a standard time block. Request for non-standard class start times must be approved by the Division Head and Vice President for Academic Aairs (VPAA). Standard time blocks are determined by the Oce of Academic Aairs. Classes that have not been assigned a classroom are listed as TBA in the Schedule of Classes until a classroom and time can be assigned. All class schedule information is entered into the Student Information System to reflect accurate course, faculty and space related information. C. Course Capacities When scheduling classes, accurate course capacities should be included. Inaccurate course capacities negatively impacts space utilization analytics and skews predictive scheduling analytics. Course capacity should be a function of instructional design and pedagogy, and should rarely be set at zero (0) or at a specic room size. No instructor or Division may allow the occupancy of a classroom to exceed the limit specied by re safety codes. The classroom capacity is xed in the Student Information System and Scheduling Software System. It is the responsibility of the Division and the instructor to ensure that actual attendance does not exceed classroom capacity. D. Room and Time Changes Division Head and VPAA approvals are required for any day and time change requests after students have begun to register for the term the class is being oered. E. Class Cancellations Classes are cancelled in the Student Information System by the Oce of Academic Aairs. When classes are cancelled, an automated email is sent the next day notifying the student of the cancellation. Lists of aected students are sent to the Divisions and to Student Services. F. Final Examinations Final written examinations, not to exceed two hours duration, are given only at the times and days established and published by the Oce of Academic Aairs. Final examinations are generally held in the same room as class meetings. Changes in classroom location must be arranged through the Oce of Academic Aairs. Examination times and days are noted on the Campus web page. G. Specialized Classroom Needs Needs for a specialized facility, such as laboratory demonstrations and unique media needs, are considered and accommodated whenever possible. Media-equipped classrooms are \u00001 6/27/2019 08/25/2020 Appendix - ARP 12.71-A - ALCC Facility Utilization and Scheduling Guidelinesassigned on a space available basis. Departments needing a specic classroom should indicate these needs in the \"Notes\" section of the schedule proofs. H. Maintenance and Development of Classroom Technology in Instructional Space Classroom space is maintained by the Facilities Department. Technology (computers, audio visual, etc.) in instructional spaces is maintained by Information Technology Services (ITS). I. Accommodation/Accessibility (American with Disabilities Act Compliance) Arrangements can be made for the change of an academic classroom due to documented accommodation and/or accessibility issues. Changes of this nature should be handled by the Accessibility Services oce, the Division Head, and the Oce of Academic Aairs. J. Use of Classroom Space for Non-Class Event Purposes The Oce of Academic Aairs will schedule classroom space for events. However, class meetings always have priority. K. Construction/Renovation During periods of construction/renovation or in the event of an emergency, the Campus President or the Vice President for Academic Aairs may authorize exceptions to scheduling policies. L. Conflict Resolution Scheduling conflicts will be resolved by the Oce of Academic Aairs in consultation with the course Division Head. Space utilization and pedagogical issues will be considered in any conflict resolution. \u00002 6/27/2019 08/25/2020 Appendix - ARP 12.71-A - ALCC and Scheduling GuidelinesDACC APPENDIX : SCHEDULING GUIDELINES A.Centrally Scheduled Classroom Priority : 1.First priority for scheduling centrally assigned space is given to courses. Class meeting times must be scheduled using standard time blocks as defined in section B, below. Classrooms are assigned to best match room priorities and capacity. Course capacity should be a function of instructional design and pedagogy and should rarely be set at zero (0) or a particular room size. 2.Second priority for scheduling centrally assigned space is given to adult education and events, after all courses and related instructional activities have been scheduled in any given academic term. B.Standard Time Blocks: To ensure ease of access for students who are having to build a schedule of classes w ith the least amount of conflict, and efficient utilization of classroom space on all days of the week, standard time blocks have been established. Regular -session class meetings with standard time patterns are scheduled before class meetings with non -standard time patterns. All classes are scheduled into the requested class room s unless it is a specialized lab or caus es a conflict with the class that has priority. If a class does not occur during the standard time block it will be given second priori ty in the class room and moved if a conflict occurs with those classes schedule d within the standard time block. Classes that have not been assigned a classroom are published in the Schedule of Classes with a TBA announcement until a classroom and time can be a ssigned. All class schedule information is entered into the student information system to capture and reflect accurate course, faculty , and space related information. C.Minimum Class Size : The target enrollment for lecture sections is 15 with a minimum enrol lment of 12. Minimum enrollment in labs is set by safety standards. Program directors or department chairs will provide any information regarding such standards to their deans. Minimum enrollment in clinicals is set by safety and/or accreditation standards . Program directors or department chairs will provide any information regarding such standards to their deans. In an effort to serve more rural locations, exceptions may be granted at the satellite locations. At Gadsden, target enrollment in lecture sectio ns is 12; minimum enrollment is 10. At Chaparral and Sunland Park target enrollment is 10, and minimum enrollment is 8. In an effort to serve students who take courses outside of the typical work day/week, exceptions may be granted for weekend and evening classes. Target enrollment is 12 and minimum enrollment is 8. For any other exceptions, see DACC's Framework for Cancelling Classes with Low Enrollment. D.Prime Time : Prime time is Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Classes with non -standard patterns are to be scheduled either starting or ending on the standard block schedule. The sections will be assigned room space in the requested classroom or specialized lab . Classes using a one -day-only pattern and meeting for more than standard duration (e.g., three hour seminars) should be scheduled outside of prime time. E.Scheduling Priority : 1.Classes scheduled within standard meeting times and the block schedule will receive first priority in classroom scheduling. Classes scheduled outside of the 08/25/2020 Appendix - ARP 12.71-B - DACC Facility Utilization and Scheduling Guidelinesstand ard meeting times will be assigned classroom space after those classes scheduled during standard times. Where an academic unit has departmental space assignment priority, t hat unit will be given preferential scheduling within those spaces. 2.Initial classroo m assignments are made based on department or program priority. Classes requiring specialized labs/classrooms will be assigned to the appropriate room based on departmental classroom requests. Classes with lower enrollments will be placed in smaller classrooms with equivalent media if necessary. Classes scheduled after scheduling deadlines have passed are assigned classrooms on a space -available basis. F.Course Capacities : When scheduling course meetings, it is expected that accurate course capacities be included. Inaccurate course capacities negatively impacts space utilization analytics and skew predictive scheduling analytics. Course capacity should be a function of instructional design and pedagogy and sho uld rarely be set at zero (0) or a particular room size. No instructor or department may allow the occupancy of a classroom to exceed the limit specified by fire safety codes. The classroom capacity is fixed in the student information system and schedulin g software system. It is the responsibility of the department and the instructor to ensure that actual attendance does not exceed classroom capacity. G.Room and Time Changes : Day and time changes should be made prior to students registering for classes. Room changes are accommodated when there is another room available. However, departments/instructors should NOT continue to add students in the expectation that a larger room will be available. H.Class Cancellations : If a class is cancelled, the Associate Vice P resident 's office (AVPAA) must be notified so the class can be cancelled in the student information system. It is the responsibility of the academic unit to notify enrolled students when a class has been cancelled. I.Instructor Assignments : When scheduling c lass meetings, instructor names must be entered in the student information system using the instructor's Aggie ID number. This ensures that the instructor's name will appear in the online Schedule of Classes, in other electronic applications such as online grading, and in faculty workload reports. J.Final Examinations : Final written examinations, not to exceed two hours duration, are given only at the times and places established and published by the Office of University Student Records. Final examinations ar e generally held in the same room as class meetings. However, by prior arrangement with the AVPAA 's office , common final examinations can be scheduled and extra room locations may be booked on a space available basis. Changes in classroom location must be arranged through the AVPAA's office . Examination codes, times, and locations are provided by the University Student Records Office and in the Student Information System. The approved final exam schedule will be posted on the DACC website in the schedule lo cation once it has been made official by the Office of University Student Records . K.Specialized Classroom Needs : Needs for a specialized facility, such as laboratory demonstrations and unique media needs, are considered and accommodated whenever possible. Media -equipped (SMART) classrooms are assigned on a space available basis. Departments needing a specific classroom should indicate these needs in the 08/25/2020 Appendix - ARP 12.71-B - DACC Facility Utilization and Scheduling Guidelines\"Notes\" section of the schedule proofs. However, standard time block and prime -time designation should be observed, whenever possible. L.Central Use of Departmentally Scheduled Rooms : Under prior agreement with the program director or d epartment Chair, departmental rooms may be scheduled by the AVPAA's office . M.Maintenance and Development of Classroom Technology in Instructional Space : All classrooms are maintained by DACC facilities and computer support.
