Method: Multi-centered randomized controlled trial (Traditional Medicine Hospital of Ho Chi Minh City, General Hospital of Soc Trang Province, and People Military Hospital of Soc Trang Province) from July 2014 to July 2015. 66 post-stroke patients were divided into two groups: a control group received modified acupuncture combined with Bobath method and a trial group received modified acupuncture combined with motor relearning method. After six weeks, patients were evaluated according to the Barthel score, 10-hole test, and 10-meter-walk test. Results: The trial group showed better results than the control group did.
