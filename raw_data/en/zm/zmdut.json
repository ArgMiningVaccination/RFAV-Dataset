Improving the body's natural defense system (immunity) is crucial to maintaining good health. We are all aware that prevention is preferable to treatment. While there is no cure for COVID-19, it is prudent to take preventative actions to build our immunity. From an Ayurvedic perspective, the pathophysiology of infection with the Covid 19 virus may be described by understanding it to be a Samsargaja/ Aupasargika (infectious) in nature. The degree of vitiation of TriDosha varies depending on the severity of infection or the affected person's Sharira Bala (immunity). How can Ayurveda boost immunity naturally? The ultimate vitalizing energy in Ayurveda is known as 'Ojas', and it is believed to be situated at the heart. Any disease is believed to be a lack of deviation in the Ojas. Individuals are more prone to disease conditions, allergies, and infections in such situations. Ayurveda also emphasizes mental imbalances or psychological tensions that cause the fluctuation in Ojas. Acharyas says that our mental emotions reflect our bodies, whether good or bad. For example, too much worry, anger, guilt, or jealousy leads to fatigue and causes harm to the body in terms of lowering your immunity. The other factors may include low physical activity, metabolic issues, overconsumption of unhealthy or junk food, environmental factors like pollution, etc. show on the immunity or health of an individual. Studies have also proven that intake of artificial food, preservatives, or additives restricts the body's capacity to recover from infections or allergies.
