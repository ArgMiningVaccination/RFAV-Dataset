Download date: 18-09-2023Effectiveness of Mechanical Treatment for Plantar Fasciitis: Context :Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common foot injuries. Several mechanical treatment options, including shoe inserts, ankle-foot orthoses, tape, and shoes are used to relieve the symptoms of plantar fasciitis. Objectives :To investigate the effectiveness of mechanical treatment in the management of plantar fasciitis. Evidence Acquisition :The review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. A systematic search wasperformed in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane up to March 8, 2018. Two independent reviewers screened eligiblearticles and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration 's risk of bias tool. Evidence Synthesis :A total of 43 articles were included in the study, evaluating 2837 patients. Comparisons were made between no treatment and treatment with insoles,tape, ankle-foot orthoses including night splints and shoes. Tape, ankle-foot orthoses, and shoes were also compared with insoles.Follow-up ranged from 3 to 5 days to 12 months. Cointerventions were present in 26 studies. Conclusions :Mechanical treatment can be bene cial in relieving symptoms related to plantar fasciitis. Contoured full-length insoles are more effective in relieving symptoms related to plantar fasciitis than heel cups. Combining night splints or rocker shoes with insoles enhances improvementin pain relief and function compared with rocker shoes, night splints, or insoles alone. Taping is an effective short-term treatment.Future studies should aim to improve methodological quality using blinding, allocation concealment, avoid cointerventions, anduse biomechanical measures of treatment effects. Keywords :orthotic devices, shoes, splints, taping Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common types of foot injuries. 1-3Approximately 10% of the general population will experience complaints associated with plantar fasciitis once intheir life. 4Patients suffering along the proximal plantar fascia and around its attachmentin the area of the calcaneal tuberosity. Pain aggravates with load, asin walking and running and when rst standing after a period of inactivity, such as getting out of bed in the morning. 5 The exact pathology of plantar fasciitis is still unknown, but a combination of high mechanical stress and repetitive microtraumais the one leading cause of the pathology. 5Histological ndings suggest the underlying process of plantar fasciitis to be moredegenerative rather than in flammatory. Therefore, the term \"fascii- tis\"might be a misnomer and could better be replaced by \"fas- ciosis. \" 6Risk factors associated with plantar fasciitis are a high body mass index,7,8prolonged weight-bearing, and a limited ankle range of motion.9In 45% to 85% of the patients suffering from plantar fasciitis, calcaneal spur is also present.10 Several nonsurgical treatment methods are available to relieve symptoms associated with plantar fasciitis. These include stretch-ing, manual therapy, dry needling, shockwave therapy, physical agents (electrotherapy, low-level laser therapy, phonophoresis, and ultrasound), lifestyle counseling, anti-in flammatory injections, andmechanical treatments such as taping, rocker shoes, and (ankle-) foot orthoses ([A]FOs) including night splints. 11 Mechanical treatments are promising due to the low risk of complications, good accessibility, and high capacity to relieve themechanical load on the plantar fascia during functional tasks of daily life. The effectiveness of mechanical treatment on plantar fasciitis has previously been investigated. 4,12-18However, these studies were limited to speci c mechanical devices or compared mechanical devices to nonmechanical interventions such as stretch- ing and nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs. An overview of the effectiveness of all mechanical treatment options is still missing. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide an overview of the effectiveness of all commonly used mechanical treatment optionsfor plantar fasciitis: taping, rocker shoes, and (A)FOs including night splints. Methods This review was conducted and reported according to the PreferredReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. Literature Search A systematic search was performed in 4 electronic databases(MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane) using a combi- nation of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and free-text words. The exact search strategy is described in Appendix . Keywords used were plantar fasciitis, heel spur, calcaneal spur combined via a Boolean AND operator with orthotic devices, shoes, splints, rocker, soles, and tape. The search was performed up to March 26, 2017, and updated on March 8, 2018.

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW Brought to you by RIJKSUNIVERSITEIT BIBLIOTEC | Unauthenticated | Downloaded 07/14/20 02:52 PM UTC database search, reference lists of all included articles were checked on additional relevant studies. Included studies were controlled trials, focusing on treating plantar fasciitis with one or more mechanical treatment methods. Incase of biomechanical or anatomical outcome measures, no controlgroup was required. Other inclusion criteria were a minimumnumber of 5 participants, adult aged ( 18 y), and only participants without a disease that could interfere with the symptoms of plantarfasciitis. Only primary research available in full text and written inEnglish, Dutch, or German was included. After removal of duplicates, 2 authors independently assessed titles, abstracts, and full text against the inclusion criteria. Duringtitle selection, articles were selected when at least one of the authorsjudged the paper to be included. Disagreements between thereviewers during abstract and full-text selection were resolvedby discussion between the authors. If still no agreement was reached, a third author would decide. Risk of Bias Two authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Co- chrane Collaboration 's risk of bias tool.19Risk of bias addressed in this tool include the following domains: (1) random sequencegeneration, (2) allocation concealment, (3) blinding of participants,(4) blinding of personnel, (5) blinding of outcome assessment,(6) incomplete outcome data, and (7) selective reporting. Otherrisks of bias not covered in these domains are (8) similar groups atbaseline or corrected for dissimilarities; (9) cointerventionsavoided of similar between groups, interventions, or measure-ments; (10) similar timing of outcome assessment in all groups;and (11) no con flicts of interest. All domains were judged \"low risk of bias, \"\"high risk of bias, \"or\"unclear. \"In the end, studies were considered of \"high risk of bias \"if one or more domains were judged \"high risk. \"If none of the domains was of \"high risk \"and one or more domains were \"unclear, \"the study was assessed \"unclear. \"If all domains were of \"low risk, \"the overall judgment was\"low risk. \"Disagreements between the authors were resolved in a consensus meeting. If no consensus could be reached, a thirdauthor would decide. Results Database Search The database search yielded 937 articles after removal of 598duplicates. Title screening resulted in the exclusion of 489 articles,abstract screening resulted in the exclusion of 391 articles, and inthe full-text screening, another 18 articles were excluded. Fromthose 18 articles, 2 were excluded because they were not availablein full text and 16 because they did not ful ll the other inclusion criteria. Checking references of the 39 remaining articles yieldedno other articles. An updated search resulted another 4 articles so in the end, 43 studies were included in the review (Figure 1). Risk of Bias Risk of bias assessment (Figure 2) revealed that 33 studies20-52had one or more domains assessed as high risk of bias. For 10studies, 53-62unclear was highest, and none of the studies scored only low risk of bias ( Appendix ). Greatest potential sources of high risk were blinding of personnel (37%), blinding of outcomeassessors (26%), and cointerventions (30%).Study Selection The 43 selected studies evaluated interventions in a total of 2837 participants. Study characteristics are shown in Table 1. All participants were diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, except for one study including patients and a control group of healthy partici-pants. 61In almost all studies, pain scores were used as criteria for patients to participate.20-23,25-31,33-35,37-39,42-46,48-56,59-62Four studies also evaluated plantar fascia thickness via radiologic evaluation.27,44,45,48Patients who had undergone foot surgery or previous treatment for plantar fasciitis were excluded in 27 out of 43 studies.21,23,25-31,33-35,38,42,43,46,48,51-56,59-62 Interventions All studies evaluated one or more mechanical interventions for plantar fasciitis. The most studied intervention was the insole. Seventeen studies24,27-30,35,41,43,44,46,48-51,54,59,62compared insoles to another type of insole, no insole, or to a nonmechanical treatment method. Nine studies focused on taping,23,34,40,52,55-58,617 studies on night splints,25,31-33,39,45,472 studies on daytime worn AFOs,20,38and 3 studies on shoes.37,42,51Comparisons were also Figure 1 \u2014Flowdiagram of the database search.

Five studies were conducted at a single visit.48,51,54,60,61Follow-up of the other studies ranged from 3 to 5 days to 12 months. In some studies, participants used more treatments than just the treatment being examined. These additional treatments were applied to all participants in 20 studies20,22,23,25,27,30,33,37-41,45-47,53,57-59and only by part of all participants in 11 studies.26-29,36,38,41,43,46,50,62 Effect of Interventions Outcomes of the included studies are shown in Tables 2and3. Based on previous research, minimal clinically important differences were 9 mm for the visual analog scale, 12 for the Foot Function Index (FFI) \u2014pain, 7 for Foot Function Index \u2014disability, 7 for Foot Function Index \u2014total, 14 for the Foot Health Status Questionnaire \u2014pain, and 7 for Foot Health Status Questionnaire \u2014function.63 Insoles The most studied intervention in the included articles was insoles. Comparisons were made between insole and no-insole use,between prefabricated and customized insoles, and between full- length insoles and heel cups. Of the 25 studies 21,22,24-30,35,36,41-44,46,48-51,53,54,59,60,62investi- gating the effect of insoles on plantar fasciitis, 10 stud-ies 24,26,29,30,44,46,48,49,51,54,62included a control group wearing no insole or a sham orthosis or receiving nonmechanical interventions. Three studies29,44,51reported signi cantly lower pain scores after insole use compared with the control group; one study62found signicantly lower pain scores in the control group receiving a corticosteroid injection, and 5 other studies24,26,30,46,49found no signicant differences in pain between insole and control. Improve- ment in function differed signi cant between insoles and control in 2 out of 5 studies. One study24favored insoles over sham insoles, and another study62favored corticosteroid injections over insoles. Bio- mechanical analysis has been done in 7 studies.29,44,46,48,51,54,62Two studies29,51found a signi cantly larger contact area and signi cantly lower plantar pressure when wearing full-length insoles compared with no insoles, but 2 others found no signi cant differences.Prefabricated Versus Customized Insoles. Six studies24,30,35,43,46,48 focused on differences between pref abricated and customized insoles. Function was assessed in 4 studies.24,35,43,46Two studies24,35 reported an improvement after both prefabricated and customized insole use, whereas the participants in 2 other studies43,46remained at the same function level. None of the included studies found signi - cant differences between both types of insoles. Comparable resultswere found for pain. Both prefabricated and customized insolescaused a pain decrease in all 4 studies evaluating pain, but again, nosignicant differences were found between both groups. 24,30,43,46 Signicant differences between prefabricated and customized in- soles were only found for walking distance, with the customizedinsole being more effective than the prefabricated insole. Heel Pads Versus Full-Length Insoles. Effects of full-length insoles and heel pads were evaluated in 4 studies.27,41,48,54One study found full-length insoles being more effective in painreduction than heel cups, 27but in another study, no signi cant differences between both interventions were found for pain andfunction. 41Biomechanical outcomes were assessed in 2 crossover studies.48,54Both studies found signi cantly lowered heel pressure when wearing a full insole, one study found a signi cantly larger contact during full-length insole use.54 Other Insoles. Two studies50,59compared different types of full- length insoles. One assessed satisfaction of a homogenous andheterogeneous thermoplastic orthosis 50but did not nd a signi - difference. The other one compared accommodative andfunctional insoles. 59Improvements were seen in pain in both groups, but function and quality of life was improved only inthe functional insole group. It is unclear whether differencesbetween groups were signi cant. Shoes Shoe adaptations were evaluated in 3 studies.37,42,51Fong et al51 performed a crossover study with a normal shoe, a rocker shoe, and aflat and customized insole. Pain scores were signi cantly lowered with both rocker shoe conditions and with a normal shoe combinedwith a customized insole. Rocker shoe combined with customized Figure 2 \u2014Risk of bias assessment.

No improvement in function was observed for flatflip- flops, prefabricated insoles and sandals having contours such as the insole, but contoured sandals were more effective in pain reduction thanflatflip-flops.42 Ankle-Foot Orthoses Three studies20,22,38examined the effect of plantar fasciitis. Two compared20,38AFOs with nonmechanical treatments. No signi cant differences in function were found.38 One study20didnd a signi cant differences in pain, with the AFO being more effective, but another study38did not. One study22compared an AFO with a prefabricated insole. No signicant differences in pain and contact area were found. Plantar force was signi cantly lowered in the AFO group. Night Splints Ankle-foot orthoses worn at night were evaluated in 10 arti- cles.21,25,28,31-33,36,39,45,47Five31,33,39,45,47studied patients with and without a night splint. Four31,33,39,45of them assessed pain and 2 found signicantly lower pain scores after night splint use.31,39Function was improved after night splint use in 1 out of 2 studies.31The other one33 did not nd a signi cant difference with or without night splints. A distinction was made between anterior and posterior night splints inone study. Participants wearing the anterior night splint were more satised compared with posterior night splint users. 32 Night Splints Versus Insoles Four studies21,25,28,36compared night splints with insoles. There were no signi cant differences in pain,21,28function,21,36quality of life,36ankle dorsi flexion, and heel tenderness21between night splint or insole use, but combining night splints and insoles did lead to improvement in pain, function,21,25ankle dorsi flexion, and heel tenderness.21One study reported a different result and found signicantly lower pain scores after insole use compared with night splint and night splint +insole. Night splint and night splint + insole did not differ signi cantly.36 Taping A total of 12 studies23,26,34,40,52,53,55-58,60,61investigated the effect of taping on plantar fasciitis. Eight studies23,26,34,53,57,58,60,61used low-dye tape. Mulligan taping.55 Seven studies23,34,40,52,57,58,61compared taping with no treat- ment or sham taping. Of these studies, 6 studies23,40,52,58,61,64had pain as an outcome measure, and they all reported a signi cant decrease in pain in the taping group. Four studies34,40,52,58also reported a signi cant pain reduction in the control group, but all favored taping over no taping or sham taping. Function did not differ signi cantly between taping and no taping,34,52but taping was most effective regarding to weight distribution,57stability,58 and plantar fascia thickness.40 Taping Versus Insoles Three studies26,53,60compared low-dye taping to insoles. All observed a decrease in pain in both taping and insole groups; 2 studies26,53found a signi cant difference between bothinterventions, with the insole being more effective in reducing pain than tape. Insoles were also found to be more effective inimproving function, 53whereas tape led to signi cantly lower mean plantar pressure.60 Discussion The aim of this study was to systematically review the effects ofinsoles, AFOs, shoes, and tape as treatment for plantar fasciitis. Intotal, 43 studies were included, evaluating 2837 patients. Treatingplantar fasciitis mechanically seems to be bene cial in relieving symptoms related to plantar fasciitis. None of the included studies reported a negative effect of mechanical treatment; all werereporting a positive or no effect. Of all included studies, the most investigated treatment was insoles. Insoles in different shapes and materials are used to treatplantar fasciitis. Insoles covering the whole foot have a larger area ofcontact between the insole and the foot compared with heel cups. Alarger contact area improves pressure distribution under the foot andtherefore minimizes peak pressures at the insertion of the plantarfascia. 48,54Moreover, insoles having contours support the longitudinal arch, which is associated with less plantar fascia strain.65However, despite the biomechanical difference s between full-length insoles and heel cups, only one41out of 3 studies reported a signi cantly larger pain decrease after full-length insole use compared with heel cups.The other 2 studies 27,30did not report signi cant differences between both shoe inserts. Furthermore, the effectiveness of prefabricatedinsoles on pain relief was compared with customized insoles. Becausecustomized insoles are individually adapted to the anatomy of aperson 's foot, we expected favorable effects of customized insoles. However, pain and function scores were comparable between pre-fabricated and customized insoles. 24,30,35,43,46 As an alternative to insoles, shoe adaptations might be used to relieve symptoms associated with plantar fasciitis. A commonlyused adaptation is a rocker-soled shoe with a stiff insole andproximal apex position. A more proximal forefoot pressure. Lower plantar flexion moments require less pulling forces of the Achilles tendon, whichleads to a smaller plantar fascia strain during gait. 66-69A proximal apex position in combination with a stiff insole further minimizesplantar fascia strain by preventing excessive bending of the meta-tarsophalangeal joints (MTP joints). 70-72In line with this proposed biomechanical effects of rocker shoes, lowered pain scores werefound after the use of rocker shoes. Interestingly, prescribing rocker shoes combined with contoured insoles led to an even larger pain reduction. 51According to the authors, this was due to the pressure distributing properties of the insole. However, the contoured insoleswere stiffer than the flat insoles, so the extra stiffness of the contoured insole might have an additional effect on minimizingMTP dorsi flexion leading to larger pain reductions compared with rocker shoes with flat insoles. Contoured sandals also seem to have a positive effect on pain related to plantar fasciitis. However, evidenceabout shoe adaptations is limited, and more research is needed toevaluate the effects of shoe sole design on plantar fasciitis. Although rocker shoes aim to relieve pain symptoms and promote healing processes by reducing plantar fascia strain duringgait, the purpose of AFOs is to increase tension on the plantar fasciaduring rest. During sleep, the plantar fascia is in a shortened andnonfunctional state. 47Through slight dorsi flexion at the ankle joint with an AFO, the plantar fascia remains in a lengthened state, andweight-bearing in the morning can better be tolerated by the JSR Vol. 29, No. 5, 2020670 Schuitema et al Brought to you by RIJKSUNIVERSITEIT BIBLIOTEC | Unauthenticated | Downloaded 07/14/20 02:52 PM UTC patient.73In addition, slight tension of the plantar fascia during sleep is hypothesized to promote plantar fascia healing.47Although the evaluated AFOs differ in design (posterior vs anterior) and timeof wearing (day vs night), all had a positive effect on pain and function. Anterior night splints were found to be more comfortable and more effective in pain reduction than posterior night splints,but evidence is weak, as only one study included both types ofnight splints. 32The investigated anterior AFO maintained the ankle angle at 90\u00b0, whereas the posterior AFO positioned the ankle inslight dorsi flexion increases tension on the plantar fascia through the pulling force of the Achilles tendon, possibly leading to more discomfort for the patient. AFOs seem tobe as effective as insoles or stretching, but combining night splintsand insoles led to enhanced improvements in pain and functioncompared with wearing night splints or insoles alone. The previously mentioned treatment options were mostly pre- scribed for a longer period of time ( >1 mo). Taping is mainly used in the short term ( <1 mo) to improve biomechanics of the foot. 52,64,73 Several taping techniques were used in the included studies, but all resulted in improvements in pain and function. It is unclear whethertape or insoles are more effective in reducing plantar fascia com-plaints. Abd El Salam and Abd Elhafz 53favored insoles over tape, whereas Lynch et al26reported the opposite and favored tape over insoles and Van Lunen et al60did not nd signi cant differences between both interventions. Several reasons might be responsible for these contradictory ndings. In the study of Lynch et al,26 participants received tape in the rst 4 weeks of treatment and then used an insole. However, the contribution of each of theinterventions to the reported decrease in pain is unclear. Van Lunenet al 60measured participants once, whereas the others had multiple follow-up sessions ranging over a few weeks.26,53Van Lunen et al60 found signi cantly lowered rearfoot mean peak pressure in patients receiving tape but no signi cant difference in pain scores between tape and insoles. A lowered mean peak pressure might be bene cial in treating plantar fasciitis but maybe only in the long term. If so, it isnot surprising that no signi cant differences in pain scores were visible during that single measurement. Methodological differences such as outcome measures, follow-up time, and treatment design limit comparability betweenstudies. Therefore, we could not conclude which treatment is mosteffective in relieving symptoms associated with plantar fasciitis. Inaddition, risk of bias was moderate to high in all included studiesrequiring cautious interpretation of the obtained results. Largestcontributors to a high risk of bias were lack of blinding, unclear allocation concealment, and use of cointerventions. Especially, the use of cointerventions limits interpretability of the current studyoutcomes. For example, insoles have a bene cial effect on pain and function and their use as cointervention most likely affects overalltreatment outcomes. In addition, the application of cointerventionswas inconsistent and poorly reported. In some studies, additional treatment was provided to all participants, some only to a part and others did not explicitly say whether they allowed additionaltreatment or not. Future studies should avoid cointerventions orinvestigate their interaction with the primary intervention to im-prove interpretability of treatment outcomes. Furthermore, we want to note that less than half of all studies used objective measures such as foot pressure to evaluate mechanical treatment effects. Mechanical treatments aim to modify biomechan- ical characteristics of the foot such as plantar pressure distribution ininsoles or plantar fascia length in rocker shoes and AFOs. To judgethe effectiveness of these mechanical treatments, their biomechani-cal effects should be evaluated in addition to measures of pain andfoot function. For example, musculoskeletal models could be used to establish the effect of rocker shoes on plantar fascia strain during gaitin patients with plantar fasciitis. 72Information on the biomechanical treatment effects can, in turn, be used to understand and improve theeffectiveness of mechanical treatments. Conclusions Mechanical treatment seems to be bene cial in relieving symptoms related to plantar fasciitis. Methodological limitations of currentstudies do not allow to conclude whether any of the investigatedtreatments is more effective in relieving pain or improving footfunction in patients with plantar fasciitis. Combining differenttreatment modalities such as AFOs and insoles or rocker shoesand insoles seems to enhance clinically relevant treatment effects.Future studies should aim to improve methodological quality usingblinding, allocation concealment, avoid cointerventions, and usebiomechanical measures of treatment effects.
