During the first fifteen years the nursing programs became so varied, the enrollment so large, and the contribution to the total community so important that reorganization was necessary. In 1944, at the request of the College of Liberal Arts, the Board of Education authorized the establishment of the College of Nursing. The College began to function as one of the components of the University in the spring of 1945. In 1947 under the leadership of Katherine Faville, the College's first dean, the faculty assumed full responsibility for teaching clinical nursing courses. This was the first time the shifting of clinical teaching from hospital staff to nursing faculty was initiated. This model has now been incorporated by colleges and schools of nursing. Graduates from this program were eligible to take the examination for the registered nurse license. Since 1945, the College has had programs leading to the degree of Master of Science in Nursing. These programs offer advanced practice preparation for nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists. In 1975, the College began offering a program leading to the Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing. The Ph.D. summer option was initiated in 1984. College of Nursing Mission Statement The mission of the College of Nursing is to create and translate knowledge and to educate a diverse student body prepared to excel as clinicians, scholars, a nd leaders who improve health in local and global communities. MSN Mission Statement The mission of the Master of Science in Nursing Program is to prepare Advanced Practice Registered Nurses to critically evaluate and apply scientific evidence to clinical practice to provide high- quality health care to individuals and communities and to improve health outcomes. Graduate Certificate Mission St atement s The mission of the Graduate Certificate in Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner is to prepare Advanced Practice Registered Nurses to evaluate critically and apply scientific evidence to clinical practice to provide high- quality health care to individuals with critical, acute, or chronic healthcare needs to improve health outcomes. The mission of the Graduate Certificate in Nurse-Midwife is to prepare Advanced Practice Registered Nurses to critically evaluate and apply scientific evidence to clinical practice to provide high- quality women's health, newborn and midwifery care to individuals, families, and communities and to improve health outcomes. The mission of the Graduate Certificate in Pediatric Nursing Practitioner-Acute Care Program is to prepare Advanced Practice Registered Nurses to critically evaluate and apply scientific evidence to clinical practice to provide high-quality health pediatric care in acute care settings to individuals and families and to improve health outcomes. The mission of the Graduate Certificate in Pediatric Nursing Practitioner -Primary Care Program is to prepare Advanced Practice Registered Nurses to critically evaluate and apply scientific evidence to OVERVIEW OF COLLEGE v i i clinical practice to provide high -quality health pediatri c care in primary care settings to individuals, families, and communities and to improve health outcomes. The mission of the Graduate Certificate Program in Complementary Therapies in Healthcare is to prepare nurses at the graduate level to understand Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies, their effects on the body and mind, research on their effectiveness and the cultural aspects of their use. The mission of the Graduate Certifi cate in Nursing Education is to prepare nurses for teaching positions in educational and service settings. The certificate provides nurses with essential knowledge and skills in teaching, program development, evaluation, and clinical instruction. Vision The College of Nursing will be the leader in nursing research and education, known for our commitment to and impact on urban healt h Philosophy The College of Nursing functions within the context of Wayne State University and supports the central goals an d mission of the University. These goals are to nurture the intellectual abilities of students and faculty and to provide education, research, and community service. As an urban university, Wayne State accepts responsibility for a reciprocal partnership wi th the community, using resources and knowledge in dealing with urban life. Nursing is an academic discipline and profession. As a discipline, nursing develops its body of knowledge using research as the major mode of discovery and validation. The scholarl y environment of the university enhances the research and theory development endeavors of the College of Nursing. As a profession, nursing uses knowledge creatively in response to the health care needs of society. Experience in a variety of clinical settin gs is the primary mode for the development of practice competencies. The urban context of the University provides a setting for exploring the application of knowledge to professional nursing practice. The concepts that order the discipline and profession o f nursing are derived from knowledge about human beings, health care, and environment. These concepts give identity to professional nursing practice, direct inquiry, and theory development. The College of Nursing supports the importance of the liberal arts , the humanities, and sciences in nursing education . The f aculty believes that programs designed for the preparation of nurses must be composed of the intellectual, social, and technical components of a liberal and professional education that are available to students within an institution of higher learning. Faculty affirms the necessity and value of clinical practice within a professional nursing program. Experience in a variety of clinical settings is the primary mode for the development of practice competencies. Faculty believes that learners are self -directed and actively participate in the learning process. Self -direction encourages the development of personal goals and values significant to the profession of nursing. Knowledge acquisition, capacity f or critical inquiry, reflection and decision making prepare s learners for responding to issues that confront them as professionals. Learners from diverse backgrounds enter the College of Nursing to begin or continue their education within the academic dis cipline of nursing. The f aculty believes the diverse characteristics of its students add to the richness of the learning experience. The program seeks to accommodate the special needs, interests, and abilities of the students. The faculty supports the righ t of students to question, challenge, and debate within the context of inquiry as an essential ingredient in the students' development. Continuing evaluation on the part of students and faculty is essential to sustain the integrity of the program. The facu lty of the College of Nursing, as members of the academic community, recognizes that its professional functions extend beyond contributions to formal teaching. Research, practice, and community service are also expectations of the faculty role. The faculty views as essential academic freedom, shared governance, opportunity to develop knowledge, and responsibility to incorporate new v i i i knowledge into teaching and nursing practice. The faculty assumes responsibility for enhancing the image of the College of Nurs ing and the University locally and nationally through various avenues including research, scholarship, practice, consultation, and participatory decision making. ix TABLE OF CONTENTS TABLE ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE x OFFICE OF STUDENT AFFAIRS College of Nursing - Office of Student Affairs (OSA) Cohn Building, Suite 10 (313) 577 -4082, toll free (888) 837 nursinginfo @wayne.edu website: www.nursing.wayne.edu The Office of Student Affairs (OSA) is responsible for a variety of activities, including recruitment, admissions, orientation, retention, academic support, and undergradu ate academic advising.

Students are expected to meet these standards of excellence. The following scholarship policies must be achieved to enable a student to progress toward degree completion. Scholarship Regulation Topic MSN/Graduate Certificate Enrollment Regulations During course work, students must be enrolled each semester during the academic year (i.e., Fall/Winter) while in a MSN or graduate certificate program, unless they have an approved leave of absence on file. Students may request a leave of absence with their academic advisor and must complete the appropriate paperwork. a. MSN students who fail to enroll in both Fall AND Winter semester of a given academic year and who do not have a leave of absence form on file will be reviewed by the MSN Program Committee and may be excluded from the program. b. A leave of absence does not stop the time allowed for completing the degree. Progression in Non - clinical courses MSN students must maintain an overall GPA in masters coursework of B (3.00) in order to progress in the program. a. B- is an acceptable grade (except in the clinical courses) as long as the student maintains a GPA average of B (3.00) in MSN course work. b. The GPA cannot be below a 3.00 for more than one semester. c. There is no limit in the number of B - grades t he student receives, as long as, the student maintains a 3.00 average . Progression in Clinical Course The following academic regulations are related to all clinical nursing courses (i.e., advanced assessment [NUR 7030] and all specialty clinical courses): a) a. Clinical course grades are comprised of two components, didactic and clinical. Students must achieve a B (83%) or higher in both components to satisfactorily pass a clinical co urse. b) b. In calculating the final score, if both the didactic and clinical components are above 83%, the grades are weighted according to the course syllabus, then combined, and a final letter grade is assigned in accordance with the graduate grading sca le. c) c. In calculating the final score, if eithe r the didactic or clinical components of the course are below 83% the grades are weighted according to the course syllabus and combined as follows: i. If the combined course grade is above 83%, the highest course grade that can be assigned is B minus. ii. If the combined course grade is below 83% , the actual calculated grade is assigned. d) d. In calculating the final score, if both the didactic and clinical component of the course are below 83% the grades are weighted according to the course syllabus, then combined, and a final letter grade is assigned. e) e. A grade of less than 83% in a clinical nursing course is unsatisfactory for progression in the clinical sequence. f) f. A student is allowed to retake an \"unsatisfactory\" clinical course one time. If the student does not achieve a B in the repeated course the student will be excluded from the Program. Course Repeating A student must repeat a graduate course in which a grade of C+, C, or F is earned in a non-clinical course or a B - in a clinical course. A student must repeat a graduate course in which a B - or below is earned in a clinical course. An individual course may be repeated only once. No more than two courses may be repeated . ACADEMICS 2 The original grade for the course will remain on the student's transcript, but only the grade received in repetition of the course will be used in computation of the student's honor point average. Students will receive University financial aid for one repeat of a course. A student must complete a \"Request to Repeat a Graduate Course\" form, which is available on the CON website at www.nursing.wayne.edu . The completed form should be signed by their advisor, and submitted to the Direc tor of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs for approval. WF or F grades Students who earn a WF or F (74% or below) grade are at risk for exclusion from the program. a. Although a grade of WF or F does not result in an automatic exclusion from the program, the student's overall performance in the program (e.g., grades, attainment of benchmarks) to date will be reviewed by the MSN Program Committee. Exclusion Policies MSN students will be excluded from the program for one of the following reasons: a. Failure to maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 for more than one semester. b. Students who receive a third unsatisfactory grade. c. Academic or nonacademic misconduct as defined by WSU. d. Unsafe or unethical practice behavior. Grade/Exclusion Appeals Grade Appeal Only the manner in which the grade was assigned can be appealed. The student assumes the burden of proof in the appeals process. Three grounds for grade appeals exist: 1. the application of non -academic criteria in the grading process, as listed in the university's non -discrimination/affirmative action statute: race, color, sex (including gender identity), national origin, rel igion, age, sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, height, weight, disability, or veteran status; 2. Sexual harassment or discrimination; or 3. Evaluation of student work by criteria not directly reflective of performance relative to course requir ements. A student who disputes the final grade awarded for any of the above reasons should follow the steps outlined in the grade appeal process. Unsafe Practice and Exclusion Appeal: Students must contact the College of Nursing, Assistant Dean of Enrollment and Student Affairs for the steps in the appeal process for unsafe practice or program exclusion within ten (10) days of oral notice or postmark of written notice of unsafe practice. Academic and Non -Academic Misconduct Appea ls: All reports and student appeals for academic and non -academic misconduct should follow the university code of conduct policies. Progression to Candidacy Requirements Not Applicable for MSN students Timeline MSN Students have a six (6) year time limit to complete all requirements for the master's degree. The six -year period begins with the end of the semester during which the student was admitted and was taking course work toward meeting the requirements of the degree Students whose six -year time limit is expiring may be considered for an extension. Students must submit a request for extension, along with a letter of support from their MSN/graduate certificate program advisor to the MSN/GC Committee 6 months prior to their expiration date. Subsequent extensions will not be considered in the absence of substantial progress during the previous year. A student whose time limit has expired is regarded by the requisite committee as automatically terminated from the program u nless the department submits an appropriately justified request for a time extension and the Graduate School approves that request. 3 Graduate Certificate Students have a three (3) year time limit to complete all requirements for the graduate certificate p rograms. The three -year period begins with the end of the semester during which the student was admitted and was taking course work toward meeting the requirements of the degree Students whose three year time limit is expiring may be considered for an ex tension. Students must submit a request for extension, along with a letter of support from their MSN/graduate certificate program advisor to the MSN/GC Committee 6 months prior to their expiration date. Subsequent extensions will not be considered in the absence of substantial progress during the previous year. A student whose time limit has expired is regarded by the requisite committee as automatically terminated from the program unless the department submits an appropriately justified request for a time extension and the Graduate School approves that request. Revalidation of Courses The MSN/GC committee reserves the right of revalidation of over -age (10 years) credits. Credits earned at WSU and other institutions may require revalidation at the time of WSU admission. In revalidation cases, the advisor and the student must set a terminal date for completion of all degree requirements, including such additional requirements as may be prescribed to revalidate the over -age credits. Residency requirements MSN A minimum of twenty -four (24) semester hours of the degree must be earned at WSU. Graduate Certificate A minimum of 12 -24 semester hours of the degree must be earned at WSU depending on the specialty. Graduation requirements MSN Degree Granting Requirements Candidates for the MSN must complete thirty -eight (38) to fifty -three (53) credits of study with a cumulative grade point average (at graduation) of 3.0 or better. All course work must be completed in accordance with the academic pr ocedures of the College and the Graduate School governing graduate scholarship and degrees. Graduate Certificate in the CON Degree Granting Requirements Candidates for any Graduate Certificate in the College of Nursing must complete 12 to 24 credits of study (depending on the specialty) with a cumulative honor point average of 3.0 or better. All course work must be completed in accordance with the academic procedures of the College and the Graduate School governing graduate scholarship and degrees. Scholarship Guidelines Regular and punctual attendance in class is a component of learning and is expected. See Graduate Bulletin for policies re: \"Obligations of Faculty and Students to the Ethics\", \"Drop/Add -Adjusting your - 100% 4.0 = 3.33 B = 83% - 88% = 3.0 ** B- = 81% - 82% = 2.67 C+ = 80% - 79% = 2.33 4 C = 75% - 78 = 2.0 F = 74% and below = 0.0 **A grade earned in a graduate course with honor point value less than 3.00 is below graduate standards. Attendance Regular punctual attendance in classes and clinical practice is expected. It is imperative that students maintain a perfect or near -perfect attendance record. Tardiness and/or failure to report to class can result in a lowering of the final course grade or exclusion from the course. Residency Requirement A minimum of twenty -four (24) semester credits must be in resid ence at Wayne State University for completion of the master's degree. Transfer of Graduate Credit In work toward the master's degree, credit beyond the twenty -four (24) credits , which must be earned in residence , may be transferred from accredited graduate schools, provided such credit is \"B\" or better and certified as graduate -level credit on an official transcript. The petition must be supported by an official transcript showing a minimum grade of \"B\" for the co urses to be transferred. \"B -minus\" credit is not acceptable for transfer. Transfer credits must be appropriate to the student's degree. Admission to Wayne State University based upon a previously earned master's degree does not guarantee that those credit s are applicable to a graduate degree at Wayne State University. Procedure: Petitions for transfer of graduate credit to be taken at another institution after admission to WSU must be filed prior to the student's enrollment in the course. Prior advisor's approval is not binding unless the Graduate Officer of the College of Nursing has also approved the student's petition. Time Limitation Students have a six -year time limit to complete all requirements for the master's degree. The six -year period begins with the end of the semester during which the student has taken work which ap plies toward meeting the requirements of the degree. The College reserves the right of revalidation of over -age credits. Students are not permitted to revalidate credits earned at other institutions. In revalidation cases, the advisor and the student must set a terminal date for completion of all degree requirements, including such additional requirements as may be prescribed to revalidate the over -age credits. Time extensions beyond these conditions are authorized only for conditions clearly beyond the stu dent's control. Guidelines for MSN Program Extension Request may be obtained from the Office of Student Affairs. Graduate Course Repeat Policy and Procedure A graduate student may repeat up to two courses one time, with prior approval, if a grade of C+ o r lower was earned. NOTE: The opportunity to repeat a graduate course is determined by the student's ability to progress in the program as determined by the academic regulations of the college and with approval by the Director of Advanced Practice and Gra duate Certificate Programs . Procedure: Approval to repeat a course must be obtained prior to registration . The \"Request to Repeat a Graduate Course\" form can be found here: www.gradschool.wayne.edu/ form s/RepeatCourse.pdf . The student is responsible for completing the form and obtaining the proper signatures before registering for the course. Failure to obtain prior approval to repeat a course means that grades earned in the original course and in the repeat course will be used in determining the student's honor point average. Mark of \"I\" - Incomplete The University policy on the mark of \"I\" (Incomplete) can be found in the University Bulletin. To insure completion to the po licy, the College of Nursing Faculty Association approved on February 2, 1994 the following College policy. 5 An \"I\" is appropriate if the student encounters a catastrophic situation which prevents completion of the final requirements of the course. An \"I\" i s not appropriate for unsatisfactory performance. In the event an \"I\" is given, the time limit for completion will be determined by the instructor, but may not exceed one year. In the event a grade of \"I\" is received in a prerequisite course, the \"I\" must be removed prior to enrollment in the subsequent course. Withdrawal from Nursing Courses A student requesting a withdrawal will be assigned a Withdrawal Passing (WP), Withdrawal Failing (WF), or Withdrawal Non -Attendance (WN). The faculty of the College of Nursing supports the University policy which stipulates that the use of an \"I\" or \"W\" to mask unsuccessful performance is inappropriate After the 4th week of class the instructor must approve a withdrawal. Students must show diligence and are normally expected to complete the courses they elect. Irresponsible attendance is wasteful of both student and University resources. Those students, who consistently receive excessive marks of \"I\" (Incomplete), and \"W\" (Withdrawal), may be refused the privilege of further registration by the Dean or Dean's designee of their school or college. Students experiencing attendance difficulties should seek counseling from appropriate college or university offices. Authorized L eave of Absence Policy A student may request an Authorized Leave of Absence when personal circumstances (e.g., birth, death, serious illness, major financial challenges), interfere with the student's ability to devote sufficient time to academic pursuits t o assure a reasonable expectation of success. Authorized Leaves of Absence are requested from and granted by the Associate Dean for Academic and Clinical Affairs and the Director of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs. 1. Currently enrolled students will be granted a Leave of Absence only if they are passing all nursing courses at 75% or better (UG) or 83% or better (Graduate) and are therefore eligible for Withdrawal Passing (WP) grades. 2. The student considering a req uest for an authorized Leave of Absence should contact the Office of Student Affairs for an explanation of the process regarding the leave of absence and to determine if she or he is eligible. 3. A Leave of Absence is approved for a maximum of 1 y ear. A student who receives an authorized Leave of Absence and returns before the Leave of Absence expires is guaranteed a space in the program. An authorized Leave of Absence is not considered a withdrawal from the program. 4. A student who does not re -enter the program by the end of the authorized period will be considered a voluntary withdrawal. 5. A student who withdraws from any nursing program for any reason must reapply to the College of Nursing as a new applicant. A student who takes an unauth orized leave of absence, or fails to register during each academic year will be considered to have voluntarily withdrawn from the program and must apply for admission to the College of Nursing as a new applicant. 6. A grade of Withdrawal Pass (WP) is not the same as an authorized leave of absence. 7. All approved leave of absence requests will require notification of the student's academic advisor, Director of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs, Office of Student Affairs, and specialt y coordinators as applicable. Distance Learning Program 6 Synchronous distance learning is offered to students who meet eligibility requirements. Residency requirements must be met and students are required to be in Michigan for the clinical experiences (e.g. NUR 7030). Information about the distance learning pro gram is available on the website at http://nursing.wayne.edu/programs/distance -learning.php and in the MSN Student Handbook. Distance Learning Policies Distance Learning is a privilege to students offered by the College of Nursing. This document explains policies of the Distance Learning (DL) Program. If a policy is violated, the student will forfeit distance learning privileges. Some courses may requi re students to attend class -related events at the Detroit campus. These events will be identified in course syllabi. I. Distance Course Scheduling and Admissions: A. Scheduling: All distance sections within a specific course will connect to one designated o n- campus section. For example, (and hypothetically) all distance sections for NUR 7015 Research for Evidence Based Nursing will connect to NUR 7015 section 001 instead of choosing between sections 001, 002, or 003. If the number of distance locations (nu mber of dial -in squares) exceeds the maximum number allowed, a second section will be designated for distance. All distance students must plan for on -site course delivery in Detroit for NUR 7030 Advanced Nursing Assessment. B. Admissions: Distance Learning students must agree to adhere to the distance policies prior to the start of each semester. Distance Learning Policies are available on the College of Nursing IT Canvas Site and College of Nursing website. C. Canvas: In order to assist w ith posting, exams, and other distance issues, the Distance Learning Coordinator will be added to the Canvas site of every distance learning course. D. Maximum Class Size: The combined total number of students enrolled in a course that has distance section s will be determined by the Associate Dean, Faculty Affairs based upon teaching workload. The combined total includes students on campus, at the distance classroom site(s), and offsite. E. Total Number of Distance Students per program: At any given time and a cross cohorts, there will be no more than twenty (20) DNP distance students and fifty (50) MSN or Graduate Certificate program distance students. For the MSN and Graduate Certificate programs, the number per program will be determined by the MSN Specialty Coordinators, Graduate Certificate Program Coordinators, and Graduate Program Director. Graduate Coordinators will report the number of new admissions to the Distance Learning Coordinator, and the Distance Learning Coordinator will send an updated report to Program Directors every semester. F. Synchronous Distance Learning Program: The College will continue to arrange for distance courses and classrooms as needed based upon all distance students' plans of work. G. Attendance Requirements: Distance Students m ay be expected to come to campus a maximum of 3 times per course. Dates will be outlined in the course syllabus and available before the start of the semester II. Distance Learning Professional Responsibilities and Behaviors: A. Technical Requirements: To minimize technical issues, students and faculty must use the video conferencing technology that meets the technical requirements listed below: 1. Hardwire Capable Computer 2. Ethernet Cable 3. Webcam 4. Headset 5. High-Speed Internet Connection 7 B. All users must perform a s uccessful test connection with the College of Nursing IT Department. The user must schedule the test connection well in advance by calling 313 -577-8604. C. When troubleshooting issues, be patient with everyone. Most issues cannot be foreseen and working r emotely has its challenges. D. Users must: 1. Abide by all rules set in place by the instructor in the syllabus. For example, if on campus students may not eat during class, distance students cannot do so either. 2. Keep the microphone and computer muted when not talking unless otherwise requested by faculty. Small noises tend to be amplified. 3. Set up the computer on a desk or a table in a room with minimal distractions. Small children, pets, ringing phones, and other noises are distracting for everyone. Behavior should be professional. Side conversations are not professional and is disruptive to the class. Focus on the class at hand and participate. Because of a sound lag common with video conferencing, this may require additional effort. 4. When online with the class, be cognizant of attire and what is reflected. 5. Be aware of lighting issues. Lighting distorts visibility. Bright lights shining in one direction can create glare. Front lighting is required. Window light and lighting behind the student needs to be blocked. E. If a student violates the policies listed above, the distance connection will be immediately disconnected. III. Examination Policy: A. Examinations: In order to maintain the integrity of the academic programs in the College of Nursing, all exami nations within a course must be given using the same method. For example, if proctored paper and pencil tests are given to students on campus, all students at distance sites will also be given proctored paper and pencil tests. If tests are proctored and g iven by Respondus on campus, all students at distance sites will be given examinations via Respondus Monitor and proctored by the Distance Learning Coordinator or faculty. All examinations designated as \"proctored exams\" must be proctored. College of Nursing proctored course examinations must be taken either on campus or at a proctored distance site. Offsite students must make arrangements with the Distance Learning Coordinator to take any proctored examination either on campus or at the nearest dist ance proctored site. If unwilling to travel to the nearest \"proctored exam site \", the student will be responsible for fees related to proctored exams. B. Accommodations for Exams 1. If a student has a documented disability that requires accommodations for examinations, longer time for examinations, etc.; the student will need to register with Student Disability Services for coordination of academic accommodations. The Student Disabil ity Services (SDS) office is located at 1600 David Adamany Undergraduate Library in the Student Academic Success Services department. SDS telephone numbers are 313-577-1851 or 313-577-3365 (TDD only). 2. Distance students with disabilities must contact the Distance Learning Coordinator at 313-577-1363 to finalize arrangements. IV. Off-Site Qualifications and Exceptions: A. Off Site Qualifications: An offsite student is a studen t who attends the majority of classes from home instead of attending class in Detroit or at a distance site. In order to be considered a permanent offsite student, the student's official address must be a minimum of 60 miles from the closest classroom site . The Distance Learning Coordinator will assess the distance from the student's home address to the WSU main campus using an online distance calculator to ensure the minimum distance requirement is being met. If the distance requirement is met, the Distan ce Learning Coordinator notifies the Assistant Dean of Enrollment Management and Student Services of the student's status as a permanent offsite student. B. Exceptions to the Off Site Qualification: 8 1. Long Term Exception: An admitted student may request a per manent off site exception to the above qualifications. Decisions to grant a permanent off site exception will be done on a case -by-case basis. Long term exceptions do not apply to NUR 7030 Advanced Physical Assessment as it is not offered as a distance cou rse. Exceptions are granted using the following procedures: a. The student completes an exception form and submits it to the Distance Learning Coordinator. b. The Distance Learning Coordinator submits the exception request to the Associate Dean, Academic and Clinical Affairs. c. The final decision to grant an exception is determined by the Associate Dean, Academic and Clinical Affairs. d. The Associate Dean, Academic and Clinical Affairs notifies the Distance Learning Coordinator and the Assistant Dean of Enrollment Management and Student Services. 2. Short Term Off -Site Exceptions: Any College of Nursing student can use the video conferencing technology for a short period of time (e.g. a few weeks or one semester) on an exception basis provided that the class is bein g held in a classroom with distance learning technology. The student will work with the Distance Learning Coordinator throughout the exception process. All questions can be directed to the Distance Learning Coordinator. If the student is requesting an e xception for the entire semester, the student needs to submit the request prior to the override and registration process. If the exception is being done on an emergent basis mid -semester, it may take the Distance Learning Coordinator and IT staff up to 3 business days to get the student set -up. Short term exceptions are granted at the faculty member and Associate Dean of Academic and Clinical Affair's discretion using the following procedures: a. The student completes an exception form and submits it to the Distance Learning Coordinator and faculty of record for the course. b. The Distance Learning Coordinator submits the exception request to the Associate Dean of Academic and Clinical Affairs. c. The final decision to grant an exception is determined by the A ssociate Dean of Academic and Clinical Affairs after consultation with faculty of record. If the faculty of record and Associate Dean of Academic and Clinical Affairs denies the request, there is no additional recourse. d. The Associate Dean, Academic and Clinical Affairs notifies the Distance Learning Coordinator. e. The Distance Learning Coordinator notifies the student College IT Department, and College Office of Student Affairs of the exception. f. IT staff work to get the student set -up with software and c onducts a test connection.

The College of Nursing has contracts with each agency which require a Health Clearance, BCLS Certification, Liability Insurance, and a current RN licensure. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in exclusion from clinical experiences. After the documents are submitted to Castle Branch , the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) will provide Clinical Permits to the Director of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs and copies will be provided to Specialty Coordinators and Course Coordinators prior to the start of the clinical courses. Health forms and renewal dates on all required documents must be updated just prior to submission of the forms on August 15 for fall semester, December 15 for winter semester, and April 15 for Spring/Summer semester. The Clinical Permit will be good for one semester. Note that if the Michigan license expires during the semester, the student must submit the renewal minimally two weeks prior to the expiration date or the Clinical Permit will be invalid. Students will incur a one-week penalty for start of clinicals if the deadline date is missed. For each subsequent week the permit is not valid, additional one-week penalties will be added. Students will not be allowed to start clinicals until faculty and students receive a clearance and start date from the Director of Advanced Practice and Graduate Certificate Programs . Students are not allowed to attend clinical without a valid Clinical Permit. If students attend clinical without a valid Clinical Permit, those clinical hours will not count towards the total number of hours required for the course and students may be subject to disciplinary action . The deadline for changes in plans of work involving a course that requires a clinical permit is one month prior to each semester's clinical permit deadline date. Requirements: Documentation of compliance with these requirements must be uploaded to CastleBranch-Immunization Tracker by the stated deadline. Students can access Immunization Tracker online at www.portal.castlebranch.com/WL48 ACEMAPP If attending an ACE site, students must complete the requirements for ACE, the Alliance for the Clinical Experience. Requirements include successful completion of on-line classes and exams in HIPAA, OSHA, and BBP. Health Clearance The examination may be completed by the student's nurse practitioner or physician and the required form filled out and submitted. The TB skin test must be in effect for the entire semester. Vaccinations and/or evidence of immunity are required for Tdap, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, Hepatitis B and influenza. Students must provide copies of the actual laboratory reports for all antibody titers. Basic Cardiac Life Support - BCLS- Level C Students entering the College of Nursing must demonstrate evidence of completion of a CPR course (Basic Cardiac Life Support for Adult and Infant) of approximately 8- 12 hours; certification must be in effect for the entire academic year. The course may be taken at several agencies in the community. Students must verify current status of their CPR for the Professional Rescuer annually. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE 16 Flu Vaccine Flu Vaccine In orde r to meet the requirement of clinical agencies, the student must submit documentation for the flu vaccine by October 15. If this documents are not submitted, the Clinical Permit will be rescinded and the student will be excluded from clinical experiences. Liability Insurance Wayne State University College of Nursing will provide professional liability insurance through Nursing Practice Corporation, at a cost of approximately $13.38 per student. Students must submit this fee online and the link is found on nursing.wayne.edu . (Nurse -Midwife students are required to purchase an individual student policy.) The policy is valid August 15 - August 14, and is not prorated. Maintaining Licensure The student must show proof of being a currently licensed RN in the United States when admitted to the program [See admission requirements for non -domestic students) . Out-of-state domestic students have two semesters to submit a Michigan RN licensure ; international students have two semesters to pass the NCLEX exam and su bmit a Michigan RN license. If a student fails to submit a Michigan RN license by the end of two semesters , the student cannot progress in the program until the license is submitted. The student must maintain current licensure for the duration of the progr am. Should the license expire or be revoked for any reason, it is the student's responsibility to report this to the Office of Student Affairs. The student may not continue in the program until current licensure is restored. If licensure was revoked and re instated, the student must report any conditions attached for future practice. Submission of the renewed Michigan RN license is due by March 31st. Criminal Background Investigation According to Public Health Code Section 20173 and Section 21173(1), any individual who regularly provides direct services to patients and residents in nursing homes, county medical facilities, homes for the aged and adult foster care cannot be granted clinical privileges if they have been convicted of one or more of the follow ing: a) A felony or an attempt or conspiracy to commit a felony within the 15 years preceding the date of application. b) A misdemeanor involving abuse, neglect, assault, battery, or criminal sexual conduct or involving fraud or theft against a vulnerable adult defin ed in the Michigan penal code, 1931 PA 328, MCL 750.145m, or a state or federal crime that is substantially similar to a Misdemeanor described in this subdivision within 10 years immediately preceding the date of application. This legislation as well as regulatory agency requirements mandates that students have a criminal history check conducted in order to gain clinical privileges at the various agencies used during the course of the student's education. Exclusion from a clinical site could jeopardize successful completion of the program. Students must have a criminal background check performed by Castlebranch .com. Urine Drug Screen Testing In addition to the criminal background i nvestigation, many health care agencies require results of a urine drug screen test (negative result) prior to the beginning of your clinical experience. This should be obtained at the Wayne State University Campus Health Center. MSN and DNP students who are Distance Learn ers can use a local faculty. The screen must include the following drugs: use of medical marijuana will provide a positive result on a urine drug screen. Students with a Medical Marijuana Registry Identification Card will be required to submit a valid copy to the Office of Student Affairs. Wayne State College of Nursing's clinical partners may exclude a student with a positive drug screen from attending clinical courses at their site, which could jeopardize the successful completion of the program. 17 Results of the Urine Drug Screen test must be submitted to OSA and will become part of your health information file. Clinical Attire Graduate students registered in clinical courses must wear a uniform or lab coat appropriate for the agency in which the clinical experience occurs. ID Badge All nursing students are required to obtain a Wayne State University One Card. Students wear their OneCard while at their clinical site. OneCards can be obtained from the university OneCard office, located on the second floor of the Welcome Center. Misuse of the OneCard will result in immediate forfeiture and possible disciplinary action. 18 Check List for Clinical Requirements Effective date must coincide with semester start Date Submitted Create CastleBranch Immunization Tracker Account Health Clearance Form with Immunization record TDAP (Tetanus, Diptheria, Pertussis) Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, Influenza Titers and record Hepatitis B Virus Inoculation Titers and immunizations (mandatory) CPR for the Professional Rescuer (Annual verification) TB Skin Tes t or documentation of no active TB (Annual verification) Pay fee for Professional Liability Insurance (Annual verification) Criminal Background Investigation Urine Drug Screen ACE requirements (classes) (Annual) 19 LE OF CONTENTS TABLE To ensure that all students are ready for NUR 7030 (offered Spring/Summer semesters), you are required to pass a written exam and demonstrate a physical examination. The expectation in 7030 is that each student will have a rudimentary knowledge of the basic assessment skills, which includes the ability to demonstrate basic skills and understand the rationale for the assessment skill. The written exam is based on the undergraduate nursing assessment course. It is a multiple- choice exam with 50 randomized questions using Respondus and it is open book. The written exam covers questions related to basic physical assessment techniques and content. The physical exam demonstration covers basic physical assessment skills. Each student will have three attempts to pass the written exam with a score of 75% or better. The exam will be open for seven hours during each attempt at the exam. The examination will be available on Canvas under the NUR 7030 PreTest tab and students will be informed of the \"go live\" date during the Winter semester before they take NUR 7030. After you have passed the written exam, you may contact Mrs. Christine Seaver (ef8107@wayne.edu) to sign up for ONE (1) time slot for the demonstration exam of your physical assessment skills. The schedule is available on Canvas under the Skills Demonstration Schedule tab. No cancellations are accepted. Students cannot cancel and request a new sign up date. All students except the neonatal students will demonstrate an adult/adolescent basic physical examination using the rubric provided on Canvas. Neonatal students have a separate physical exam pre-assessment rubric. The Rubrics for the pre-assessment will be posted on the website. Use the rubric to practice for this portion of the pre-assessment. All students must pass the complete exam with the majority of the skills (90 %) demonstrated to our clinical skills lab staff. The areas that the faculty believe you may need to review or remediate will be identified. These areas are the sections you should read about and review before starting NUR 7030. Distance students who live 6 0 miles or more from campus can demonstrate a physical examination from a remote location or they can demonstrate the exam on campus. Students are provided a systematic process for demonstrating the exam from a remote location. Ms. Seaver, the distance learning coordinator, will work with each student to facilitate the process. For all students, once both assessment processes are completed, you may receive an over- ride to register for NUR 7030. In summary, the pre-assessment process is as follows: 1.

Any diagnostic testing, prescriptions or subsequent visits are the responsibility of the student. (*) Walk-ins should be no later than 3:00 p.m. for both clinics Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Plan All students should use extreme caution in the care of their patients to avoid needle sticks and exposure to Bloodborne pathogens. All students will use Universal Precaution in all patient care settings. In the event of a needle stick or exposure to bloodborne pathogens: Students who are possibly exposed to bloodborne pathogens by way of needle sticks or exposure to human body fluids must report the exposure to their clinical instructor immediately . They should wash off STUDENT INJURY POLICY 21 or flush out exposure as soon as pos sible after it occurs according the guidelines provided by the ACE modules or the clinical agency.\" 1. Exposure during a precepted experience must be reported immediately to the preceptor and as soon as possible to the course faculty member. 2. For students who are possibly exposed to bloodborne pathogens by way of needle sticks or exposure to human body fluids at off -campus sites, such as hospitals or community health settings, the following policy will apply o For exposures in a hospital or another agency with a policy covering possible exposure to bloodborne pathogens, the policy of the facility will be followed. o For exposures in a setting where there is no policy on possible exposure to bloodborne pathogens, the student should either report immediately to University Health Center (UHC), 4K (7:30 a.m. -3:30 p.m.*) or Henry Ford Health Center -Harbortown Suite 100 (8:00a.m. -4:30p.m.*) located on Jefferson just west of Belle Isle or to their personal health care provider (at your own expense). If the injury occurs after the previously mentioned clinic's operational hour, the student has the option to go to Detroit Receiving or Henry Ford Emergency Room for initial treatment. If the a gency does not cover the cost of testing for students, students are responsible for the cost of testing beyond the initial treatment for exposure (health insurance may cover): HIV antibody Hepatitis B surface antibody Hepatitis C antibody Testing for Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (e.g. Ebola and Marburg fevers) Pregnancy test (for women) 22 OF CONTENTS E Skill Laboratory (Rooms 217 & 219 Cohn) The Skill laboratory is a practice lab with simulated hospital bedside units. Students practice various nursing procedures under the guidance of a nursing faculty. Physical Assessment Learning Laboratory (Room 30 Cohn) The Physical Ass essment Learning Laboratory (PAL) provides materials, activities, and facilities for students to acquire skills in history-taking and physical assessment and is located on the lower level of the Cohn Building. It is equipped with study carrels and physical examination rooms. Students learn physical examination skills through the use of demonstration, media viewing, and practice. Office of Health Research (Room 315 Cohn) The Office of Health Research ( OHR), the research arm of the College of Nursing, embodies the commitment of faculty to research. The idea of a center originated with faculty in the mid-60: it became a reality in 1969. It was the first such center in an academic setting devoted to the generation of new knowledge which underpins the discipline and profession of nursing. The research program of the Office of Health Research ( OHR) focuses on nursing and health-related research, including interdisciplinary research, for the purpose of advancing nursing knowledge and improving nursing and health , particularly Urban Health. Because the research objectives also target health needs of the urban community, the research agenda also advances the research programs of the University. Visit the website to learn more about the OHR at http://www.nursing.wayne.edu/research/index.htm. Simulation Laboratory (Room 221 Cohn) The Simulation Laboratory contains state-of -the art technology (including high fidelity mannequin simulators and audio-visual real-time capture) to provide the student with an immersive and interactive environment which enhances student learning. Students, in conjunction with faculty, are able to practice and blend skills taught in the Nursing Skills Laboratory, Physical Assessment Learning Laboratory and the classroom. Because of the immersive nature of the simulation environment, students are required to behave in a professional manner and wear approved Wayne State University clinical uniforms when in the Simulation Laboratory. RESOURCES 23 CONTENTS E Since education is a cooperative effort between teacher and student, both parties must fulfill obligations if the integrity and efficacy of the instructional process are to be preserved. Professional Integrity Policy Breaches of academic and professional integrity are grave and serious acts. The faculty member and/or student are expected to take action when any breach of integrity occurs. Inherent in the beliefs of WSU is that the University must prepare young men and women in such a way that they will have the intellectual and moral strengths to make value judgments and to assume participant roles in responding to the needs of a rapidly changing, complex society. Honesty is a value of society and the nursing profession, and students are expected to respect this principle. The nursing student has areas of responsibility as stated in the Student Handbook and the College of Nursing philosophy. As the student strives to become a professional nurse, she/he must actively support the ethics and goals of the profession. The faculty as members of the nursing profession must actively support the goals and ethics. The nursing student and faculty member, therefore, have the responsibility to act in an honest and truthful manner and to protect the integrity of scholarship and to take action when there is any violation of academic integrity. Violation of academic and/or professional integrity shall result in a failing grade on a particular assignment or test, a failing grade for a course, or exclusion from the College of Nursing, depending on the nature of the particular incident. Final decision will be determined through collaboration of faculty, Area Assistant Dean, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, and Dean.

If, however, a complaint does arise, the parties should meet in an effort to resolve the matter. When such a discussion fails to resolve the problem, the college's published procedures should be followed. Although the University Ombudsperson is not a direct part of the a ppeal process, students and faculty may consult the Ombudsperson at any point during such proceedings. University Guidelines for Assisting Persons with Behavioral Problems All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in a manner which is conducive to an environment that encourages the free exchange of ideas and information. However, from time to time, the University is called upon to assist individuals who are displaying behavior which: 1. Threatens themselves or others; a nd/or that 2. Severely impairs their ability to function within the University environment; and/or that 3. Makes impossible the proper functioning of an academic program through obstructive or disruptive behavior. To ensure respect for the legal rights of every person, the University seeks, through referral or intervention, to guarantee that appropriate professional care is available for those who become disruptive. 26 TENTS E Grade Appeal: Basic Principles of the Appeals Process : 1) What can be appealed: O nly the manner in which the grade was assigned can be appealed. Instructors are expected to evaluate student work according to sound academic standards. It is the instructor's prerogative to assign grades in accordance with his/her academic/professional judgment. If the student believes the manner in which the grade was assigned was done in an unfair manner and the student is able to demonstrate that the unfair manner is based on one of the two criteria stated below then the appeal policy should be followed. The student assumes the burden of proof in the appeals process 2) Grounds for appeals are : (1) the application of non-academic criteria in the grading process, as listed in the university's non-discrimination/affirmative action statute: race, color, sex (including gender identity), national origin, religion, age, sexual orientation, familial status, marital status, height, weight, disability, or veteran status; (2) sexual harassment or discrimination; or (3) evaluation of student work by criteria not directly reflective of performance relative to course requirements. A student who disputes the final grade awarded for any of the above reasons should follow the steps outlined in the grade appeal process. 3) Timeliness of appeals process . Failure of the instructor or any appeal officer to respond within the designated time frame of the formal appeal entitles the student to proceed to the next level of appeal. In no case should there be any assumption that a failure to respond at any level signifies a granting of the appeal. Failure of the student to adhere to the time-frames specified in the policy will result in the appeal process being nullified (the appeal will not be heard). 4) Academic dishonesty. These policy guidelines do not apply to allegations of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty matters should be addressed under the Student Due Process statute. 5) Patient safety. Students may be removed from a clinical course at any time in which the faculty or clinical agency staff identifies an issue that would constitute unsafe care for a patient. These policy guidelines do not apply to safety issues. 6) Assistance. Student/faculty may contact the College of Nursing, Assistant Dean, Enrollment & Student Affairs and/or the Ombudsperson at any time for assistance with any problem associated with a grade decision or grade appeal. 6) Assistance. Student/faculty may contact the College of Nursing, Assistant Dean for Student affairs and/or the Ombudsperson at any time for assistance with any problem associated with a grade decision or grade appeal. Procedure Prior to implementing the formal appeal process, the student must discuss in person the disputed grade with the instructor of the course within ten days of notification of the grade. The faculty member will respond in writing with a copy to the student and the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services. If the dispute remains unresolved, the student may then initiate a formal appeal. COLLEGE OF NURSING ACADEMIC APPEALS POLICY 27 All steps of the appeal process must be followed within the stated time frame or the appeal process is nullified (will not be heard). Steps to Initiate a Formal Appeal 1. The student must submit a written statement detailing his or her objections to the faculty response, along with supporting documentation, to the Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs with copy to the Assis tant Dean for Enrollment and Student Services. This statement must be submitted within 14 days following the response of the faculty member who assigned the grade. 2. The Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs must meet with the student and faculty member, eithe r jointly or individually, within 14 days of receiving the appeal to attempt to resolve the issue. 3. The student must be notified in writing of the Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs' decision within 21 days of receiving the student's written appeal. As the Dean's designee, the decision of the Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs shall be the final decision at the College level. 4. Provost Review. If, after your School/College appeal path is exhausted and you wish to continue with the grade appeal process, per the University Academic policy, you may request a Provost Review within 30 days of this decision. The request should be submitted via the online form located at https://provost.wayne.edu/ac ademic- policy. For assistance with the appeal process, you may contact the Ombudsperson Laura Birnie -Lindemann at ombudsoffice@wayne.edu . Procedure for Unsafe Behaviors in the Clinical Setting 1. When a clinical instructor makes the determination that a student in the clinical setting has displayed behavior that poses a safety risk to the student, patient, staff, faculty or fellow students, the student shall immediately be relieved of patient care respons ibilities and assigned non -patient care responsibilities until the end of that clinical day (a library assignment is an example of an appropriate alternate assignment). The student will not be sent home at this time but will be told that a determination of a corrective course of action will be arrived at after consultation with the course coordinator. The student will not be able to return to clinical until resolution. 2. Within 24 hours, the clinical faculty will write up the incident detailing the clinical events that transpired leading up to the removal of the student from patient care. 3. The clinical faculty will notify the course coordinator within 24 hours of the incident. The course coordinator will immediately notify the Assistant Dean of Faculty Affai rs and the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services via email. 4. The course coordinator, in collaboration with the clinical faculty and Assistant Dean (if necessary), will determine a corrective course of action that may include supervised skill review on campus, written work, and/or an evaluation of student performance by a third party, 28 e.g. the course coordinator or the course coordinator's designee. Corrective course of action may include exclusion from the program. 5. A meeting will be held which in cludes the student, the Assistant Dean of Enrollment and Student Services or designee and, at a minimum, the clinical faculty, the course coordinator, and the Area Assistant Dean or designee. The student will be given advance notice of the time and place o f this meeting and will be allowed to have an advisor or support person with him/her. At this meeting, a written summary of the observed clinical behavior as well as the plan for corrective action including time frames for completion will be presented to the student for discussion and signature. The meeting will occur within three business days of the notification of the course coordinator. If the student fails to appear without extenuating circumstances, he or she will be excluded from the program and not ified of exclusion by registered mail. Official exclusion (if this is the decision) occurs at this point. 6. If it is determined that the student is excluded from the program, the student is advised to contact the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Servi ces, or designee to learn about the Appeal Policy. Appeal Process for Exclusion for Unsafe Practice in the Clinical Setting A student may appeal his/her exclusion from the program for unsafe practice by following the guidelines for appeal identified belo w. Steps to Initiate a Formal Appeal: 1. A written appeal outlining the student's view point of the circumstances which caused the student's removal from the clinical course and the rationale for the appeal must be submitted within five business days of t he exclusion to the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Services. Appeals submitted after the two day deadline will not be heard. 2. Within one two business day of the receipt of an appeal, the Assistant Dean of Faculty Affairs and the Associate Dean for Academic and Clinical Affairs (serving as the Dean's designee) will review the documentation provided by the instructor and the student and make a decision, which is final. The decision will be forwarded to the Assistant Dean, Enrollment and Student Servic es, who will notify the student. 3. If the appeal is sustained and the student is allowed to return to the clinical setting, arrangements will be made for the student to make up missed time. Any absences sustained during this time will not fall under the clinical absenteeism policy. 4. If the appeal is denied, the exclusion from the clinical setting will result in an F grade for the course. 5. Provost Appeal. The student may request the Provost to review the final decision on the record. A written Request fo r a Provost Review must be made by the student himself/herself, with a copy to the Dean of the College of Nursing, postmarked within thirty (30) calendar days of the postmark of the College's final decision.
