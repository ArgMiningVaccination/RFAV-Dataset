Foreword 1 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 Foreword The Wellcome Trust Monitor was launched to build our understanding of the societal context of the research that we fund. Through it, we hope to understand and track over time the public's interest in, attitudes towards, experience and knowledge of science, with a particular focus on biomedical topics. The wave 3 Monitor uses a rigorous and robust methodology to achieve data that is representative of the UK adult population . This survey mark s a departure from previous waves by interviewing only adults (young people will be interviewed separately in 2016); however , the sample size has increased allowing richer analysis. By following the same methodology, t his wave of the Monitor enables compar isons with the previous two waves , in 2009 and 2012 respectively. Our aspiration for the Wellcome Trust Monitor is to provide a rich resource for many audiences. We hope academics and students will explore the data furthe r, examining for instance the lang uage people use to describe their understanding of antibiotic resistance , or the relationship between aspects of scientific knowledge and confidence in taking health - related decisions. Policy -makers can learn about public attitudes towards sharing medical data for research purposes, what guides this, and what concerns people have about it. Science journalists, engagers and communicators can learn, as can we at the Wellcome Trust, about how the public interact with science , and what their preferences are fo r engagement. The full SPSS datasets of all three waves are availa ble through the UK Data Service . The wave 3 dataset can be accessed at: https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue /?sn=7927 The Wellcome Trust website, at www.wellcome.ac.uk/monitor , hosts: the reports for all three waves of the Monitor ; Excel tables presenting the core data from waves 2 and 3 (data can be reached f rom the corresponding tables in the report ); infographic sheets illustrating findings of interest from waves 2 and 3; and links to publications related to wave 1. We greatly encourage others to use these resources . The findings of the research show that our work exists in a receptive public climate. The majority of the public are interested in medical research and many want to hear from scientists about the work they are doing. Nonetheless , more can be done to ensure that our ideas are accessible to the public and that everyone , independent of who they are or where they come from , can engage with science and medical research. Clare Matterson Director of Strategy Wellcome Trust April 2016 Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Executive Summary 2 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 Executive Summary Knowledge, interest and engagement The public e xpress high levels of interest in medical research. Around three -quarters of the public say they are interested in medical research, which is a high level of intere st, consistent with previous waves. Women, older adults, those with hi gher educational quali fications, and those who know more about science are more likely to be interested in medical research . The public a re particular ly interest ed in the development of new d rugs, vaccines and treatments , as well as mental health . The proportion expressing inte rest in mental health has increased from 48 per cent in 2012 to 55 per cent in 20 15. Around two in five of the public say they have actively tried to find out information about medical research in the past year . People are most commonly trying to find medi cal advice about illnesses affecting themselves or a family member . The internet is by far the most popular method for finding information, with search engines most likely to be the first port of call, as opposed to specific websites run by the NHS or othe r organisations. Television is the dominant medium by which people happen to come across information about medical research, followed by websites and newspapers . One in five of the public has visited a science museum or science centre in the last 12 months . By contrast, one -third have visited a history museum, and three in ten have visited an art gallery. The majority of the public say they are interested in hearing directly from scientists about the research they do, but would prefer to hear from them via passive means , such as television, radio, newspaper s, and websites, rather than interacting with them directly. Hearing from scientists about the latest findings from scientific research, and about research of personal relevance, are of greatest interest. Of the professions and institutions involved in the production and dissemination of scientific and medical research, doctors, nurses and other medical practitioners are most trusted by the public, followed by scientists working in universities, medical res earch charities, and scientists working in private industry. J ournalists are by far the least trusted group . Reasons for trust and distrust a re explored in the report. Around three -quarters of the public are willing to share their anonymised medical record s, or their anonymised genetic information, for the purposes of a medical research study . The primary concern among those who are unwilling relates to confidentiality and privacy . The report explores how the public relate to issues of science and medicine in their everyday lives . Two-thirds think their understanding of science is useful in their everyday lives , but more, almost nine in ten, believe it is useful for others - people in general - to have an understanding of science in their everyday lives . The vast majority of the public feel confident making informed decisions about their health - for example whether to have a flu jab, or whether to make a doctor's appointment when feel ing unwell - and around half feel confident challenging the conclusions of a medical professional. When presented with three options as to how a drug's effectiveness can best be tested, s even in ten of the public choose the controlled exp erimentation option . Far fewer think that talking Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Executive Summary 3 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 to patients to get their opinion, or that scientists using their own knowledge to determine a drug's effectiveness, are the best approaches . The amount of time taken to develop a medical treatment varies greatly, but research suggests it takes between 15 and 25 years from the pre -discovery phase to availability to patients. Half of the public believe it takes between 10 and 20 years, on average, to develop a medical treatment. Around one in ten believes the process takes less than ten years, and almost one in five say they do not know how long it ta kes. Around two -thirds of the publ ic believe (correctly) that pharmaceutical companies spend the most on developing new medical drugs in the UK. One in five think the NHS and other public sector or government organisations spend the most. Behaviour To prov ide a context to the Wellcome Trust 's Crunch campaign, which encourages the public to look at the relationship between food and drink, health, and the environment, the Monitor explored the various influences behind people 's food and drink choices. The publ ic prioritise considerations affecting their own health, namely sugar and salt content . The most important environmental factors relate to sustainability, packaging, and food being produced in the UK rather than in a foreign country. Our analysis segments the public according to the factors they consider important when deciding what to eat and drink . The Monitor also explored the public's experiences with antibiotics, and their understanding of antibiotic resistance . Nine in ten of the public say they have heard of antibiotic resistance , however this is most commonly thought (mistakenly) to refer to one's body becoming resistant or immune to antibiotics. Although the great majority of the public believe that antibiotics treat bacterial infections, only two i n five (correctly) believe that antibiotics treat bacterial infections alone. Over o ne in five of the public say they have, at some point, asked a GP or medical professiona l to prescribe them antibiotics. The great majority of these requests were granted. Of those who have been prescribed antibiotics before , whether they have asked for them or not, over two in five feel they have, at some point, been prescribed antibiotics inappropriately. Around two in five of the public say they have been prescribed antib iotics in the last year. The great majority report following their most recent prescription as instructed , taking all the antibiotics they were prescribed, at the right times. However, six per cent say they did not finish the course, typically because they were feeling better. Use of a range of alternative and complementary medicines is unchanged since 2009, with the exception of acupuncture, for which use has risen . Just under one in five of the public has used homeopathy before . These adults are more than twice as likely to say that homeopathy was effective, rather than ineffective, in treating their condition the last time they used it. Among those who have never used homeopathy, almost two in five say they would never use it, while almost one -third would consider using it if they thought it would be appropriate for their health problem .Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Chapter 1: About the study 4 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 1. About the study This report sets out the results of the third Wel lcome Trust Monitor, a survey of the UK public aged 18 or over conducted by Ipsos MORI on behalf of the We llcome Trust. The Wellcome Trust Monitor is designed to measure the public's awareness, interests, knowledge and att itudes in relation to science, and in particular, biomedical science . The Wellcome Trust Monitor is conducted every three years in order to measure long -term trends in public attitudes. The first (baseline) wave was conducted in 2009 by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen), and the second in 2012 by Ipsos MORI. 1.1. Background and objectives For over 75 years the Wellcome Trust has work ed to promote advances in the fields of animal and human health. Over this time the Trust has become the UK's largest charitable funder of biomedical research, aiming to improve health and well -being through new discoveries. The Wellcome Trust also has a l ong history of promoting public engagement with science and biomedical research. The Wellcome Trust Monitor is an important study that not only explores interest in and attitudes towards biomedical science, but also helps organisations interested in public engagement with science to plan their activities . The questionnaire retained key questions from the 2009 and 2012 questionnaires to allow changes over time to be tracked. Examples include questions assessing interest in medical research ; what kinds of inf ormation about medical research people actively seek, or passively encounter ; past participation in medical research; p articipation in scientific and cultural experiences ; trust in professions to provide information about medical research ; optimism about m edical research; underst anding of clinical trials , and of particular biomedical terms; use of alternative medicine s; and scientific literacy, assessed via a knowledge quiz. New questions were added in 2015 to gather evidence of attitudes, behaviours , and k nowledge in other areas . These included questions about antibiotics and antibiotic resistance; interest in hearing directly from scientists ; factors affecting what people choose to eat and drink ; understanding of the drug development process ; the perceived value of science in everyday life; and m edical and scientific networks . In 2009 and 2012, young people (aged 14 to 18) in the UK were interviewed as part of the Wellcome Trust Monitor. In accordance with the recommendations of an independent review of the Monitor in 2014, in 2015 the Monitor interviewed only adults ( aged 18 or over) in the UK.1 A total of 1,524 adults were interviewed in 2015, a larger sample size than in 2012 (1,396) and 2009 (1,179) in order to enable deeper exploration of the data. 1.2. Meth odology Further technical deta ils are provided in Appendix A and in the Technical Report.2 Here we summarise key aspects of the survey design to assist the reader in interpreting the results. As the Wellcome Trust Monitor was designed to track changes over time, great emphasis was 1 The Wellcome Trust has commissioned a separate survey to measure the views of young people, to be carried out in 2016. 2 Appendix A and the Technical Report are available at: www.wellcome.ac.uk/ monitor Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Chapter 1: About the study 5 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 placed on achieving comparability between waves . Thus, in most respects the methodology used is the same as that for the 2009 and 2012 wave s of the Monitor. Cognitive testing and pilot survey New questions developed for the third wave were subjected to cognitive testing, a type of in - depth interviewing that pays explicit attention to the mental processes respondents go through when answer ing a question . Three rounds of ten cognitive interviews each were conducted, with findings dis cussed with the Wellcome Trust between each round, and the questionnaire developed and re -tested from round -to-round in light of these discussions. A pilot survey of 50 interviews was then conducted to test the operation of the questionnaire and associated survey materials . Sampling A two -stage probability sampling methodology was used (a s is common in high -quality surveys of the general public ) to achieve interviews with a representative sample of adults aged 18 or over in the UK . A total of 129 postcode s ectors were selected from a stratified list of all postcode s ectors, with probability of sel ection proportionate to size.3 Twenty -five addresses were then randomly selected from each selected s ector to obtain a sample of 3,225 addresses to issue to intervi ewers . At addresses w ith more than one dwelling unit and/or more than on e resident adult, interviewers selected one dwelling unit /adult at random to approach. Fieldwork and response An advance letter was sent to all selected addresses . Interviews took plac e between 2 June and 1 November 2015, using face-to-face Computer -Assist ed Personal Interviewing (CAPI) . Interviews took 45 minutes to complete on average. Respondents were given a \u00a320 (or \u00a340 at the reissues stage) LoveToShop gift card as an incentive conditional on completion of an interview . Interviews were achieved with 1,524 adults , equating to a response rate of 51.4 per cent .4 Weighting Data in the report have been weighted to adjust for differing probabilities of selection , and to adjus t the sampl e to match the UK population by age within gender, and by region . 3 Each postcode sector containing fewer than 1,000 delivery points was combined with an adjacent sector , or sectors, so that each combined sector contained at least 1,000 delivery points. 4 Response Rate 1 , as defined by the American Association f or Public Opinion Research Standard Definitions (2011) . This is the number of interviews achieved expressed as a proportion of the number of addresses approached less those found to be ineligible during fieldwork ( Monitor: Wave 3. Chapter 1: About the study 6 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 1.3. Interpretation of sub-group and over -time differences Statistical significance Data are taken from a sample of UK adults, rat her than the entire population , meaning results are subject to sampling variability. The Technical Report provides a g uide to statistical reliability , and shows the 95 per cent confidence intervals around key survey estimates . For instance, the survey finds that 77 per cent of the public are interested in medical rese arch with an associated confidence interval of + 3.0 per cent, and that 75 per cent are willing to allow anonymised information from their genes to be used in a medical research project, with an associated confidence interval of +2.7 per cent. The mean design effect (across seven key survey variables) resulting from the complex sample design is 1.5. Sub-group differences Where results are analysed by sub -group, the difference s have been tested for significance at the 95 per cent confidence level or above using the complex samples module in SPSS 19.0.5 The significance testing examines the overall relationship between the question variable and the sub -group variable, and avoids testing all pairwise comparisons within a sub-group as this risks detecting spur ious differences. Sub-group differences by gender and age are considered for all questions, and additional sub- group differences are considered on a question -by-question basis based on expected relationship s with the question variable. The questionnaire included a nine-item knowledge quiz intended to measure respondents' scientific literacy. At points throughout this report, findings are broken down according to scores on this quiz, with respondents grouped by high scores (8-9 items correct) , medium score s (5-7 items correct) and low scores (0 -4 items correct) . Chapter 7 provides details of the knowledge quiz. Selected f indings within the report are also broken down by whether the respondent had gained a science -related qualification from school, or from university or college . Respondents were left to self -define whether or not qualifications they had ga ined were \"science -related\" . Comparisons between the 2009, 2012, and 2015 Wellcome Trust Monitor s This report comments on the statistical significan ce of differences between the findings of the 2009, 2012, and 2015 waves of the Wellcome Trust Monitor where the same question has been repeated in different waves . This is not possible in all cases due to changes in the wording of questions or answer options. I n these instances, the reasons for not making comparisons are noted. In considering wave on wave changes , reader s should note that cross -wave change s in sample composition could account for some or all of the observed changes. That is to say, it is possibl e that apparent change s in attitudes are actually a result of differences in the profile of 5 The complex samples module accounts for sample stratification, clustering and weighting when conducting significance testing. This means that type 1 errors (i.e. 'false positive' results, where a difference is interpreted as real when it is not) are less likely than if standard formulae were used.

However, b ecause the demographic profiles of the sample s are similar across the three surveys (see Appendix A) , undue emphasis should no t be placed on this possibility . Reporting conventions Footnotes are used throughout the report to indicate which questions and variables are being discussed. This is to allow the reader to cross -refer easily to the questionnaire documentation, data tables, and the SPSS dataset, which has been deposited at the UK Data Service . Where percentages do not sum to 100 per cent, this may be due to rounding, or questions allow ing multiple answers. An asterisk (*) denotes a value that is less than half a per cent but greater than zero. Figures in the report include the unweighted and weighted base sizes (the actual number of respondents asked the question, and the weighted number of respondents asked the question, respectively). 1.4.

Chapter 2: How interested are people in science and medical research? 8 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 2. How in terested are people in science and medical research? This chapter explores how interested people are in medical research, and how they find out about medical research , whether by actively seeking, or passively encountering information. This chapter also examines the trust people place in various professions and organisations to provide accurate and reliable information about medical research . The chapter concludes by considering how optimistic the public are about the future of medical research . Key finding s: The majority of the public (77 per cent ) say they are very or fairly interested in medical research . Interest in medical research is more likely among women, older adults, those with higher educational qualifications, and those who know more about scie nce (as measured by scores on the knowledge quiz), even when the influence of other factors are controlled for. Among those in managerial and professional occupations, 83 per cent say they are interested in medical research. This falls to 73 per cent among those in routine and manual occupations, and to 59 per cent among those who have never worked, or are long-term unemployed . Three broad areas of medical research are of most interest to the public : the development of new drugs, vaccines and treatments, mentioned by 61 per cent, how the body works (46 per cent) and how the brain works (45 per cent) . There has been no significant change in the broad areas of medical research of interest to the public since 2012. There has been little change since 2012 in the specific fields of medical research of interest to the public . The proportion of the public interested in mental health has increased significantly from 48 per cent in 2012 to 55 per cent in 2015. Over two in five (42 per cent) of the public say they have actively tried to find out information about medical research in the past year, in line with the proportion recorded in 2009 (39 per cent). Those looking for information about medical research are most likely to be seeking medical advice (69 per cent) or information on other people's experience s of an illness or disease (48 per cent). As in 2012, t he internet is the most common method for seeking information about medical research , used by 90 per cent of those seeing information. Of the professions and ins titutions involved in the production and dissemination of scientific and medical research, doctors, nurses and other medical practitioners are most trusted by the public ( with 64 per cent having complete trust or a great deal of trust in them to provide ac curate and reliable information about medical research ). Journalists are the least trusted (three per cent). Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Chapter 2: How interested are people in science and medical research? 9 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 Key findings (continued): Men are more trusting than women of doctors, nurses and other medical practitioners (71 per cent expressing complete tr ust, or a great deal of trust, compared with 58 per cent), and of journalists (five per cent, compared with two per cent). Younger adults are more trusting than older adults towards medical research charities (45 per cent of those aged 18 to 34, falling to 28 per cent of those aged 65 or over), and towards scientists working in private industry (36 per cent of those aged 18 to 34, falling to 19 per cent among those aged 65 or over). Almost all of the public (94 per cent) believe that medical research will l ead to an improvement in the quality of life for people in the UK in the next 20 years. 2.1. How interested are people in medical research? The Wellcome Trust Monitor has measured public interest in medical research since 2009 (Figure 2.16). Before being asked how interested they were in medical research , respondents were presented with a card showing a definition of medical research , in order to ensure that responses were based on a consistent interpretation of this term.7 Three-quarters (77 per cent ) of the pu blic say they are very or fairly interested in medical research. This proportion is not significantly different from the 75 per cent expressing interest in 2012, but is significantly lower than the 91 per cent expressing interest in 2009.8 This high level of interest was also found in the recent Public Attitudes to Science study (BIS, 2014) for science in general ; over four in five (84 per cent) of the public say that \"s cience is such a big part of our lives that we should all take an interest\". Figure 2.1 Interest in medical research Q. How interested, if at all, would you say you are in medical research?

Chapter 2: How interested are people in science and medical research? 10 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 Interest in medical research by sub -group Interest in medical research varies by population sub-groups . Women are more likely than men to say they are very or fairly interested in medical research (80 per ce nt, compared with 74 per cent). Inter est in medical research also varies with age; older adults are more likely to express an interest (83 per cent of those aged 50 and over, compared with 68 per cent of those aged 18 to 34). Those with a serious long-term illness or medical condition , or who have a friend or family member with such an illness or condition , are more likely to say they are interested in medical research than those with no experience of serious illness or disability (81 per cent, compared with 73 per cent). In addition , those wi th a serious genetic condition in their family are also more likely to be interested in medical research (84 per cent, compared with 76 per cent among those without such a condition). Interest in medical research also varies by social class , as measured by the National Statistics Socio -Economic Classification (NS-SEC). Among those in managerial and professional occupations , 83 per cent say they are interested in medical research, a proportion which falls to 73 per cent among those in routine and manual occu pations, and to 59 per cent among those who have never worked, or are long -term unemployed. Turning to education and employment , interest in medical research varies by the highest educational qualification adults have obtained. Those with a postgraduate de gree are most likely to be interested (85 per cent), while those with no qualifications are least likely to be interested (63 per cent). With respect to qualifications in science specifically, among those with a science -related qualification gained from un iversity or college, 86 per cent express an interest in medical research, compared with 73 per cent of those with no science -related qualifications . Among those who work, or have previously worked, in a scientific or medical field, 81 per cent say they are interested in medical research, compared with 73 per cent of those who have not worked in these fields . Knowledge about science (as measured by a scale derived from the knowledge quiz)9 is associated with interest in medical research ; 85 per cent of those with high scores on the knowledge quiz express an interest , compared with 77 per ce nt of those with medium scores , and 64 per cent of those with low scores. Interest in med ical research also varies between those who have visited a science -related attract ion in the past year, and those who have not.10 Over four in five (84 per cent) of those who have visited a science -related attraction in the last year say they are interested in medical research, compared with 70 per cent among those who have not made such a visit. Interest in medical research: multivariate analysis Many of the factors considered above which are associated with interest in medical research will, of course, be correlated with one another . For instance, those who have a job in a scientific or medical field will be more likely to have science -related qualifications, and older 9 See section 7.1 in Chapter 7 for an explanation of the knowledge quiz. 10 Those visiting a science -related attraction were defined as those who had visited, or attended, one or more of the following in the last 12 m onths: a science museum or centre, a science -related art exhibition or installation, a zoo or aquarium, a planetarium, a working laboratory or similar scientific site, a local community science event, a science festival, or a science talk . Overall, half (5 1 per cent) of adults have made such a visit. Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3.

For this reason, multivariate analysis was carried out in order to isolate the unique contribution of each of the identified factors to interest in medical research .11 The results of this analysis are presented in the Annex to this chapter (Figure 2.17). This analysis demonstrates that interest in medica l research is more likely among women, older adults, those with higher educational qualification s, and those who know more about science (as measured by scores on the knowledge quiz), even when the influence of other factors is controlled for .12 The following factors are related to interest in medical research when considered on their own but are no longer significant once other factors are controlled for: social class , science -related qualificati ons, having worked in a scientific or medical field, and experie nce of serious illness or disability. 11 The multivariate analysis technique used was logistic regression. 12 It should be noted that the knowledge quiz, while not a demographic variable like the others included in the model, was included as it provi des a current measure of knowledge about science.

Which areas of medical research interest people? To understand the areas of medical research of most interest to the public, r espondents were presented first with a list of broad areas of medical research, and then w ith a list of specific areas of medical research. For each, they were asked to choose which, if any, were of interest to them . Broad areas of medical research of interest to people On average , respondents mentioned three areas of medical research of intere st to them (mean number of areas mentioned = 3.1). Those with an interest in medical research mentioned closer to four areas (mean = 3.7), and those who said they are not interested in medical research specified one area, on average, in which they have an interest (mean = 1.4). Three broad areas of medical research emerge as of particular interest: the development of new drugs, vaccines and treatments, which is the only area of interest to a major ity of the public (61 per cent); how the body works (46 per c ent); and how the brain works (45 per cent) (Figure 2.213). Ten per cent of the public say they are not interested in any of the broad areas of medical research presented to them . Women are more likely than men to be interested in how diseases have been t reated at different times and in different cultures (32 per cent, compared with 27 per cent); however, aside from this, the areas of interest show no differences by gender. 13 Figure 2 .2 shows data from K1/2MR (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

Conversely, older adults are more likely to express an interes t in policy and funding issues in medical research (27 per cent of those aged 65 or over , falling to 17 per cent of those aged 18 to 34 ), and in how medical research is regulated (25 per cent of those aged 65 or over , falling to 16 per cent of those aged 1 8 to 34). Those adults with a serious genetic condition in their family are more likely to be interested in the d evelopment of new drugs, vaccines and treatments (70 per cent, compared with 60 per cent among those without such a condition in their family ), and in what medical research is currently being undertaken (46 per cent, compared with 37 per cent). They are also more likely to be interested in how the brain works (55 per cent, compared with 43 per cent), in the social and ethical issues raised by me dical research (34 per cent, compared with 25 per cent), and in policy and funding issues in medical research (31 per cent, compared with 22 per cent). Areas of interest do not vary between those who have a serious long -term illness or medical condition , or who have a friend or family member with such an illness or condition , and those with no experience of serious illness or disability . There have been no significant change s in the proportions choosing each area of interest since 2012 (Figure 2 .314,15). Figu re 2.3 The broad areas of medical research that interest people Q.

On average , respondents mentioned three specific areas of medical research of interest to them (mean = 2.9). Those who said they were interested in medical research mentioned, on average, twice as many areas of interest as those who sai d they were not interested in medical research (mean = 3.3, compared with 1.6). The specific areas of medical research of greatest interest to the public are mental health issues (chosen by 55 per cent), how genes work and how they affect health and diseas es (45 per cent), risk of disease (43 per cent), and ageing (42 per cent). Eight per cent say they are not interested in any of the specific areas of medical research presented to them. Women are more likely than men to express an interest in mental hea lth issues (60 per cent, compared with 49 per cent), and obesity (33 per cent, compared with 25 per cent), while men are more likely than women to cite stem cells as an area of interest ( 32 per cent, compared with 25 per cent). Agein g is, understandably, substantially more likely to be of interest to older adults; a majority (59 per cent ) of those aged 65 or over express an interest in ageing, compared with a minority (32 per cent ) among those aged 18 to 34. Risk of disease, however , is less likely to be ch osen by older adults; 34 per cent of those aged 65 or over express an interest in this topic , rising to 46 per cent among those aged 35 to 64, and 45 per cent among those aged 18 to 34. 16 Figure 2 .4 shows data from K3/4SP (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

Adults with a serious long -term illness or medical condition , or with a friend or family member with such a condition , are more likely to express an interest in mental health issues (59 per cent, compared with 50 per cent among tho se with no experience of serious illness or disability ). These individuals are also more likely to cite the health implications of climate change as an area of interest (24 per cent, compared with 19 per cent). The only area to have seen a significant chan ge in interest since 2012 is mental health, for which interest has increased seven percentage points over the past three years (from 48 per cent in 2012, to 55 per cent in 2015) ( Figure 2 .517,18).

How do people find out about medical research? This section looks at the type s of information about medical research that people encounter either when actively looking fo r information , or simply by coming across it. Two in five (42 per cent) say they have actively tried to find out inf ormation about medical research in the past year (Figure 2 .619). This is significantly higher than the proportion in 2012 (35 per cent), but is in line with the proportion recorded in 2009 (39 per cent). Figure 2.6 Proportion seeking information about medical research in past year Q. In the past year, have you tried to find out any information about medical research?

Those seeking information about medical research are most likely to look for information about types of illnesses (for instance information about cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's , epilepsy, Parkinson's, heart disease, or other illnesses ) (58 per cent), followed by information about aspects of illnesses (for instance information about the causes of illnesses, the prevention of illnesses , about identifying and diagnosing illness, and about treatments and cures ) (21 per cent). This pattern i s reflected in the types of information the public remember passively encountering. People are most likely to have come across information about types of illness (49 per cent of those who recall encountering information about medical research), followed by aspects of illness (16 per cent).

Where do people find information about medical research? Those seeking information about medical research look for it through a variety of channels (Figure 2 .922). By far the most common is the internet (90 per cent) , followed by talking to another person (40 per cent), and visiting a hospital or doctor's surgery (31 per cent). There have been no significant changes sin ce 2012 in the channels the public use to seek information about medical research. Younger adults are more likely to use the internet to seek information, wi th almost all ( 96 per cent) of those aged 18 to 34 doing so, falling to 77 per cent among those age d 65 or over. This pattern reflects the findings in a recent survey by OfCom (2015) , which show s that while 85 per cent of adults in the UK have internet access at home , this proportion stands at 92 per cent among those aged 16 to 24, falling to just 40 pe r cent among those aged 75 or over.

Whom do people trust to provide accurate information about medical research? This section examines the public's trust in the professions and institutions involved in the production and dissemination of scientific and medical research , including journalists, medical research charities, and scientists working in a variety of sectors. Respondents were asked \" Please tell me how much trust you have in each of the following to provide accurate and reliable inf ormation about medical research \", and then provided their answer about each profession and institution in turn. Doctors, nurses , and other medical practitioners emerge as the most trusted of the professions, with 64 per cent of the public saying they have complete trust, or a great deal of trust in them (Figure 2.1227). Scientists working in universities come a close second, with three in five (59 per cent) of the public having complete trust, or a great deal of trust, in them to provide accurate and reliabl e information about medical research. This pattern is in line with Ipsos MORI's Trust in Professions survey , which has found doctors to be the most trusted profession since the survey was first conducted in 1983 . Scientists are also regularly among the most trusted of professions , with politicians and journalists tending to be trusted the least. The Monitor finds that j ust under two in five (37 per cent) say they have complete trust, or a great deal of trust , in medical research charities to provide accura te and reliable information about medical research . A random half of respondents were asked how much they trust \" scientists workin g for pharmaceutical companies\" , with the remaining half asked how much they trust \"scientists working in private industry \". Both of these groups of scientists are trusted far less than are scientists working in universities . One-third (32 per cent) say they have complete trust, or a great deal of trust, in scientists working for pharmaceutical companies, which is not statistical ly different from the 29 per cent for scientists working in private industry. Journalists are the least trusted of the professions asked about, with just three per cent of the public saying they have complete trust, or a great deal of trust, in them to pro vide accurate and reliable information about medical research . It is instructive to consider that journalists are the least trusted source of accurate and reliable information about medical research along with the finding that the information about medical research the public passively encounter is most likely to come from journalistic sources, including from news on television, and from newspapers (see Figure 2 .11). 27 Figure 2.12 shows data click on question name to access data table).

In 200 9 respondents were asked about \" Scientists working for drug or pharmaceutical com panies\" . With respect to d octors, nurses and other medical practitioners, almost three -quarters (72 per cent) of the public had complete trust, or a great deal of trust, in these individuals to provide accurate and reliable information about medical research in 2009. By 2012, this had fallen to 67 per cent, and in 2015 stands at 64 per cent, which while significantly below 2009 l evels, does not represent a further significant decline since 2012. Turning to scientists, the proportion of the public saying they have complete trust, or a great deal of trust, in scientists working for universities rose significantly between 2009 and 20 12 (from 61 per cent to 66 per cent), but has now fallen back to the level recorded in 2009 (59 per cent). Trust in scientists working for private industry follows the same trend; the proportion of the public saying they have complete trust, or a great dea l of trust, in scientists working for private industry rose significantly between 2009 and 2012 (from 26 per cent to 32 per cent), and has now fallen back to a level consistent with that recorded in 2009 (29 per cent).29 The proportion of the public saying they have complete trust, or a great deal of trust, in journalists also rose between 2009 and 2012 (from four per cent to eight per cent), and has now fallen back to 2009 levels (three per cent). 28 Figure 2.13 shows click on question name to access data table). 29 Comparisons with 2009 should be made with caution due to a change in question wording. In 2009, respondents were asked about scientists w orking for \" drug or phar maceutical companies \", whereas in 2015 respondents were asked about scientists working for \" pharmaceutical companies \".

The proportion saying they have very little trust, or no t rust at all, in medical research charities has increased from five percent in both 2009 and 2012, to 11 per cent in 2015. In interpreting this finding, it should be noted that there has been a rise in the proportion who say they \"don't know\" how much trust they place in medical research charities to provide accurate and reliable information about medical research . This proportion has more than quadrupled, from two per cent in both 2009 and 2012, to nine per cent in 2015 . Also of note is a questionnaire change that may have con tributed to this fall in trust . Specifically, i n 2009 and 2012 respondents were asked how much trust they had in medical research charities immediately after being asked how much trust they had in government departments and ministers. In 2015 however , trust in government departments and ministers was not asked; instead, respondents were asked how much trust they had in medical research charities immediately after being asked how much trust they had in doctors, nurses and other medical p ractitioners . This change may have produced a \"context effect\" (e.g. see Tourangeau et al., 2000) which reduced the likelihood that respondents answered that they tru sted medical research charities , or increased the likelihood that they answered \"don't kno w\". It is also possible that negative publicity about the charity sector during the fieldwork period affected respondents' trust in medical research charities.30 Trust by sub -group Men are more trusting than women of doctors, nurses and other medical practi tioners (71 per cent expressing complete trust, or a great deal of trust , compared with 58 per cent), and of journalists (five per cent, compared with two per cent). Younger adults are more tr usting than older adults of medical research charities (45 per c ent of those aged 18 to 34, falling to 28 per cent of those aged 65 or over ), and scientists working in private industry (36 per cent of those aged 18 to 34, falling to 19 per cent among those aged 65 or over ). With respect to education , those with higher educational qualifications are more trusting of scientists working in universities (69 per cent of those with a postgraduate degree expressing complete trust, or a great deal of trust , falling to 47 per cent among those with no qualifications), and towards medical research charities (49 per cent among those with a postgraduate degree, falling to 26 per cent among those with no qualifications). However, this trend is reversed with respect to trust in scientists worki ng for pharmaceutical companies: 29 per ce nt of those with a postgraduate degree, and 19 per cent of those with a first degree express complete trust, or a great deal of trust in scientists working for pharmaceutical companies , compared with 49 per cent among those with level 1 qualifications, and 33 per cent of those with no qualifications. Social class is related to trust in scientists working for universities ( 63 per cent of those in managerial or professional occupations say they have complete trust, or a great deal of trust in 30 For instance, the suicide of the poppy seller Olive Cooke in Bristol on 6 May 2015 led to a substantial media focus in the months that followed on charities ' fundraising activities, and in July 2015, the financial problems, and related controversies, surrounding the Kids Company charity were widely reported, with the charity ultimately ceasing operations on 5 Augus t 2015.

Those who are more knowledgeable about science ( as measured by the knowledge quiz) are more trusting of three of the professions asked about: d octor s, nurses and other medical practitioners (73 per cent among those with high scores express complete trust, or a great deal of trust , falling to 57 per cent among those with low scores), scientists working in universities (66 per cent among those with high scores, falling to 48 per cent among those with low scores), and medical research charities (47 per cent among those with high scores, falling to 29 per cent among those with low scores). Trust in medical research charities: multivariate analysis Many of the factors considered above which are associated with public trust in medical research charities to provide accurate and reliable information about medical research will be interlinked. For instance, those who have higher educational qualifications are mo re likely to score highly on the knowledge quiz. For this reason, multivariate analysis was carried out in order to isolate the unique contribution of each of the identified factors with trust in medical research charities.31 This analysis was carried out separately for both the 2009 and the 2015 surveys. The results of this analysis are presented in the Annex to this chapter (Figure 2.18). Before turning to the results of this analysis, it is first worth considering , for both 2009 and 2015, which demographi c factors bear a relationship with trust in medical research charities, regardless of the influence of other factors. Age had a significant relationship with trust in medical research charities in both 2009 and 2015 , with younger adults more likely to be t rusting than older adults. In both 2009 and 201 5, trust in medical research charities was higher among the more highly educated , among those with greater knowledge of science (as measured b y scores on the knowledge quiz) , and among those with experience o f working in a scientific or medical field. A number of factors had no significant relationship with trust in medical research charities in either 2009 or 2015: gender, social class , experience of serious illness or disability , or having a serious genetic condition in one's family. The multivariate analysis demonstrates that, in both 2009 and 2015, trust in medical research charities is more likely among those who know more about science (as measured by scores on the knowledge quiz) , even when the influence of other factors is controlled for .32 In addition, in 2009 trust was higher among those who had worked in a scientific or medical field, even when the influence of other factors is controlled for , and in 2015 trust was higher among younger adults, even whe n the influence of other factors is controlled for . Additional analysis considered the 2009 and 2015 results together, to assess whether the nature of the relationships between sub -groups of the population, and trust in medical research charities, has chan ged between 2009 and 2015. For instance, the fact that trust in medical 31 The multivariate analysis technique used was logistic regression. 32 It should be noted that the knowledge quiz, while not a demographic variable like the others included in the model, was included as it provides a current measure of knowledge abo ut science.

Why do people trust certain professions? Respondents who said they had complete trust, or a great deal of trust , in three of the professions asked about (d octors, nurses and other medical practitioners ; scientists working in universities ; and m edical research charities ) were asked why they trusted these individuals or organisations to provide accurate and reliable information about medical research (Figure 2.1433). The most commonly cited reason is that the respective professionals are knowledgeable, or are experts. Fewer adults mention evaluation of the re spective professionals' work. One in eight adults (12 per cent) say they trust doctors, nurses and medical practitioners because they have \"no choice but to trust them\", around twice the proportion that give this as a reason for trusting scientists working in universities (five per cent), or medical research charities (six per cent).

Why do people distrust certain professions? Respondents who said they had very little trust, or no trust at all , in three of the professions asked a bout (journalists , scientists working in private industry, and scientists working for pharmaceutical companies) were asked why they don't trust these professions (Figure 2.1 534).

As a result of this, it was not possible to allocate verbatim responses to this question into codes that were raised at the coding stage , and these codes remained in the \"o ther reason\" category . The most common reason for distrusting journalists to provide accurate and reliable information about medical research is a belief that they would exaggerate information relating to medical research (cited by 49 per cent). This is followed by a belief that journalists are 34 Figure 2.15 shows data from NoTrJourn , NoTrPrin (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table). Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3.

Among those distrusting scientists working in private industry, the primary reasons for this distrust are a belief they would exaggerate information relating to medical research (39 per cent), would try to present themselves in the most positive light (34 per cent), and would not be honest about the findings of medical research (30 per cent). These rea sons are also among the main ones for distrust in scientists working for pharmaceutical companies; 35 per cent feel that these scientists would try to present themselves in the most positive light, 32 per cent that they would exaggerate information relatin g to medical research, 26 per cent that they are generally corrupt, and 25 per cent that they would not be honest about the findings of medical research. 2.8. Optimism about medical research improving quality of life in the future The great majority (94 per cen t) of the public believe that medical research will definitely, or will probably, lead to an improvement in the quality of life for people in the UK in the next 20 years, consistent with public sentiment in 2009 and 2012 (92 per cent on each occasion ) (Figure 2 .1635). The proportion that believe medical research will definitely lead to an improvement in quality of life, however, has increased across the three waves of the Monitor, from a minority of 41 per cent in 2009, to a majority of 58 per cent in 2015. Optimism about the future of medical research is equivalent between men and women, across age groups, across levels of educational qualifications, and across social classes . Those who are more knowledgeable about science ( as measured by the knowledge quiz) are more likely to be optimistic, with 97 per cent of those scoring highly expecting an improvement, compared with 91 per cent of those with low scores.

The value of science in everyday life This chapter considers the value the public place on science in everyday life. The chapter starts by exploring how useful people think an understanding of science is in their own everyday l ives, and in the lives of people in general. We then turn to how well people feel they understand stories relating to science that they see or hear in the news, and their confidence in discussing these stories with other s. We then consider the confidence people have in making informed decisions about their health. The chapter conclude s by examining how many people are employed in scientific or medical fields , and why those working in these fields chose to do so. Key findings: Most of the public (66 per cent ) think their understanding of science is useful i n their everyday lives , but a higher proportion (87 per cent) believe it is useful for others - people in general - to have an understanding of science in their everyday lives. Around two in five (39 per ce nt) of the public say they usually understand stories about science in the news, and a further half (50 per cent) say they sometimes understand them. Only 13 per cent of those who say they usually, or sometimes, understand these stories say they feel very confident discussing them with others. Nine in ten (90 per cent) of the public feel confident in making informed decisions about their health, and almost half ( 48 per cent ) feel confident challenging the conclusion s of a medical professional. Over one in f ive (22 per cent) of the public live in a household where they , or another household member, has worked in a scientific or medical field . Around three in five (61 per cent) of those who have worked in a scientific or medical field said they did so because they were interested in the field , or enjoyed the role. Most of the public (62 per cent) say that when they were growing up, their parents were not interested in science. Those whose parents were interested in science are twice as likely to have worked in science or medicine themselves , and are more than twice as likely to have gained a science -related qualification from university or college, as those whose parents were not interested in science . Twelve per cent of the public say that one or both of their parents have worked in a scientific or medical field. Those with a parent who has worked in a scientific or medical field are twice as likely to have themselves worked in a scientific or medical field as those whose parents have not worked in these areas.

How useful is an understanding of science in everyday life ? While the majority of the public (66 per cent) say that their understanding of science is useful in their everyday lives , a greater proportion (87 per cent) say that it is useful for others - people in general - to have an understanding of science in their everyday lives (Figure 3.137). There is evidence that the importance the public place on knowing about science has increased in recent years. The Public Attitudes to Science study (BIS, 2014) measured public agreement with the statement \"it is important to know about science in my daily life\". Almost three -quarters (72 per cent) agreed with this statement in 2014, compared with 62 per cent in 2008, and 50 per cent in 1996.

Turning to how useful the public think it is for people in general to have an understanding of science in their everyday life, while ther e is no significant variation by gender, those aged 35 to 49 are most likely to think this is useful (91 per cent), and those aged 65 or over least likely (83 per cent). 37 Figure 3.1 shows data from SciDaily and SciDaily2 (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

How confident are people when mak ing decisions about their health? The great majority of the public (90 per cent) feel confident in making informed decisions about their health (such as deciding whether to have a flu jab, or whether to make a doctor's appointment when they are feeling unw ell), with half (48 per cent) saying they feel very confident (Figure 3.440). While confidence in making informed health -related decisions is high across the population, there are some differences by sub -group. W omen are significantly more likely than men to feel confident in making informed decisions about their health, however this difference is small (93 per cent, compared with 88 per cent). There are no significant differences in confidence levels by age . By social class , those in managerial and profes sional occupations are most likely to feel confident (93 per cent, falling to 79 per cent among those who have never worked or are long - term unemployed ). With respect to qualifications in science, 96 per cent of those with a science -related qualification f rom university or college express confidence, falling to 87 per cent among those with no science -related qualifications. Reflecting this pattern, among those who sco re highly on the knowledge quiz, 93 per cent say they feel confident. This falls to 84 per cent among those with low scores. To examine the extent to which confidence in making health -related decisions may be linked to the medical and scientific expertise within one's personal and professional networks, 40 Figure 3.4 shows data from ConfHlth (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

They were also asked whether they know anyone with a job in another scientific field whom they feel able to talk to , or ask for advice abou t scientific or medical issues . Among those who know someone with a job in a medical field, 93 per cent express confidence in making informed decisions relating to their health, higher than the 88 per cent among those who say they do not know such a person . And a mong those who know someone with a job in another scientific field, 96 per cent express confidence, higher than the 87 per cent among those who do not know such a person . Confidence in challenging the conclusions of medical professionals The Wellcom e Trust is interested in the extent to which the public tend to defer to medical professionals without question, or alternatively, are confident challenging and questioning medical professionals if they do not feel the advice they are receiving is correct. Respondents were read the following scenario, and were asked to say how much the person described in the vignette was like them: When he41 sees a medical professional, he likes to ask questions to make sure the medical professional hasn't made a mistake or missed something, and feels confident querying or challenging the medical professional's conclusions. Half of the public (48 per cent) say the person described is like them, including just over one- quarter (28 per cent ) who say the person described is ver y much like them (Figure 3.542). Only 15 per cent say the person described is not at all like them. Figure 3.5 Confidence in challenging a medical professional's conclusions Q.

Those who say they know someone working in a medical field are more likely to feel that the person described is li ke them, or very much like them (54 per cent, compared with 42 per cent among those who do not know such a person ). Similarly, those who say they know someone working in a nother scientific field are more likely to say the person described is like them, or very much like them (57 per cent, compared with 43 per cent among those who do not know such a person ). Confidence in challenging a medical professional's conclusions is higher among those with higher educational qualifications, and among th ose who are more knowledgeable about science. Among those with a postgraduate degree, the majority (63 per cent) feel t he person described is like the m, or very much like them, falling to half (49 per cent) among those with GCSEs or O levels, and to a mino rity (36 per cent ) among those with no qualifications. With respect to qualifications in science specifically, those with a science -related qualification from university or college are more likely to feel th e person described is like them, or very much like them (58 per cent) than those with science -related qualifications from school (45 per cent), or with no science -related qualifications at all (also 45 per cent). And with respect to scientific knowledge , as defined by answers to the knowledge quiz, over half (56 per cent) of those with high scores fe el the description is like them, or very much like them , falling to two in five ( 40 per cent ) among those with low scores. By social class , those working in managerial or professional occupations are most conf ident in challenging the conclusions of medical professionals, with 54 per cent feeling the description is like them , or very much like them, compared with 42 per cent among those who have never worked or are long -term unemployed.

How many people work in a scientific or medical field? One in five (22 per cent) of the public live in a household in which they, or someone else, works or has previously worked in a scientific or medical field (Figure 3.643). Fourteen per cent of adults say that they themselves work or have worked in a scientific or medical field.44 Figure 3.6 Households with experience of jobs in a scientific or medical field Q. Have you or any of the other adults in your household ever had a job in a scientific or medical field?

One in five (21 per cent) cite good career prospects, and a similar pr oportion (18 per cent) refer to the chance to make a difference. Reasons such as pay, parental encouragement, or the influence of other family members are mentioned less frequently. Figure 3.7 Why respondent pursued job in a scientific or medical field Q.

However, men are far more likely than women to cite being good at science at sch ool as a rea son (26 per cent compared with five per cent). Mentions of this reason do not vary by age group. 3.5. Social and family networks Parental employment in scientific or medical fields Twelve per cent of the public say that one or both of their parents have had a job in a scientific or medical field (10 per cent say just one of their parents has, and a further two per cent say both of their parents have)46. Older adults are less likely than younger adults to say their parents have worked in a scientific or medical field (seven per cent of those aged 65 or over , compared with 17 per cent of those aged 18 to 34). This is likely to reflect the changing nature of the economy over the past fifty 45 Figure 3.7 shows data from YesSciJB (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table). 46 Data are from PScJB (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

F or instance, Census data published by the Office for National Statistics (2013) shows that the proportion of the workforce in England and Wales employed in the service industry (which includes health, scientific, and technical activities) has increas ed from just under half in 1961, to around four in five in 2011, while over this period the proportion working in manufacturing has fallen from around two in five, to just under one in ten . Twenty -three per cent of those who have had a scientific or medical job themselves are children of parents who have had suc h a job, over twice the proportion among those who have never had a scien tific or medical job (10 per cent). Considering this pattern from the parents' perspective, among those with a parent who has worked in science or medicine, 28 per cent have worked in science or medicine themselves, while among adults whose parents have never worked in science or medicine, only 13 per cent have worked in science or medicine themselves. A similar relationship is evident with respect to qualifications in scie nce. Among t hose with a science -related qualification from university or college, 23 per cent have a parent who has worked in science or medicine, while among those with no science -related qualifications, this falls to just five per cent. And from the perspective of p arents, among adults with a parent who has worked in science or medicine, almost half (48 per cent) have gained a science - related qualification from university or college, over twice the proportion among those whose parents have never worked in science or medicine (21 per cent). Parental interest in science Most of the public (62 per cent) say that when they were growing up, their parents were not interested in science, almost double the proportion (32 per cent) who say their parents were interested in scie nce (Figure 3.847).

In addition, those whose parents were interested in science while they were growing up are more than twice as likely to have gained a science -related qualification from university or college as those whose parents were not interested in science (41 per cen t, compared with 17 per cent). These data illustrate a strong relationship between adults' employment in science and the science -relate d experiences of their parents, and are consistent with separate research by Archer et al. (2013) which found that among children aged 10 to 14, parental attitudes to science is one of the factors most strongly related to a child's likelihood of aspiring to be a scientist. However, these data from the Monitor do not establish a causal relationship, and it should be noted th at other socio -demographic factors are likely to influence the likelihood that an individual gains employment in a scientific or medical field. Only six per cent of those who have worked in a scientific or medical field explicitly mention parental encourag ement as a motivating factor, and only three per cent explicitly mention having a parent who worked in science or medicine as a motivating factor (see Figure 3.7). Furthermore, it is possible that some respondents' reports of how interested their parents w ere when they were growing up are inaccurate , whether by problems with recall, or due to their own interest in science biasing their responses.

Cultural and informal science experiences This chapter focuses on people's visits to science museums, and othe r science -related and cultural experiences and attractions. The chapter also examines how visiting such attractions varies according to individual characteristics and group memberships . Key findings: One in five (20 per cent) of the public has visited a sc ience museum or science centre in the last 12 months, and s even in ten (71 per cent) say that they have visited a science museum or science centre at some point in their life. Younger adults are more likely than older adults to have visited a science muse um or science centre in the past 12 months (27 per cent of those aged 18 to 34 and 28 per cent of those aged 35 to 49, falling to just seven per cent of those aged 65 or over). By socio -economic group, those in managerial and professional occupations are most likely to have visited a science museum or science centre in the past 12 months (29 per cent, compared with 10 per cent among those in routine and manual occupations, and 10 per cent also among those who have never worked or are long -term unemployed ). By contrast, one-third (33 per cent) of the public have visited a history museum in the last 12 months, and 30 per cent have visited an art gallery. Almost all (96 per cent) those visiting a science museum or science centre in the last 12 months found the experience interesting. The majority of the public (57 per cent) have watched a film or television programme involv ing science or medical research in the last 12 months , and around one in five (19 per cent) have listened to a radio programme involving sci ence or medical research. Overall, 51 per cent of the public have made a visit to a science -related attraction or event in the p ast twelve months. 4.1. How often do people visit science museums or centres? One in five of the public (20 per cent ) has made at lea st one visit to a science museum or science centre in the past 12 months (Figure 4. 148). Half (52 per cent) say they have not made such a visit in the past 12 months, and 29 per cent say they have never visited a science museum or centre. 48 Figure 4. 1 shows data from SciCent (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

In 2015, the response code 'Never' was replaced with 'Not in the past 12 months' and ' I have n ever visited science museum or science centre'. Since 2009, there has been a fall in the proportion of the public making at least one annual visit to a science museum or centre. This proportion has fallen from 32 per cent in 2009, to 26 per cent in 2012, and to 20 per cent in 2015. However, comparisons between 2015 and earlier years should be made with caution due to a change to the response codes . The 2009 and 2012 questionnaires included the code \"Never [in the past 12 months]\", which in 2015 was separated into two codes: \"Not in the past 12 months\" and \"I have n ever visited a science museum or science centre\" . It is possible (although the data cannot address this directly ) that the inclusion in 2015 of an explicit code for never having visited a science museum or centre led respondents to feel more comfortable saying they had not made such a visit in the past 12 months, reducing a tendency to over-report visits that may have been evident in previous waves . Younger adults are more likely to have visited a science museum or centre in the past 12 months (27 per cent of those aged 18 to 49, compa red with 11 per cent of those aged 50 or over). Those living in households with children (aged 18 or below) are also more likely to have visited (28 per cent, compared with 16 per cent among those living in households with no children). Frequency of visits does not vary by gender . Visiting science museums or centres is strong ly related to educational qualification s. Two in five (42 per cent) of those with a postgraduate degree, and one-third (34 per cent) of those with a first degree have visited a science museum or centre in the past 12 months. This falls to just five per cent among those with no qualifications. Among those who have a science - related qualification from university or college one-third (34 per cent) have visited a science museum or centre in the past 12 months . This falls to 19 per cent among those with a science - related qualification from school, and to 11 per cent among those with no science -related qualifications. By social class , those in managerial and professional occupations are most li kely to have made at least one visit to a science museum or centre in the past 12 months (29 per cent, compared with 10 per cent for those in routine and manual occupations, and 10 per cent Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Chapter 4: Cultural and informal science experiences 47 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 among those who have never worked or are long -term unemployed). Similarly, those with higher annual household incomes are more likely to have visited a science museum or centre in the past 12 months (30 per cent of those with a (pre -tax) hous ehold income of \u00a350,000 or more and 26 per cent of those with an income between \u00a329,000 and \u00a349,999, falling to 15 per cent among those with an income between \u00a310,000 and \u00a319,999, and 13 per cent among those with an income below \u00a310,000). Separate qualitative research by Dawson (2014) finds that those from low -income, minority ethnic backgrounds can experience science museums and centres as unwelcoming places, and that infrequent visits among these groups are not merely attributable to issues of affordability . Those who themselves have a serious long-term illness or medical condition (regardless of whether their friends or family have such a condition) are less likely to have visited a science museum or centre in the past 12 months than those without a serious long-term illness or medical condition (12 per cent, compared with 22 per cen t). 4.2. How interesting do people find science museums or centres ? Almost all those who have visited a s cience museum or centre in the p ast 12 months say they found their most recent visit interesting (96 per cent ). Two-thirds (67 per cent ) found the visit very interesting, and three in ten (29 per cent ) found it fairly interesting (Figure 4.249). Men and women are equally likely to have found their most recent visit interesting, and interest levels are also similar across age groups. 49 Figure 4 .2 shows data from SciCentInt (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

Science -related attractio ns and experiences Respondents were asked whether they had visited a range of science -related attractions in the last 12 months, or whether they had listened to or watched a science -related programme across a range of media (Figure 4.350). Of the attraction s and programmes asked about, t he public are most lik ely to have watched a film or television programme involving science or medical research (57 per cent), followed by visiting a nature reserve (41 per cent), and visiting a zoo or aquarium (36 per cent). Respondents were also asked for their experiences of two cultural attractions - whether th ey had visited a history museum, or an art gallery, in the last 12 months. One-third (33 per cent) of the public have visited a history museum, and 30 per cent have visited an art gallery in the last 12 months; both these proportions are higher than the proportion of the public that have visited a science museum or centre in the last 12 months (20 per cent). One in five (19 per cent) said they had not done any of the things listed in the last 12 months. We defined those making a \"science -related visit\" as those who had visited one or more of the following in the last 12 months: a science museum or science centre, a science -related art exhibition or installation, a zoo or aquarium, a planetarium , a working laboratory or similar scientific site , a local community science event , a science festival, or a science talk. By this yardstick, half (51 per cent ) have made a science -related visit in the past 12 months. Younger ad ults are more likely to have made a science -related visit, with two-thirds (65 per 50 Figure 4.3 shows data from SciVisit (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

There is no difference by gender. Making a science -related visit is strongly related to qualification levels. Seven in ten (72 per cent) of those with a postgraduate degree, and 69 per cent of those with a first degree have made a science -related visit in the past 12 months. This falls to less than half (4 7 per cent) of those with GCSEs or O levels, and to one-quarter (25 per cent) among those with no qualifications. With respect to science -related qualification s, 69 per cent of those with a science -related qualification gained from university or college ha ve made a science -related visit, compared with 37 per cent among those with no science -related qualifications. Three in five ( 60 per cent) of those in managerial and professional occupations have made a science -related visit in the last 12 months. This fal ls to 42 per cent among those in routine and manual occupations , and to 37 per cent among those who have never worked or are long -term unemployed. Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Chapter 5: Public interest in hearing directly from scientists 50 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 5. Public interest in hearing from scientists The Wellcome Trust is committed to encouraging people of all ages , and from all walks of life, to be informed about , inspired by, and involved in science. In this chapter, we consider the extent to which the public are interested in hearing directly from scientists about the work they are conducting . We also examine the nature of that interest: what do people want to know about, and how should this be communicated? Key findings : The majority (63 per cent) of the public say they are interested in hearing directly from scientists about the research they are conducting. Almost three -quarters (73 per cent) of those interested in hearing directly from scientists want to hear about the current or latest findings from scientific research, and almost three in five (57 per cent) want to hear about scientific research that is relev ant to their lives. Those interested in hearing directly from scientists would prefer to do so via the television, the radio or from a podcast (73 per cent), or from a newspaper, magazine, book, blog or website (65 pe r cent) . These preferences coincide wit h the channels via which the public tend to come across information about medical research (as reported in Chapter 2), the most common of which are television, website s, and newspaper s. Other preferred channels for hearing directly from scientists include listening to a lectur e, talk or debate (31 per cent), and from a museum or exhibition (23 per cent). Younger adults are more likely than older adults to express a preference for online channels of communications, as well as those channels which involve mak ing a visit outside the home, or actually interacting with a scientist. 5.1 Interest in hearing directly from scientists about their research Respondent s were asked to what extent, if at all, they were interested in hearing directly from scientists about the r esearch they are conducting. It was explained that this could include anything from talking with scientists , to reading a newspaper article written by a scientist. The majority of the public (63 per cent ) say they are interested in hearing directly from scientists about the research they are conducting, with one in five (18 per cent) saying they are very interested (Figure 5 .151). Around one -third (36 per cent) of the public say they are not very interested, or are not at all interested in hearing directly from scientists. A small proportion (one per cent) are unable to say whether they would be interested in hearing directly from scientists or not, because this would depend on the context, such as the topic or whether the research was relevant to them. 51 Figure 5.1 shows data from ScEng (press CTRL and click on question name to access d ata table).

Chapter 5: Public interest in hearing directly from scientists 51 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 Men are more likely than women to say they are interested in hearing directly from scientists about the work they are conducting (66 per c ent, compared with 60 per cent). Interest shows no significant variation , however, by age group . Interest in hearing dir ectly from scientists is strong ly related to educational achievement. Three -quarters ( 76 per cent ) of those with a postgraduate degree express an interest in hearing directly from scientists , falling to two in five ( 41 per cent ) among those with no qualifi cation s. And 79 per cent of those with a science -related qualification from university or college express an interest , compared with 51 per cent among those with no science -related qualifications . Interest in hearing directly from scientists is also associ ated with other attitudes and behaviours relevant to science and medical research. For instance, among the 77 per cent who say they are interested in medical research, three -quarters (73 per cent) say they are interest ed in hearing directly from scientists , compared with just 28 per cent among those who say they are not interested in medical research. And of those who have made a science -related visit in the past 12 months52, three -quarters (74 per cent) say they are interested in hearing directly from scien tists. This falls to half (5 2 per cent) among those who have not made such a visit. Those who are more optimistic about medical research are more likely to be interested in hearing directly from scientists. Among those who believe that medical research wil l lead to an improvement in the quality of life for people in the UK over the next 20 years, two -thirds (64 per cent) express an interest in hearing directly from scientists. Among those who do not believe medical research will lead to such improvements, t his proportion falls to 40 per cent. 52 See chapter 4 for details about the definition of a \"science -related visit\".

Respondents who expressed an interest in hearing directly from scientists about their research were asked to choose from a list which research -related activity or ac tivities they would be interested in hearing about (Figure 5.253). The most popular choice is hearing about the latest findings from scientific research (chosen by 73 per cent) . Almost three in five (57 per cent) are interested in hearing about research tha t is relevant to them personally, and two in five (43 per cent) would welcome the opportunity to hear directly from scientists about how scientific research is done these days. Taking the top three most frequently mentioned areas of interest, men (47 per cent) are significantly more likely than women (39 per cent) to express an interest in how scientific research is done these days . Men and women do not differ, however, in their interest in hearing about the latest findings from scientific research, or hearing about scientific research of personal relevance. Younger adults are more likely to express an interest in hearing about the latest findings from scientific research (76 per cent of those aged 18 to 34, compared with 66 per cent of those aged 65 or o ver), and in hearing about scientific research of personal relevance (63 per cent , compared with 48 per cent). I nterest in hearing about how scientific research is done these days does not differ by age group . 53 Figure 5.2 shows data from ScEngArea (press CTRL and click on question name to acces s data table).

Those expressing an interest in hearing directly from scientists about their research were asked how they would prefer to hear from them (Figure 5.354). The most popular communication channels are television, radio or a podcast (73 per cent), followed by reading about the research in a newspaper, magazine, book, blog or on a website (65 per cent). Tree in ten (31 per cent) say they would like to listen to a lecture, talk or debate, and one-quarter (23 per cent) say they would like to hear via a museum or exhibition. The most popular communication channels are passive in nature; they do not require interaction with a scientist. Of those channels which do involve direct interaction with a scientist, the most frequently mentioned was attending a laboratory op en day (19 per cent). These preferred communications channels follow a similar pattern to the manner in which people say they actually hear or read about new scientific research, as measured by the Public Attitudes to Science study (BIS, 2014). This rese arch found that television news was the most common medium, followed by other programmes on television , and print newspapers. It is also instructive to compare these preferred communication channels with the channels via which the public tend to come acros s information about medical research, the most common of which are on television, on a website, and in a newspaper (see Figure 2.11 in Chapter 2). The preferred channels for hearing directly from scientists differ by age . These differences are likely to reflect general communication preferences, rather than being specific to scientific research . 54 Figure 5.3 shows data from ScEngHow (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

Younger adults, on the other hand, are more likely to prefer online channels of communication, as well as channels which involve making a visit outside the home, or actually interacting with a scientist. For instance, a mong those aged 18 to 34, one-third (33 per cent) want to hear directly from scientists through social media ( compared with just five per cent among th ose aged 65 or over), and one -quarter (27 per cent) want to hear directly from scientists from an email n ewsletter (compared with 15 per cent among those aged 65 or over). Those aged 18 to 34 are more than twice as likely to wish to hear directly from scientists at a museum or exhibition than those aged 65 or over (32 per cent, compared with 13 per cent), fro m asking questions at a lecture, talk or debate (24 per cent, compared with 11 per cent), from meeting or talking with scientists in another situation (22 per cent, compared with nine per cent), or at a science or art festival (16 per cent, compared with s ix per cent). Men and women do not differ in how they would prefer to hear directly from scientists. We conducted further analysis to assess the extent to which different groups prefer to hear directly from scientists via active versus passive channels of communication. For this analysis, we allocated r espondents into one of three groups: Active (those mentioning one or more of \"a t a laboratory open day \", \"asking questions at a lecture, talk or debate \", \"to meet with/talk with scientists in some other situ ation \", and \"a t a science or art festival \"); Passive (those mentioning one or more of \"f rom the television, radio or podcast \", \"from a newspaper, magazine, book, blog or website \", \"listening to a lecture, talk or debate \" and \"b y email newsletter \", and no active channels); and Ambiguous whether passive or active (those mentioning one or more of \"from social media\", \"from an online chat room or discussion forum \", and \"from a museum or exhibition\", and no other channels). Overall, the majority (61 per cent) of those wishing to hear directly from scientists want to hear from them via passive channels only. Around two in five (37 per cent) express a preference for active forms of communication . The remaining two per cent wish to hear only via channels whose na ture is ambiguous . Younger adults are more likely to express a preference for active channels (45 per cent of those aged 18 to 34, falling to 26 per cent among those aged 65 or over). Reflecting this, older adults are more likely express a preference passi ve channels only ( 74 per cent of those aged 65 or over, compared with 54 per cent of those aged 18 to 34). Men and women do not differ in their preferences for active or passive communication channels. We also examined whether these communication preferenc es are associated with t he likelihood of having visited a science-related attraction .

A consortium of 15 funders of UK public research (inc luding the Wellcome Trust) commissioned TNS -BMRB and PSI (2015) to conduct research to inform strategies for supporting UK researchers to engage with the public. This found that three -quarters o f STEM researchers believe researchers have a moral duty to engage with the public, an d that 57 per cent believe the p ublic are enthusiastic to learn more about research, co mplementing the Monitor finding that 63 per cent of the public are interested in hearing directly from scientists about their work. The research further found that, since 2006, public engagement has become more valued, and better understood, by researchers. However, the proportion of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) researchers undertaking public engagement activities has onl y risen by a small proportion over t his period. The research concludes that more work is required if public engagement is to become a fully embedded aspect of the UK research culture. 55 As described in Chapter 4, we defined those making a \"scienc e-related visit\" as those who had visited one or more of the following in the last 12 months: a science museum or science centre, a science -related art exhibition or installation, a zoo or aquarium, a planetarium , a working laboratory or similar scientific site, a local community science event , a science festival, or a science talk Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3.

Participation in medical research This chapter examines public participa tion in medical research . It also examines the public's willingness to allow their medical records, and genetic information , to be used in medical research studies , and what concerns they may have about this. Key findings : One in eight ( 12 per cent ) of the public say they have , at some point, taken part in a medical research project . This level of participation has remained stable over the last six years. Of those living in a household where someone has taken part in medical research, 41 per cent say partic ipation involved testing a new drug, 39 per cent say a blood or tissue sample was provided, 37 per cent say a survey was completed, 26 per cent sa y participation involved health or behaviour monitoring, and 24 per cent say participation involved allowing access to medical records. Most of the public (77 per cent ) say they are willing to share their anonymised medical records for the purposes of medical research . A similar proportion (75 per cent ) say they are willing to share information from their genes fo r medical research purposes, again on an anonymous basis . The key concern among those unwilling to share their anonymised medical records, or anonymised genetic information , for the purposes of medical research relate s to confidentiality and privacy . Othe r concerns include a lack of trust, concerns with the research and what it is, not being interested or wanting to take part , and ( especially for sharing genetic information) not knowing enough about this type of research. 6.1. Public participation in medical re search A quarter of the public (24 per cent) report that either they, or a family member, have taken part in a medical research project (Figure 6.156). This proportion includes one in eight adults (12 per cent) who report that they themselves have taken par t in a medical research project. These findings ar e in line with the 2009 and 2012 surveys , where 23 and 22 per cent of the public , respectively, reported that either they, or a family member, had participated in a medical research project. 56 Figure 6.1 shows data from PartProj (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

Older adults are more likely to have taken par t in a medical research project: one in five (21 per cent) of those aged 65 or over have done so, three times the proportion among those aged 18 to 34 (seven per cent). It should be noted that this does not imply that an older adult is more likely to participate in a medical research project in a given year; rathe r, it is likely to reflect the fact that older adults have simply had more time to participate in medical research over their lives . The likelihood of having taken part in a medical research project does not differ by gender. Knowledge about science ( as me asured by the knowledge quiz) is associated with the likelihood of having participated in a medical research project. Among those with high scores , 16 per cent have taken part in a medical research project, compared with eight per cent of those with low sc ores. Adults with a serious long -term illness or medical condition , or with a friend or family member with such a condition , are more likely to have taken part in a medical research project than those with no experience of serious illness or disability (14 per cent, compared with 10 per cent). Those in managerial and professional occupations are most likely to have participated in a medical research project (17 per cent , compared with 10 per cent among those in all lower social classes ).

Among those who report that they or a family member have done this, the most recent project was most likely to involved testing a new drug or treatmen t (41 per cent) , provision of blood or tissue samples (39 per cent) , or the completion of a survey or questionnaire (37 per cent) . There has been little change since 2009 in the types of medical research projects that adults, or their fa mily members, have participated in. The only significant change over this period is a fall of nine percentage points in the proportion that say they, or a family member, have participated in a study requiring the provisio n of samples of blood or tissue (48 per cent in 2009, compared with 39 per cent in 2015 ).

Younger adults are more likely to say that the most recent study they (or a family member) participated in involv ed monitoring health or behaviour (39 per cent among those aged 18 to 34, falling to 18 per cent among those aged 65 or over ). No other significant differences emerge across the types of research project by age gro up, nor is there any significant differenc e by gender, or by experience of serious illness or disability . 6.2. Willingness to participate in, and concerns about, medical research projects that involve access to anonymised personal data The increasingly important role of anonymised patient data in biome dical research studies has focus ed attention on how willing the public are to share their personal medical and health - related data with researchers . We asked respondents how willing they would be to allow their medical records to be used in a medical resea rch study , if the information given to researchers exclude d their name , date of birth, address , and contact details. We also asked how willing they would be to allow information from their genes to be used in a medical research study, 57 Figure 6.2 shows data from TypeProj (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table). Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3.

We specified that by \"information from your genes \" we were referring to \"information about you contained in your DNA \". Almost four in five of the public (77 per cent) say they would be willing to allow their anonymised medical records to be used in a medical research study , and over two in five ( 43 per cent) say they would be very willing to do so (Figure 6.358). The public are equally likely to be willing for their anonymised genetic information to be used in a medical research study. Three -quarte rs (75 per cent) of the public say they would be willing to share their genetic information in this way , and two in five (40 per cent) say they would be very willing to do so.

In the second Wellcome Trust Monitor (2012), responden ts were asked \" How willing or unwilling would you be to take part [ again ] in a medical research project which involved allowing access to your personal health information, that is, your medical records, on an anonymous basis? \". Three in five (60 per cent) said they would be very willing, or fairly willing, to take part. While a majority, this is a lower proportion than the 77 per cent who express a willingness to share their medical records in the present research . This difference may, in part, be because the question wording in 2012 (\"how willing or unwilling would you be to take part...\") implied a greater chance of active participation on behalf of the respondent than did the wording in 2015 (\"how willing or unwilling would you be to allow informa tion from your genes to be used in a medical research study\" ). 58 Figure 6.3 shows data from WillAccMed and WillAccGen (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

Chapter 6: Participation in medic al research 60 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 It should also be noted that the questions asked in both 2012 and 2015 specified explicitly that the information provided to researchers would be anonymised. Recent research by the R oyal Statistical Soci ety (2014) highlights the impact of anonymisation on the public's willingness to share their personal data. This study found that the public's acceptance of their data being shared between government departments depended strongly on assurances of anonymity . While a minority (33 per cent) felt that \"we should share all the data we can [between government departments] because it benefits the services and me\", this rose to a majority (55 per cent) when it was made clear that the shared data would be anonymised , and that no individual could be identified. Recent research carried out by Ipsos MORI (2016), and commissioned by the Wellcome Trust , explored this theme further to look at public views on commercial access to health data. Qualitative research indicates that people tend to apply four key tests when judging the acceptability of data uses: why (the purpose needs to have public benefit), who (different types of commercial organisation are viewed as acting in the public interest to a greater or lesser extent ), what data (use of identifiable information is less acceptable than aggregate data) and how (safeguards and regulation are necessary). Subsequent quantitative research indicated that a slight majority support commercial access for research purposes. The f indings also revealed that the public know little about how health data is used (or could be used) within a commercial context beyond their direct care, nor about the safeguards that are already in place , nor about what counts as anonymised information. Willingness to share medical record s, and genetic information, by sub-group The public's w illingness to share their medical records , or genetic information, for use in a medical research study does not differ by age group , gender, or whether one is employed in a scientific or medical field. Participation in past medical research is , though, strongly associated with willingness to share medical records, or genetic information, for use in a medical research study. Among those who have previously participated i n a medical research project , 90 per cent are willing to share their medical records, and 86 per cent are willing to share their genetic information (compared with 76 per cent and 73 per cent , respectively , among those who have not previously participated in a medical research project ). Those with higher educational qualifications are more likely to be willing to share their medical records, or their genetic information. Among those with a postgraduate degree, 78 per cent are willing to share their medical records, and 73 per cent are willing to share their genetic information, and among those with A levels, 83 per cent are willing to share their medical records, and 83 are willing to share their genetic information. Among those with no educational qualifica tions, however, the proportion willing to share their medic al records falls to 66 per cent, and the proportion willing to share their genetic information to 64 per cent. Those who are more knowledgeable about science are more likely to be willing to share their medical records, and their genetic information. Among those with high scores on the knowledge quiz , 82 per cent are willing to share their medical records, and 80 per cent are willing to share their genetic information (compared with 66 per cent and 65 per cent respectively among those with low scores). Whether one has gained a science -related qualification, and the level of this qualification, however, does not bear a significant relationship with willingness to share either one's medical records, or one's genetic information.

Chapter 6: Participation in medic al research 61 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 People with a serious long -term illness or medical condition , or with a friend or family member with a serious long -term illness or medical condition , are more likely to be willing to share their data . Among those with experienc e of serious illness or disability , 82 per cent are willing to share their medical records, and 79 per cent are willing to share their genetic information (compared with 72 per cent and 70 per cent respectively among those with no experience of serious ill ness or disability ). In addition, among those with a serious genetic condition in their family, 84 per cent say they would be willing to share their medical records, compared with 76 per cent among those with no such genetic condition. While this is in the same direction as sharing genetic information (81 per cent of those with a genetic condition are willing to share their genetic information, compared with 74 per cent among those without a genetic condition), this difference is not statistical ly significa nt. There is a significant association between social class and willingness to share medical records. A mong those in managerial an d professional occupations four in five (81 per cent) say they are willing to share their medical records, compared with 57 pe r cent among those who have never worked or are long -term unemployed. Willingness to share genetic information, however, does not exhibit a significant relationship with social class . Willingness to share genetic information : multivariate analysis CHAID an alysis was carried out to identify the groups that are the most, and the least, willing to allow anonymised information from their genes to be used in a medical research study .59 The results of this analy sis are presented in Figure 6.4. At the first level ( the \"trunk\" ) are all respondents, amongst whom, as we have seen, 75 per cent are willing to allow anonymised information from their genes to be used in a medical research study . As we progress down the tree to the first \"branch\", we see that the variable that most strongly discriminates the public's willingness to share their genetic information is highest educational qualification, and our total sa mple is broken down into groups based on this variable. Those with no educational qualifications are least li kely to be willing to share their genetic information (64 per cent), while those with qualifications below degree level are most likely (79 per cent), and those with qualifications at degree level or higher lie towards the middle of this range (73 per cent ). Within these first groups defined by educational qualifications , the variable s that most discriminate willingness to share genetic information are shown in the next \"branch \" of the tree diagram . The final level shows that the most will ing group are peop le with: qualifications below degree level, with medium or high scores on the knowledge scale , who have worked in a scientific or medical field . Among this sub -group 92 per cent say they are willing to share their genetic information . In comparison , the proportion is just 56 per cent among people with qualifications at degree level or higher, with no experience of disability, and living in more deprived areas . 59 CHAID is a statistical technique that identifies the ch aracteristic that is most highly discriminating on the outcome variable. The characteristic which discriminates the most on the outcome variable within this first identified characteristic is then identified, producing a \"tree\" structure which identifies t he population sub - groups which have the highest and the lowest proportions in the categories of the outcome variable. In the specified model, the response variable was willingness to share genetic information, and the demographic variables were gender, age , social class, highest educational qualification, the level of area deprivation, experience of disability, presence of a genetic condition in the family, score on the knowledge quiz, and whether or not the respondent identified as belonging to a particula r religion.

As shown in Figure 6. 560, public concerns about sharing medical records are similar in nature to concerns about sharing genetic information. C onfidentiality and privacy issues are by far the most common concerns , cited by 64 per cent of those concerned about sharing their medical records, and - signi ficantly fewer, but still more than half - 54 per cent of those concerned about sharing their genetic information. Adults are less likely to mention other concerns as reason s behind their unwilling ness to share their medical records or genetic inf ormation . Fewer than one in five cite factors such as a lack of trust, concerns with the research itself, a lack of interest, or not knowing enough about these types of research. It is possible that the public's lack of familiarity with \" genetic information\", relat ive to \"medical records\", contributes to their unwillingness to share their genetic information. One in five (18 per cent) of those unwilling to allow their genetic information to be used in a medical research study say this is because they \"don't know eno ugh about it \". This is significantly higher than the proportion of those unwilling to share their medical records who give this reason (11 per cent).

This research asked the public how much trust they had in academic researchers and universities to \"use your data appropriately\". Among those who said they had a low level of tru st, the main reasons underlying this were a concern their data would be used for other purposes, about which they would not be informed (mentioned by 49 per cent), a concern their data might be lost to hackers ( also 49 per cent), and a concern their data might be lost by accident (42 per cent).

What does the public know about science and medical research? This chapter begins by looking at how knowledgeable the public are about science, as measured by a knowledge quiz which has been used in all three waves of the Wellcome Trust Monitor. The chapter then examines public understanding of how medical research is conducted, public understanding of genetic modification, and public awareness of genetic tests that can predict the likelihood of developing geneticall y influenced conditions. The chapter also considers public understanding o f the drug development process. Key findings: The public's k nowledge about science, as measured by the knowledge quiz, has been broadly stable over the last six years. Women are less likely to score highly than men, and those aged 65 and over are less likely to score highly than younger adults. When presented with three options as to how a drug's effectiveness can best be tested, seven in ten (70 per cent) choose the controlled experi mentation option , with far fewer choosing the other two options: talking to patients to get their opinion (14 per cent), and scientists using their own knowledge to decide (10 per cent) . Adults aged between 50 and 64 are most likely to choose the controlle d experimentation option (78 per cent), while those aged 18 to 34 are least likely to (65 per cent). When those choosing the controlled experimentation option are asked why they chose it, the most common responses relate to comparing groups of patients, pr oviding a true picture or conclusive results, and to the placebo effect. Nine in ten (90 per cent) of the public have heard of the term \"GM, or genetically modified\" . Of these, only around one-third (36 per cent) say they have a very good or good understan ding of what the term means. Almost nine in ten (86 per cent) of the public say they are aware of genetic tests that predict the likelihood of developing gen etically influenced diseases, although over a quarter (27 per cent) say they have not hear much abo ut them. Over half (53 per cent) of the public believe that life evolved as a result of natural selection, without the involvement of God. This proportion rises to 63 per cent among those with a science -related qualification from university or college, and falls to 44 per cent among those with no science -related qualifications. Around one in five (22 per cent) believe life evolved in a process guided by God, and a similar proportion (19 per cent) believe all life was created by God, and has always existed i n its current form. The amount of time taken to develop a medical treatment varies greatly, but research suggests it takes between 15 and 25 years from the pre -discovery phase to availability to patients . Half (50 per cent) of the public believe it takes b etween 10 and 20 years , on average , to develop a medical treatment . Around one in ten (11 per cent) believe s the process takes less than ten years, and 16 per cent say they do not know how long it takes. Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3.

Results of the knowledge quiz The questionnaire included a knowledge quiz to measure respondents' scientific literacy. This compr ised nine \"true or false\"61 questions that were asked in both 2009 and 2012 , as follows:62 Q. For each of the following statements, please say whether you think it is definitely true, probably true, probably false or definitely false. If you don't know, jus t say so and we'll go on to the next o ne: All plants and animals have DNA (True) The oxygen we breathe comes from plants (True) The cloning of living things produces genetically identical copies (True) By eating a genetically modified fruit, a person's ge nes could also become modified (False ) All radioactivity is man -made (False ) It is the mother's genes that determine the sex of the child (False ) Lasers work by focusing sound waves (False ) More than half of human genes are identical to those of mice (True ) Electrons are smaller than atoms (True) When reporting the results of the knowledge quiz, respondents have been classified into thr ee groups. Those who answered between 0 and 4 questions correctly were classified as \"low \" scoring, those who answered bet ween 5 and 7 questions correctly were classified as \"medium \" scoring and those answering between 8 and 9 questions correctly were classified as \"high\" scoring (Figure 7.1). This follows the classification method employed in both 2009 and 2012 . 61 For each question, respondents \"probably true\" in the case of true statements (o r \"definitely false\" or \"probably false\" in the case of false statements) were scored as having answered correctly. 62 The questionnaire also included one additional question asked in 2015 for the first time : \"1 kilogram of lead has the same mass on Earth a s it does on the Moon \" (True) . This was included to provide additional discriminatory power to analysts wishing to explore the data by scientific knowledge. For reasons of consistency with waves 1 and 2, this item has been excluded for the purposes of allo cating respondents into the \"high\", \"medium\" and \"low\" quiz grouping. Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Chapter 7: What does the public know about science and medical research? 67 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 At points throughout this report, findings are broken down according to scores on the knowledge quiz, with respondents grouped by hig h, medium and low scores. Figure 7.1 Knowledge quiz scores Base: All respondents Wellcome Trust Monitor Monitor w 1 (2009) Monito r w2 (2012) Monitor w3 (2015) Proportion providing correct answers % % % High (8 -9) 25 23 29 Medium (5 -7) 58 53 52 Low (0 -4) 16 are more likely to score highly than women (36 per cent, compared with 21 per cent) . Research in this area (e.g. see Sturgis at al., 2008) suggests that this gender difference is partly to do with the greater propensity of men to guess answers when they are uncertain and for women to say they do n ot know when they might guess the answer cor rectly at a rate higher than 50 per cent. T he difference may also reflect cultural differences in what is seen to constitute knowledge about science and, relatedly, the selection of items in the knowledge quiz. Older adults are less likely to score highly (22 per cent among those aged 65 or over , compared with 31 per cent among those aged 50 to 64, and 30 per cent among those aged 49 and under). Those with a postgraduate degree are most likely to score highly (54 per cent), over four times the proportion among those with no educational qualifications (12 per cent). With respect to scientific qualifications specifically, almost half (49 per cent) of those who have gained a science -related qualification from universi ty or college score highly, compared with 28 per cent of those with science -related qualification from school, and 16 per cent of those with no science -related qualification s. Those in managerial or professional occupations are most likely to score highly on the knowledge quiz (41 per cent), while those in routine and manu al occupations (18 per cent) are least likely .

Do people understand the principles behind clinical trials? How do people think clinical trials work? The majority of the public believe th at controlled experimentation is the best way for scientists to find out if a treatment works . As illustrated in Figure 7 .263, 70 per cent of the public think the effectiveness of a drug developed to treat high blood pressure can best be tested by giving th e drug to a random half of patients, but not to the other half, and then comparing blood pressure between the two groups of patients. Fourteen per cent of the public think that talking to patients to get their opinion would be the best way, while 10 per ce nt think that scientists should use their knowledge of science and medicine to determine the effectiveness of the drug. Awaren ess of how clinical trials work varies by age. Those aged 50 to 64 are most likely to choose the controlled experimentation opti on (78 per cent), while those aged 65 or over (66 per cent) and those aged 18 to 34 (65 per cent) are least likely. Men and women do not differ in their l ikelihood of choosing the control led experimentation option . Awareness of the mechanism by which clini cal trials work is related to knowledge of science, as measured by scores on the knowledge quiz . Among those obtaining high scores, 87 per cent choose the controlled experimentation option, compared with just 38 per cent of those obtaining low scores. Thos e who have had a job in a scientific or medical field are more likely to choose the controlled experimentati on option than those who have not (86 per cent, compared with 67 per cent), and related to this, 82 per cent of those who have a science - related qua lification from university or college choose the co ntrolled experimentation option, 63 Figure 7.2 shows data from DrugEff2 (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table). Figure 7.2: How people think clinical trials work Q.Suppose a drug has been developed to treat high blood pressure. Here are 3 different ways scientists might use to determine whether the drug is effective. Which one do you think would be the best way for scientists to find out if the drug works?

Around f our in five ( 83 per cent ) adults working in managerial or professional occupations choose the controlled experimentation option. This falls to 58 per cent of those in routine or manual occupations, and to a minority (38 per cent ) of those who have never worked or are long-term unemployed. Among this latter group, one in five (22 per cent) say they do not know what the best method would be ( compared with five per cent across all adults). Those who have previously taken part in a medical research project are more likely to choose the controlled experimentation option than those who have not (83 per cent, compared with 68 per cent).

Respondents identifying a particular approach as being the best for testing a drug's effectiveness were asked why they chose this approach (Figure 7 .364). Their verbatim responses to this question were recorded by interviewers, and subsequently coded to a code frame. Among those believing controlled experim entati on to be the best option, aroun d one-quarter (28 per cent) made reference to outcomes being compared between the two groups, 15 per cent mentioned that this method would show a true picture, or conclusive results or proof, nine per cent mentioned the placebo effect , and nine per cent me ntioned tests of the drug .

Those who think that scientists should use thei r own knowledge to determine a drug's effectiveness are least likely to provide any justification: 16 per cent of this group say they do not know why this would be the best method, and a further 16 per cent simply refer to the expertise of doctors and scientists. 7.3. Understanding of genetic modification The great majority (90 per cent) of the publi c have heard of the term \"GM, or genetically modified\" ( Figure 7. 465). Less than two in five (36 per cent), however, feel they have a very good or good understanding of what the terms means, a proportion that has not changed significantly since 2012 (34 per cent). Men are more likely than women to say they have a very good or good understanding of genetic modification (42 per cent, compared with 30 per cent). Of course , this does not necessarily mean that men have a more accurate understanding of the term , it may simply mean that they are more confident that their understanding is correct. Reported understanding of genetic modification does not have a significant relati onship with age. Figure 7.4 Self-reported understanding of genetic modification Q.

Their verbatim responses to this question were recorded by interviewers, and were subsequently code d to a code frame. The most common responses relate to genes being c hanged, altered, or modified ( mentioned by 18 per cent), human intervention (11 per cent), and to \"something\" (non-specified) being changed, altered, or modified (11 per cent) . More detai led responses are less common ; for instance, just eight per cent refer to DNA specifically being changed, altered, or modified, and just four per cent make explicit reference to genetic information being taken from one organism and added to another. Fiftee n per cent of those who have heard of the term say they do no t know what it means. Figure 7.5 What is understood by the term \"GM, or genetically modified \" Q.

Awareness of genetic tests A clear majority of the public ( 86 per cent) say they are aware of genetic tests that predict the likelihood of developing genetic ally influenced diseases , such as heart disease and cancer , although one-quarter (27 per cent) say they have not hear d much about them (Figure 7 .667,68). Fourteen per cent, however, have heard nothing at all about such tests.

Th is example was removed in 2015. * indicates a percentage less t han 0.5%, but greater than 0. Adults in the middle of the age range are most likely to be aware of such tests; 90 per cent of those aged 35 to 49, and 89 per cent of those aged 50 to 64 say they are aware of genetic tests, compared with 84 per cent of tho se aged 18 to 34, and 79 per cent of those aged 65 or over . Awareness does not vary significantly by gender. Those with a serious genetic condition in their family are more likely to be aware of genetic tests than th ose without such a condition (94 per cen t, compared with 85 per cent) , and those with a serious long -term illness or medical condition , or with a friend or family member with such a condition , are more likely to be aware than those with no experience of disability (88 per cent compared with 83 p er cent). Awareness of genetic tests has a significant relationship with social class : 92 per cent of those in managerial or professional occupations say they are aware of genetic tests , compared with 79 per cent among those in routi ne or manual occupation s, and 72 per cent among those who have never worked or are long -term unemployed. 67 Figure 7.6 shows data from GenTest2 (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table). 68 In 2009 and 2012 the question wording included Alzheimer's as an ex ample (i.e. \" How much have you read or heard about genetic tests that predict the likelihood that a person will develop certain genetically influenced diseases or cond itions, such as heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's? \"). This example was removed in 201 5, and as a result of this change, wave on wave significance testing has not been conducted. Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3.

The origins of life As illustrated in Figure 7 .769, just over half of the public (53 per cent) believe that life evolved as a result of natural selection, with God playi ng no part in th e process. One in five (22 per cent) believe that life evolved over time, bu t that this process was guided by God, and a similar pro portion (19 per cent) hold the \"creationist\" view that all life was created by God, and has always existed in its current form. Beliefs about the origins of life have remained broadly stable since 200 9, although there has been a fall in the proportion believing that life evolved in a process guided by God (from 27 per cent in 2 009, to 22 per cent currently). Men are more likely than women to believe that life evolved by natural selection, with God playing no part (58 per cent, compared with 48 per cent), and this belief is also more prevalent among younger adults (58 per cent of those aged 18 to 34, falling to 43 per cent of those aged 65 or over ). Turning to religious belief and practice, a mong those who do not regard themselves as belonging to any particular religion, 76 per cent believe that life evolved by natural selection, with God playing no part. Among those who regard themselves as belonging to a religion, but who attend services or meetings c onnected with their religion no more than twice a year, 43 per cent believe that life evolved by natural selection, with God playing no part. Among those 69 Figure 7.7 shows data from LifeEart (press CTRL and click on question name to acce ss data table).

Among this group, the majority (53 per cent) believe that humans and other living things were creat ed by God, and have always existed in their current form. Beliefs about the origin of life on earth are also related to the science -relate d qualifications people have gained, and to their knowledge about science. Among those with a science - related qualific ation gained from university or college, 63 per cent believe li fe evolved by natural selection with God playing no part , over four times the proportion (14 per cent) that hold the creationist view that humans and other living things were created by God and have always existed in their current form . Among those with a science -related qualificatio n gained from school, 55 per cent believe life evolved by natural selection with God playing no part, almost three times the proportion that hold the creationist vie w (19 per cent). And among those with no science -related qualification s, 44 per cent believe life evolved by natural selection with God playing no part, twice the proportion that hold the creationist view (22 per cent). Related to this, those who are more knowledgeable about science (as measured by the knowledge quiz ) are more likely to believe that life evolved by natural selection, with God playing no part (66 per cent among those with high scores, compared with 32 per cent among those with low scores ), and are less likely to hold the creationist view (10 per cent among those with high scores, compared with 34 per cent among those with low scores).

The length of time it takes to develop a medical treatment, from investing in early research, to the treatment being available to patients, varies considerably across types of medical treatment. Research suggests that it takes between 15 to 25 years for a medicine to be developed, from the pre -discovery phase during which scientists work to understand the disease, to eventual availability to patients (e.g. Glover et al., 2014; Paul et al., 2010 ; Health Economics Research Group, Office of Health Economics, and RAND Europe , 2008 ). In order to gauge the public's appreciation of this time -span, respondents were asked to indicate (by choosing their answer from a list) how long it takes to develop the average medical treatment, from investment in earl y research to the treatment being available to patients (Figure 7.870). Half of the public (50 per cent) think it takes over ten years, and up to 20 years, for the average medical treatment to be developed. One in ten (11 per cent) believe the process is faster than this, while 21 per cent believe it takes longer. A significant minority (16 per cent) say they do not know how long it takes to develop the average medical treatment. Figure 7.8 Length of time taken to develop the average medical treatment Q.

Respondents were asked to choose which organisation (from a list) spends the most on the development of new medical drugs in the UK (Figure 7.971). The majority of the public (65 per cent) correctly identify pharmaceutical companies as the highest spenders, while 20 per cent believe that the NHS and other public sector or gov ernment organisations spend the most.

By contrast, younger adults are more likely than older adults to believe that the NHS and other public sector or government organisations spend the most (27 per cent among those aged 18 to 34, compared with 17 pe r cent among those aged 65 or over ). Beliefs do not differ by gender. Identification of pharmaceutical companies as the largest funde rs of drug development in the UK has a significant relationship with people's science -related qualifications, and with their knowledge about science as measured by the knowledge quiz . Among those with a science - related qualification gained from university or college, 75 per cent believe pharmaceutical companies spend the most, while just 14 per cent believe that the NHS and ot her public sector or government organisations spend the most. Among those with no science -related qualifications, the proportion citing pharmaceutical companies falls to 59 per cent, while the proportion citing the NHS and other public sector or government organisations rises to 23 per cent. Reflecting this pattern, 79 per cent of those scoring highly on the knowledge quiz cite pharmaceutical companies (compared with 12 per cent who cite the NHS and other public sector or government organisations ), while ju st 40 per cent of those of those with low scores on the knowledge quiz cite pharmaceutical companies, in line with the 36 per cent who cite the NHS and other public sector or government organisations . 71 Figure 7.9 shows data from PhaFunds (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

What is important to the public when deciding what to eat and drink ? The Wellcome Trust's nationwide initia tive, The Crunch, aims to engage people of all ages with th e future of food and drink . The Crunch is a year of activities, experiences, and discussions about fo od, health and the planet. It provides free resources for schools, act ivities for families and a dults, and an opportunity for everyone to join in and have their say. The Monitor includes a range of questions about f ood choices, and one question about drink choices, to help us understand what the nation thinks about food and its relationship to our health and to our planet . Key findings: When the public hear the term \"healthy food\" they typically think of vegetables, salads and greens (mentioned by 60 per cent), and fruit (47 per cent). When asked about the importance of various factors when deciding what to eat and drink, the public prioritise considerations affecting their own health, namely sugar and salt content . The most important environmental factors are food coming from sustainable sources, food not c oming in a lot of packaging, and food being produced in the UK rather than in a foreign country. Older adults are more likely than younger adults to consider it important that their food is produced in the UK, is produced in their part of the country, and does not come in a lot of packaging . 8.1. What do people understand by the term \" healthy food\" ? Respondents were asked what comes to mind when they hear the term \"healthy food\" (Figure 8.172). Their verbatim responses to this question were recorded by interviewers, and were subsequently coded to a code fr ame. The term \"health y food\" elicits a wide variety of responses among the public, with the most common being \"vegetables, salads and greens \" (cited by 60 per cent), followed by fruit (47 per cent). Around two in five of the public (43 per cent) mention ve getables, salads and greens, as well as fruit. One in five (19 per cent) think of a balanced and healthy diet, 17 per cent mention food that is natural, fresh or home -grown and free from additives, while 15 per cent refer to food that is low in fat, or fat -free. 72 Figure 8.1 shows data from HFoodMean (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

Female, aged 23, Northern Ireland Food that's not salty. Male , aged 92, West Midlands Women are significantly more likely than men to think of vegetables, salads and greens , and fruit. Two-thirds of women (66 per cent ) say they think of vegetables, salads or greens, compared with 54 per cent of men, and over half of women (54 per cent) think of fruit, compared with 40 per cent of men. 8.2. What do people consider important when choosing what to eat? Four per cent of the public describe their diet as vegetarian, one per cent as vegan, and less than one per cen t as pescatarian.73 Women are almost three times more likely than men to describe their diet as vegetarian, vegan, or pescatarian (eight per cent, compared with three per cent) ; however , there is no significant variation by age. Respondents were asked how i mportant nine different factors are when deciding what to eat and drink (Figure 8.274). The results show that t he public prioritise considerations affecting their own health, with around four in five considering it important that what they eat and drink doe s not have a high sugar content, and that their food does not have high salt content. The majority of the public (73 per cent) consider it important that their food comes from sustainable sources, that their food does not come in a lot of packaging (66 per cent) , and that their food is produced in the UK (57 per cent) . Among the 90 per cent of the public who are aware of genetic modification, just over half (52 per cent) consider it important that their food is free from genetic modifications. The two least important considerations, of those asked about, are that food is produced locally (with 35 per cent considering this to be important ), or is organic (31 per cent). The majority of the public (70 per cent) consider five or more of the nine factors asked ab out to be important. 73 These data are from Vegetarian . 74 These data click on question name to access data table ).

Base is respondents who have heard of the term \"GM, or genetically modified\" (unweighted base: 1,372) . The biggest differences in how people weigh these factors are related to age. Older adults are more likely to place impor tance o n where their food is produced. Whereas 71 per cent of those aged 65 or over consider it important that their food is produced in the UK, only around two in five ( 41 per cent) of those aged 18 to 34 consider this important. Similarly, half of those aged 65 or over think it important that their food is produced in their part of the country (47 per cent), twice the proportion among those aged 18 to 34 (23 per cent). Another stark difference by age relates to packaging, with three -quarters (76 per cent) of those aged 65 or over (and a similar proportion of those aged 35 to 64) considering it important that their food does not come in a lot of packaging, compared with less than half (46 per cent) of those aged 18 to 34. Older adults are also mo re likely t o place importance on factors relating to their own health, reflecting the fact that older people are more likely to be in poor health . Four in five (82 per cent) of those aged 65 or over consider it important that their food does not have a high salt content, compared with 71 per cent of those aged 18 to 34. Similarly, 85 per cent of those Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3.

The importance placed on food being free from genetic modification, being organic, or coming from sustainable sources d oes not vary by age group . Women are significantly more likel y than men to place importance o n each of the factors asked about, with the exceptions of food being produced locally, or coming from sustainable sources (for which there are no significant gende r differences). In general, the differences in opinion between men and women are relatively small. The greatest difference relates to genetically modified food. Around three in five (63 per cent) women consider it important that their food is not genetical ly modified, compared with 42 per cent of men . The next largest difference relates to food being imported. Around three in five (63 per cent) women consider it important that their food is produced in the UK, compared with half (50 per cent) of men. There is evidence that those who know more about genetic modification are more willing to eat genetically modified foods . Those who say they have a very good or good understanding of the term \"GM, or genetically modified\" are less likely to consider it important that their food is free from genetic modification than those who do not have a good understanding of this term (48 per cent, compared with 56 per cent). Factors considered when choosing what to eat and drink : multivariate analysis This section explores th e factors the public consider when choosing what to eat and drink, grouping them into five groups (\"clusters\"), identified using a segmentation methodology. Segmentation, or cluster analysis, is a technique used to classify individuals into groups that are as similar as possible within each group , but as different as possible to the other groups, based on r esponses to a set of questions. We segmented the public using eight of the nine questions which asked about the importance of various factors when decidi ng what to eat and drink .75 Following preliminary analysis exploring several different segmentation solutions, a five cluster s olution was selected.76 We now present the groups . In interpreting the groups , reference can also be made to the demographic profi le of the groups , which is p resented in Figure 8.3 in the Annex to this chapter. Health -conscious . This is the largest group, accounting for one -quarter (24 per cent) of the public. These individuals place more importance on considerations affecting their own health (the sugar and salt content of their food, and the sugar content of their drink) than do the public as a whole, but are similar to the public as a whole with regard to other considerations, such as where food is produced, sustainably sourced food, packaging, and whether food is organic. Individuals in this group are more likely 75 The question asking how important it is that the food is not genetically modified (FDGM) was excluded from the analysis because it was only asked of a sub -set of respondents (those who had heard of the term \"GM, or genetically modified\"). 76 124 respon dents who answered \"don't know\", or who refused to provide an answer for one or more of the questions, were not assigned to a cluster.

Concerned about all factors . This group accounts for one in five (21 per cent) of the public. Adults in this group place high importance on each of the eight factors asked about, relative to the public as a whole. Consistent with the pattern among the public overall , they place the greatest importance on co nsiderations affecting their own health, and the least importance on local food production, or whether or not the food they eat is organic. Individuals in this group are more likely than the public as a whole to be women, to be aged 50 or over, and to live in less deprived areas of the country. Focused on local produce . This group accounts for one in five (22 per cent) of the public. Adults in this group are more likely, relative to the public as a whole, to place importance on food being produced in the UK , and in their area of the country, but are less likely to place importance on considerations affecting their own health. Individuals in this group are more likely than the public as a whole to live in less deprived areas of the country, and to have higher household incomes, Little concern for any factor but health . This group accounts for 16 per cent of the public. Individuals in this group are similar to the public as a whole in terms of the importance they place on factors affecting their own health, but they place less importance than do the public as a whole on other considerat ions, such as where food is produced, sustainably sourced food, packaging, and whether or not food is organic. Individuals in this group are more likely than the public as a whol e to be aged 18 to 34. Little concern for any factor . This is the sma llest group, accounting for 10 per cent of the public. Individuals in this group place little importance on each the eight factors asked about, compared to the public as a whole. Individu als in this group are more likely than the public as a whole to be male, to be aged 18 to 34, to be in routine and manual occupations, to have no educational qualifications, and to live in the more deprived areas of the country.

Chapter 9: Antibiotic resistance and the use of antibiotics 87 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 9. Antibiotic resistance and the use of antibiotics Antibiotics, which are used to treat or prevent bacterial infections, have been estimated by the World Health Organisation (2012) to have (along with v accines) lengthened our life -spans by an average of twenty years since the discovery of the first antibiotic, penicillin, by Alexander Fleming in 1928. However , the misuse of antibiotics has contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistance, whereby ba cteria are no longer affected by antibiotics, resulting in drug resistant infections becoming widespread . This chapter considers the public's awareness and understanding of antibiotic resistance , as well as their knowledge about the types of conditions that antibiotics can treat. The chapter then examines public behaviours around antibiotics, including how recently people have taken antibiotics , whether they adhere to their prescribed course, and the expectations they have of medical professionals to prescr ibe them antibiotics. Key findings: Awareness of the term \"antibiotic resistance\" is high, with 91 per cent of the public saying they have heard of the term. Antibiotic resistance is most commonly thought (mistakenly) to refer to one's body becoming resi stant or immune to antibiotics. Other common conceptions of antibiotic resistance are that antibiotics do not work, or have less effect, and that antibiotics are overused. Although m ost of the public (84 per cent) believe (correctly) that antibiotics treat bacterial infections, only two in five (41 per cent) have a fully accurate understanding, believing that antibiotics treat bacterial infections alone. Almost all of the public (91 per cent) have been prescribed antibiotics at some point in their lives , and around two in five (41 per cent) have been prescribed antibiotics in the last year . Over one in five (22 per cent ) of those who have been prescribed antibiotics believe there has been an occasion when they have been prescribed antibiotics inappropriately . The great majority (86 per cent) of those who have been prescribed antibiotics report following their most recent prescription as instructed , taking all the antibiotics they were prescribed, at the right times. However, six per cent (equating to 2.6 millio n adults across the UK ) say they did not finish the course, and this was typically because they were feeling better. Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3.

Of those who have asked for antibiotics, most (85 per cent) say their request was accepted the last time they asked, with younger adults more likely to have had their request accepted (94 per cent of those aged 18 t o 34, falling to 77 per cent of those aged 65 or over). Of those who se request for antibiotics was refused on asking , one-third (34 per cent) believe they should have been prescribed antibiotics. 9.1. Awareness and understanding of antibiotic resistance The gre at majority of the public (91 per cent) say they have heard of the term \"antibiotic resistance\", and most (56 per cent) say they have a very good or good understanding of the term (Figure 9.177). One in ten (11 per cent) say they have heard of the term but have little understanding of its meaning. Those aged between 18 and 34 are least likely to say they have a good or very good understanding of the term \"antibiotic resistance\" (49 per cent). This proportion rises to 63 per cent among those aged 50 to 64, and falls back to 55 per cent among those aged 65 or over . Professed understanding of antibiotic resistance does not vary by gender. 77 Figure 9.1 shows data from KnowABR (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

The most common responses relate (mistakenly) to one's body, or oneself, becoming resistant or immun e to antibiotics (31 per cent). This is consistent with recent qua litative research carried out by Good Business (2015) on behalf of the Wellcome Trust, which found that the public commonly talk about \"antimicrobial resistance\" in terms of changes to their own bodies, to their own tolerance levels, or to their own levels of immunity. Over one -quarter (28 per cent) understand antibiotic resistance to mean that antibiotics do not work, have less effect , or have no effect. One in five (20 per cent) refer to antibiotics bein g overused. One in ten (nine per cent) say they do not know what the term means.

What conditions do people think can be treated by antibiotics ? Respondents were asked to choose which conditions they though t could be treated effectively by antibiotics. The great majority of the public (84 per cent) correctly identify bacterial infections as being treatable by antibiotics (Figure 9.379). However, two in five (38 per cent) incorrectly believe that antibiotics are an effective treatment for viral infections, and 21 per cent incor rectly believe that antibiotics are an effective treatment for fungal infections. A minority of two in five (41 per cent) have an accurate understanding of what antibiotics can treat; that is, they believe that antibiotics are an effective treatment for bacterial infections alone .

Women are more likely than men to have an accurate understanding of what antibiotics can treat; 45 per cent of women believe that a ntibiotics are an effective treatment for bacterial infections alone, compared with 36 per cent of men. 79 Figure 9.3 shows data from ABTreat (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

Around half of those with a postgraduate degree (53 per cent) or with a first degree (47 per cent) have an accurate understanding of what antibiotics can treat, falling to under one -third (31 per cent) of those with no educational qualifications. Those who have taken antibiotics before are more likely than those who say they have never taken antibiotics to have an accurate understandin g of what antibiotics can treat (42 per cent, compared with 25 per cent). Figure 9.480 shows how the conditions the public believe antibiotic s can treat varies by their professed understanding of antibiotic resistance. For instance, among those who rate the ir understanding of antibiotic resistance as very good, 91 per cent believe antibiotics treat bacterial infections, over three times the proportion that believe antibiotics treat viral infections (28 per cent) . Among those who have not heard of the term an tibiotic resistance, however, the proportion that believe antibiotics treat bacterial infections falls to 65 per cent, and the proportion that believe they treat viral infections rises to a majority of 53 per cent. Of those rating their understanding of a ntibiotic resistance as very good, a slim majority (54 per cent) have an accurate understanding of the conditions antibiotics can treat (that is, they believe antibiotics are an effective treatment for bacterial infections alone).

What are peopl e's most recent experiences of, and attitudes towards, taking antibiotics The great majority of the public (91 per cent) say they have been prescribed ant ibiotics at some point in their life. Women are more likely to say they have been prescribed antibiotics than men (94 per cent, compared with 88 per cent). Nearly all adults aged between 50 and 64 say they have been prescribed antibiotics (96 per cent), wh ile among those aged 18 to 34, this proportion falls to 86 per cent (Figure 9 .581). 81 Figure 9.5 shows data from ABEvPresc (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table).

This equates to 41 per cent of all adults who have taken antibiotics in the last year. The Eurobarometer survey (2013) also found that 41 per cent of adults in the UK had taken antibiotics in the past 12 months. Half of women say they last took antibiotics within the last year (48 per cent), higher than the proportion among men (41 per cent). Those aged 18 to 34 are most likely to have taken antibiotics within the past year (52 per cent). This proportion falls amongst older respondents; 38 per cent among those aged 50 to 64, and 45 per cent among those aged 65 or over . Figure 9. 7 Most recent experience of taking antibiotics Q.

Respondents were asked to choose, from a list, the scenario that best described what t hey did on receiving the prescription for the antibiotics they took most recently. The great majority (86 per cent) report following their prescription as instructed , taking all the antib iotics they had been prescribed at the right times (Figure 9 .886). Seven per cent report that, although they took all the antibiotics they had been prescribed, they failed to do so at the right times, and a further six per cent (equating to 2.6 million adults across the UK ) say they failed to take all of the antibi otics they had been prescribed. This is consistent with research commissioned by Royal Society of Chemistry (2014) that found a similar pattern of adherence. Figure 9.8 Adherence to the prescribed course of antibiotics Q.

Among those aged 18 to 34, one in five (20 per cent) report s either failing to take all the antibiotics they were prescribed, or taking them at the wrong times . This is almost twice the proportion among those aged 35 to 49 (11 per cent), and more than twice the proportion among those aged 65 or over (eight per cent). Failure to follow the prescribed course does not vary by gender, by social class , by qualifications in science , or by knowledge about science . Nor does failure to follow the prescribed course vary between those who have an accurate, versus inaccurate, understanding of the conditions antibiotics treat. Those respondents who reported not tak ing all of the antibiotics they were prescribed were asked why they did this . The most common reason reported was that they were feeling better before the course was completed (mentioned by 60 per cent). One -quarter (25 per cent) sa id it was because they experienced side-effects, and 12 per cent that they simply forgot to take them.87 86 Figure 9.8 shows data from ABCourse (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table). 87 Data are from ABNComp (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table s).

Asking GPs or medical professionals to prescribe antibiotics In recognition of the serious dangers of over -prescribing antibiotics, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellenc e has recently d rawn up fresh guidelines (NICE, 2015) on antibiotic prescribing for the NHS in England. Research by Public Health England (2014) found that prescriptions of antibiotics by GPs and hospital doctors rose by six per cent between 2010 and 2013, with up to hal f of this increase potentially being \"inappropriate\". And a survey of GPs in the UK by the Longitude Prize (2014), carried out by MedeConnect, found that the great majority of GPs (90 per cent) feel press ure from patients to prescribe antibiotics, and over one-quarter (28 per cent) prescribe antibiotics \"several times a week \", even when they are not sure this is medically necessary . Furthermore, almost half of GPs (45 per cent) say they have prescribed antibiotics for a viral infection, when they know this will not treat the condition . The present research included questions to gather up-to-date information about the extent to which adults in the UK are requesting antibiotics from their GPs, and to what extent these requests are being accepted . One in five ( 21 per cent) of the public say they have, at some point, asked a GP or other medical professional to prescribe them antibiotics (Figure 9 .988). Women are more likely than men to have made such a request (25 per cent, compared with 17 per cent), and this may help to explain why, as seen earlier in this chapter, women are more likely than men to say t hey have, at some point, been prescribed antibiotics (94 per cent, compared with 88 per cent). The likelihood of requesting antibiotics does not differ by age gro up, by knowledge about science as measured by the knowledge quiz, or between those who have an accurate, versus inaccurate, understanding of the conditions antibiotics can treat. 88 Figure 9.9 shows data from ABAsked , ABAskedPre , and ABPersuadeY (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table s). Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Chapter 9: Antibiotic resistance and the use of antibiotics 97 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 Among those who have asked their GP or another medical professional for ant ibiotics, the great majority (85 per cent) say that the last time they made such a request, they were provided with a prescription for antibiotics (Figure 9 .9 again ). Younger adults are more likely to have had their most recent request for antibiotics accepted (94 per cent among those aged 18 to 34, falling to 77 per cent among those aged 65 or over ). This does not necessarily mean that GPs and other medical professionals are more easily persuaded by younger adults ; for instance, it is possible that younger adults are more likely to request antibiotics when, in the opinion of their GP, they actually need them. Men and women are equally likely to have had their most recent request for antibiotics accepted . Respondents who were given a prescription for antibio tics on requesting one were asked whether they had to persuade their GP or other medical profess ional for a prescription . The great majority (84 per cent) say they were given the prescription on asking for it , with the remainder having to persuade their GP before being given the prescription (Figure 9 .9 again ). There are no significant differences either by gender, or age group, in the proportions having to persuade their GP before being given a prescription for antibiotics . Turning to those adults whose mo st recent request for antibiotics was refused, one-third (34 per cent) think that they should have been prescribed antibiotics, and one-quarter (25 per cent) say that they attempted to persuade their GP or other medical professional to give them a prescrip tion for antibiotics, after being told they were not going to be given one.89 Those respondents who thought they should have been prescribed antibiotics were asked why 89 These data are from ABPersuadeN and ABShdPre (press CTRL and click on question name to access data table s).

Male, aged 37, North East I was unwell and needed something. Male, aged 84, Wales I had a bad cough and thought I needed antibiotics to clear it. Male, aged 45, Scotland These answers suggest that some adults may feel entitled to antibiotics based on their prior experiences with antibiotics, others may believe they have been incorrectly di agnosed, while others may even believe that antibiotics should be prescribed as a \"default\" treatment upon feeling unwell. Qualitative research conducted by Good Business (2015) , on behalf of the Wellcome Trust , is consistent with these indicative findings . This research found that many people think they know when they need antibiotics, and do not need a doctor to tell them. Furthermore, most of the participants considered antibiotics to be a suitable treatment when they fe el \"really ill\", irrespective of the cause of their illness. Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3.

Complementary and a lternative medicine The Wellcome Trust is dedicated to improving health, and is therefore interested in understanding public use and perceptions of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) . Evidence on the se matters is sparse, even though large numbers of people may be using treatments for which there is little or no evidence of their efficacy. This usage may adversely affect public health ; for example, CAMs that are not effective (or for which there is no evidence of efficacy) may be used as a replacement for conventional medicine s which are effective . Furthering our knowledge in this area may also help us to understand other issues, such as the uptake of vaccinations , or the value of public health initiati ves around antibiotic resistance . This chapter considers the use of CAM among the public, with a specific focus on homeopathy. Key findings: Herbal medicine is the most popular of a number of alternative or complementary medicines asked about, having been used by 30 per cent of the public . This is followed by acupuncture (22 per cent), and homeopathy (16 per cent). The use of alternative or complementary medicines has not changed since 2009, with the exception of acupuncture, use of which has risen from 16 per cent to 22 per cent. Around half of those with a science -related qualification gained from university or college (52 per cent), or gained from school (50 per cent), have used at least one of the types of alternative or complementary medicine asked abo ut, higher than the 43 per cent among those with no science -related qualifications. Sixteen per cent of the public say they have used homeopathy, with almost two in five of this group (37 per cent) having used it in the past year. Users of homeopathy are more likely to believe it was effective in treating the ir condition (42 per cent) than ineffective (17 per cent) the last time they used it . Among adults who have never used homeopathy, almost two in five ( 37 per cent ) say they would never use it, while almost one-third (32 per cent ) would consider using it if they thought it would be appropriate for their health problem. A further 22 per cent say they have never heard of homeopathy, or do not know what it is. The majority (54 per cent) of those who have he ard of homeopathy but have not used it believe that, to a greater or lesser extent, homeopathy can be an effective treatment for medical conditions. However, this group is far more likely to think that homeopathy is less effective than conventional treatme nts (46 per cent) than is more effective (4 per cent) or just as effective (20 per cent).

What forms of alternative medicine have people used? Respondents were asked which of a number of CAMs , if any, they had ever used. The most commonly used CAM of tho se asked about is herbal medicine, with 30 per cent of the public saying they have used this ( Figure 10.190). This is followed by acupuncture (22 per cent) and homeopathy (16 per cent). Almost half of the public report having used at least one of the types of alternative or complementary medicine asked about. Figure 10.1 Use of alternative or complementary medicine Q.

Acupuncture is the only CAM to have undergone a change in its u se since 2009, rising from 16 per cent in 2009, to 22 per cent currently. Women are more likely than men to have used at least one CAM (54 per cent, compared with 40 per cent). Those aged 35 to 49 are most likely to have used one of the CAMs asked about (58 per cent, compared with 39 per cent of those aged 18 to 34, and 42 per cent of those aged 65 or over ). Use of CAM is higher among those with higher educational qualifications. Among those with a postgraduate degree, 57 per cent have used one or more of the CAMs asked about , and among those with a first degree, the proportion is similar, at 54 per cent. This falls to one- third (33 per cent) among those with level 1 qualifications, and to 29 per cent among those with no qualifications. Half (52 per cent ) of those with a science -related qualification gained from university or college , or from school (50 per cent) , have used at least one of the types of alternative or complementary medicine asked about , compared with 43 per cent of those with no science - related qualifications. While this may appear counter -intuitive, this difference could be attributable to factors other than science education, such as the afford ability CAM treatments. 90 Figure 10.1 shows data from AlterM (press CTRL and click on ques tion name to access data ta ble).

Experiences of h omeopathy One form of alternative medicine was explored in further detail: homeopathy. Those who had used a homeopathic treatment were asked when they last used homeopathy, and how effective they felt it was on this occasion . Focusing only on those who report having used homeopathy risks under -estimating the pote ntial of those who have not used it to be open to using it in the future. So, t hose who had never used homeopathy were asked about their likelihood of doing so in the future, and about their views on its likely efficacy as a treatment for medical condition s. How recently have people used homeopathy? Among adults who have used homeopathy, 12 per cent report having used homeopathy within the last month, and a further nine per cent report having used it within the last three months (Figure 10.291). Half (51 pe r cent) say that the last time they used homeopathy was more than two years ago. Figure 10.2 Most recent use of homeopathy Q.

Respondents who had used homeopathy were asked to think back to the last time they used it, and consider how effecti ve it was in treating the condition they had at the time. Users of homeopathy are more likely to feel it was effective than ineffective as a way of treating their condition (42 per cent, compared with 17 per cent) (Figure 10.392). However, as many say they \"don't know\" whether it was effective or not (41 per cent) , as feel it was effective. 92 Figure 10.3 shows data from HomLastEff (press CTRL and click on ques tion name to access data table) .

Respondents who had never used homeopathy were asked whether they would ever use it to treat a health problem they might have in the future. One-third ( 32 per cent ) say they would use homeopathy if they thought it would be appropriate for their health problem, while 37 per cent say they would never use homeopathy (Figure 10.493). Almost one-quarter (22 per cent) say they have never heard of homeopathy, or have heard of it but do not know what it is. The likelihood of using homeopathy in the future amongst those who have never used it does not vary between men and women, or across age groups. How effective do peop le think homeopathy is at treating medical conditions? Respondents who had heard of, but not used, homeopathy were asked how effective they thought homeopathy is at treating health problems. Very few believe homeopathy is an effective treatment for all medical conditions (two per cent), and one in ten (nine per cent) believe it is an effective treatment for many medical conditions (Figure 10.594). Instead, those who have heard of homeopathy, but have not used it, are most likely to say that homeopathy is an effective treatment, but only for a few medical conditions (43 per cent). 93 Figure 10.4 shows data from HomNWould (press CTRL and click on q uestion name to access data table) . 94 Figure 10.5 shows data from HomEff2 (press CTRL and click on ques tion name to access data table) .

This means while only 16 per cent of the public have used homeopathy, most of the public do believe it can be an effective treatment. Research by Stoneman et al . (2012), using data from the first wave of the Wellcome Trust Monito r (2009) , has investigated this distinction between reported use of homeopathy, and beliefs about its efficacy, in detail. The authors conclude that \"there are good grounds...to assume that a high proportion of non -users of homeopathy would be willing to use this contro versial treatment, if they were advised to do so and could afford to pay for it \". Women are more likely than men to believe that homeopathy is an effective treatment for many or all medical conditions (14 per cent, compared with eight per cen t). There is no variation by age group.

Reflection s The findings from the third wave of the Wellcome Trust Monitor provide rich insight into a range of science and biomedical research themes. This report has described these findings in detail, and has explored differences between groups withi n the population; however, the themes have been, to a large extent, considered separately within their own chapters. In this final chapter, we bring the themes together. We reflect on what the findings tell us, on the questions they raise, and on the attit udes, knowledge, and behaviours that characterise key groups within the country. Interest and engagement A key objective of the Monitor is to assess the public's interest in, and engagement with, science and medical research. While we find a high level of interest in medical research, an appreciation for the value of science in everyday life, a desire among the public to hear directly from scientists, and many among the public seeking information about medical research, these findings should be considered i n the context of the detail that the Monitor provides. For instance, those who have actively sought information about medical research tend to do so to find medical advice, rather than to learn about new scientific developments per se . And those who are in terested in hearing from scientists directly would prefer to do so via passive means, such as from television or radio, rather than via personal interaction. Furthermore, while the great majority of the public think it is useful for people to have an under standing of science in their everyday lives, when they consider their own lives specifically, comparatively fewer see the value of science. Nevertheless, around half of the public have made a science -related visit in the past year, for instance visiting a zoo or aquarium, a science museum or centre, or a science -related art exhibition or installation. The one in five of the public that has visited a science museum or centre compares to around a third that have visited a history museum, and three in ten that have visited an art gallery. Efforts to increase public engagement with scientific research could build on the high esteem in which doctors and other medical practitioners, and university scientists, are held in contrast to journalists. The findings sugge st the public may be receptive to a greater presence from these professionals in the media. Knowledge of science, and education We now turn to consider the public's knowledge of science (as measured by the knowledge quiz) and levels of education, factors which are strong differentiators for many of the themes considered in this wave of the Monitor. These factors are, of course, highly inter -related; for instance, those with a postgraduate degree are over four times as likely to obtain a high score on the k nowledge quiz as those with no educational qualifications, and those with a science - related qualification from university or college are around three times as likely to score highly as those with no science -related qualifications. While over two -thirds of the public as a whole realise that controlled experimentation is the best method to assess the efficacy of a treatment , among those with no educational qualifications this falls to a minority of two in five, with a similar proportion professing that they d o not know what the best method is. Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Chapter 11: Reflections 107 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 These differences extend to more specific fields of knowledge too. For instance, while most of those with a first or a higher degree feel they have a good understanding of genetic modification, and of antibiotic resistan ce, professed understanding is far lower among those with low or no qualifications. In addition, an accurate understanding of how antibiotics work (treating bacterial infections alone) is held by around half of those with first or higher degrees, compared to around one -third of those with low qualifications or no qualifications. A similar pattern pertains to science -related qualifications. In spite of these differences, the public's knowledge about science, and their education levels, are not found to be as sociated with specific health -related behaviours such as the likelihood of adhering to a prescribed course of antibiotics, or the likelihood of asking a GP for antibiotics. Those with a higher level of education, or who know more about science, however, ar e more likely to say they feel confident querying or challenging the conclusions of a medical professional. Engagement with science is considerably higher among the more highly educated, and among those who know more about science. For instance, these gro ups are far more likely to be interested in hearing directly from scientists, to be willing to share their medical records or genetic information for use in a medical research study, or to have visited a science museum or science centre in the last year. Those with higher educational qualifications are also more trusting of sci entists working in universities, and tow ards medical research charities; h owever, they are less trusting of scientists working for pharmaceutical companies. Differences in engagement with science and medica l research among the population Focussing on age, gender and class, the Monitor finds that the public's relationship with science and medical research varies . In terms of age , these differences are not simple linear relationships whe re the public becomes more or less interested, engaged, or knowledgeable as they get older ; rather, we also find similarities between younger and older adults, with those in the middle of the age range standing apart. Older adults are more likely to expres s an interest in medical research, and we find this to be the case even when other factors are controlled for. The topics of interest also vary, with younger adults more likely to express an interest in medical research topics such as how the body and brai n work, and older adults relatively more likely to be interested in issues of governance, such as policy and funding matters, and how medical research is regulated. Adults of all ages express an interest in hearing directly from scientists about the resear ch they are conducting, but younger adults have a greater appetite than older adults for hearing from scientists in person. It is also of note that younger adults are more likely than older adults to have visited a science museum or centre, or made a scien ce-related visit more generally in the past year. Perhaps related to these differences in engagement, younger adults are more trusting than older adults of medical research charities, and of scientists working in private industry. Adults in the middle of the age range (aged 35 to 64) are most likely to be knowledgeable on a number of topics. They are most likely to be aware of genetic tests that predict diseases, to understand the importance of controlled experimentation in assessing the efficacy of a treatment , and to feel they have a good understanding of antibiotic resistance. This age group Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Chapter 11: Reflections 108 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 is also most likely to claim they usually understand stories about science in the news, and are most likely to think it is useful for people in general to have an und erstanding of science in their ever yday lives. It is older adults (aged 50 and over) however, that are most likely to know that it is pharmaceutical companies that spend the most on drug development in the UK. With respect to past experience of antibiotic s, younger adults are the most likely to have failed to follow their most recent course of antibiotics, and are the least likely to have an accurate understanding of the conditions that antibiotics treat, or to profess a good understanding of antibiotic re sistance. However, they are just as likely to have asked a GP for antibiotics as other adults, and indeed are most likely to have had their most recent re quest for antibiotics accepted. Decisions around food and drink also exhibit differences by age. Older adults are more likely to place importance on sugar and salt content, whether food is produced in the UK, or produced locally, and the amount of packag ing food has. Some of these differences may be attributable to a greater level of political and social e ngagement among older adults in general, rather than being specific to these aspects of food and drink. It is also instructive to consider areas where age makes little or no difference. Confidence in making informed health -related decisions, and in queryi ng or challenging the conclusions of a medical professional, is one such area, and willingness to share medical records, or genetic information, is another. While we find that men and women are similar in many respects - for instance, they are equally happ y to share their medical records, and genetic information, for t he purposes of medical research, and are equally optimistic that medical research will improve the quality of life for peopl e in the UK in the next 20 years - the Monitor uncovers a number of interesting differences between men and women. Women are more likely than men to express an interest in medical research, and while the topics of interest are broadly similar between the genders, women are more likely than men to be interested in mental he alth issues and obesity, while men are more likely to be interested in how scientific research is done. While men and women use very similar methods to seek information about medical research, women are more likely to use a chat room or discussion forum. In spite of the greater interest in medical research among women, men are more likely than women to express an interest in hearing directly from scientists about th e research they are conducting. In terms of knowledge about science and medicine, men are mor e likely than women to score highly on the science quiz, to say they understand stories about science on the news and to have confidence discussing these stories, and to profess a good understanding of genetic modification. Men are also more likely than wo men to feel that their understanding of science is useful in their everyday life. However, m en and women are equally likely to understand the need for controlled experimentation in assessing the , to be aware of genetic tests that predict the likelihood of developing geneticall y influenced diseases, and to believe that pharmaceutical companies spend the most on drug development in the UK. With respect to antibiotics, while men and women are equally likely to profess a good understanding of antibiotic resist ance, women are more likely to have an accurate understanding of the conditions that antibiotics can treat. Women are more likely to have taken antibiotics in the past year, and to some extent this may be explained by the greater Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3. Chapter 11: Reflections 109 This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for market research, ISO 20252:2006. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3145744 likelihood among women to ask for antibiotics, requests which are accepted in the great majority of instances. In terms of personal health, women are more likely than men to have confidence making informed decisions about their health , such as when to make a doctor's appointment , although there is no difference between the genders in terms of confidence in challenging the conclusions of a GP. The findings from the Monitor suggest significant social class disparities in knowledge about, and engagement with, science and medical resea rch. For instance, we find that those from the lowest social class groups are less likely to be interested in medical research, to visit science attractions, or to wish to hear from scientists directly about their research . They a re less willing to share t heir genetic information, or medical records, for research purposes; have less confidence in making informed decisions about their health, or challenging the conclusions of a medical professional; and are less likely to score highly on the knowledge quiz, to understand the need for controlled experimentation in clinical trials, or be aware of genetic tests. Differences in engagement may to a large extent b e explicable by differences in educational attainment, or financial resources , but the consistency of t hese disparities throughout all areas of science knowledge and experience suggest that engagement with the general public is failing to reach all parts of society. Events that are focussed on broad themes relevant to all backgrounds and ages may help to en gage these groups more. Wellcome Trust Monitor: Wave 3.
