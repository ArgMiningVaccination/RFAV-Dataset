Twenty years ago, she was teaching English as a second language to adults in Los Angeles when a middle-aged Latina student was stricken with chest pains during class. Dow wanted to call an ambulance to take her to a hospital, but the woman begged her not to. She couldn't afford the ride. The student made it to the ER, but seeing her desperate situation was one factor that led Dow to pursue a second career. \"I chose medicine to serve the neediest and work in an area where I'd make the most impact,\" she says. \"Healthcare is something all humans need.\" The clinical professor helps fill that need in community clinics and the classroom, where she inspires medical students to join her in treating the poor. Dow impresses her students as both a soft-spoken humble leader and a fearless woman, says former UC Irvine medical student Negin Agange. Dow practices family medicine in areas where physicians are few - from a high-crime neighborhood in South Central Los Angeles where she directed a community clinic, to Chiapas, Mexico, where she spends a few weeks each year treating patients who live in extreme poverty. \"She gives to the community every day,\" Agange says. \"She teaches future doctors how we can make positive changes in the lives of others through our daily work.\" Continued on page 3UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE | DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE www.

Healthcare is something all humans need.\" - Dr. Emily Dow \"I want to make UC Irvine a center of excellence for Latino healthcare with the best practices in the country.\" - Dr. Charles Vega Spring 2012 Innovative Care for Latinos Focus on cari\u00f1o Dr. Charles Vega first walked into the UC Irvine Family Health Center as a medical school graduate eager to make a difference in his first job as a physician. Twelve years later, his impact is felt both within the community of hundreds of grateful patients and their families he sees each week and in the burgeoning field of Latino healthcare. Vega directs the family medicine residency program and the acclaimed Program in Medical Education for the Latino Community (PRIME-LC), the first medical education program in the country designed to meet the needs of underserved Latinos. As such, he stands at the forefront of one of the most pressing issues in healthcare today. Continued on page 3 Letter from the Chair Dr. Laura Mosqueda, Chair, Department of Family Medicine I am pleased to say that, due to the hard work and dedication of our faculty and staff, the Department of Family Medicine has achieved considerable momentum in the past year toward our vision of being one of the top 10 departments in the country caring for underserved populations. Our vision for the future is to be a leader in medical education and clinical care, with the goal always being exemplary care for the underserved, including the indigent, aged, disabled, abused and neglected. New trends in the field, including an emphasis on patient-centered medical homes and attention at the national level on the complex conditions of the chronically ill, bring attention, focus and resources to support our vision. Our department has a diverse team committed to excellence in patient care, teaching, research and community service. w e are increasing the size of our faculty as we expand our clinical care operations, strengthen our medical student teaching through innovations such as Medical Readers' Theater and bolster our research division. w e are the first in the country to offer the PRIME-LC program, which is designed to train medical students in care for underserved Latinos. In addition to our fully accredited Family Medicine Residency Program, we have an American College of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) -accredited geriatrics fellowship with two fellows per year. w e are also proud of our students as they continue to run a free health clinic for the uninsured on Saturday mornings. They not only run the free clinic, they also have taken the next step and designed a class about caring for the underserved. The students recruit speakers and do what it takes to grow our impact as we seek to educate, ultimately, all medical students about these vulnerable patients. Our research program has major focuses on elder abuse and neglect, innovative medical education, and clinical care. For example, we participate in a grant through the Orange County Coalition of Community Clinics to help our Family Health Center become patient-centered medical homes. Additionally, two of our faculty have received advanced training in integrative medicine. This specialized training allows us to broaden our medical practice to include an in-depth knowledge of integrative medicine. Our faculty are currently funded through the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Justice, Donald w . Reynolds Foundation, Archstone Foundation and UniHealth Foundation. you know? n Family medicine is the medical specialty that provides continuing, comprehensive health care for the individual and family. It is the specialty in breadth that integrates the biological, clinical, and behavioral sciences. The scope of family medicine encompasses all ages, genders, organ systems and every disease entity. n Family medicine is a three- dimensional specialty, incorporating knowledge, skill and process. The family medicine process is unique. At the heart of this process is the patient-physician relationship with the patient viewed in the context of the family. It is the extent to which this relationship is valued, developed, nurtured and maintained that distinguishes family medicine from every other specialty. n The d epar Tmen T o F Family m edicine is the academic home to nearly 30 UC Irvine faculty members who have a passion for patient care, research and medical education. Faculty members teach medical students at our four faculty practice sites - in Santa Ana and Anaheim (both federally qualified health centers), Gottschalk Plaza in Irvine on the UC Irvine campus and the SeniorHealth Center in Orange at UC Irvine Medical Center. w e provide more than 30,000 patient visits each year.

In Chiapas, where Dow works as a volunteer physician, most of her patients have never been to a doctor. \" we see people who live on less than a dollar a day. They're fortunate to have shoes,\" she says. \" we treat illnesses such as malaria, typhoid and hookworm not seen in the U.S. in decades.\" \"Despite the frustrations, we can make a difference, however small, in the lives of patients,\" Dow says. \" when we see them rise above their situation, take charge of their lives and take better care of themselves, that's the reward.\" By Kathryn Bold, University Communications Innovative Care for Latinos continued from page 1 The expanding U.S. Latino population creates a growing need for competent and culturally sensitive healthcare. According to studies, nearly 30 percent of Latino patients cited difficulty communicating with their physician as a concern. \"I want to make UC Irvine a center of excellence for Latino healthcare with the best practices in the country,\" Vega says. \" when patients, researchers and policymakers think about Latino health, I want them to think about UC Irvine.\" The issue of Latino health is of particularly critical importance in Santa Ana, the home of UC irvine's Family Health Center, where 69 percent of the patients are Latino. The great majority of these patients speak Spanish. In addition to PRIME-LC, which is enrolling its fifth class this month, Vega has created HEAL-LC, a program in which freshly minted physicians will receive a strong foundation in the language, cultural customs and health beliefs of Latino patients. These physicians will continue to use these skills long after completing their training at UC Irvine. \"while Latino health needs are increasingly being recognized, we need to have solutions and put what we learn into action,\" Vega says. \"That's where PRIME and HEAL come in.\"\"what we in medicine can learn from Latinos is the concept of cari\u00f1o, which is loving care. we need to bond with our patients and let them voice their concerns. Building that skill with our medical students is important.\" By Tom Vasich, University Communications\"When patients, researchers, and policymakers think about Latino health, I want them to think about UC Irvine.\" - Dr. Charles Vega UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE | DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE Spring 2012 Congratulations to our faculty! n d r. d avid Kilgore completed a fellowship in integrative medicine from the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine in 2011. n dr. l aura m osqueda received the Family Physician of the Year award from the Orange County Chapter of the California Association of Family Practice (OC-CAFP). n dr. e mily d ow received the Family Physician Educator of the Year award from the OC-CAFP.UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE | DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE Spring 2012 www. FAMILYMED .UCI. EDU | www. HEALTHCARE .UCI. EDU /FAMILY -MEDICINE 4Students Care for the Underserved The UC Irvine Outreach Clinics, a student-run free clinic at the Village of Hope in Tustin, continues to expand its services in 2012. The students provide primary care, lab, medications and referrals every Saturday morning under the guidance of Medical Director, Emily Dow, MD, and other faculty. Recently, behavioral health, psychiatry and ophthalmology were added to the clinic services. \"The students wanted to start a clinic of their own where they can treat patients - not just screen them for diseases,\" she says. \"They're not only getting early clinical training, they're seeing the plight of the poor and getting motivated to contribute to their care throughout their career.\" The medical students' vision is to expand both primary care and specialty referrals. Thanks to a volunteer ophthalmologist, patients have received sight-saving procedures. A second volunteer specialist performed a tongue biopsy for a patient who was able to apply for Medi-Cal after the pathology report showed cancer. This year the student organization, Medical Initiative Against Homelessness, will be joining forces with UCIOC to serve Orange County's most vulnerable residents. The medical students designed a class called \"Caring for the Underserved\" that covers topics such as healthcare policy, health and human rights, and community advocacy. The students coordinate the class and invite faculty to speak on course topics. 101 The City Drive South Bldg. 200, Ste. 835 Orange, CA 92868 Inside Meet Dr. Dow Innovative Care for Latinos Letter from the Chair Integrative Medicine UC Irvine Outreach Clinics UC Irvine Family Medicine physicians practice at four locations: n Gottschalk Medical Plaza Irvine, CA n UC Irvine Family Health Center Santa Ana, CA n UC Irvine Family Health Center Anaheim, CA n UC Irvine SeniorHealth Center Orange, CA You can contact us at 1-877-UCI-DOCS "}
