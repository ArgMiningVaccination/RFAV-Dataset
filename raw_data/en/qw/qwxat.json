The upswing in healthcare mergers and acqui-sitions is likely to continue into 2012 and even 2013. In light of national healthcare reform, hospitals and health systems are looking to cut costs and integrate services. As a result, the sectors of home-health, ambulatory surgery centers and physi-cian practice groups may see the largest amount of consolidation and acquisition. According to Brent Hill, JD, healthcare transactional attorney at Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis in Nashville, Tenn., decreases in healthcare reimbursement rates and the Patient Protection and Af-fordable Care Act are placing downward 7 Steps for Building a Top-Tier Cancer Center By Sabrina Rodak Many hospitals are building or upgrading oncology centers to more efficiently and effectively treat cancer patients. For example, the Uni - versity of Nebraska Medical Center and The Nebraska Medical Center, both in Omaha, recently announced preliminary plans for an estimated $370 million cancer center. In addition, UC San Diego Health System recently acquired the Nevada Cancer Institute in Las Vegas. Through these significant investments, hospitals aim to provide the latest and best oncology care. However, a building alone cannot guarantee top-rate cancer services. Here are seven steps hospitals can follow to de - velop a successful cancer center.Healthcare Reform: Two Years Gone, Now What's on the Horizon? By Bob Herman President Barack Obama signed the landmark healthcare reform bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, into law in March 2010, and now here we are, two years later, trying to absorb the rami - fications of the past and prepare for the future. It's not easy to remember or grasp every section of the bill \u2014 the 974- page piece of legislation is not your typical light reading. However, it's important to look back and reflect on how the healthcare environment has changed in the past two years and to see the new initiatives and challenges that lie ahead. continued on page 11continued on page 8 continued on page 12 70 Hospitals and Health Systems With Great Oncology Programs p. 14 REGISTER T ODAY!

For example, starting in September 2010, young adults were allowed to stay on their parents' health plans until they turn 26 years old. The PPACA also instituted an option for states to offer health plans for those with pre-existing conditions who were turned down by other health insurers. While these provisions helped the national healthcare system at large, they did not have monumental impacts on how hospitals and health systems went about their business. Last year saw more substantive change, both for the general American populace as well as for the hospital and health system sector. In 2011, the PPACA enforced the medical loss ratio , which required health insur - ers to spend 80 to 85 percent (depending on their market) of premium dollars on medical care as opposed to administrative costs and profits. If insurers do not spend the required amount, they must send rebates to consumers. The MLR requirement has led to a new era of stringent price negotiating and managed care reimbursement talks between hospi- tals and health insurers. Pauline Rosenau, PhD, professor of management, policy and community health at the University of Texas School of Public Health in Houston, has written extensively on healthcare reform. She says the regulation of commercial payors was a big step in helping advance the U.S. healthcare system to that of other countries. \"The biggest element is the increased regulation of the insurance agencies,\" Dr. Rosenau says. \"It's new to the United States, but this level of regulation is common to other industrialized nations around the world.\" Primary care physicians and general surgeons also benefited from the PPA- CA, as they received reimbursement increases of 10 percent from Medicare in an effort to emphasize preventive care. Other major measures of the PPACA that have come to fruition include: Pharmaceutical companies must provide a 50 percent discount on all name-brand prescription drugs to Medicare beneficiaries who fall in the Part D drug plan coverage gap, or the \"doughnut hole.\" The Department of Health and Human Services estimated that Medicare beneficiaries who fell in the doughnut hole saved a combined $2.1 billion on prescription drug costs in 2011. Medicare Part C plans, which are the privatized health plans known as Medicare Advantage, can no longer raise cost-sharing requirements for certain benefits. Additionally, MA payments and premiums will be set at increasingly smaller percentages than traditional fee-for-service Medicare plans. Medicare enrollees can now receive certain preventive services, such as annual check-ups, for free without co-payments. Jeffrey Steinberg, MD, CEO of Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago, says what has actually been enacted so far is only the tip of the iceberg, as the U.S. healthcare system is just beginning a wholesale change to value-based care. \"Right now, we are in a fee-for-service world,\" Dr. Steinberg says. \"It's a world where the more we do, the more hospitals and physicians make. But that's changing. There are a lot of innovation models from CMS, and we're at the front end of the changes.\" Those models include accountable care organizations, shared savings pro - grams, bundled payments, readmissions reductions and an overall shift toward accentuating primary and preventive care, which are going to be a bigger part of 2012. \"What I see happening globally is that there's a realization in the industry there are things that need to happen to take care of patients in the community,\" says Jay Fathi, MD, director of community health at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. \"That hasn't been reimbursed before. We're going to start rewarding systems for things that haven't been done optimally in the past.\" However, the PPACA hit a major speed bump in October 2011 when HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and the rest of the Obama administration agreed to terminate part of the law: The Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, which would have been a long-term care insur - ance program that provided cash benefits to adults who became disabled. Although the CLASS Act would not have impacted acute-care hospitals much, it was an ominous sign that the healthcare reform law may have to fight bigger challenges down the road. Finally, the two biggest \u2014 and most controversial \u2014 components of the healthcare law that made ripples in 2011 actually won't go into effect until 2014: the individual mandate in which most Americans will be required to buy health insurance through their employer or health insurance ex-changes and the expansion of the Medicaid program. The Supreme Court decided last year it will hear and discuss the constitutionality of those two provisions in 2012 after a maelstrom of criticism and lawsuits swept the country, which will make this year even more important for the hospital and healthcare industry. What 2012 means Healthcare reform is coming to a fork in the road this year. Either it will move on unimpeded, or it will hit figurative blows to the head from the ju-dicial and political systems. There are four main components surrounding the healthcare law that will define 2012. 1. Supreme Court ruling. When it comes down to it, nothing will be more important to the healthcare industry than the Supreme Court's constitutional ruling of the PPACA. It is expected the Supreme Court will issue a decision by the end of June. The individual mandate requiring most people to obtain health coverage and the expansion of Medicaid are the main policies at the center of the debate. The Supreme Court can rule in several different ways. It can strike down the entire law, which would send the healthcare industry into a leg - islative chaos of sorts after two years of implementation. It could also rule that only the two provisions in question are unconstitutional, but the rest of the law may stand. This could still create a stir as removing those provisions could water down the impact of the PPACA, Dr. Rosenau says. The Supreme Court could also say the challenge of the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion cannot be heard because it has not yet gone into Healthcare Reform: Two Years Gone, Now What's on the Horizon?(continued from page 1) REGISTER T ODAY!

Becker's May 17-18, 2012; Chicago; www.regonline.com/beckershospitalreviewannualmeeting_1041813 effect, thus not causing any damages. \"There is a loophole in consideration: You can't really sue for damages unless you've actually suffered damages,\" Dr. Rosenau says. \"Until you've started requiring people to buy insurance, you may not be able to bring the case to the Supreme Court.\" Regardless of what the Supreme Court decides, the mere uncertainty around the law is enough to give hospital executives and all others in healthcare an unsettling feeling, Dr. Steinberg says. Additionally, Dr. Rosenau says these legislative challenges are hindering hospitals and their main goals: providing healthcare. \"If I'm a hospital administrator, I'd be staying up all night pulling at my hair because no one knows for sure if [the PPACA] is going to be ruled as constitutional or not,\" Dr. Rosenau says. \"This is not good for hospitals or insurers or any other healthcare provider because you want to get on with the business of providing healthcare with the lowest costs and best outcomes, and it's a major vulnerability for those who expect an increase in access.\" 2. Provisions that are rolling out. Before getting too caught up in the ramifications of a Supreme Court ruling, the healthcare industry still has to be prepared for the full implementation of the PPACA. There are several provisions rolling out this year, and there are three in particular that have the potential to restructure how hospitals operate. Accountable care organizations. One of the most highly advertised policies of the PPACA that aims to help hospitals, physicians and other providers improve quality while reducing costs is the Medicare Shared Savings Program . This program went into effect Jan. 1 and established the parameters of what an ACO looks like and how it could be the future model for care management and reimbursement. However, because the program is barely off the ground, there is still uncertainty as to what this component of the PPACA will look like down the road. \"ACOs are like unicorns,\" Dr. Fathi says. \"You know what they look like, but you've never seen one before.\" A related program is the Pioneer ACO initiative. Under this five-year initia-tive, Medicare will reward experienced groups of hospitals, primary care physicians, specialists and others to provide better, more coordinated care for Medicare beneficiaries. The first performance period of the Pioneer ACO program began Jan. 1, and there are 32 healthcare organizations that are giving it a go. Bundled payments. The Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative, which got under way last year, aims to reimburse healthcare providers a lump sum on the expected costs for the spectrum of a patient's care. Par - ticipants in these models would be paid for their services under the origi-nal Medicare fee-for-service system but at a negotiated discount. Then, total payments would be compared with the target price at the end of the patient's episode of care, and those providers would share any of those savings with Medicare. There are three models that will be highlighted in 2012, and applications for Models 2, 3 and 4 are due to CMS by no later than March 15. In Model 2, bundled payments include the inpatient stay as well as post-acute care, and the hospital decides the scope of DRGs to be included. Model 3 fo-cuses only on post-acute care, while Model 4 focuses only on the inpatient stay. Model 4 is different from the others because it involves prospective payments, which are when hospitals agree to a price upfront on a particular DRG, and CMS pays that specific bundled price to the hospital. Models 2 and 3 are retrospective payments, where hospitals receive the usual fee-for-service payment, but there is a retrospective comparison with the previ-ously determined target price.

Starting Oct. 1, 2012 (fiscal year 2013), Sec - tion 3001 of the healthcare law establishes the hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program for Medicare. The VBP Program will distribute an estimated $850 million in incentives to hospitals based on their overall performance on a set of quality measures, such as clinical pro - cesses of care and patient satisfaction from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey. Examples of the care processes included in the measures are how quickly heart attack patients receive potentially life-saving surgery on their arter - ies and how often patients with heart failure get proper discharge instructions. From there, hospitals will be scored based on their performance on each measure compared with other hospitals, and higher scores lead to incentive payments. Hospitals will still receive regular payments for providing care to Medicare patients based on the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System, but those payments will decrease by 1 percent across the board starting in FY 2013 to fund the new value-based payments. \"These are fairly basic initiatives,\" Dr. Fathi says. \"It's giving patients good education about congestive heart failure diagnoses, who to follow up with, where to get prescriptions, basic things. This is not about high-tech im-plantable devices \u2014 it's making sure people have the basics they need to stay well. There hasn't been a financial incentive to do these things in the past, but now with ACOs and bundled payments, there is. And that's a good thing.\" However, part of the problem with these initiatives is combining the value-based desires of the future while still maintaining a solid revenue stream in the current fee-for-service system. \"We're in a very tricky place right now because you want to be innovating and experimenting, but at the same time, you have to look at the current system,\" Dr. Fathi says. \"Of course, we're all trying to maximize revenues. You have to straddle a fine line.\" 3. State legislative decisions. The PPACA gives states several freedoms in how they want to implement certain parts of the law \u2014 these include high-risk pools, Medicaid eligibility and, most no-tably, the creation of the health insurance exchanges and the right to design the benefits package for the various health plans that will be offered in the exchanges. David K. Jones, a PhD candidate within the University of Michigan Department of Health Management and Policy and the Department of Political Science, recently wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that these 2012 state sessions are so important because they are the last chances for states to control their fate. For example, if states do not establish health insurance exchange guidelines by January 2013, the federal government will step in and create the exchanges. 4. the presidential election. The 2012 presidential election is still relatively far away (Nov. 6), but the buzz surrounding it has already dominated the airwaves. President Obama will face off against one of four contending Republican candidates \u2014 Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum \u2014 and much of the GOP rhetoric has decried a full repeal of the PPACA should they take the presidency. However, Dr. Rosenau says regardless of who wins the election, the odds of a repeal are slim. If President Obama is re-elected, the law would obviously stay enacted, but even a Republican presidential vic - tory would not doom the healthcare law because a consensus would still be needed in the other branches of Congress. \"The chance of a full repeal is very, very low,\" Dr. Rosenau says. \"It doesn't mean it couldn't be amended, but I do believe the Supreme Court's considerations are much more likely to lead to substantial change than what happens after the election.\" What the future holds While 2012 will decide the fate of the health law, 2014 and beyond will dictate how effective these changes will actually be. By 2014, most people will be required to have some form of health- care coverage through the individual mandate. However, due to gaps and loopholes in the PPACA, there would still be about 26 million uninsured people if the mandate stands. Dr. Steinberg says the concept of provid- ing more access to care is a no-brainer, but the problem remains in how everything will be funded. \"I agree every patient must have insurance and equal access to care,\" Dr. Steinberg says. \"That's just a human right. That's our responsibility to deliver it. How we pay for that care, though, is changing radically.\" Dr. Rosenau says if the healthcare system is looking for a source of funding, it should look to cut billing and administrative costs, which waste an estimated $360 billion per year . The PPACA will institute new standards for electronic funds transfer in healthcare, and this is ex-pected to save up to $4.5 billion. However, hospitals and health systems will have to do more on their own. \"Administrative costs are where the U.S. [healthcare system] is different from other countries,\" Dr. Rosenau says. \"It's a lot of pushing paper, and that spends a lot of money. That's the place to look for really easy cuts. If I'm a hospital administrator, that's the first place I'd look.\" However, there is more to healthcare reform than only the PPACA, Dr. Fathi says. He notes most people think of the federal legislation when the phrase \"healthcare reform\" is used colloquially, but for hospitals and other organizations, healthcare reform is and has been an ongoing process. \"There are market-driven reforms and system improvements that are kind of taking place as a parallel process,\" Dr. Fathi says. \"People like to talk about the healthcare legislation, and acknowledging that is important. But there is a healthcare system improvement occurring in real time that is independent of the legislation process.\" Whether the PPACA, ACOs and every other acronym stays as part of federal healthcare legislation is murky, but one item remains fairly evi-dent: The days of the regular, volume-based, inpatient acute-care hos-pital are winding down. \"Theoretically at least, less will be uninsured and more will have insurance through the exchanges, but hopefully they will also be getting preventive care,\" Dr. Fathi says. \"The poor, the uninsured \u2014 everyone needs follow-up and preventive care and sta-bilization to stay out of the hospital. It's easier to go into the ER, and a lot of patients don't have a disincentive to go in there. Our system needs to right itself to offer more robust access to primary care for everybody.\" n We Deliver confidence, convenience and patient comfort. 1-800-932-7472 www.imageerst.com 11 REGISTER TODAY!

Articulate a vision. Hospitals should start building a cancer center by developing and ar - ticulating a vision for the service, according to Timothy Eberlein, MD, director of the Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Hospital leadership needs to agree on a vision for the center that includes the size of the center, its mission and its goals in patient care. Barnes-Jewish Hospital's vision was to develop an integrated, multidisciplinary cancer center that would work towards achieving world-class status for quality of care. Now, the Siteman Can - cer Center has the third largest oncology center in patient volume in the United States, according to Dr. Eberlein. 2. Gain support for the vision. The second step is garnering support from various stake - holders for the vision. Dr. Eberlein says gain- ing buy-in to the vision and strategic plan was one of the biggest challenges when developing the Siteman Cancer Center. Before Siteman was built in 1999, oncology care at Barnes-Jewish and Washington University was not integrated, but was instead departmentally-centered. Gain-ing buy-in for the vision thus meant persuading stakeholders to support a shift in the delivery of care. \"This was new; it was a different para - digm,\" Dr. Eberlein says. \"Our strategy in the institution had been to support the departments. And of course, that's almost the antithesis of a cancer center, which is a multi-departmental, in-tegrated model.\" One way the hospital gained buy-in was by set - ting smaller goals that would eventually lead to a more ambitious plan. \"Rather than say our goal is to be the third biggest cancer center in the United States, we chose to say we want to prog - ress towards being a world-class cancer center,\" Dr. Eberlein says. \"If we had made [being the third-largest center] our goal, we would have had a very difficult time convincing leadership to make that large of an investment. We took incremental steps, but each of the steps was to-ward a goal of excellence.\" 3. develop a strategic plan. Once lead- ers of the hospital and service line support a common vision, they need to develop a stra- tegic plan. Barnes-Jewish Hospital began with a three-year strategic plan that outlined how the institution would build a successful cancer center. They then followed the plan \"pretty reli-giously,\" Dr. Eberlein says. Once the center was built and received designation as a National Can - cer Institute cancer center, the hospital then cre - ated another three-year strategic plan, this time to be designated a comprehensive cancer center by the NCI. Creating incremental strategic plans allowed the hospital to gain leadership support, follow the plan closely and achieve its goals. 4. Create specialized teams. To begin staffing a cancer center, hospitals need to re- cruit multidisciplinary skilled clinicians. One of the keys to a successful cancer center is having several teams that specialize in a specific type of cancer, according to Nathan Levitan, MD, president of the University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center in Cleveland. For example, UH Seidman Cancer Center has 10 teams represent - ing 10 major types of cancer, such as brain and spine cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer. This structure allows physicians to \"keep up with the furious pace of new developments because they don't have to master everything for every can- cer,\" Dr. Levitan says. Specialized teams can also provide patients with a single recommendation that has been agreed upon by multiple individuals. He says, \"When we think of state-of-the-art care, we think of having subspecialty physicians that have real expertise in one or two types of cancer, and we think of teams [in which] the doctors will actually discuss and debate among themselves what the best treatment is and provide that recommendation.\" These teams should include medical and surgi- cal oncologists, social workers, nutritionists and nursing staff, according to Paul Okunieff, MD, director of University of Florida Shands Cancer Center in Gainesville and chair of the UF De - partment of Radiation Oncology. An academic medical center may also consider adding scien - tists to the teams, Dr. Okunieff says, so they can \"understand the clinical needs, focus their research to overcome barriers and create logis-tically and economically viable implementation plans.\" He suggests the teams go on a retreat intermittently to self-examine and discuss how they can improve patient care as a team. 5. Invest in advanced technology. Hospi- tals building cancer centers also need to invest in advanced technology that has been shown to im-prove outcomes. For example, some centers are using robotic surgery because it is associated with less recovery time. Dr. Levitan says intraoperative MRI is useful when operating on brain tumors because it allows the surgeon to detect, during surgery, any part of the tumor that was not taken out in the initial procedure and remove the tumor. New diagnostic technology, such as PET-MRI scanners and breast tomosynthesis, and radiation therapy technology, such as CT scanners that re - calibrate its beam to avoid treating healthy tissue, can also benefit patients, Dr. Levitan says. Some hospitals and health centers, such as Rochester, Minn.-based Mayo Clinic and Boca Raton (Fla.) Regional Hospital are spending upwards of $120 million on centers for proton therapy, a new treat - 7 Steps for Building a Top-Tier Cancer Center (continued from page 1)12 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review E-Weekly and CFO E-Weekly Report at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 ment designed to more precisely target cancer. There is debate, however, concerning the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this therapy. 6. Offer clinical trials. After establishing a robust clinical program with specialized teams and advanced technology, hospitals should con-sider offering clinical trials as a way to increase treatment options for patients. \"A clinical trials program is a very important part of a state-of-the-art cancer center because it gives patients access to drugs that might not otherwise be available because they're not FDA approved,\" Dr. Levitan says. Dr. Okunieff says UF Shands Cancer Center tries to get as many patients as possible on clinical trials because it gives them the opportunity to try new medications and therapies that may result in better outcomes. 7. Focus on the patient experience. As an additional step, hospitals that aim to be recognized for strong cancer services need to focus on the patient experience when deliv-ering care. A patient's experience is shaped by everything and everyone in the care envi-ronment. \"Every interaction cancer patients have, whether with someone who is transport - ing them, someone who is delivering a meal \u2014 anything that touches the patient \u2014 is a healing interaction. And depending upon how these individuals approach the patients, they can really be a part of the healing environ- ment or not,\" Dr. Levitan says. The UH Seid- man Cancer Center, which opened a new free - standing 120-bed cancer hospital in June 2011, was designed to create a healing environment for the patient, according to Dr. Levitan. \"The environment of care is as important to the healing process as are the drugs or the surgery or the radiation.\" Dr. Okunieff also emphasizes the role of pa- tients' experiences in their overall care. \"There has to be a culture of the patient comes first,\" he says. \"You need care and caring, because without the latter, you'll never get to do the former.\" He suggests that if the provider does not behave or speak compassionately, the patient may not re-turn to the center regardless of its clinical qual-ity. One way physicians can demonstrate their caring is to make themselves easily accessible to patients, Dr. Okunieff says. \"Give patients your cell phone number, they won't abuse it. Just make sure people know that you care.\" n pressure on the healthcare sector, which is most likely causing the indus-try's increase in mergers and acquisitions. Industry experts believe healthcare M&A will continue to see significant numbers in 2012, whether the transaction involves a hospital, a health sys - tem or another health organization. \"There are many of areas ripe for con- solidation,\" says Mr. Hill. While hospitals will still see M&A transactions due to physician acquisi- tion opportunities, hospital executives may be more focused on service integration causing increased acquisitions. More specifically, Mr. Hill be - lieves four general areas may lead the industry in 2012 M&A dealings: ambulatory surgery centers, physician practice groups, urgent care and the home health industry. Additionally, Mr. Hill says it is likely that hos-pitals, healthcare companies and private equity firms will be purchasers of these organizations. There have been more private equity firms investing in healthcare in 2010 and 2011 than in years past. Private equity players have been active in the hospital industry for many years, and in 2012, we should expect private equity to continue to be active in the hospital space and in home health and urgent care. Both the home health and urgent care industries are frag-mented and ripe for consolidation. In order to understand where private equity in healthcare may lead, it is important to know its past. Two notable players are New York-based Cerberus Capital Management and The Blackstone Group. Cerberus Capital owns Boston-based Steward Health Care System and Blackstone Group holds majority equity in Tenn.-based Vanguard Health Systems. Steward Healthcare System Typically, Cerberus has not invested in healthcare. The company is better known for investments in pharmaceuticals, paper products, transportation and retail. For instance, in 2007, Cerberus purchased an 80 percent stake in auto manufacturer Chrysler. Cerberus made its first healthcare investment with the purchase of Caritas Christi Health Care for $900 million in November 2010. Caritas was con-verted into a for-profit system and renamed Steward Health Care System. With the purchase of Caritas, Cerberus infused capital into the financially struggling health system.According to Dan Grauman, MBA, president and CEO of DGA Partners, a healthcare finance and management consulting company, one reason pri - vate equity firms invest in healthcare is because they have multiple sources of readily available capital to satisfy the capital needs of hospitals and health systems. More and more, hospitals and health systems have been in need of capital. Private equity firms like Cerberus and Blackstone, can meet that need, hence, an influx in private equity healthcare investments. As part of the Caritas Christi purchase, Cerberus provided $400 million in capital for infrastructure and technology improvements. Thus far, Steward is fulfilling the capital improvement pledge. First, Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Mass., completed construction of a $10.2 million surgical suite consisting of three operating rooms in Au-gust 2011. And, Saint Anne's Hospital in Fall River, Mass., opened its new 13,000 square-foot emergency department in early February. Following the conversion of Caritas Christi into Steward Health System, the system quickly expanded its reach in the region. In December 2010, Steward completed a $21 million acquisition of two Massachusetts community hospitals: Merrimack Valley Hospital in Haver - hill, Mass., and Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, Mass. Steward also pledged $19 million in capital improvements at the two hospitals. Steward then tried its hand in the healthcare insurance arena with an in- surance plan for use with Steward-affiliated physicians and facilities. Stew - ard worked with non-profit Tufts Health Plan in Watertown, Mass., the third largest health insurer in Massachusetts, to create Steward Community Choice. The Massachusetts Division of Insurance approved the insurance plan in December 2011. Finally, Steward is currently in the midst of acquiring Landmark Medical Cen- ter in Woonsocket, R.I. Approval of the deal has been complicated after state regulators deemed the Steward's first application submission incomplete. Vanguard Health Systems For-profit Vanguard, backed by The Blackstone Group, also invested in healthcare organizations. Vanguard acquired eight-hospital Detroit Medical Center in December 2010. As part of the DMC deal, Vanguard took on $391 million in DMC's debt and assumed its unfunded pension obligations and malpractice liabilities estimated at $335 million. Vanguard also pledged $850 million in capital improvements for DMC. Despite Distressed Assets, Private Equity Firms See Value in Healthcare (continued from page 1)13 REGISTER TODAY! Becker's Hospital Review Annual Meeting - May 17-18, 2012; Chicago; www.regonline.com/beckershospitalreviewannualmeeting_1041813 This January, DMC broke ground on million cardiology facility. In November 2011, DMC's Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital in Commerce, Mich., opened a $7 million private-room orthopedic and neurosurgery unit. Both projects represent forward movement of Vanguard's $850 million pledge. In June 2011, Vanguard was taken public in an IPO at $18 per share, bring - ing additional capital to fuel the hospital operator's aggressive acquisition strategy. As of February 2012, Vanguard was trading at $10.69 a share. Vanguard Health also owns three health plans: Phoenix Health Plan, a Medicaid managed health plan; Abrazo Advantage Health Plan, a managed Medicare and dual-eligible health plan; and MacNeal Health Providers, a preferred provider network. Blackstone Group's investments through Vanguard appear successful based on 2012 fiscal year earnings thus far. Vanguard's 2012 fiscal year began July 1, 2011. Vanguard's acquisitions increased their total earnings for the 2012 fiscal year by 61 percent from their 2011 fiscal year. The increase was largely due to patient revenue from its acquisition of Detroit Medical Center. Vanguard also recorded net income of $12.9 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2011, com- pared with a net loss of $4.2 million in the second quarter of last year. Cerberus and Blackstone appear to have been successful thus far, but the question remains \u2014 are they following a strong strategy that has escaped struggling facilities simply due to lack of access to capital, or are they an exception to the rule? Mr. Grauman believes there are two reasons private equity firms invest in healthcare. First, private equity firms have multiple sources of readily available capital to satisfy the capital needs of hospitals and health systems. Second, despite the challenges of distressed assets and variability in hospi- tal performance across the U.S., private equity firms can see down the road to when an investment in healthcare may turn profitable. \"Investors and private equity firms are attracted to the healthcare industry because of the growth that the healthcare reform law and expanding healthcare coverage is fueling,\" says Mr. Grauman. There is also one overarching demographic trend down the road, which suggests movement towards increases in healthcare service demand: the aging of baby boomers. \"Private equity firms can focus on the bigger pic-ture and see longevity in hospitals and health systems,\" says Mr. Grau-man. \"Conventional wisdom is that with the increased consolidation in the healthcare industry, if you pick the right investment it will be attractive in the future,\" he says. A private equity firm can weather turn-around time and losses, so that a hospital investment has a high return in a few years \u2014 when the U.S. patient population is at a peak. However, only some hospitals suggest a promising investment to private equity firms. The fundamentals for hospital operations need to be available in the market. According to Mr. Grauman, \"the four M's\" \u2014 market, medical staff, money and management \u2014 are elements a private equity firm would consider when evaluating a hospital or health system. \"[Market, medical staff, money and management] need to be present for a hospital to operate successfully. The private equity firm needs to see that there are enough available physicians in the area and that the market has a sufficient patient population,\" says Mr. Grau- man. \"There needs to be a reasonable opportunity for the hospital to succeed.\" While Boston and New England have no shortage of competition with providers such as Partners HealthCare in Boston and Johns Hopkins in nearby Baltimore, Steward may have been drawn to the market's ability to attract and produce high quality physicians and perhaps the competitive advantage of offering lower-cost care when compared to the big AMCs. Most often hospitals face distress for a small number of reasons such as management decisions, lack of insight into future trends or an absence of technological investments. Hospitals that would operate efficiently under alternate circumstances are better able to regain lost capital and are smart investments. Private equity firms, like Cerberus and Vanguard, can visualize the hospital's potential for a strong turn-around, says Mr. Grauman. Whether a private equity firm is looking for a promising return or merely wants to meet the needs of the healthcare industry, private equity investments seen recently in the healthcare industry are likely to continue. The future is ripe for healthcare transactions as healthcare reform and increases in health coverage continue. With Cerberus Capital's Steward Health and Blackstone Group's Vanguard Health as precursors, time will tell if they have paved the way for other private equity firms or if they are merely an exception. n REGISTER T ODAY!

Becker's Hospital Review Annual Meeting - May 17-18, 2012; Chicago; www.regonline.com/beckershospitalreviewannualmeeting_1041813 Increasing pressure to reduce costs and im- prove quality can be overwhelming for hos-pital leaders. Elizabeth G. Nabel, MD, presi- dent of the Brigham and Women's/Faulkner Hospitals in Boston, says she approaches this challenge, like others she has faced, as an op-portunity. Here, she describes how Brigham and Women's plans to continue to innovate and pro - vide quality care while reducing costs. Q: What are the biggest challenges you are currently facing as president of Brigham and Women's Hospital, and how are you working to overcome them? Dr. Nabel: One of the biggest challenges that we are currently faced with is driving down the cost of healthcare while maintaining quality, safety and the patient experience. In 2010, we set a three-year goal to reduce our base expenses by $160 million. I am proud to say that we are $125 million toward our goal, and that we have developed plans for the final $35 million, which we will implement over 2012 and 2013. We will work to create efficiency while being ever mind-ful that quality outcomes, patient safety and the patient experience cannot be sacrificed. To do this, we are working together as a multidis - ciplinary team and asking those closest to the patients how to make changes to improve care while cutting costs. In 2011, we also completed a strategic plan which articulates our strategic commitments. The plan is centered on the following \"truths:\" The care we deliver must be the best and must provide more value to patients and families, specifically through our efforts to push the boundaries of innovation, research and education. We have to continually prove our value to all those we serve \u2014 patients, families, referrers, payors and com-munity and government partners. We must op-timize the use of our assets and match patients' healthcare needs with the appropriate level of resources, both inside the walls of our academic medical center and with our partner institutions. Our work across our mission areas must be in-tegrated and coordinated, and we must be able to adapt quickly as the environment in which we live and work changes. Q: How do these challenges compare to those you have faced in the past? EN: As a physician, scientist and leader, I have approached challenges throughout my career as opportunities to innovate, and in that way this challenge is quite similar. The Brigham has a his-tory of transforming the future of healthcare \u2014 performing the first organ transplant, launching the world's first intraoperative MRI system, con-ducting the Nurses' Health Study, America's first study of women's health, and more recently per - forming the nation's first face transplant \u2014 and we intend to continue to do so as we shape how we will provide the highest quality patient- and family-centered care going forward. The chal-lenge is to provide the right care at the right loca-tion with the right expertise, which will contain costs and improve the patient care experience. That being said, many of the challenges in healthcare are different now than they were even five years ago. Delivering high-quality, afford-able, safe care consistently requires diligence in setting priorities and taking advantage of ef - ficiencies. Going forward, we will focus on co-ordinating care across the continuum, making appropriate and better use of our varied sites of care and further integrating and aligning our research, education, clinical and community mis-sion areas. Q: How do the challenges you deal with as a hospital leader shape your leadership style and your approach to healthcare? EN: My leadership style as president of Brigham and Women's Hospital is focused on collabora-tion. I learned very early on in my career as a phy - sician and a scientist that most often teamwork yields the best outcome. I encourage those on the front lines and staff across the organization at all levels to share their thoughts and ideas. I have es-tablished open forums to interact with our staff and encourage all employees to send me their ideas and concerns via an email forum that I've established for this purpose. I've found that this approach \u2014 encouraging participation \u2014 allows us to capture the creativity of our workforce and implement ideas that improve the quality, safety and efficiency of the care we provide. Q: What are the most valuable les-sons you have learned as president of Brigham and Women's Hospital, and how have you learned from them? EN: In my time as president of Brigham and Women's Hospital, as well as during my career as a practicing physician and a scientist, I have learned the value of being flexible and adapt - able. This is also something I learned from my father, a scientist for 3M, very early on. By an-ticipating changes in our environment and by committing to being nimble while staying true to our four-part mission of providing exceptional clinical care, innovating through research, train-ing the next generation of caregivers and pro-moting health equity for our community, both locally and globally, we, as an institution, have been able to continue to be successful while planning for the future. n Turning Challenges Into Opportunities: Q&A With Brigham and Women's Hospital President Dr. Elizabeth Nabel By Sabrina Rodak uPCOMING WEBINAR Developing and Strengthening a Culture That Motivates - Thoughts from Quint Studer Sponsored by the Studer Group Thursday, April 19, 2012 - 1:15 - 2:15 pm (CDT) Visit: www.beckershospitalreview.com and click on the Webinars tab to register call 800-417-2035 or email Lauren@beckershealthcare.com22 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review E-Weekly and CFO E-Weekly Report at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 What does it mean to be a top-perform- er, exactly? The phrase is often spoken with implicit meaning, but ask any two people and you'll likely hear different definitions. To help clarify what \"top performance\" looks like in healthcare right now, five hospital and health system CEOs from around the country decon-structed the term into five realms: clinical quality, finance, patient satisfaction, employee and physi-cian morale, and leadership. Here is how a hand-ful of our country's healthcare leaders are describ-ing \u2014 and working toward \u2014 top performance within their organization. Clinical quality \"Hospitals and systems need to engage close - ly with every member of the healthcare team \u2014 physicians, clinical and non-clinical em-ployees \u2014 to reduce variation in operations and quality. Clinical dashboards should be developed to identify the organization's per - formance in clinical areas, with organization-wide action plans developed to evaluate and improve any area of concern. Improvement in quality and safety is difficult and compli-cated, as it takes changes in the way we de - liver care to improve the care. Again, there are many external metrics to use to compare the organization's performance, and those should be used to target top performance.\" \u2014 Chris Van Gorder, president and CEO of San Di-ego-based Scripps Health \"First, as the people in an organization are a ma- jor determinant in the care hospitals provide, it's important to focus on the recruitment and re-tention of staff. You want people who are skilled at the highest level, regardless of their role, and who are committed to working together as a team to contribute to the growth of the institu - tion. Second, care is generally not delivered by an individual but by teams, so systems need to seamlessly come together to achieve needed out - comes. It's important to pay attention to patient flow and processes that enable care delivery. Ap-propriate use of information technology can en- able systems and processes to work efficiently with the goal of improved outcomes.\" \u2014 Louis Shapiro, president and CEO of Hospital for Special Surgery in New York \"Hospitals at the top of the quality spectrum see quality as something that's never 'done' \u2014 there is always a new benchmark to achieve and process to be improved. The best hospitals have highly engaged and committed clinical staff who strive to serve each patient and the other provid- ers caring for that patient \u2014 which, for academ - ic medical centers like ours, always includes the referring physician. We embrace the Joint Com- mission's concept of a culture of safety and 'col - lective mindfulness' of safety. Clinical leaders at top-performing hospitals set clear goals for qual- ity, safety and patient experience using guidelines and evidence-based medicine, and they commu- nicate and inspire their staff to embrace these goals. They also embrace information technol - ogy as a tool to track and improve processes and outcomes.\" \u2014 Eric J. Beyer, president and CEO of Tufts Medical Center in Boston \"This is where the best hospitals are at the top of their game. They've engaged physicians, staff and support systems to focus on the ul- timate outcomes of care. This is the best of times and the worst of times for quality in healthcare. We have far more data and trans-parency than ever before, and that is gradually raising the bar for all \u2014 which is a great ben-efit to our patients and our organizations over time. The downside is there are way too many measures out there, many requiring more data than the value they create. We have a long way to go, and it will be nice when we can move from mostly counting errors to measuring suc - cessful outcomes of care.\" \u2014 Ted Townsend, president and CEO of St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa \"You need to identify best practices for patient types, patient conditions and patient diagnoses. If you implement best practices and use them as a starting point, then you can adapt as you go on an individual basis.\" \u2014 Brock Nelson, president and CEO of Regions Hospital in Saint Paul, Minn. Finance \"Hospitals and health systems must find a way to perform financially even though reimburse - ment is trending down, particularly from federal and state programs. To identify a top-performer financially, one only needs to look at the ratings given to the organization by the rating agencies \u2014 Moody's, S&P and Fitch. The metrics for those various ratings are published by each rating agen-cy, and those are the targets for the healthcare organization to achieve.

This enabled us to retire older, more expen-sive debt and to fund some key capital invest-ments needed to further enhance our clinical programs. In order to accomplish the debt of-fering, we had to demonstrate to the financial community that we had positive cash flow and a solid strategic plan that would lead to contin-ued financial success in this challenging health-care environment.\" \u2014 Eric J. Beyer, president and CEO of Tufts Medical Center in Boston \"[Hospitals] need to show profitable per - formance in the short-run and a sufficiently strong balance sheet to weather whatever re - imbursement storms come out of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or deficit reduction. This is a crucial reason why many remaining single-site independents are looking for system alignment. From a debt financing standpoint in particular, bondholders are look-ing for historical track records and access to a deep pocket to deal with whatever comes.\" \u2014 Ted Townsend, president and CEO of St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa \"A hospital needs to have its expenses run com- mensurate with its revenue. When those two are not linked, it's a recipe for a lack of success. That ability to run your expenses with your volume is so vital to a hospital's financial health.\" \u2014 Brock Nelson, president and CEO of Regions Hospi-tal in Saint Paul, Minn. Patient satisfaction \"Improvement in patient satisfaction is not the end result of a 'smile program,' although courtesy is always important. Sustainable im-provement requires changes in systems that have been designed for the convenience of the providers \u2014 not necessarily our patients. It can also require facility and operational changes in addition to having all staff focus on the total well-being of the patient and their family.\" \u2014 Chris Van Gorder, president and CEO of San Diego-based Scripps Health \"At Tufts Medical Center and Floating Hospital for Children, we have a motto: 'Every Patient, Every Time.' We know that every interaction with a patient is an opportunity to create a su - perior experience or a disappointing one. Af-ter patients are discharged, they are surveyed on their level of satisfaction with the care they received here. Those results are posted on na-tional websites for the public to review and use in making decisions about their own healthcare. In addition, any patient at any time can instantly communicate with his or her entire social net - work about the care they received from us \u2014 great or not-so-great. It is critical for hospitals to educate their employees about the aspects of patient care on which we're officially and unof-ficially judged, and to communicate feedback we receive to frontline staff in ways that enable them to take action.\" \u2014 Eric J. Beyer, president and CEO of Tufts Medical Center in Boston \"First, hospitals need to place a high value on patient satisfaction as a strategic priority. Hos-pital for Special Surgery has been at the 99th percentile for 'likelihood to recommend' for 14 consecutive quarters when benchmarked against other facilities in the Press Ganey Mag-net Peer Group. It's a number one strategic pri-ority for everyone in our institution. Second, patient satisfaction is directly linked to employ - ee morale. Employees are 100 percent commit - ted to what we're trying to accomplish as an organization, and they view themselves as own-ers [of that mission]. Patient satisfaction needs to be hardwired into your organization. For example, we implemented hourly rounding for our nurses to reduce the need for patients to use their call bell. By anticipating our patients' needs, we improved their satisfaction and made nurse workflow more efficient. Now that is part of how our nurses work every day.\" \u2014 Louis Shapiro, president and CEO of Hospital for Special Surgery in New York\"Patient Satisfaction is the 'other side of the coin' for quality. Doing the right things clini-cally is a start, but if we don't do it the right way or with a caring attitude, then we've not served the patient well. High-performing hos-pitals have learned how to make sure that the first thing their associates do is care about 'the person' before they start providing care to 'the patient.' And they do it time after time.\" \u2014 Ted Townsend, president and CEO of St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa \"Have a plan. Be consistent. You need to learn what satisfies patients. Most importantly, make sure everyone in the hospital contributes to the cumulative result of all the patient interactions, from the parking attendants to the food service people to the medical staff. Everyone needs to be engaged.\" \u2014 Brock Nelson, president and CEO of Regions Hospital in Saint Paul, Minn. Employee and physician morale \"Healthcare delivery is hard work \u2014 both emotionally and frequently physically. But, for - tunately, healthcare attracts wonderful people who are dedicated to the care of our patients and our missions. Therefore, it's important for organizations to find ways to support \u2014 in ev - ery way legally possible \u2014 their employees and physicians by creating secure employment for employees and a supportive workplace for phy - sicians. We need to provide competitive salaries and benefits, opportunities for education and advancement, and the opportunity to grow as a healthcare professional.

Communication goes hand-in-hand with involvement, feedback and follow-up. People need to feel that their opinions count. This means paying attention to and following up on their suggestions for improvement. It's important to communicate what is happening at the hospital so that employees don't feel inhibited or discon-nected. Finally, everyone needs to have the tools to do their job, feel the organization is investing in their development, and know what's expected of them \u2014 then they're operating in an environ- ment that lets them work at their highest possible level.\" \u2014 Louis Shapiro, president and CEO of Hospital for Special Surgery in New York \"I believe physicians and employees are attracted to hospitals that have great reputations for high clinical quality. At Tufts Medical Center, we not only have a great reputation for quality but for being warmer, more collegial and more nimble than many of our competitors. This culture ap-peals to physicians and employees alike. For phy - sicians, this means they have opportunities to be entrepreneurial and that they'll be supported as they grow their clinical and research careers. Be - ing somewhat smaller than many academic med - ical centers also means that individual physicians and employees really can make a difference here. We also support our physicians' practices with a strong community physicians' network and a network of affiliated community hospitals.

Beyer, president and CEO of Tufts Medical Center in Boston \"High-performing hospitals have taken the 'us/ them' out of patient care and moved aggressively to make both their associates and medical staff part of a single team.

We have to be extremely cognizant of changes in the market and stay ahead of them. Some years ago, big AMCs were adding lots of beds and trying to drive as much volume to their hospitals as possible. Tufts Medical Cen- ter has developed strong clinical partnerships at community hospitals where our [physicians] spend time, helping [those hospitals] expand their clinical offerings and improve quality. In turn, they send us more of their tertiary cases. We stay in close communication with referring physicians to ensure patients get seamless care.

Becker's Hospital Review May 17-18, 2012; Chicago; www.regonline.com/beckershospitalreviewannualmeeting_1041813 Keith Churchwell, MD, was named executive director and CMO of Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute in July 2009. Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which includes the Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute, was one of the top-grossing hospitals in 2011 with $4.52 billion in total patient revenue, according to CMS cost report data analyzed by the American Hospital Directory. Additionally, U.S. News & World Report ranked Vanderbilt University Medical Center amongst the top 40 on its Best Hospitals for 2011-2012 List. Dr. Churchwell's background as a clinician and cardiologist guides his open door and humor-filled management style. Here he discusses his goals in the face of healthcare reform and innovation, his desire to surround himself with hard-working, collaborative individuals and his grassroots approach to executive leadership. Q: What goals do you have for the Vanderbilt Heart for 2012?Dr. Churchwell: One of the major goals for this year and for the whole medical center centers on financial issues. We are working to maximize our financial margin so we can fund innovative projects and prepare for what is down the road. Within the Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute, we are looking closely at key projects surrounding acute episodic care for cardiovascular disease that improves and enhances our care model. The goal is to maximize our opportunity to use novel approaches to patient cardiovascular care that achieve the goal of better outcomes and greater efficiency. We want the care to be a win for VHVI and for the patient. We would like to enhance the whole package, which includes minimizing costs and maximizing outcomes. Another major goal is to truly \"bundle\" the patient's cardiac care under one care plan. We have spent the last 10 months working on this key project at VHVI. At Vanderbilt, we take care of very ill patients providing surgical pro-cedures that are remarkable in righting the wrongs of the patient's cardiovas-cular problem. However, that is only part of what we do. Our goal is to look at the totality of patient care. It is essential that the patients understand their disease process. We need to ensure that patients are taking their medicine and that we are taking steps to help put the patient back on the right track from both a physical and mental standpoint. We want to communicate with the patient's local physicians and care providers so they are also a part of this plan and give the patient the best chance for a full recovery. Q: How are you working toward achieving those goals?KC: The first level of achieving any goal is making sure we have the right staff to get that done. Do we have the appropriate people to maximize care within the hospital environment? We really need to understand the day-to-day work of the hospital; what are the appropriate interlocking parts from a personal and technological standpoint? Once we have those key parts iden-tified, the next question is how do we use them to the best of our ability? We also need to determine if there is excess in the system. If so, where is it? Is there a better way to use our people, and if there is waste, how can we get rid of it? Where are we not placing enough resources, and how are those deficits leading to problems in care? How can we prevent those rollbacks from oc - curring, and we are encouraging and receiving the best work out of our staff?Q: What are your biggest chal-lenges as CMO? KC: The first challenge is that Vander - bilt is such a large, extensive system. To overcome this, I like to encourage the idea of teamwork. All the staff \u2014 support staff, cardiologists, nursing and tech support staff \u2014 are a part of what makes Vanderbilt a great medical center and medical school. I want to encourage the staff to act and work in a way that represents Vanderbilt in the best light \u2014 a \"they are we, we are they\" mentality. Thinking in that mindset is extremely important because if not, we are disparate in our ap-proach to problems, and we will not be as effective. Additionally, it is important to ask for innovation in our thinking about issues that arise so problem solving becomes an opportunity to improve. I want the atmosphere to be \"everyone rowing together, in the boat, in the same direction.\" Q: How do you try to encourage that mentality and environ- ment of \"everyone rowing together\"? KC: We set meetings with all the parts of the staff at VHVI on a regular basis. Sometimes that is not as successful, but I still try. Face time is ex- tremely important. I want to be transparent with questions, concerns and new initiatives. It is essential to get input from all the people who have ideas to share. When I understand their issues, I can handle the big questions, keeping their perspective in mind. Q: It sounds like you utilize a grassroots strategy. What helps you accomplish that? KC: Having an excellent administrative staff is essential. Then, realizing that part of my job is being a cheerleader and supporting my staff. It is important that I am able to look at the larger picture, the whole picture, as well as work with the staff and gather their ideas. I have a unique position because I am a clinical cardiologist as well as have responsibilities with senior management. I can see from the ground level what has been and is effective, and then I can talk with executives and partners and see their perspective. The view from both levels is very helpful. Q: We were discussing challenges for this year. I would imagine that other challenges might revolve around health-care innovation through technology. What is your strategy for incorporating new healthcare technologies? KC: Well, you are right in that healthcare technology can be a challenge to in- tegrate. Currently we are in another renaissance with cardiovascular technol- ogy and the ability to care for patients. In the late 1970s, there was a new age of revascularization with angioplasty. We are now looking at the age where diagnostic and therapeutic techniques are taking another significant leap for - ward. As an example, cardiologists and cardiac surgeons can now replace an aortic valve without opening the sternum \u2014 a tremendous advance \u2014 which will usher in other technological advances and also new care models that should be more efficient, less costly and better for our patients. \"Everyone Rowing Together\": Q&A With Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute Executive Director and CMO Dr. Keith Churchwell By Kathleen Roney 26 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review E-Weekly and CFO E-Weekly Report at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 With my staff, we are closely evaluating how to continue to integrate the find- ings of new cardiovascular research and translate those advances into our daily work. What are the results in terms of outcomes from a therapeutic stand-point? We also evaluate the technologies from a financial standpoint \u2014 what is the cost to Vanderbilt? What is the cost to the patient? How is it being paid for? How can we be sure that reimbursement is in line with the cost of the proce - dure and the results? Right now, these questions are key points in conversations at Vanderbilt and on a national level. Q: You are rounding out your third year as CMO. What is your proudest accomplishment? KC: I can't think of one single accomplishment, but I am proud of helping to keep the idea of an interlocking, interdisciplinary institute all together and that everything is still moving forward. Vanderbilt Heart has been able to integrate mature, successful cardiologists who have been in practice for a significant period into an aggressive aca-demic and clinical model of care. The newer cardiologists have thrived and joined successfully with cardiologists who have grown up on this campus. I am proud of that \u2014 of our ability to retain physicians and grow careers. Q: Hospital-physician relationships are very important to healthcare. Why do you think Vanderbilt has such great rela-tionships with its physicians? KC: Again, we have great administration, from the chairman of cardiac sur - gery, John Byrne; the chief of cardiovascular medicine, Douglas Sawyer; Robin Steaban, our CNO for Vanderbilt Heart and many others \u2014 are all examples of hardworking, dedicated people to this work. They have created a produc - tive, collaborative environment. The physicians and cardiologists respond well to that, and thus far, there has been no burning of torches at the barricades. Q: How would you describe your management style? KC: I hope that my style has a bit of humor. I try to be open, firm and more than willing to hear and incorporate other viewpoints. I try to give those who have expertise and who want to grow the opportunity to do so. The meetings I run are never terribly serious. It is okay for me to be the butt of the jokes if that puts people at ease as they go forward. I try to make it my role to ensure that I hear everybody's viewpoints, from around the room, during a meeting. When I find I am the only one speak - ing for an extended period, I try to take a step back. I find the most benefit derives from meetings when thoughts and ideas percolate. Q: What is the best piece of advice you have been given? KC: My father, who passed away three years ago, gave me some advice when I was offered the position of CMO: \"You need to [take the position] while you are young and use that youth to your advantage! Work hard as CMO; use your energy to do the best job possible and to see what you can make of the position.\" I think that is great advice because sometimes one may hesitate when they take on a significant responsibility. The best way to grow as an individual intellectu-ally and emotionally is take on responsibilities like [being CMO]. It is important to remember that others saw qualities within you that may be extremely helpful for moving a bigger agenda forward \u2014 it is important to take advantage of that. Be self-reflective throughout the whole process. Ask yourself if you are doing the right thing \u2014 have I made the right decision? What would I do dif-ferently next time? Be open to critical thinking. Ask those you trust what they think of your decisions. Ask people who can be honest.

Review Annual Meeting - May 17-18, 2012; Chicago; www.regonline.com/beckershospitalreviewannualmeeting_1041813 I speak to at least one healthcare CEO ev - ery day and I have to tell you: From coast to coast, I am seeing something akin to panic right now. Highly experienced, talented and smart leaders, who used to move ahead of the curve, seem completely paralyzed. They are telling me they don't know where healthcare is heading, and many of them are holding off on making any major decisions about the future. That is a mistake. Granted, the healthcare landscape of today is not a pretty picture. Many hospitals have a flat or declining inpatient census, due to the effects of the Great Recession, and future funding looks problematic. Medicare and Medicaid are pro - jected to have shortfalls of $25 trillion and $30 trillion, respectively, over the next few decades. During recent negotiations of the Congressional super committee, the skies looked pretty dark. The federal budget is still pushing $1 trillion, and our national debt is literally out of sight, a num-ber we can't rationally contemplate. It will take a stable federal government to solve healthcare funding problems, but all we have right now is political infighting at every turn \u2014 and no clear prospect of moving beyond the current game of partisan point-scoring. Here is the scenario as we enter this election year: The Supreme Court will review ObamaCare, the U.S. Senate is up for grabs and nobody can predict where the presidential race is headed. As a healthcare executive, you have to deal with a lot of the unanswered questions ahead, but the worst thing you can do is just stop and wait to see which way the wind blows. You need to be preparing your institution for the future, because the future will come sooner than you think. Many executives, however, believe they don't know where to start. Take ObamaCare. Will the Supreme Court strike it down -- throwing out all of its myriad provisions, from expanded in-surance coverage to accountable care organiza - tions? Well, I don't think so. My read is that the Court is feeling gun-shy about interceding in yet another presidential election, as it did in Bush v. Gore. Yes, there is a possibility the court will strike down the individual mandate, but I believe they will basically leave ObamaCare intact. Expect fundamental change The Affordable Care Act faces more challenges beyond the Supreme Court decision, of course. If we put a Republican president and Con -gress into office, they will likely take the axe to the ACA. But even if ObamaCare is repealed, healthcare reform is still inevitable. The system simply cannot continue in its current form and still satisfy both parties' concerns about fiscal solvency, quality and availability. With no ACA, changes could still come through other channels, such as the marketplace and the competition it creates. At a time when people are paying much more out-of-pocket for their care, they are be-coming more attentive about getting quality care. For example, the Internet has become a key tool in finding out more about physicians and hos-pitals. The younger generations are going to be even more computer-savvy. Whatever happens to ObamaCare, account - able care organizations will move forward, in one form or another. In spite of the furor over federal rule-making for ACOs, a lot organiza - tions are looking to join them in one capacity or another. A USA Today survey in late July of executives at 1,800 hospitals found that a third of respondents' organizations were \"extremely likely\" to become part of an ACO. These or - ganizations are about knitting together hospi-tals, physicians and post-acute care to manage population health, meet many more standards for quality and share in savings. I don't know ex- actly what form ACOs will take, but the model of tight integration is here to stay. Be open to change There are truly unprecedented challenges for healthcare right now \u2014 more than I have seen at any time since Franklin Roosevelt was presi-dent. And whenever there are major challeng-es, a good number of us want to dig in, resist change and be vocal about it. In healthcare, we are world-class in many ways, but perhaps the most refined skill we have is bemoaning the state of our industry. When President Kennedy proposed Medicare, I was director of communications at the Amer - ican Medical Association. The leadership of that august organization seriously believed that the sky was about to fall. A lot of doctors be - lieved the practice of medicine would die out. In 1962, right after President Kennedy pro-posed Medicare in a speech in Madison Square Garden, the AMA rented out the space and the AMA president gave a speech warning of the decline of healthcare if Medicare should ever be passed into law. Well, Medicare was passed a few years later. Although I am a Republican, I have to say that this reviled program turned out to be a reliable payor -- for many years, at least -- and even now, doctors recoil at any significant changes to it. Then, 20 or so years after Medicare started, DRGs came along. At the time, I was publisher of Modern Healthcare and, oh, what a furor there was among hospital executives. But when all was said and done, hospitals dealt with DRGs and they prospered. Then in the late '80s and '90s came managed care, which was supposed to be the end of everything good in the world. And we dealt with that, too. New pressures before us Now we have new problems to grouse about -- such as health IT, ACOs and readmissions poli- cies -- and new challenges to meet. Readmissions are a perfect example of the stark choice that healthcare executives face today. Lowering readmissions means fundamentally changing a hospital's financial outlook. Hospitals that profited from readmissions will soon get dinged as much as 3 percent of payments if you don't reduce them. But even if ObamaCare is repealed and the readmissions disincentive goes away, which is unlikely, don't expect that we are not going to set the clock back again. The old system of fee-for-service reimbursements that encouraged high readmissions doesn't have a fu - ture. We are headed into a new way of managing population health, with payment based on meet - ing standards for quality of care, patient satisfac - tion and outcomes. This new system will require investment in healthcare IT systems that can deal with huge amounts of data. In the economic stimulus bill, the federal government even sweetened the pot by offering substantial incentive payments for This is the Worst Time for Healthcare CEO Paralysis By Chuck Lauer, Former Publisher of Modern Healthcare and an Author, Public Speaker and Career Coach 28 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review E-Weekly and CFO E-Weekly Report at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 hospitals that comply with meaningful use stan- dards. I am amazed about how many hospitals haven't taken part yet. CMS paid out only a small portion of the $2.8 billion in incentives on the table for stage 1 meaningful use in fiscal 2011. Many providers were glad that stage 2 was de - layed, but I have to ask: What in the world are they waiting for? If you don't have a robust IT system, you can't compete. You can't manage costs by DRG, by physician, by service line. It's as simple as that. Yes, the new programs spawned by the health re- form and stimulus laws are still experiments. We really don't know whether they will succeed the way they are set up, but we have to try. If peo-ple like Mark McClellan, MD, the former CMS head under President George W . Bush, are right, these programs will soon become the new nor - mal in healthcare. They will then be expanded in a much bigger and broader scale. Joining this experiment now means becoming part of a new system of care at the ground floor. Time to get out of denial Despite all the evidence, plenty of executives are still wondering whether any of the changes be-fore them will come to pass. I think they are in denial. I think they want to return to the good old days, when life was simpler. But this is wish - ful thinking. The world has changed and health-care is changing with it, and whoever lives in this bubble is due for a rude awakening. Sure, there are a lot of challenges ahead, but there is also an incredible number of opportuni - ties. Despite all the problems we face, healthcare is an industry with a strong future. The glut of babyboomers reaching retirement will need a lot of healthcare. Even though Medicare will proba - bly undergo revolutionary change, it is not going to go away. The payment system of the future will reward value-driven care, not just volume.This is not a time for the faint-hearted. As with anything worthwhile, there will be winners and there will be losers. But for those who are dedi - cated to healthcare as a calling and are willing to embrace change, this is a thrilling time. Becom - ing a success will take all your skills, ingenuity, smarts and not a little bit of luck. But you can survive the test of today, and wind up with more than just a T-shirt for your troubles. n Chuck Lauer ( chuckspeaking@aol.com ) was publisher of Modern Healthcare for 33 years.

That's because physicians have such an impact on cost and quality of care \u2014 both of which are the key goals of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \"Across the country, there are very few health- care markets where the relationships between physicians and hospitals aren't in some type of change process,\" says Quint Studer, founder of Studer Group. \"Closer clinical integration is achieved by a number of different models, in-cluding employment. What we're finding, how - ever, is no matter what strategy you pick, the real challenge is the execution of the strategy \u2014 not only in the first year but the years thereafter.\" Over the past few years, the fear of significant reimbursement changes has caused many phy - sicians to \"run for shade\" by seeking hospital employment, explains Mr. Studer. Hospitals, in return, have welcomed them \u2014 often because of an overarching integration strategy. Yet, there are certain hurdles that need to be over - come before the relationship between healthcare organizations and physicians can be optimized. Misaligned incentives Lessons of the 1990s taught hospitals they must achieve certain levels of performance from phy - sicians in an employment model. As a result, the majority of physician contracts today are productivity or collection based. In contrast, the future of healthcare delivery is value-based \u2014 and the shift from one compensation model to another cannot happen overnight. \"When most physicians are brought into em- ployment by a hospital, the hospital isn't totally at risk,\" explains Mr. Studer. \"Physicians' salaries are determined by a productivity model based on either relative value units (RVUs) \u2014 i.e., produc - tivity \u2014 or percent of total collections. Yet, the heart of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act challenges that type of reimbursement.\" While it is true that a growing number of sys - tems do provide incentives for meeting certain quality and/or patient satisfaction goals, these measures often impact only a small portion of the total compensation a physician receives. Therefore, the biggest challenges in physician integration could lie ahead. When hospitals bring physicians on board they do so hoping to eventually achieve lower-cost, higher-quality care. Unfortunately, the contract they forge with physicians doesn't incentivize them to prioritize these goals. It incentivizes quantity, not quality. This situation creates a gap that hospital leaders must find a way to bridge. So how can leaders bridge the gap? The answer involves educating physicians on the coming shift, providing them with a mechanism for feedback and using a tiered approach to intro-ducing new payment structures. Do physicians know where the organization is headed? Hospitals leaders should first make sure all phy - sicians understand the shift toward value-based care and how it will impact the health system's overarching strategy. \"They need to truly under - stand what goals \u2014 both clinical and financial \u2014 the organization must meet in order to be successful,\" says Mr. Studer. For example, if the organization has set a certain HCAHPS score or utilization rates as overarch-ing goals, physicians need to understand what the goal is, why it has been set and their role in helping to achieve it. Traditionally, physicians have trained to have an individual mindset. This mindset, combined with physician contracts that reward individual pro-ductivity, may create a situation in which physi-cians are not aligned with the organization's larger goals. Leaders must help physicians to understand that they will soon have to move away from the old paradigm and into a new one \u2014 and to under - stand how it will translate to the system's goals as well as their individual performance goals. Leaders, however, have to be careful not to dic - tate these goals to physicians. \"Physicians want to have input into and influence on decisions,\" says Mr. Studer. This means a hospital should involve the physi - cians \u2014 through committees or other avenues \u2014 in helping set new performance measures. For example, if an organizational goal is to re-ceive a specific HCAHPS score, a certain per - cent of each individual physician's compensa- tion could be determined by his or her scores on the physician communication measure. \"Give the physicians a menu of metrics and let them select which metrics they need to see regu - larly to meet performance expectations,\" sug - gests Mr. Studer.When these Mr. Studer recom- mends a step-wise approach: introducing a few new measures each year and expanding that as value-based payments become more prevalent. As the organization grows more sophisticated, it can begin to weight the most important measures to ensure they are a core focus of the physicians. Provide feedback Next, the organization needs to provide feed - back to physician on how they are performing \u2014 before it impacts their pay. Physician leaders or an administrator can track physician perfor - mance on all indicators that align with organi-zational goals and regularly provide reports on how each physician stacks up compared to the benchmark as well as to other physicians. Mr. Studer recommends this feedback be pro - vided in a one-on-one meeting, so the physician doesn't feel publicly shamed if performance falls below the standard. During this meeting, the ad-ministrator or physician leader should also solicit feedback from the physician on what barriers may be keeping him or her from achieving those results. If those barriers are operational, leaders should be prepared to quickly address them. He also recommends healthcare leaders be pre - pared to provide skill development and training to physicians. \"Once they know they're evaluated and data is transparent, they become very hungry to improve their skill sets in those areas,\" he says. In the end, the transition from fee-for-service to pay-for-performance is about finding the right speed of change and explaining why this shift is beneficial. \"Value-based payment is actually much more balanced for doctors,\" explains Mr. Studer. \"Items most important to the doctors \u2014 patient care and access, for example \u2014 begin to more greatly influence how they are compensated for the work they do.\" nBridging the Gap Between Fee-for- Service and Value-Based Care Starts With Physician Feedback By Lindsey Dunn 30 Health Information Technology Health information exchange is a key goal of the HITECH Act and mean-ingful use program, as it is designed to enable the secure transmission of data between healthcare providers. The American Health In-formation Management Association named HIE as one of the seven initiatives it will focus on in 2012, and the Office of the National Coordina - tor for Health Information Technology placed achieving HIE as one of its top goals in its 2011-2015 strategic plan. In addition, a CapSite report found that 74 percent of U.S. hospitals plan to purchase new HIE solutions. Here are seven best practices for hospitals implementing HIEs. 1. Define goals. The first step in develop- ing an HIE, as with many projects, is to define the goals. \"Determine strategic objectives, [and] how those are going to be measured. Then de - termine what's feasible [and identify] top priori - ties,\" says Marshall Maglothin, MHA, principal at Blue Oak Consulting, a healthcare firm spe - cializing in electronic medical record implemen - tation, among other areas. He says primary goals should be related to quality, such as preventing readmissions and reducing medical errors. Other goals, however, will differ between hospi- tals. For example, Ralph Johnson, CIO of Franklin Memorial Hospital, a rural referral center in Farm-ington, Maine, says one the hospital's motivations for joining an HIE was to facilitate follow-up with patients after referrals. FMH has participated in HealthInfoNet, a statewide HIE, since 2006. \"A large number of our patients will be referred out because we don't do open-heart surgery and we're not a trauma center,\" Mr. Johnson says. \"We're constantly sending patients out of our network. [But] it's almost like a black hole \u2014 we don't get feedback on what happened to those patients. Now HealthInfoNet gives us that data.\" 2. Meet with physician stakeholders. Mr. Maglothin suggests forming a physician advisory board consisting of physician champions, physi-cians who have reservations about HIE, clinical medical directors of major departments and exec - utives such as the COO, CMIO and CIO. Creating this board will facilitate communication between hospital leaders and physician stakeholders as well as understanding of any resistance to implement - ing the HIE. \"Understand what the reservations and real barriers are,\" Mr. Maglothin says. It is important for hospital leaders to understand the HIE initiative from a physician's point of view to be able to identify potential issues and solve them before implementation. For example, Mr. Maglothin says from a physician's standpoint, the number of log-ins required is important because it affects workflow and productivity. Multiple log-ins may take only 30 seconds for each patient; howev-er, when considering the number of patients seen a day, log-ins could account for up to 43 hours per year of unproductive time, Mr. Maglothin says. Mr. Johnson said minimizing log-ins was one of FMH's goals when implementing HIE technol-ogy. The hospital established a system that allows providers to pass directly from the hospital's EMR to the patient's record in HealthInfoNet without a second log-in. \"We wanted to keep the patient in context going between the local EMR in the hos-pital and at the statewide HIE,\" Mr. Johnson says. 3. Encourage physician champions. \"The primary point of strength of a hospital HIE is physician stakeholders,\" Mr. Maglothin says. A hospital can benefit from \"a visionary physician who has experienced medical records and under - stands the potential for improving healthcare,\" he says. He says physician champions should drive implementation of the hospital HIE and \"[tell other physicians] 'This could be an extremely sig-nificant tool to leverage our EMR investment to improve patient care across the board.'\" 4. Gain physician buy-in. Gaining physician buy-in is essential to the success of an HIE be - cause an HIE's value depends on the number of users. \"Getting the enthusiasm to the end users to use the system is really [when] the benefits [occur],\" Mr. Johnson says. While critical to the process, hos-pitals cannot rely on physician champions alone to achieve the organization's goals through HIE. \"The purpose of a hospital HIE is to improve quality of patient care and reduce unnecessary costs. That can only be done if not only physician champions are using it, but also those with reservations,\" Mr. Maglothin says. He suggests gaining buy-in from physicians with reservations by listening to their concerns and addressing to them. Mr. Johnson says physicians respond to HIE plans when they learn of the potential benefits, such as faster transmission of data and the re-duction of duplicate tests. For example, Mr. Johnson says when he was training a hospitalist to use the HIE he pulled up a patient's chart in the system, which revealed the patient had re-cently been admitted to a different hospital \u2014 information the patient forgot to tell the hos-pitalist. This information led the hospitalist to determine the reason for the patient's back pain and immediately intervene to reduce the pain. 5. Include other practitioners. Since the benefits of HIE increase in proportion to the number of users, hospitals should include prac-titioners other than physicians. \"When you focus solely on doctors, you're missing a tremendous opportunity for the entire care team to have information they need to take care of their pa-tients,\" Mr. Johnson says. He suggests extending the HIE to nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants, therapists and other professionals in-volved in the care of a patient. FMH is roughly one-tenth the size of the largest hospital in Maine, but its HIE usage is nearly the same as the utilization of the largest hospital, Mr. John - son says. \"I think [this] is primarily because we expanded; we were not focused on just emergen-cy department doctors using the system. We in-troduced it to a larger portion of the care team.\" 6. Work towards interoperability within the hospital. \"The obstacle many are reach- ing now is they still have a number of signifi - cant siloed data repositories, diagnostic systems, for example, that collect extensive data, produce a report, but are not necessarily interfaced with other [systems],\" Mr. Maglothin says. Hospitals can make best use of the HIE if hospital systems that collect data are interoperable and can thus create one comprehensive database. For example, Mr. Johnson said before implementing the HIE, FMH established interfaces so the HIE could normalize the hospital's data in various forms, such as radiology exams and ICD-9 codes. 7. Don't limit the organization to one HIE. \"Hospitals won't [use] one or the other,\" Mr. Maglothin says. \"Large health systems will have possibly their own internal HIE as an in-ternal resource, and also exchange data with a state or regional HIE.\" Mr. Johnson says when examining a patient, FMH usually begins with the hospital's EMR and then references the HIE to include statewide data. Participating in both an internal and external HIE can enable the hos-pital to better organize data within the organiza - tion and be able to share that information via the regional or statewide system. n 7 Best Practices for Hospitals Implementing a Health Information Exchange By Sabrina Rodak HIE Statistics to Know 70% of healthcare organizations are planning HIEs 42% of healthcare executives believe HIEs will improve patient outcomes 67 % of healthcare excutives believe HIE will increase patient accessibility Source: Beacon PartnersBecker's Hospital Review Annual Meeting May 17-18, 2012 Hotel Allegro - Chicago, Illinois Great Topics and Speakers Focused on ACOs, Physician Hospital Integration, Improving Profitability, and Key Specialties - 74 Sessions 124 Speakers Coach Mike Ditka, Hall of Fame NFL Football Player and Coach Valinda Rutledge, Director of Patient Care Models Group, Center for Medicare/Medicaid Innovation Stephen Mansfield, PhD, President and CEO, Methodist Health System Chris Karam, President & CEO, CHRISTUS St. Michael Health System Joseph Golbus, MD, President, NorthShore University HealthSystem Bob Woodward, Author, Associate Editor, The Washington Post Michael A.

This word is one I've been saying a lot lately. At Mercy St. Vincent, where I served as president and CEO until October, a transformation \u2014 in the form of creating a culture of continuous improvement \u2014 has been taking place over the last several years. And, healthcare delivery as we know it will soon also experience a major trans-formation as it moves from fee-for-service to value-based, integrated care. This transforma-tion will require healthcare providers to redesign how they deliver care, in ways both big and small. On the grander scale, hospital and health sys - tem strategy must prepare for integrated, co- ordinated care along the care continuum. On the smaller scale, this strategy must also create value in more traditional ways \u2014 for example, through more efficient operations. At Mercy we have worked to develop a culture of continu-ous improvement \u2014 a culture that allows us to adapt the way we deliver care as we transition to value-based models. Continuous process improvement The transformation process we've instituted at St. Vincent involves bringing together a multi - disciplinary group from all levels of the hospital to explore ways to make our processes more ef - ficient while maintain the high quality care we are known for. For example, we recently stream - lined the transfer process so patients referred to St. Vincent from regional hospitals can quickly be assigned a bed and transported to the hospi-tal. The undertaking began by bringing various staff members who \"touch\" the transfer pro - cess together to map what our current state was as well as what the future state needed to be\u2014 that is, where we want to go. From there, we determined how to streamline and cut dupli- cate work at each point along the transfer pro - cess and identified which measures we needed to improve and track our performance. Then, we implemented and tested the various solutions. Today, St. Vincent has a single hub that receives calls from physicians who wish to transfer pa- tients, and each transfer patient is assigned a bed in 10 minutes or less. Before, transfer assign-ments took roughly an hour. Also, as a result of the efforts, St. Vincent experienced a 26 percent increase in transfers coming from the region. Now this same process and principles of per - formance improvement is being implemented at some of Mercy's rural hospitals, and it will soon be taken out to various regions within our parent organization, Catholic Health Partners. So while the actual improvements may be individual to each hospital, the process is replicable. Critical capabilities While continuous improvement alone is impor - tant to developing a strong foundation for value-based care, additional capabilities are needed for success as hospitals expand their care contin-uums post-reform. Here are just a few that will be important. Eliminating waste. As part of their continuous im- provement efforts, providers must continuously examine how they can eliminate waste and re-move duplication and rework. If a redundancy doesn't improve safety or quality, then why are we doing it? Patient-centered mindset. As organizations move toward coordinated, integrated care, they must think in a patient-centered manner. That's easier said than done, of course, but operationalizing processes that do what's right for patients is where the rubber meets the road. Drill-down benchmarking. Process improvement methodology must include meaningful measures of performance that can be easily reported to employees and staff. This is fairly obvious. How - ever, one thing we learned at St. Vincent is that these measures must be drilled down into more specific measures each employee can impact. We systematically broke down the processes our front line workers could impact in their own domains. For example, for years we were telling nurses to shorten length of stay, but what does that mean to them? Once we drilled down to the specific ways they could impact LOS, we started seeing improvement. How can nurses impact LOS? They can make sure orders are inputted in a timely manner; they can make sure test re-sults are delivered to physicians quickly; the list goes on. Health information technology and analytics. Where it's applicable, use technology as an accelerator and as a resource to develop visibility of what you're doing. Also use it to give you data that can be analyzed to improve both clinical and operational processes. If you don't know how you're performing, you don't know what to work toward. These tools also allow us to provide performance data to our various departments by week, day and hour, not by months or years. Transformation requires rapid change in a sys - tem, and HIT helps us impact the care delivered at the bedside in real-time. Transformation, though, is a journey, and it won't happen overnight. The key is to move in the right direction by articulating a vision and have methodology that moves your organization towards it. n Imran Andrabi, MD, currently serves as senior vice president and chief physician officer for Teoledo, Ohio-based Mercy.

Since much of the first wave of co-management agreements began in the mid-2000's, there are many \"mature co-management arrangements from which to learn. Here are 10 lessons learned from those early ventures that paved the way for clinical integration in specific service lines. 1. The improvement in the operations of a co-managed surgi- cal service line, such as orthopedics, had a huge impact on the operations of the OR overall. When the range of on-time starts increased to 80 to 90 percent, and turnover improved, more patients could be accommodated using the same human and capital resources, and both the hospital and physicians benefited financially. The process improve - ments resulting from co-management spread to other service lines. 2. During the first years of the arrangement, performance standards, targets, tasks and metrics were often adjusted to match those used by accrediting bodies and CMS. Since most co-management agreements have three-year terms, agreements were amended within months of execution. The language in some agreements made this easy, while in others, it was very cumbersome. It is important to have the flexibility to change tasks, responsibilities and hours through amendments, rather than waiting for renewal dates. 3. Most organizations commissioned independent opinions on the fair market value of the payments outlined in the agreement. However, since the mid-2000's, scrutiny from the IRS and CMS has increased regarding the commercial reasonableness of arrange - ments as well as the compensation paid. Hospitals with co-management agreements (especially those with multiple agreements) have strengthened their compliance to include commercial reasonableness opinions, typically when the contract is renegotiated or extended after the third year. The commercial reasonableness opinion considers the following: a. Does the arrangement meet a need of the hospital other than for referrals? b. Is there a community and/or patient need for the services in the agreement? c. Are the hours reasonable for the services provided? d. Is the compensation structure reasonable for the services provided?e. Do the credentials of the individuals in the agreement match the services needed? f. Are the tasks outlined in the agreement consistent with industry practice? g. Is another agreement or party covering the same services? h. Is there a formal oversight of the agreement to confirm that the services are being provided? Hospitals with multiple co-management agreements ran into complica-tions with items c and g, and most had shortcomings in the documentation of item h. 4. Co-management arrangements are more sustainable when they are focused on service lines where the oppor-tunities for quality improvement and/or cost reduction are the greatest. For this reason, many early entrants started with ortho-pedics or cardiology yielding improvements in supply costs, length-of-stay, readmissions and post-acute utilization. These organizations are now poised to pursue bundled payments and other value-based pay - ment models. 5. In the early agreements, the hours covered in the agree- ment were typically for physician involvement only. Many agreements were amended to add non-physician services, especially in multi-hospital agreements or those with joint venture managers. Some tasks were delegated to non-physicians working under the direction of physicians. When this occurred, the parties were required to confirm that the tasks and responsibilities were not already performed by hospital paid employees. 6. Many physicians confused co-management with gain- sharing and were surprised to learn that the hospital savings are not shared with physicians. This was especially annoying for physicians in those hospitals that had significant increases in volume over the time of the agreement. Inadequate attention to (and dollars in) the \"incentive\" payment portion of the fees deflated physician enthusiasm. It should be noted however there will be opportunities for gain-sharing in bundled payment and some value-based payments in the future. All physi - cians impacted by the co-management agreement should be fully educated on the mechanics and compensation possibilities. 7. throughout the 2000's, CEOs reported that they spent as much as 50 percent of their time on physician problem reso- lution. Perhaps that has not improved overall, but CEOs have reported that rather than demanding to see the CEO regarding problems in the OR, surgeons are more likely to work out the issues with the co-management leaders, leaving their interactions with CEOs to more positive and produc-tive topics. This was a lesson for the C-suite and affirmation that clinical integration can improve problem resolution and communication in some hospitals. The specialty liaison committees and site operations committees, in particular, appeared to address physician problem resolution. 8. The success or failure of co-management arrangements in some hospitals confirmed that the culture of clinical integra-tion starts at the top. If the CEO does not include physicians and nurses in senior leadership teams, budget preparation and decision-making processes on a daily basis, then true integration at the service-line level did not come naturally. Opportunities for improvements in patient care and quality were therefore missed. Some hospital executives involved with co-management agreements have increased the exposure of clinicians in all areas of hospital operations and planning efforts. 9. Hospitals with a healthy compliance culture seemed more successful with co-management arrangements. When hospital management was fluent in language that described Stark and IRS excess benefit concerns, there was better acceptance of the constraints on compensation, and the expectations for incentives were more clearly communicated. Hospitals with good compliance were also better at de - fining roles and responsibilities, which ultimately reduced conflict in their arrangements.Top 10 Lessons Learned from \"Mature\" Co-management Arrangements By Rebecca Bales, MPA, ASA, Senior Vice President, and Robert Minkin, MBA, FACHE, Senior Vice President, The Camden Group 40 Hospital-Physician Relationships & ACOs 10. As the payors continue to seek greater value, more extensive clini - cal metrics have been imposed upon healthcare entities, and the pressure to reduce costs is escalating. As a result, most co-management agreements will need to address these higher standards as a part of their deliverables, and accountabilities and responsi-bilities between the parties must be clearly es - tablished. Many co-management agreements are structured to include some or all of the fol-lowing: leased employees, service line manage - ment, supply standardization and control, capital equipment and medical direction. The physician-led co-management company must assume some or all of these responsibilities in a service line in order to perform to expectations. Hospital executives need to learn to \"let go\" and share the decision-making while not relinquishing the responsibility for the outcome. This is the most difficult behavior change, along with selecting the right combination of physicians who also can lead their colleagues in practice change. Co-management appears to be a good first step to greater levels of physician/hospital integra - tion. Utilizing this tactic can build success and trust which are necessary ingredients for all fu - ture relationships. n CBO: Most Demonstration Projects Don't Curb Medicare Costs By Molly Gamble After reviewing the outcomes of 10 major Medicare demonstra-tions, the Congressional Budget Office has found most produced little or no savings to the federal health insurance program. The CBO reviewed six disease management and care coordination demos, and four-value based payment demos. The first group of six disease management and care coordination demos comprised 34 programs operated by disease management companies. In nearly each of these demos, spending remained stagnant or increased at the same rate it would have without the program in place. Programs in which care managers had more direct contact with physicians and patients were more likely to reduce costs than other programs. For instance, hospital admissions fell by an average of 7 percent and regular Medicare spending declined by an average of 6 percent for programs with more direct contact. Still, these savings are not enough to offset fees \u2014 programs would have to achieve savings of 13 percent to do that. Value-based payment demos had mixed results. Only one of the four \u2014 bundled payments covering all services related to heart bypass surgeries \u2014 reduced Medicare spending at all. It cut costs by about 10 percent. The three other demos produced little or no savings. These include the Physi - cian Group Practice demo, Premier Hospital Quality Incentive and Home Health Pay-For-Performance demo. The CBO has concluded that the key factor associated with demos' suc - cess is the nature of the incentive offered to providers. Demos that paid bonuses to providers based on quality scores, estimated savings, or both, produced little to no savings. The success of the bundled payment demo was largely attributed to the competitiveness of hospitals' local markets and providers' strategic decisions \u2014factors that influence the size of the discount offered to Medicare in bundled-payment rates. nSurvey Suggests Joint Ventures With Physicians Most Popular Alignment Strategy, Among Other Findings By Lindsey Dunn The results of a recent survey of more than 200 healthcare lead-ers by Jarrard, Phillips, Cate and Hancock published in the firm's Inside Baseball newsletter suggests that joint venturing with physicians is the most popular current physician alignment strategy (49.8 percent of respondents indicated using this strategy), compared to aggressively acquiring practices (26.3 percent), traditional credentialing and medical staff relations (15.1 percent) and \"keeping [physicians] at bay\" (8.8 percent). In terms of how healthcare organizations are facing reform, 42.8 per - cent of respondents reported \"becoming strange bedfellows with... competitors\" through ACO or joint venture development. Additionally, just over 20 percent of respondents reported they plan to wait until after the presidential election to embrace reform, 11.2 percent plan to orchestrate or sale or purchase, and 10.2 percent plan to start a new managed care business. In regard to the election's impact on reform, the majority (53.5 percent) say it's \"unstoppable\" and market-driven, while 42.5 percent believe if President Obama loses the election, the intensity and direction of healthcare reform will dramatically change. n REGISTER TODAY!Becker's Hospital Review Annual Meeting Focused on ACOs, Physician-Hospital Integration, Improving Profits and Key Specialties Co-Chaired by Chuck Lauer and Scott Becker Keynote Speakers: Bob Woodward, Coach Mike Ditka and Suzy Welch May 17-18, 2012; Chicago Hotel Allegro To register, visit: www.regonline.com/beckershospitalreviewannualmeeting_104181341 Transactions & Valuations Over the past 24 months, HealthCare Appraisers has performed valuation services in connection with over 100 physician practice acquisitions across the country. In connection with these acquisi - tions, HAI is frequently asked to review or rebut competitors' valuation reports, typically as a result of one of three scenarios: i) HAI is asked to review an analysis that a party to the acquisition does not understand or agree with; ii) HAI is asked to refute or temper the work performed by a valuation firm or consultant that is willing to push past the limits of fair market value (e.g., potentially in violation of Stark Law or Antikickback Statute); or iii) HAI is asked to correct another appraiser's mistakes. From these experiences, HAI has compiled the following list of 11 com- mon ailments observed with physician practice valuation. 1. Mistaking investment value for fair market value. In the healthcare industry, regulations such as the Stark Law and Antikickback Statute mandate that permissible transactions involving parties who are in a position to refer patients (e.g., physicians) must be priced at fair market val-ue. FMV is defined by these regulations 1 in a manner that is more nuanced than the standard definition of FMV2, and may preclude consideration of economic benefits that might otherwise be priced into a transaction. Though the specifics of these laws and definitions are beyond the scope of this article, it is common to encounter investment banking, accounting, consulting and general valuation firms (i.e., valuation firms not specialized in healthcare) who incorporate significant levels of synergies into their FMV opinions (these synergies result in an investment value opinion which is not consistent with FMV). Common synergies include adjustments involving the following: increased reimbursement under provider-based billing, down-stream revenues, improper ancillary carve-outs, lower expenses achieved by the acquirer, indirect consideration of referrals and others. The result of in-corporating the aforementioned synergistic adjustments is a change to the standard of value and, therefore, an unusable valuation opinion. 2. Failing to analyze operational data. Appraisers unfamiliar with healthcare frequently fail to consider and analyze key operational data. Op- erational data includes detailed CPT code reports, provider mix, payor mix, place of service, patient zip code and other related reports. These reports allow valuation analysts to analyze historical trends, prepare a Medicare (or new commercial fee schedule) impact analysis, understand revenue con- centration, project changes in revenue, benchmark the subject practice to the industry, analyze relative value units of the subject physicians, assess unsystematic risk and many other supplemental analyses. Without these schedules it is difficult, if not impossible, for the valuation analyst to prop - erly value the subject physician practice. 3. Forgetting the impact of an electronic health record system. Many physician practices have implemented or are in the process of imple-menting an electronic health record system. Significant direct and indirect costs are incurred during the implementation process, with physician prac-tices expecting to achieve both direct and indirect benefits from the un-dertaking. The main direct financial benefit includes CMS' subsidy revenue of $44,000 per physician (paid over five years at $18,000, $12,000, $8,000, $4,000 and $2,000 per year), which is subject to current stage one meaning-ful use requirements and future implementation achievements (CMS in-tends to propose, through future rulemaking, two additional stages of the criteria for meaningful use). In addition to the expected direct revenue over the first five years after implementation, many valuation analysts forget to analyze the potential lost productivity during implementation and potential improved productivity going forward. On the expense side, many valuation analysts forget to examine changes in operating expenses during and after the implementation of an EHR system. An example of this is forgetting to analyze historical consulting and other one-time implementation expenses that should not be projected going forward. Another example is forgetting to project the full amount of increased software, server, computer, hardware and maintenance expenses that will be incurred to maintain the EHR system at the subject physician practice. A final common error, assuming the subject physician practice has implemented voice recognition hardware, is the valuation analyst forget - ting to project a decrease in transcription expense (either in-house or con-tracted service). All of the examples illustrated in the previous paragraphs have an impact on a subject physician practice's future cash flow and, thus, impact the concluded FMV of a subject physician practice. 11 Common Ailments With Physician Practice Valuation By Nicholas J.

Failing to analyze local demographics, industries and economies. Valuation analysts may determine that the subject phy - sician practice has the capacity to further grow revenue, whether it is through increased productivity or expanding services, but this does not always mean they have the ability to do so. The ability of a subject phy - sician practice to grow, or even maintain existing productivity levels, is highly dependent on factors within the local demographics and econo-mies. Healthcare is geographically constrained by a patient's willingness to travel and, therefore, local healthcare demand should be analyzed thoroughly, including analyses of historical and projected changes in population, age, workforce, income levels, major employers and indus-tries, prevalence of disease and other factors applicable to the subject physician practice's region. 5. disaggregating business and compensation valuations. In the valuation of physician practices, physician compensation and business value have an inverse relationship. To the extent physicians are going to re - ceive an increase in compensation relative to historical levels, the result is a decrease in projected cash flow and, thus, a decrease in value (and vice versa). It is common to review valuation reports in which the valuation analyst or client has disconnected the business and compensation opinions either through the use of multiple appraisers or a compartmentalizing of information. A busi-ness appraisal that fails to account for a 20 percent increase in compensation post acquisition does not properly impact projected cash flows and over - states the conclusion of value for the subject physician practice. This is akin to someone winning the lottery and choosing to receive the upfront payment and the annuity payments for 20 years (i.e., have your cake and eat it too).6. Erroneously valuing in-office ancillaries. Many physician prac- tices have both professional collections related to physician services and technical collections related to in-office ancillaries such as diagnostic imag-ing. In certain instances it may be appropriate to value these separately; however, there is a correct and an incorrect way of separately valuing in-office ancillaries. Similar to disaggregating business and compensation val-uations, many valuation analysts create unsustainable business models and do not account for the portion of physician compensation that is generated from in-office ancillaries. An example is valuing the in-office ancillaries of a cardiology practice where the cardiologists generate a significant portion of their compensa-tion from in-office diagnostic imaging (e.g., as high as 50 percent of total compensation). If the in-office ancillaries are sold, the cardiologists will no longer be able to bill for these services and, as a result, the subject physician practice will have to pay the cardiologists a reduced level of compensation based solely on professional collections. Valuation ana-lysts cannot simply use survey data (e.g., MGMA, AMGA, etc.) via the market approach for determining physician compensation, as the survey data does not adequately bifurcate compensation related to professional services and in-office ancillaries. Thus, after adjusting for the impact of in-office ancillaries, a distributable earnings method or pre-compensation earnings method should be used in determining the appropriate physi-cian compensation. 7. Benchmarking improperly. Valuation analysts should benchmark the subject physician practice to industry metrics. Failure to do so gen- erally results in unsupportable business models and provides very little value-added to the acquirer. Through the use of published surveys, such as the MGMA Cost Survey, and through reviewing previous valuations of similar entities, the valuation analyst should be able to identify cer - tain revenue and/or expense abnormalities as well as adjustments that a normal operator would be able to achieve. Common adjustments include poorly (or absently) negotiated payor contracts that result in below-mar - ket reimbursement; excess (or insufficient) staffing levels; in-sufficient) leased underperforming flow); and non-operating and non-recurring items. While some valuation analysts do not benchmark the subject physician practice to the industry, others develop unreasonable financial statement adjustments through assuming all physician practices can achieve \"medi - an performance levels.\" These valuation analysts fail to truly analyze the unique characteristics of the subject physician practice relative to what is \"common\" within the industry. An example is adjusting clinical support staffing levels to a \"median level\" for subject physicians that achieve pro - ductivity above the 90 th percentile. This may be obvious to most, but the subject physicians likely need clinical support staffing levels at the 90th per- centile (or above) in order to be so productive. 8. Incorrectly utilizing the market approach. The comparable trans- action method of the market approach is the most commonly misused meth- od in determining the FMV of a physician practice. Many valuation, con-sulting and investment banking firms attempt to apply valuation multiples from closed transactions in valuing a subject physician practice, particularly multiples of revenue. There are a number of downfalls to this approach, including the following: the transactions may not represent FMV; the trans-actions could involve the subject physicians receiving a pay raise (or pay cut) that is not reflected in the deal data; the inclusion or exclusion of specific assets or liabilities in the transactions that is not reflected in the deal data; and unknown levels of ancillaries, mid-level providers and other important information. Furthermore, assuming the valuation analyst has enough infor - mation about a set of closed transactions, it may be inappropriate to apply valuation multiples from closed transactions that have occurred outside of the local market of the subject physician practice. Given the local nature of healthcare services, particularly physician practices, there can be many differ - ing factors across market areas (e.g., reimbursement). 43 Transactions & Valuations 9.

Certain valuation firms, consulting firms, acquirers and attorneys believe every physician practice should be compensated at or above the median compensation per work relative value unit reported in published surveys (even when the subject physician practice has not been able to his-torically generate such levels of compensation per wRVU). By definition, a median value reflects the midpoint of a data set. Accordingly, 50 percent of physicians make less than and 50 percent make more than the median reported compensation per wRVU rate. It is also important to understand what the data in these surveys reflect and how the data is intended to be used. For example, MGMA has spe - cifically addressed the fact that for the majority of physician specialties there is a declining compensation per wRVU rate as overall productivity increases. Generally, this indicates that physicians who produce at the 75 th percentile should not be paid at the 75th percentile rate per wRVU. There are many factors that contribute to this relationship, and even with a declining rate per wRVU as productivity increases, physicians still have increasing total compensation in all reported quartiles, as illustrated in the following graph. Every physician practice has its own unique operating characteristics and levels of technical and other service revenues. Some physicians use more resources (e.g., clinical support staff, space, etc.) in generating wR - VUs, have more ancillary utilization and generate higher levels of other service revenues (e.g., on-call, directorship, co-management, interpretation, etc.). These operational characteristics and additional revenues impact a physician practice's compensation per wRVU rate. As a result, it is possible to have two physician practices across the street from each other that real-ize disparate compensation per wRVU rates. 10. Failing to understand what is reflected in the FMV opin - ion. Acquirers of physician practices are typically structuring the purchase as an asset deal (instead of a stock deal). The acquirer frequently relies on the valuation firm to help determine the FMV of acquired assets (and li- abilities to the extent that any are transferred). Under the asset approach, it is fairly simple to analyze and adjust the FMV balance sheet to include only the assets and liabilities that are expected to be transferred. It is com- mon for valuation analysts to make mistakes when analyzing the FMV of acquired assets (and liabilities to the extent that any are transferred) when using the income approach. Using debt-free cash flow under the income approach, an analyst de - velops a conclusion of the market value of invested capital. From the concluded market value of invested capital, the valuation analyst has to subtract assets that are not going to be transferred. Typical adjustments include the exclusion of net working capital, inclusion of inventory and inclusion of debt on transferred fixed assets. Once the deal terms are known, the appraiser should be consulted to verify that the purchase price is reconciled for the inclusion or exclusion of any assets and liabilities. 11. Failing to go on-site to visit with management and phy- sicians. There is only so much information that can be gleaned from financial and operational reports. Valuation analysts who do not go on site to meet with the administrative team and physicians have a higher pro - pensity to miss certain nuances of the subject physician practice or bury themselves in the numbers and forget the big picture. In meeting with the administrative team and physician group, an appraiser can gain insight into the practice patterns of the subject physicians, condition of the office and ancillary equipment, depth and quality of the administrative team and other information important to the valuation. Although a site visit can be dependent on the scope and timing of the engagement, conducting a site visit is an integral part of the valuation process Conclusion As evidenced in the list above, there are many areas where valuation ana - lysts err in valuing physician practices. Acquirers must be very careful in selecting a valuation firm to help determine the FMV purchase price of a physician practice; an interview process is necessary in order to appropri - ately vet the hiring of a valuation firm. n Footnotes:1.

See the International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms 44 Finance, Revenue Cycle & ICD-10 Sitting in the healthcare \"hot seat\" is a turbulent experience right now for any hospital CFO. It's similar to the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" in that the personal pressure builds the further along someone goes, and there is gradually more on the line, financially speaking. However, health-care does not have any multiple choice options, 50/50 lifelines or Regis Philbin's calm demeanor. Mark Doyle, CFO of St. Vincent's HealthCare in Jacksonville, Fla., lays out three questions that are at the forefront of any hospital CFO's mind right now. And unlike a game show, there are no easy answers. 1. How will Medicaid cuts impact my hospital? Medicare, Medicaid and commer - cial payors are the three main revenue sources of most hospitals. There are, undoubtedly, pres- sures on all three. Medicare reimbursement rates have an anemic growth rate \u2014 the Medicare payment adjustment actually fell behind inflation rates this past year. Hospitals also may have to barter more with commercial payors to make up for the declining governmental payments. Medicaid, though, has become a growing con- cern for hospital CFOs because the impact of Medicaid cuts depends solely on what state the organization is located in. Medicaid spending for the entire country for fis - cal year 2011 was around $398.6 billion, a 10.1 percent increase from FY 2010, according to a report from the National Governors Associa-tion and the National Association of State Bud - get Officers. That total accounted for almost 24 percent of state spending \u2014 the single largest el - ement of state spending. At the same time, many state officials are enacting austerity measures on state budgets, and Medicaid reimbursement is one of the biggest items on the chopping block. More than a dozen states have already sliced Medicaid payments to hospitals and physicians. For example, Arizona cut Medicaid reimburse- ment to hospitals and other providers by 5 per - cent this past year. South Dakota (11.5 percent cut to hospitals), Oregon (11 percent cut to hos-pitals), Washington (10 percent cut to hospitals), North Carolina (7.3 percent cut to hospitals) and many others have also reduced Medicaid rates. St. Vincent HealthCare in Florida faces roughly $2 billion in Medicaid cuts for the 2012 to 2013 fiscal year, which amounts to a 12 percent aver - age cut to Medicaid reimbursements for hospi- tals, and Mr. Doyle says those types of reduc - tions will hurt his state's struggling program even more. \"Funding for Medicaid has taken a huge bite out of reimbursement, and every pa-tient of Medicaid will be a significant loss for each hospital,\" Mr. Doyle says. Hospital CFOs looking to stay on the offen- sive have to consider areas that can compensate for this lost Medicaid revenue. For some, this may require an analysis of service line produc - tivity. \"This will force a lot of hospitals that are standalone and don't have [market] lever - age to probably close their doors or choke off less profitable service lines,\" Mr. Doyle says. \"Hospitals won't be able to keep up the level of services. In the past, it's been you pass the lack of reimbursement onto the backs of the commercial payors and the HMOs. In the fu-ture, I don't think we'll be able to do that \u2014 or at least not like 10 years ago.\" Additionally, Mr. Doyle says hospitals need to constantly review production metrics, become more persistent in payor negotiations, manage the supply chain as efficiently as possible and control every other type of cost (e.g., energy, labor, etc.) down to the penny. \"That's the only way right now, absent of rate increases, that we'll be able to survive,\" he adds. 2. Will ACOs and bundled payments be beneficial? The Medicare Shared Savings Pro- gram set the parameters for accountable care or - ganizations, and the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Program created guidelines for a bundled payment system focused on the contin-uum of care. Both initiatives, part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, are under way, but concrete financial benefits will not be seen for quite some time. Mr. Doyle says although his organization is analyzing the new programs, they are not moving full-force until more large-scale financial ramifications become clearer. However, St. Vincent's HealthCare has submit - ted an application for Model 2 of the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Program. Model 2 focuses on bundled payments for both the inpatient stay as well as the post-acute set - ting, and the hospital decides the scope of diagnosis-related groups to be included in the bundled payments. In this instance, Mr. Doyle says the organization plans to focus on ortho-pedics and cardiology for the bundled payments, but St. Vincent's HealthCare has not necessarily committed to anything yet. Mr. Doyle believes the success of these pro - grams will largely be dependent on one com- ponent: physician alignment. About a year and a half ago, St. Vincent's HealthCare employed five physicians. Now, the health system has 92 employed physicians. Regardless of how the PPACA programs shake out, there is a shift to congregate physicians and make them a more integral part of the health system's financial sol- vency. \"You can see a rapid expansion for physi - cian alignment, and it's all to manage the entire spectrum of a patient's health,\" Mr. Doyle says. 3. What exactly is going to happen with the healthcare reform law? This is the million-dollar question. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on the PPACA this March, with a final ruling expected in the sum - mer. Parts of the healthcare reform law being questioned include the individual mandate for health insurance and the expansion of Medicaid. However, because the law is in a legal limbo of sorts, it makes it difficult for hospital CFOs and other executives to make definitive short-term plans for their organizations. \"It has to be all or nothing,\" Mr. Doyle says of the potential ruling. \"You need the first domino to fall for the rest to come into play.\" The early indicators vary on how the Supreme Court will rule. Many healthcare experts think because so much of the PPACA has been ruled constitutional elsewhere \u2014 and because so much has been implemented \u2014 it will be un- likely there will be a full repeal or even a repeal of the individual mandate, which is one of the biggest hot-button issues. However, in an elec - tion year, nothing is for certain. Mr. Doyle, who believes the funding of the PPACA appears to be unsustainable in the future, says it is that un- certainty that is making things so difficult for the healthcare sector. nSt. Vincent's HealthCare CFO Mark Doyle: 3 Burning Questions Right Now By Bob Herman 45 Finance, Revenue Cycle & ICD-10 As Benjamin Franklin famously quipped, \"In this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\" The certainty of taxes has become increasingly involved for hospi - tals, as the Internal Revenue Service as well as state and local governments are making sure the healthcare systems in this country are properly paying their fair share in an era of tight budgets. As the tax season now starts to hit full stride for most people in the United States, here are seven best practices for hospitals and their financial teams in order to manage their tax processes smoothly year-round. 1. Understand the new Form 990. For non-profit, tax-exempt hospi- tals, nothing is more important than the Form 990. It is the Holy Grail of tax documents, and the IRS released the 2011 version of the Form 990 (for tax years beginning in 2011) last month. Milt Cerny, JD, counsel at McGuireWoods, and Rick Speizman, national partner-in-charge of the exempt organization tax practice at KPMG, say this year's Form 990 has added new reporting requirements, with those involving Schedule H as the most important for hospitals. Section 501(r) of the Internal Revenue Code, part of the Patient Protection and Afford-able Care Act, imposed new tax exemption requirements on non-profit hospitals. These new requirements in turn led to new reporting on Sched-ule H, beginning with the 2010 Form 990. Much of the new reporting was optional for filers of the 2010 form, but it is now required for filers of the 2011 form. Here are four of the most pertinent items hospitals need to know about this year's Form 990. Facility information. Part V , Section A now requires hospitals and health systems to list each of their hospital and non-hospital healthcare fa-cilities, including those operated indirectly through a \"disregarded\" entity like a limited liability company or a joint venture. \"There is more reporting in this form, and it also requires a separate set of re-sponses regarding policies and practices for each hospital's practices and facilities,\" Mr. Cerny says. Community health needs assessment . Part V , Section B, lines one through seven, provide new reporting obligations for hospitals, as well. Mr. Speizman says the community health needs assessment require - ment of Section 501(r) is a major new tax requirement for hospi-tals. If hospitals want to remain tax-exempt, they have to conduct community health needs assessments, which essentially detail how a hospital is meeting the health needs of the community it serves. The community health needs assessment is optional for tax years be-ginning before March 24, 2012, but many hospitals are working on this section of Schedule H now to stay ahead of the game. Examples of detailed questions in this section include how hospitals obtained data and how the assessment was made available to the public. Financial assistance and billing/collections policies . The financial assistance and billing/collections policy questions are still within Part V , Sec - tion B on Schedule H, and these reporting requirements essentially ask hospitals to outline the standards they apply in offering financial assistance to patients, what type of financial assistance they offer and how they publicize their policies. Mr. Cerny, however, says this sec - tion has expanded and added different terminology. \"It's interesting because [the IRS] eliminated the term 'charity care' replaced it with 'financial assistance,'\" Mr. Cerny says. \"That's basically asking about policies that applied to the largest number of patients.\" Compensation. Hospitals must record the compensation of top execu - tives in their Form 990 (this is outside of Schedule H). Although the compensation reporting requirements are not new, they still are con-sidered to be one of the most heavily scrutinized facets of the entire form. \"Compensation is always going to be looked at by the IRS,\" Mr. Cerny says. \"That's something hospitals really need to make sure they have done the due diligence for determining compensation.\" Hospital financial teams should always review the compensation packages of top executives and other \"insiders.\" \"Look at the compensation of ex-ecutives and see how it matches up against executives at other organiza - tions,\" Mr. Speizman says. He also notes that proper reporting of compen-sation on Forms 990 can be difficult \"because of the increased and more detailed reporting \u2014 retirement benefits, fringe benefits. A great deal of data needs to be collected. This is always a lot of work,\" he says. Mr. Speizman also recommends that as a best practice, healthcare providers should give their full board of directors an opportunity to review the Form 990 in its final form before it is submitted to the IRS. Because the Form 990 is available in the public sphere, prudence and meticulous evaluation must reign supreme. \"In the tax-exempt world, we're concerned about a lot more than the income tax we might owe,\" Mr. Speizman says. \"This is information that is being looked at by the IRS, the public, potential donors, labor unions, competitors, the press \u2014 everybody. It's worth putting the proper investment into preparing Form 990 because it really is the face of your organization and continues to get more complicated as the govern-ment adds more rules and more reporting requirements.\" 2. Have an efficient and effective tax compliance team. The Form 990 is a major undertaking for non-profit hospitals and health sys - tems, but every hospital \u2014 regardless of tax status \u2014 needs to have a focused tax team, says Monica Coakley, national tax leader for healthcare at KPMG. Getting all tax filings completed on time should be a given, but being proactive and well-organized along the way is the challenge. \"You need to make sure that your [hospital] has an efficient and effective tax compli-ance team that is planning ahead and executing a proper project manage - ment plan,\" Ms. Coakley says. \"The company should have a clear time - line, from gathering all relevant information through any internal and external reviews and electronic submission. The planning and informa-tion gathering process should be ongoing throughout the year.\" 3. Evaluate the tax processes on a periodic basis. Hospital CFOs and other financial officers should evaluate periodically how they gather tax data and how they are meeting compliance obligations, including whether they have the right, robust tax technology in place. \"Tax technol - ogy can make a big difference in the cost effectiveness and accuracy of the tax compliance process,\" Ms. Coakley says. \"Having strong systems and controls in place is one of the keys to effective tax risk management.\" 4. Be proactive on gathering investment information. Many of the larger non-profit hospitals and health systems have substantial invest - ment portfolios these days, and they are making very diverse investments, such as real estate, private equity funds and hedge funds. However, compiling and retrieving the slew of information from those investments is not always easy. \"Typically, those organizations are reliant on receiving forms and disclosures of information, but sometimes that information is hard to get,\" Mr. Speizman says. He recommends hospital 7 Best Practices for a Smooth Hospital Tax Process By Bob Herman 46 Finance, Revenue Cycle & ICD-10 financial officers stay on the offensive and be proactive about receiving timely and complete investment statements and Forms K-1 from all of the accounts and funds in which they invest. 5. Don't narrow the focus to only federal income taxes. Both non-profit and for-profit hospitals need to devote appropriate resources to state income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes and escheat taxes, which is another term for unclaimed property taxes. \"It's important to not fall into the trap of allocating all of your attention and resources to the federal income tax return, although that's a large component,\" Ms. Coakley says. \"State auditors have become increasingly aggressive as they look to close state budget shortfalls.\" 6. Stay on top of IRS guidance. Both non-profit and for-profit healthcare providers stand to gain a lot by staying \"in the know\" with IRS \u2014 as well as state and local \u2014 tax law developments. The IRS website provides updates to the federal tax code and offers official tax guidance. Ms. Coakley says there are a number of important recent tax developments that affect taxable healthcare providers. For example, this past fall, the IRS introduced a new safe harbor for the nonaccrual-experience method of accounting, which is a special way for taxable entities to determine when certain income related to healthcare services must be recognized. The les -son? There will always be complicated rules to the tax code, and doing the research pays off in the long haul. \"The rules for the nonaccrual experi-ence method of accounting are very complex, and the previously provided safe harbors are also very complex,\" Ms. Coakley says. \"It's important that for-profit healthcare providers work with their tax advisors to determine how these rules are going to apply to them.\" 7. Acknowledge that taxes are a year-round endeavor. For the normal taxpaying American citizen, the nuts and bolts of returns are really only considered at the beginning of the year, when tax returns need to be filed. For hospitals and other large organizations, taxes need to be a year-round concern because the organization's bottom line is at stake. \"Any CFO should know that taxes are an integral part of the economics of their busi-ness,\" Ms. Coakley says. \"Tax implications and planning opportunities should be considered at the forefront of any business undertaking. Taxes shouldn't be something that only comes to mind when it's tax return filing season.\" Ms. Coakley adds hospitals that are adroit in their tax planning are actu - ally putting the organization in a better position for future success. \"Tax efficiency can contribute to the bottom line,\" she says. \"Because of the prevalence of tax credits, tax incentives, tax exemptions and other oppor - tunities, attentive tax planning can actually create significant value for an organization.\" n When it comes to a hospital's finances, most CFOs are awaiting decisions on just how much Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements will be cut. While cuts to those government-sponsored programs are out of the hospital's control, there are ways a hospital can make its ledger trimmer from its own cost-sav-ing initiatives. Mark Bogen, vice president of finance at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, N.Y ., says there are numerous areas where a hospital can manage and reduce its costs with - out thinking about Medicare or Medicaid, and he shares seven ways hospitals can save money within two of the most prominent areas: the la-bor force and the backend operations. 1. Monitor overtime pay. Mr. Bogen says a hospital's labor force is the single largest item that impacts the hospital's budget. At South Nas-sau, the payroll is $180 million per year, which is more than 50 percent of its total operating budget. Even if the payroll is off by one tenth of one percent, it would still lead to $180,000 in wasted money, he says. One way to keep the payroll in check is by monitoring overtime pay. Hospitals are working at all hours of the day, but over-scheduling staff members can lead to higher-than-desired overtime wages and empty work hours. \"What you find in most hospitals is that it's easier to staff up when volume goes up than it is to staff down when volume goes down,\" Mr. Bogen says. \"Staffing is certainly an area that needs to be managed, especially in light of the fact most hospitals today have static or reduced inpatient admissions.\" 2. Review on-call and all formal pay policies. Hospitals naturally have to have all clinicians on-call. If on-call pay policies have not been reviewed in a while, though, a hospital may want to assess and adjust them to reflect the hospital's current needs. \"One of our de - partments had an on-call policy where if you have to call someone in, as long as they work a minimum of an hour, they got paid for four hours of time,\" Mr. Bogen says. \"It's really im-portant to review not only what the formal pay rules are, but also why the particular pay rules were established years ago.\" 3. Find the right mix of staff members. Layoffs have been rampant throughout the hos-pital industry, as there were 13 mass layoffs in August alone. However, hospitals do not have to lay employees off to save the labor budget, Mr. Bogen says. Having more per diem and part-time employees could keep employment figures steady, but it would guard against both staff shortages and superfluous overtime pay. 4. Renegotiate inbound shipping rates. Mr. Bogen says South Nassau's inbound ship-ping costs averaged around $500,000 per year, with $300,000 of that related to deliveries for operating room supplies. Hospitals should work with their materials management team to find different vendors and suppliers to lower shipping rates. South Nassau was able to save $75,000 by leveraging its buying power. \"The problem is [shipping] doesn't get separately cod-ed, and it gets buried in hospitals' general led - ger, so you don't have a good idea of how much you're spending on in- and outbound delivery,\" Mr. Bogen says. \"But you need to take advantage of those situations where vendors are having difficulties closing sales. If they ain't crying, we ain't buying.\" 5. Reduce overnight shipping in the OR. ORs are unique parts of the hospital that require very specific supplies and par levels, but that doesn't mean its inventory process should get out of hand, Mr. Bogen says. Reducing over - 7 Ways Hospitals Can Trim Their Labor and Operational Costs By Bob Hermann 47 Finance, Revenue Cycle & ICD-10 night charges on shipping is one way hospitals can minimize costs, but this is a point that has to be talked over with surgeons, nurses and all other OR staff. 6. Try to standardize supplies. Physi- cians, nurses and other clinicians all prefer certain supplies and products over others, but standardizing certain supplies to reduce costs can make the inventory process much simpler and cheaper, Mr. Bogen says. \"Try to make things standardized, maybe things that a par - ticular nursing unit prefers, for example, unless there's some big clinical rationale to go outside that standardization,\" he says. 7. train the revenue cycle team to be \"pit bulls\" with managed care con- tracts. Backend collections are critical for any hospital, and Mr. Bogen says having a persis-tent team that understands what needs to be collected \u2014 and who is responsible for pay - ment \u2014 will lead to less bad debt and more accountability. This is especially important for managed care contracts, which he says can be very convoluted. \"Have your revenue cycle team be pit bulls who won't let something go until it's adjudicated in a fair and timely man-ner,\" Mr. Bogen says. n This past November, the American Medical Association and its House of Delegates voted to \"work vigorously to stop implemen-tation of ICD-10.\" This was, in a way, one of the biggest shots in the battle over ICD-10 \u2014 a battle that has raged on for more than a decade. Now, almost exactly three months later into the wintery months of 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services has bowed, announcing it will delay the Oct. 1, 2013, compliance date for certain healthcare entities. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said HHS and CMS would go through a for - mal rulemaking process to re-establish a timeline for the implementation of ICD-10, although no new compliance dates have been provided as of February. However, this war over ICD-10 does not rest on ICD-10 alone. ICD-10's pre - requisite, Version 5010 electronic transaction standards, has also been a factor. One day after the AMA declared in November it would do everything in its power to stop ICD-10, CMS' Office of E-Health Standards and Services announced it would not initiate enforcement of Version 5010 for HIPAA-covered entities until March 31, 2012 \u2014 a delay of 90 days from the Jan. 1, 2012, target. The Medical Group Management Association-American Col-lege of Medical Practice Executives also recently said the current problems with the transition to Version 5010 could force physicians to close their practices and should be further delayed to June 30. In January and February, AMA took their efforts one step further. They sent letters to House Speaker John Boehner and Sec. Sebelius urging the ICD-10 initiative be halted. The AMA has argued the costs of ICD-10 will be onerous and crippling to physician practices, estimating it could cost physician practices from $83,290 to more than $2.7 million depending on the size of the practice. The AMA has not indicated a date of when ICD-10 should be mandated, but rather suggested HHS should call \"on appropriate stakeholders, including physicians, hospitals and payors, to as-sess an appropriate replacement for ICD-9 within a reasonable timeframe,\" according to AMA CEO James Madara, MD. However, not all healthcare groups have opposed the ICD-10 transition. The American Health Information Management Association, one of the main advocacy groups for HIM and the advancement of health informa-tion standards, urged the healthcare community to \"keep moving on the ICD-10 transition\" because a wait-and-see approach will force providers to inevitably miss the compliance date. The College of Healthcare Informa-tion Management Executives also wrote a letter to Sec. Sebelius, whose mailbox is seemingly overflowing these days. CHIME urged that HHS \"move quickly and decisively in setting a new compliance date\" and to keep physicians and hospitals on the same compliance date. The American Hospital Association's Central Office also believes the tran- sition to ICD-10 will be ultimately beneficial and will \"allow for precise di-agnosis and procedure codes, resulting in the improved capture of health-care information and more accurate reimbursement.\" Although AHA said it recognizes there are several overlapping health IT initiatives, its members still support the adoption of ICD-10. Paul Spencer, compliance officer for Fi-Med Management, says when he first became a certified coder in 1998, he was told ICD-10 would probably be coming in two years. Now, due to the temporary delay of ICD-10, that time will be coming more than 15 years after his certification. \"The reason it was delayed was related to lobbying dollars to make sure it never saw the light of day,\" Mr. Spencer says. \"Throwing lobbying dollars is not going to change this reality.\" This newest postponement of ICD-10 is the second such delay. Previously, ICD-10 was supposed to go live on Oct. 1, 2011, but after earlier resistance, HHS pushed back ICD-10 to the Oct. 1, 2013, \"go-live\" date. This recent delay also flies in the face of HHS and CMS, which repeatedly said there would be no more delays and no grace period. Although the AMA and other healthcare providers have won in the most recent ICD-10 battle, there are several hospitals and physician practices that have heavily invested millions of dollars into the system. While those groups are still well on track to be compliant with ICD-10, groups who lag behind will have some breathing room. But in the end, healthcare providers will all eventually have to convert to ICD-10, regardless of this most recent delay. The most important question left for hospitals and others is this: How will ICD-10 ultimately affect my productivity and bottom line, and is it worth waiting any longer? n The War Over ICD-10 By Bob Herman REGISTER T ODAY!

In a January 2011 survey, \"Emergency Department Staffing and Outsourcing Trends in U.S. Hospitals,\" Stax, Inc. conducted blind, in-depth interviews with close to 400 randomly selected hospital decision-makers nationwide, seeking to answer a number of questions about current trends in emergency department outsourcing: What are your perceptions of outsourcing in general, and do perceptions vary by hospital segment? What factors lead up to the decision to outsource? What triggers will drive a hospital to consider making a change in their Emergency Department model management setups? When selecting an outsourcing provider, under what circumstances might a hospital choose to forego an RFP and bidding process? How do hospital decision-makers select which Emergency Department management groups to include in their RFP and bidding process? Among hospitals that outsource their Emergency Department, how satisfied is hospital leadership with the current provider? How likely are they to recommend their provider to a colleague? Not surprisingly, quality and performance measures wer e top-of-mind considerations among those surveyed. Executives were clear on their reasons for change, the vendors they were most and least likely to consider changing, and the degree to which peer recommendations play a role (see chart on other side). According to the survey, direct referral from another hospital is the most frequently mentioned reason why hospitals include a particular vendor in their consideration sets. The top triggers for considering change turned out to be the following: 1. Inability to meet metrics. 2. Decline in quality of care provided by the current physician group. 3. Inability to recruit and retain quality physicians.

For instance, emergency physicians are likely to exert sharper focus on patients' immediate needs to ensure they are stable and comfortable. Emer - gency physicians are also accustomed to operating on working diagnoses as test results come back and the patient continues to undergo assessments. In the inpatient setting, hospital medicine pro - viders tend to think more in the long-term. They may focus more intensely on diagnoses and consequences of patient admissions. Detailed and specific patient data helps HM physicians determine the severity and volume of the care that will need to be delivered when the patient is admitted under their supervision.These subtle differences in priorities and con-centration may lead to communication break-downs that carry operational repercussions. For instance, HM physicians might ask the ED to order a certain type of imaging test. Though the ED will order the scan, it can later become am-biguous as to who will follow up on the results. This causes delays in care delivery that can even- tually harm patient satisfaction, hospital finance and patient safety. \"The ED and hospital medicine department usu - ally have a good relationship,\" says Dr. Gunder - sen. \"When things break down, it's often due to a lack of communication. This relationship is really a trio \u2014 it's the ED, HM and the hospital itself.\" Operational issues within the system \u2014 such as problems with testing services, the avail- ability of equipment or poor throughput \u2014 can trigger communication glitches between the two providers and affect numerous other aspects of hospital operations and business. The repercussions of poor communication Beginning in October 2013, hospital readmis-sions can pose a significant threat to hospitals' reimbursement. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Medicare will penalize hospitals if heart attack, heart failure or pneu-monia patients return frequently. High readmis-sion rates could cost hospitals up to 3 percent of their regular Medicare reimbursement by 2014. To avoid these potential setbacks, hospitals are implementing a range of strategies to strengthen patient handoffs and other transitions. One of the most proactive strategies is to tighten com-munication, hand-offs and collaboration be-tween emergency physicians and hospitalists. In a study 1 published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine , researchers analyzed the communica- tion patterns of emergency physicians and hos- pitalists during patient handoffs. Researchers found emergency physicians talked more than hospitalists during the handoffs. Discussions often centered on the patient's presentation, the professional environment and the patient's as-sessment. The interaction between emergency physicians and hospitalists did not qualify as a question-and-answer dialogue by most means, as the form of the conversation was prevalently in-formation-giving with very few questions asked. Faster, Better, Stronger: Reinforcing Ties Between Hospitalists and Emergency Medicine By Molly Gamble 8 Common Communication Failures in Patient Transfers The most commonly cited communication failures in emergency departments and in-ternal medicine patient transfers include 1: Inaccurate or incomplete information, especially of vital signs Cultural and professional conflicts Crowding High workload Difficult in accessing key information, such as vital signs, pending data, ED notes, ED orders and the identity of the responsible physician Non-linear patient flow ED boarding Ambiguous responsibility for patient sign-out or follow-up 1\"Dropping the Baton: A Qualitative Analysis of Failures During the Transition From Emergency Department to Inpatient Care,\" published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine , Volume 53, Issue 6, Pages 711-712. June 2009. TeamHealth enjoys a 98.2% client retention rate. In a January 2011 survey, \"Emergency Department Staffing and Outsourcing Trends in U.S. Hospitals,\" Stax, Inc. conducted blind, in-depth interviews with close to 400 randomly selected hospital decision-makers nationwide, seeking to answer a number of questions about current trends in emergency department outsourcing: What are your perceptions of outsourcing in general, and do perceptions vary by hospital segment? What factors lead up to the decision to outsource? What triggers will drive a hospital to consider making a change in their Emergency Department model management setups? When selecting an outsourcing provider, under what circumstances might a hospital choose to forego an RFP and bidding process? How do hospital decision-makers select which Emergency Department management groups to include in their RFP and bidding process? Among hospitals that outsource their Emergency Department, how satisfied is hospital leadership with the current provider? How likely are they to recommend their provider to a colleague? Not surprisingly, quality and performance measures were t op-of-mind considerations among those surveyed. Executives were clear on their reasons for change, the vendors they were most and least likely to consider changing, and the degree to which peer recommendations play a role (see chart on other side). According to the survey, direct referral from another hospital is the most frequently mentioned reason why hospitals include a particular vendor in their consideration sets. The top triggers for considering change turned out to be the following: 1. Inability to meet metrics. 2. Decline in quality of care provided by the current physician group. 3. Inability to recruit and retain quality physicians.

In the study, 40 of 264 provider respondents reported that a patient of theirs had experienced an adverse event or near miss after an ED to inpatient transfer. Reported incidents included errors in diagnosis, treatment or disposition resulting from commu- nication issues between the providers, such as in- accurate or incomplete information, cultural and professional conflicts, crowding and high work- load. Difficult access to patient information, boarding in the ED, confusion over responsi- bility for sign-out or follow-up and non-linear patient flow were also cited as factors. It doesn't take a full-on hospital crisis or grave error to put a patient's safety at risk \u2014 many of these cited incidents, such as high workload, are ordinary circumstances for physicians. Best practices to reduce siloed mentalities The following best practices can help hospitals strengthen the relationships and collaborative spirit between their emergency medicine and hospital medicine programs. Go to great lengths to build rap-port between providers \u2014 even outside of the hospital. Sometimes it's simply a matter of understanding other providers' perspectives and personalities. By encouraging regular and casual com-munication through joint meetings, so-cial outings, newsletters and email blasts, hospitals can strengthen a team spirit between emergency medicine and hos-pital medicine departments. \"The more emergency medicine understands how the hospital medicine department works, and vice versa, the better those two sys - tems will interact,\" says Dr. Gundersen. Further, joint metrics and incentives fos-ter common goals between the emergency medicine and hospital medicine depart - ments. The departments can work to overcome operational or communication hurdles that prevent them from reaching their shared performance goal. Once that metric or goal has been met, Mr. Rogers recommends hospitals jointly celebrate and reward the departments' success as a team. These shared incentives can rein-force a culture of cooperation, collabora - tion and engagement in both the ED and HM departments. Implement daily interdisciplin - ary rounds. \"A good hospital medi - cine program has daily interdisciplinary rounds as a cornerstone of their operat-ing model,\" says Mr. Rogers. \"Expand the group to include ED providers and nurs-ing staff on occasion. This will educate them about downstream problems their actions might create.\" If problems are identified, EM and HM leaders can meet to develop improvement action plans. Rounds are one strategy to help avoid problems linked to hospital flow. Wait times and boarding are especially crucial to ED operations given the links between wait time, patient satisfaction and hospital finances. \"It's really important that we fo-cus on communication,\" says Dr. Gunder - sen. \"That way, people will have a more seamless experience. They won't come into the ED as patients and face long wait times or providers resisting one another from different departments.\" Emphasize shared decision-mak-ing. Under TeamHealth's management model, EM and HM leaders develop and standardize order sets for patient transfers. These shared expectations among ED and HM physicians help expedite patient care and also increase cost-efficiency by coor - dinating orders and tests. \"In today's envi-ronment, observation and clinical decision units are a must-have,\" says Mr. Rogers. \"These can either further evaluate new conditions or manage acute episodes of chronic disease that can be effectively sta - bilized in short-stay environments. These units involve both hospital medicine and ED providers in the development of pro - tocols and management.\" n Footnotes: 1 Exploring Emergency Physician-Hospital - ist Handoff Interactions: Development of the Handoff Communication Assessment.

TeamHealth is one of the largest suppliers of outsourced healthcare professional staffing and administrative services to hospitals and other healthcare groups in the United States. Founded by emergency physicians in 1979, TeamHealth remains a physician-led, patient-focused organization committed to strengthening hospitals, supporting physicians and improving healthcare through high-quality man-agement, staffing and support services. TeamHealth's more than 5,600 affiliated healthcare professionals provide emergency medi-cine, hospital medicine, anesthesia and pediatric staffing and management services to more than 540 civilian and military hospitals, clinics, and physician groups in 45 states.3 Things to Know About ED-to- Hospital Handoffs Emergency physicians talk more during handoffs. Emergency physicians are re-sponsible for 68 percent of the dialogue, whereas hospitalists speak 32 percent of utterances. Most conversation content focuses on patient presentation (43 percent), pro - fessional environment (36 percent) and assessment (20 percent). More than 90 percent of the dialogue consists of information-giving, includ- ing descriptions, explanations and ratio- nale. Questions account for less than 10 percent of handoff conversations.

We have divided the article into three key sections. The first focuses on hospital and physician issues. Second, a brief observation on urgent care and sleep labs. Third, a brief discus - sion of key business issues, focusing largely on a new book by Jim Collins. I. ACOs, Hospitals, Physicians and Physician-Hospital Relationships 1. Pioneer ACOs. The Pioneer ACO Model is a CMS Innovation Center initiative designed to support organizations with experience operating as accountable care organizations or in similar arrangements. The Pioneer ACO model will test the impact of different payment arrangements in helping these organizations achieve quality and cost goals. After a weak start, 32 provider orga-nizations ultimately enlisted in the Pioneer ACO Project. Many of the ACO participants are very prestigious systems, such as Allina Hospitals and Clinics, Beth Israel Deaconess Physician, and the University of Michigan Health System. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services made a wise decision by making the process of testing the ACO model more man-ageable for health systems. An article entitled \"Pioneer ACOs: Promise and Potential Pitfalls,\" posted by Steven Lieberman on Dec. 29, 2011, in Health Affairs Blog states: \"The 32 Pioneer ACOs selected by CMS will operate in 18 states for up to 5-year periods. Hospitals are key players in 22 (69 percent) of the Pioneer ACOs, with 16 integrated delivery (or healthcare) systems, 4 hospitals-physician partnerships, and 2 individual practice associations (IPAs) named for hos-pitals where the physicians have affiliations (or employment). The remaining 10 Pioneer ACOs (31 percent) are predominately IPAs, with one identified as an alliance of 5 multi-specialty medical groups. (The Leavitt Part - ners survey reported hospitals sponsored 99 (60 percent) of ACOs, with 38 (24 percent) sponsored by IPAs, and 27 (16 percent) sponsored by insurers, a category not rel-evant for Medicare ACOs.) In addition to urban entities, the selected Pioneer sites in-clude ACOs that serve rural areas.\" Time will tell whether the ACO will endure as a significant part of the healthcare landscape. 2. Exclusive relationships between hospitals and payors. Recently, hospitals and health systems with great market positions are looking again at exclusive relationships with payors. This again threatens to become a sub- stantial issue for independent surgery centers, physician practices and competing hospitals. One of the earliest exclusive agreements was struck between Boston-based PartnersHealth - care and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachu- setts in 2000. BCBS gave Partners increased re- imbursements in exchange for Partners' promise to seek similar pay increases from Blue Cross competitors. Since 2000, Partners has received a 75 percent increase in payments from Blue Cross, but health insurance premiums have also risen by 78 percent since that agreement. There is some evidence that the government is monitoring the anticompetitive effects of such behavior. For instance, in February 2011, the Department of Justice took an aggressive stance against a health system under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act in United States v. United Regional Health Care System (No. 7:11-cv-00030-O (N.D. Tex., Feb. 25, 2011) . In United Regional Health Care System, the DOJ alleged that United Regional Health Care System possessed monop - oly power in the sale of both inpatient hospital services and outpatient surgical services to com-mercial health insurers. 3. Community hospital sales and con- solidation. Given the changing healthcare environment, we are seeing frightened looks on the faces of the boards of community hospitals. This has led to an unprecedented willingness to engage in potential sales of hospitals to national chains or larger systems. On the flip side, buy - ers may often obtain substantial market benefits from consolidation (see, e.g., \"Hospital Monop - olies: The Biggest Driver of Health Costs That Nobody Talks About,\" Forbes, by Avik Roy, Aug. 22, 2011; \"Hospital Merger Mania on the Rise Across the U.S.,\" Next Hospital, by Katherine Rourke, April 30, 2011). The occurrence of hos-pital mergers and acquisitions increased by 33 percent in 2010 compared with 2009. The dollar volume of transactions also increased substan - tially in 2011. 4. Physician independence. Notwith - standing the talk of physician practice acquisi - tions and physician integration with hospitals, we are hearing from several large independent physician practice groups that they have re-mained very busy despite the fact that systems they once worked with are acquiring competing practices. In orthopedics, for example, it is com-monly discussed that almost 12.5 percent of the healthcare budget is spent on orthopedics in to- tal. This means that many systems must have a large orthopedic presence and compete aggres- sively to employ orthopedic surgeons. Despite the hospital pressure to accept employment, the independent orthopedists seem to be weathering the changes fairly well. A 2011 survey conducted by PricewaterhouseC - oopers found 56 percent of physicians want to more closely align with a hospital in order to increase their income, yet 20 percent of physi - cians surveyed said they don't trust hospitals and another 57 percent \"sometimes\" trust hospitals. 5. Professional services agreement. Once again, a number of systems have been considering professional services agreements with physicians and physician groups. Such ar - rangements are a middle ground between the ac- quisition of a physician practice and subsequent employment of its physicians, and other kinds of relationships between health systems and physicians. As such, professional services agree - ments are growing in popularity as an option for increasing integration with a number of special - ties, while enabling the physicians to maintain private practice. In the article, \"When PSAs Are the Right Choice ,\" (Health Leader Media, July 13, 2010) author Karen Minich-Pourshadi writes: \"Physician compensation expert Max Reiboldt, president and CEO for The Coker Group, an Alpharetta, GA-based healthcare management consulting firm, refers to these PSA arrangements as 'employment lite'\u2014and he says they can offer a good opportunity for both hospitals and physicians. Unlike tradi- tional service agreements, in which a person is hired for a specific function or for limited service, PSAs allow the facility to work with the doctors, allowing them to keep their inde - pendence while the hospital can build in qual-ity measures to help create greater alignment for the physician with the hospital's goal.\" \"A PSA takes the shape and look of employ - ment, but the physician or practice retains its independence, and if the deal doesn't go well, then the doctor can go back to private practice,\" he says. In a professional services agreement model, a health system will typically purchase a substan - tial amount overall of a physician's time but will not acquire the physician's practice. We will see whether or not this becomes a sizable part of the physician-hospital universe or, whether in-11 Evolving Issues in Healthcare and Business By Scott Becker, JD, CPA, Drew McCormick, JD, Allison Harms, JD, and Samuel Bernstein, JD, McGuireWoods 53 REGISTER TODAY! Becker's Review Annual Meeting - May 17-18, 2012; Chicago; www.regonline.com/beckershospitalreviewannualmeeting_1041813 stead the popularity of the professional services agreement model is merely a stop gap measure for certain systems. The challenge with the physician services agreement model is that it is much more difficult to fit payments to physi - cians within various Antikickback safe harbors and antitrust safety zones than in the practice acquisition and subsequent employment model. 6. Opting out of Medicare. Notwithstand - ing the difficult economy, we are hearing from more and more physicians that they have decided to opt out of Medicare. This is occurring more frequently in certain specialties in which physi - cians are not overly reliant on Medicare busi-ness or hospital referrals. For instance, of the 93 internists affiliated with NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, only 37 accept Medicare, according to the hospital's website. Further, we typically see the decision to opt out of Medicare with physicians who have built tremendous brands and franchises and who can afford to not take Medicare patients. Interestingly, despite opting out of Medicare, many of these physicians nev - ertheless continue to see Medicare patients on either a pro bono basis or through other means (see, for example, \"Doctors are Opting Out of Medicare,\" by New York Times, by Julie Connaly, April 1, 2009). 7. Privileges and disputes. We have ob- served an increase in the number of privilege and peer review disputes involving physicians and hospitals. We are not exactly sure what is driving increased clinical reviews. However, an article was published in 2011 on the concept that the Health Care Quality Improvement Act has resulted in abuses of the peer review system through the courts. The article, entitled \"How Courts are Pro-tecting Unjustified Peer Review Actions Against Physicians by Hospitals,\" ( The Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, by Nicholas Kadar, Volume 16, Number 1, Spring 2011) states: \"Nevertheless, the courts have disregarded the legislative history of HCQIA in the [House Committee on the Judiciary], and have interpreted and applied HCQIA in a way that protects unjustified peer review ac-tions against physicians by hospitals against Congress's expressly stated contrary intent.\" As a result, according to Kadar, the courts im-properly review motions for summary judgment based on HCQIA immunity and improperly dis-miss cases on summary judgment before a physi - cian has an opportunity to present the merits of his or her case. II. Urgent Care and Sleep Labs. 1. Urgent care. The number of urgent care sites is growing tremendously. For instance, the number of facilities has now grown to 9,200, including approximately 600 new facilities this year. The development in the urgent care arena includes traditional urgent care clinics as well as clinics inside retailers such as Wal-Mart, Wal-greens and CVS. The growth in urgent care sites has occurred in response to a direct consumer de - sire to be able to see physicians at the consumer's convenience (see, e.g., \"Health Law May Acceler - ate Growth in Urgent Care Centers,\" Kaiser Health News, by Phil Galewitz, Dec. 7, 2011). Interest - ingly enough, in response to the increase in urgent care, many large practices and systems have sub-stantially improved their own customer care and their speed at which they are able to see patients. 2. Sleep labs. We continue to see the evolution of sleep labs and sleep lab relationships. Various structures for sleep labs include independent di- agnostic testing facilities, extensions of a physi- cian's practice, hospital-based sleep labs, hospital- owned freestanding sleep labs and joint ventures, to name a few. We often query the method by which sleep labs are structured. As of late 2010, there were about 2,100 accredited sleep labs with an approximate growth of 10 percent per year. III. Great Business Issues. 1. Great leaders. We continue to be cogni-zant of the import of great (and poor) leader - ship on organizations. In health systems as well as in great companies and charitable founda- tions, there seems to be nothing more important than strong leadership that is truly concerned about the organization (see, e.g, \"4 Great CEOs and 1 Who Missed the Boat,\" Motley-Fool, by Molly McCluskey, Nov. 11, 2011). In the article, \"The Best Performing CEOs in the World,\" (Harvard Business Review, January 2010) au-thors by Morten T. Hansen, Herminia Ibarra and Urs Peyer write: \"Our data highlights the great extent to which CEOs account for variations in company performance beyond those due to in-dustry, country and economic swings.\" As we read articles about the overpayment or compensation to leadership we come away with the conclusion that it is not so much that great leaders are overpaid, it is rather all the other CEOs are not worth what they are paid. In es - sence, it is hard to place a value on a great CEO but many organizations that do not have great CEOs have been paying as though they do. REGISTER T ODAY!

Great Business Book \u2014 \"Great by Choice.\" In reading the most recent book by Jim Collins, \"Great by Choice,\" we continue to believe that he has more clarity on what it takes to be a great organization than almost anybody else. His core philosophy is the concept that putting great people in place (i.e., the \"who\" issue) remains the most important issue in creating successful organizations. We agree strongly with this sentiment. Collins also has several other insightful concepts in the book. For example, he speaks of testing concepts (bullets vs. cannonballs), consistent discipline and a core set of business concepts or a blueprint to guide the organization. On testing, Collins states: \"Amgen's early days illustrate a key pattern we observed in this study: fire bullets, then fire cannonballs. First, you fire bullets to figure out what'll work. Then once you have empirical confidence based on the bullets, you concentrate your resources and fire a cannonball. After the cannonball hits, you keep 20 Mile Marching to make the most of your big success.\" On people, he notes: \"Microsoft used extreme standards to select the right people for Microsoft, with Gate's summing up in 1992, 'Take away our 20 best people and I tell you that Microsoft would become an unimportant company.' Biomet paid fastidious attention to getting the right people in every seat, using stock options at all levels to attract and retain the best talent. All the 10X companies cultivate cult-like cultures wherein the right people would flourish and equally, where the wrong people would quickly self-eject. The 10X study is predicated on the premise of unending uncertainty, which increases the importance of First Who; if you cannot predict what's going to happen, you need people on the bus who can respond and adapt successfully to whatever unforeseen events might hit.\" Finally, on the concept of constant performance he spoke of the consis - tent achievement of goals rather than sporadic phenomenal growth: \"John Brown understood that if you want to achieve consistent per - formance, you need both parts of a 20 Mile March: a lower bound and an upper bound, a hurdle that you jump over and a ceiling that you will not rise above, the ambition to achieve and the self-control to hold back. The 20 Mile March is more than a philosophy. It's about hav- ing concrete, clear, intelligence, and rigorously pursued performance mechanisms that keep you on track. The 20 Mile March creates two types of self-imposed discomfort: (1) the discomfort of unwavering commitment to high performance in difficult conditions, and (2) the discomfort of holding back in good conditions.\" n Hospital & Health System Transactions55 REGISTER TODAY!
