Learn how mindfulness practices can improve well-being and performance. An integrative and holistic approach to health is becoming increasingly common in modern medicine as we understand how powerful the mind-body connection really is. Often, psychological issues affect us physically and vice versa. Acknowledging that the ways in which working on our mental state can improve our physical health is one of the most effective ways to promote longevity and overall vitality. Stress-relieving activities such as meditation are a way we can simultaneously address both our psychological and physical well-being. Stress is known to increase levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, which in large, constant amounts can release inflammatory chemicals, cytokines. Cytokines, when released too often, lead to symptoms such as depression, anxiety, increased blood pressure, fatigue, insomnia, and namely, chronic inflammation. 50% of deaths annually are due to inflammatory conditions. With 75% of Americans experiencing physical and/or emotional symptoms of stress daily, relaxation techniques are needed now more than ever. Meditation is one of the most effective stress-relieving activities as it is linked to numerous health benefits: Because stress often manifests physically as inflammation, it can also contribute to chronic pain as is the case with rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain, muscle pain, and more. Although inflammation is part of the immune response to address such issues, too much inflammation can do more harm than good and contribute to the pain being experienced. The research behind meditation alleviating symptoms of stress is well-supported. In one eight-week study, mindfulness meditation was linked to reduced inflammation, symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, and other chronic conditions. As stress and inflammation can strain and weaken the immune system, they can increase susceptibility to illness. Meditation can help relieve the inflammatory strain on the immune system, improving the body's ability to fight pathogens and potential infections. In fact, there is a growing body of scientific research suggesting that meditation may help with cancer, asthma, frequent colds, and more. A meta-analysis of approximately 1,300 people concluded that meditation can help decrease anxiety and promote mental stability. This analysis noted that meditation was particularly beneficial for those with high anxiety or generalized anxiety disorder. Meditation is also known to combat depression symptoms. One publication reviewed treatments given to over 3,500 adults and found that meditation was effective in improving depression symptoms. Studies also show that regular meditation leads to a decrease in negative thoughts and improved emotional stability. This is likely because chronic inflammation and the release of cytokines are linked to depression. By combatting stress and its subsequent reactions in the body, we can alleviate other issues such as depression and anxiety. Meditation is often compared to \"weightlifting\" for your brain and attention span as it is very effective in increasing the strength and endurance of your focus. This benefit is almost immediate as studies show that people who simply listen to a meditation tape while completing a task improved attention and accuracy when compared to the control group. Moreover, regularly practicing meditation is linked to reversing patterns in the brain that contribute to mind-wandering, worrying, and poor attention. Research shows that nearly half the population will struggle with insomnia at some point in their lifetime. Meditation has been linked to sleep longer and deeper sleep for those struggling with insomnia when compared to those struggling with an unmedicated sleep condition. Experts hypothesize that this is because meditation helps the brain control and redirect thoughts that often \"runaway\" and lead to insomnia. Moreover, meditation gives you regular practice in relaxing your body, releasing tension, and entering a peaceful state, similar to getting ready to go to sleep. High blood pressure is often linked to stress and over time, high blood pressure can strain the heart and contribute to the narrowing of arteries, which can, in turn, lead to a heart attack or stroke. Meditation is proven to help reduce blood pressure, especially in older individuals who are already suffering from high blood pressure. Experts believe this is in part due to the fact that meditation may help control blood pressure by relaxing nerve signals that coordinate heart function and blood vessel tension. Meditation can feel like an overwhelming journey to start alone, it can be intimidating to approach the concept of controlling and strengthening your own mind.
