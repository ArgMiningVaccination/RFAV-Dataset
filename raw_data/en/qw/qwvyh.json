Here's what WCH members, staff, and coalition partners are saying about Mr. Gerlach's presentation: \"Thank you very much Joachim, this sounds very promising.\" -Tess Lawrie \"Quite remarkable how the extraordinary work by Vedicinals to identify the optimal actives then demonstrate clinical effectiveness mirrors what some of the leading Ayurvedic and TCM practitioners have found with respect to herbal ingredients - including Scuttelaria (pipeline), green tea (EGCG)! It is amazing just how effective natural products have been when compared with new-to-nature patented drugs!\" - Rob Verkerk \"Thank you Dr. Joachim for providing this wonderful information and having an alternative medicine available.\" -Interest Of Justice \"Fabulous presentation. A reinforcement for everyone to NOT drop their nutraceutical protocols.\" -Jennifer Hibberd \"Thank Dr. Naseeba Kathrada: Um, with that we are going to move to our next speaker for this evening. And that is Joachim Gerlach. I hope I got it right. Um, he's a German entrepreneur, a co-founder and head of the R&D Vedcinals India private limited research, development and production of novel therapeutics for infectious diseases, as well as environmentally caused chronic illnesses. [00:01:00] Today, he's going to present for us a very comprehensive COVID treated treatment protocol, covering conditions from early onset of SARS, CoV-2 infection, all the way to management phase and a hypersensitivity. And he's going to talk about long COVID and illnesses. Um, and with that, I'm going to hand it over. [00:01:23] I'm going to hand over to Joachim!. [00:01:27] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: Yes. Good evening. Can you hear me? Well, yes, we can. Okay. So thank you for having me on this panel and to be able to present what we've done. Uh, maybe first to [introduce] ourselves, uh, the Vedicinals India was, is a company that was founded, especially for the purpose, um, during COVID at the beginning of this, of this pandemic to give it the necessary framework before we were more like a loose group of, uh, informal group of scientists globally working amongst others, Dr Seneff and other scientists that were investigating chronic diseases that are caused by pesticides or any other environmental influences. [00:02:11] And so they provided us with the insight of what the mechanisms of damage are and our job was, or my job was to coordinate other scientists to see what kind of solutions can be found. Um, So the distance came to life in a, in, in early 2020. And we have been working practically without any break four with 25 teams for almost two years in meta analysis, AI supported research, preclinical trials, toxicity, trials, formulation development, pharmacokinetics, um, computational analysis and modeling clinical trials and all necessary compliance and quality control up to manufacturing and logistics. [00:02:53] Um, the resulting product is classified as a nutraceutical. And within India, we are also classified as a FSMP, which has kind of a therapeutic, um, suspension. And so that doctors can use it and prescribe it. Um, we started on January 24th, 2020, and we kind of had all hands on decks and, um, to work on this, uh, therapeutic solution for this newly arising illness. After obtaining the genome, genomic sequence from, uh, from China, uh, we could start to identify the so-called cold spots or at least mutated parts of the virus and compare them with previous coronaviruses on which there was already a lot of research on efficient inhibitors documented. [00:03:41] Uh, in the meantime, in the coming weeks, after that, we got more and more information about the true nature and the many angles of this disease. And then we were able to define more mechanisms that needed to be covered that are behind this multisystemic condition. So our experts developed a selection matrix, um, by which we could start to select the, the necessary molecules that we wanted to use to address these different conditions. [00:04:14] Next slide please. So that's there really thank you. That's fine. So out of sorry, out of, out of more than 8,000 available molecules, we finally were able to select the nine most potent comprehensive and synergistically working molecules with the very high safety profile. [00:04:34] Um, another requirement thinking about all the medical practitioners was to be able to cover the disease over all stages from onset now all the way to long COVID conditions while being able to start the supplementation at any given phase of disease progression because you can choose when you see the patient. [00:04:54] And so we thought that would be a good thing to have as a requirement. [00:04:59] Um, as most of the COVID related damages are caused by a disbalance and exploration of the host, um, reactions we knew from our previous experience with working with natural, um, highly concentrated phenolic compounds, that they are very good at rebalancing this and helping the body to, so to speak, to come back into a balanced homeostasis. [00:05:25] So natural molecules have another phenomenon, if the bioavailability is sufficiently enhanced, they work so to speak on demand and go into the regions of the body or organism where they are needed. [00:05:38] So let's go to the following chart and I will give you our understanding, um, that our collaborators and us have no more or less, um, concluded on the different on the nature of this disease, because there is still a lot of things missing. [00:05:56] So this chart looks a little bit complicated. But if you see that, if you see the boxes phase 1, 2, 3, 4, these are the stages, and, um, we have to thank Dr. Shankara Chetty for also, um, highlighting, uh, and adding one box in there. So if we look at the first upper left corner, the viral phase, you can see that many practitioners don't really take that as serious as they should, because it can even with a asymptomatic or very mild disease, it can persist in the body for a very long time and cause further problems and even lead to chronic illnesses or long COVID without giving you a severe disease condition. And from the viral phase, it can also trigger independently the hypersensitivity, hyper inflammation or hypercoagulation phase. So it is quite complex. So, um, antiviral is for sure, very much needed in this disease. [00:07:03] And in phase two, what we have highlighted there is the hypersensitivity. That is something that is, um, that needs to be emphasized more to the medical community, because it has been shown by, uh, especially Dr. Chetty and others that. Possible to, um, especially when it appears on the eighth day, it's possible to, to kind of rescue, um, patients that are turning severe and having a huge drop in their oxygen. [00:07:31] And from there on, we go into the hyper inflammation phase and hypercoagulation phase, which is pretty well known about among medical practitioners and they can handle it very well. But on the right side, you see the phase five and six. And that also is something that we feel is underrepresented in the efforts to treat this, uh, um, this disease. [00:07:54] So that is, uh, the manifesting organ damage and immunological dysfunction, which can arise at any kind of arrow that you see there. So even just the viral ongoing persistence can lead to organ damage in the long run and the same for as counts for hypersensitivity or hyper inflammation. Can we go to the next slide please, Zoe? [00:08:19] So the takeaway of this experience of the last two years is that what I just said, that the phases one and two, the viral phase and the hypersensitivity phase, as well as the organ damage phase are, in my opinion, not sufficiently covered. And they want to thank not only Dr. Shetty, but also Dr. Tina Peers for their invaluable contribution to understand this ongoing, um, chronic illnesses, especially related to hypersensitivity and muscle activation, to which we come later. [00:08:50] Can we have the next slide please? So this is the protocol that we have developed, and some of it is our own, let's say our own product is this, this suspension here containing nine molecules, which by now have been, uh, globally confirmed by many, many scientists as each one of them being very potent by themselves against any COVID condition. [00:09:14] And we managed to get them all into one suspension and a very, um, balanced dosages. And so I'll get to that a little later. And then we have, of course, an additional recommendation of vitamin C, vitamin C, D3 and zinc, which I think now is clear to everybody, but there's another angle here where you see their monolaurin and lysine, um, which we added as a good measure because we see, we also come to that later, Epstein BARR virus activation very, very strong happening in two thirds of all COVID cases. Be it acute or long COVID. And on the bottom you see a special probiotic. We took one example of a probiotic that will not cause any histamine release. That is good because histamine does play a big role in COVID. [00:10:05] And so that is a recommendation that has developed here to this stage. It is changing sometimes according to virons and according to different findings we do in the meantime. Next slide please. So here we go, we come now to phase one viral replication. That is for, for, for non-scientists now a little bit dry, uh, but we can claim that in the clinical trial phase clinic phase two trials that we did in India, where we were co-administered and control group, where having medication like ivermectin, in hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir. [00:10:41] And, um, corticosteroids, antibiotics, you just name it. India has a pretty good treatment protocol anyhow. And so when they add Vedicinals, you can see on the left, that is the antiviral potency measured by the of the PCR tests. So we could elevate the cycle threshold value by 1.75 per day. [00:11:04] I think that is global benchmark in antiviral, potency against coronavirus SARs-CoV-2.. Can we go to the next slide here? You see now the structure that is the matrix I was talking about before. So you see on the left, all the required, um, let's say targets in the organism or on the virus and on the right you see the molecules. [00:11:27] And wherever you see a star, that means there is a sufficient evidence to say that this molecule will do this. Um, you can see on, on the top of this is the top left is the virus structure, protease inhibitors. This is the moving targets. We call them that is the backbone of the virus we are targeting with these molecules, especially the three CLI protease. [00:11:50] We do it also on the spike protein at the RBD. Uh, we are constantly doing computational analysis, uh, has been about around 500 right now, the single studies that we did ourselves to keep track of the different mutations and see how well these molecules are still, excuse me on target. Then the second part on the lower part, you see that something that is completely unrelated to the mutations in the first place. [00:12:17] And that is blocking the host cell receptors. Everybody knows about ACE-2, but we are blocking around eight more so we can see now with ominicron, for example, Uh, ominicron is having other docking features, that means it can bind to other hosts receptors. And if you look at the APN, the second one that is very, exactly some of the Omicron,, um, proteins will bind. [00:12:41] Can we go to the next slide? Then another angle on antiviral activity is that you can bring down the host and the host enzymes, which are, which are needed by the, by the virus for fusion and for cell fusion. So that is the upper part. You can see there from TMPRSS -2 , et cetera. These are all enzymes that can be downregulated in our body and which are usually upregulated in chronic disease like diabetes and other arthritis. [00:13:12] Then these are up. So the, the most remarkable one is the third from above, which is Furin. The, the main gain of function for SARS-CoV-2 was the foreign cleavage site. And we found that very early on, like already by beginning of March, 2020. And then we started to look for the most potent plant-based Furin inhibitor that is known, and we included those and several others, because if you inhibit furin, then no matter where this thing goes in, in its variety, it will, um, it will be at least the infant and slow down. [00:13:48] And then on the bottom you find the intracellular replication antagonist, which means, um, if you look at Zinc ionophores, that's what hydroxychloroquine does. That's one of the, um, let's say mechanisms, how hydroxychloroquine works. So it, it, it brings in ionophores into the cell and by that is slowing virus replicaiton, um, Sorry, you have to. [00:14:13] Yeah. And by that you're slowing down the virus replication. So let's come to the next point from after antiviral. That's the phase two hypersensitivity part. Um, in hypersensitivity that's allergy type one, you can see a strong elevation in histamines, in the serum level and mass cell activation. And so we included here the two best known and most potent plant derived mass cell activation inhibitors. [00:14:41] One is quercetin and the other one is luteolin. And then the quercetin by itself is even stronger than cromolyn in blocking mass cell activation. So the mass cells cells are kind of like petrol bombs in a, in a forest. And when the fire hits, then they will work like a fire accelerator. That's what's happening in severe COVID and that's what happening in long COVID four over a very prolonged time. [00:15:05] Can we go to the next slide please? And here we have the previously mentioned Epstein Barr virus activation. So it has two different angles. Epstein Barr virus is in present in almost all humans. If you have an infection with SARs-CoV-2, that activates Epstein Barr and Epstein Barr will then, um, enhance the expression of ACE-2, which is the receptor for the SARs-CoV-2 coronavirus to, to dock on yourselves. [00:15:35] So they are kind of partners in crime and them in, in long COVID, uh, the same happens there. You have 66%, uh, documented Epstein-Barr virus activation in, uh, in long in the long haul. So it's in both stages, a very prevalent thing that needs to be addressed. Next page, please. Next slide please. Okay. You become now to the phase of hyper inflammation. [00:16:01] We can see now these are the results from our clinical trials. Oh, you're looking at interleukin six, C-reactive protein, ferritin and TNF alpha, which is from an animal trial. And you can see that, uh, in the, in the treatment groups there was, it was very, um, very well suppressed. You don't see any elevation, it's all going in the right direction. [00:16:23] You can see that day zero day, five day 12 and day 45. To my knowledge, we were the first company trying to, or that did a 45 day monitoring. We're taking 50 biomarkers after 45 days to see how well can we prevent long COVID or chronic COVID developments. And they use, that's always the fourth virys that you see there. [00:16:47] So we could keep interleukin six and all the other cytokines pretty well at bay. And there was no severity developing. Can we go to the next slide, please? Um, this slide, you see all the pathways and these different molecules, how they work on different angles of a hyper inflammation and how they bring down various cytokines or bring up nerve two, which is a master switch for many, many other pathways that are downstream. [00:17:15] And then you have another enzyme is called SPLA2, uh,, which is a so-called snake venom, uh, mechanism, which will cause, um, inflammation in the cardiovascular system. Can we go to the next slide please? Now we come to the next phase, which is hypercoagulation and thrombosis. Uh, also that be monitored well in our clinical trial setting. [00:17:40] And as you can see the D-Dimers. Uh, from day zero to day 12 and day 45 are constantly decreasing. So it shows that we could very well keep that update. And that is the only point where we say it is, uh, there should be some caution in mixing, uh, Vedicinals or our suspension with other blood centers, because it might be too much if you add now other bloods to the equation, let's go to the next slide where we see the different pathways that we can, um, uh, we can address here. [00:18:14] Uh, the, the second from the bottom is a very interesting pathway because that is also not very well documented was just, uh, Kind of, um, proven by a German Institute, the Max Planck Institute, they had a machine where they could see that the red blood cell plasticity and deformability was impaired. That means that the red blood cells were stiffening. [00:18:36] And so they cannot pass through the smaller vessels anymore. And that is a, for many weeks or even months within COVID happening. So some of our molecules are able to restore this plasticity and make sure that they can now cross again into this capillary vessels. Next slide, please, Zoe. Now we come to the really important point of organ damage. [00:19:00] How can you prevent organ damage or even restored organ function, which you see here as the clinical trial results of abnormal lung x-ray findings. And to our big surprise, we had a, uh, over 90% of our, of our group, uh, of our treatment group. Um, Having abnormal lung x-ray findings. And after 12 days, we could reduce that by 75%. [00:19:26] And after 45 days, it was almost all gone, ground glass opacity, as well as other lung problems. So that is very good thing to see that it's not only stopping the disease progression, but that we can bring back some kind of restoring effect to the lung tissue and other organ tissues. Next slide please. [00:19:49] Here we have another slide. That was an animal trial. We did that before we went into the, um, phase two human clinical trials. And during that time we did studies on mainly, um, toxicity like acute toxicity long-term toxicity. Calibration of the molecules, the suspension formulation development, that was a difficult process. [00:20:13] And then we wanted to also see about bioavailability because that is one of the biggest obstacles in using natural molecules. So what we did in this study, we induce artificially myocarditis and in rats, and then co-administered our medication in, in, in, uh, in the control group or in the treatment group. [00:20:34] But we also tried two different versions of a Vedicinals 9. And just to prove, and to see how well we could now bring up the bioavailability. And now you can see that there on the upper picture, that is the heart tissue after, uh, after the trial that was untreated and on the lower picture, you can see the bio enhanced version of Vedicinals 9, and it's pretty clear that the damage, uh, Which is very similar and normally that can be caused also by myocarditus. You can see that there is a very strong effect of protecting the heart muscle and heart tissues, myocardial tissues from damage. Next slide please. So this is CPK, um, that is another marker for muscle damage in the, in the body. And also that you can see as has been brought down tremendously, uh, during the clinical trials. [00:21:28] Next slide, please. These are the different, um, let's say requirements we had in our selection process on organ protection, organ regeneration, and, um, to prevention of organ damage. And you can see that there is a lot of, um, different not only lung and heart tissues that are being protected. It's the whole cardiovascular system by itself. [00:21:55] Uh, the kidneys, the liver, the beta cells of the pancreas, and also intestinal inflammation, because we can see that SARS-CoV-2 also, depending on the strain of the virus can give a lot of, uh, problems in the intestines. And, uh, also the gut bacteria gets like, uh, attacked by the virus. And so that can all be dampened and help by the Vedicinal 9 molecules. [00:22:27] So last, last week you had a good friend of mine, um, presenting at your, uh, at your panel. And that was, uh, about neurodegenerative diseases. And, um, I've been working with Dr. Seneff for many years now and she pointed out rightfully, uh, how, how prevalent the problem of neurological damage and disease in COVID can be. [00:22:52] And so today I want to also shine a light on what we can do in this respect. Um, the SARS-CoV-2 protein can interact directly with, uh, amyloid proteins and also cross prion disease as we have heard from Dr Seneff. So let's go to the next slide and it can bring you through the different pathways. So these are all the neuroprotective or cytoprotective pathways we are looking at in, in that sense and from like a number 75 to number 80, you see all the pathways that are directly related to prime formation, bringing down alpha synuclien, uh, stopping filopodia adhesion and bringing down Tau protein and amyloid aggregation. [00:23:43] I think that there's very strong evidence that we can be of help here to protect the neuronal tissues and the brain. And other thing is that the molecules have been proven in the past in many other trial settings that they can restore the blood brain barrier integrity, which is also very important. We will see that in the next slides that's coming. [00:24:07] In between I just want to highlight also that there is a lot of metabolic disorders happening. And so these molecules have been used using in different diabetes, uh, two settings and other clinical trials autophagy, uh, to see how well they work. And they showed very good performance in this to kind of rebalance and restore metabolism and metabolic systems. [00:24:34] Another really important pathway is the immune immunomodulation pathways. Um, it can be observed more and more that, uh, COVID is leading to some kind of immune deficiency. Be it short term, we saw that in India with all the black fungus cases and we ourselves have some patients in Pune that were deteriorating and dying. [00:24:57] Um, even though there, they were not having COVID anymore, it was like an immune deficiency that played out like six to eight weeks after. And so to keep the immune system protected from, um, from damage and from disbalance is also very important. And so I hope that this shows that it is possible to do something in the right direction here, and that is not bad for an oh, please go back. [00:25:24] Just one more thing. I want to just point out quickly on the bottom, you find the CCR5 and Fraktalkine antagonists. Uh, which, um, now next slide, which have been, which have been highlighted and we want to thank also Dr. Bruce Patterson for, um, for pointing that out. And, uh, so it is possible with some of our molecules to do some good in this direction because the, um, the monocytes activation in, especially long COVID, um, it is prevalent in many cases. [00:25:55] And so it needs to be addressed. Can we go to the next slide slide please? [00:26:02] So also I want to thank Dr. Phillip McMillan. He took a lot of time to explain me and my partner Prakash on what he thinks of, uh, uh, COVID conditions and auto-immunity, and I have to say that he has definitely has a point. And so I want to just also shine the light on that, that needs to be. So I think, uh, yeah, we are getting out to the end. [00:26:27] Um, and I wanted to explain one thing before I want to call in Dr. Shankara Chetty for a moment and that's about, uh, that's some very interesting information that inside of Omicron, um, the global consensus at this moment is that Omicron is not severe and not leading to, um, increased hospitalizations. [00:26:48] And, um, let's say the usual, um, Cases in the ICU with respiratory problems. But when we looked at the Omicron construct of Omicron, um, what kind of struck me immediately was that the Furin cleavage site was quadrupled. And that is the original gain of function that was put or happened in this Corona virus. [00:27:12] And that was like four times now it's four times more than normal Delta or other virons. So that of course has shown that in, in previous experiments, that if you enhance the Furin cleavage capacity, you would enhance the ability of that virus to cross the blood brain. So we were all up in arms and saying, \"Hey guys, we need to keep an eye on that\" [00:27:39] And, uh, so I, I asked Dr. Shankara Chetty and he agreed that we should keep an eye on that. And Shankara are you there? Can I, can I ask you to come into please now and tell us from ground zero, what you observed? [00:27:57] Dr. Shankara Chetty: Yeah, we always, we always meeting, discussing problems. Yeah. Yeah, we were there, there there's been some concern about, uh, Omicron being mild, but, uh, from a clinical perspective, there's certain things that we've seen that are a little unnerving unsettling. [00:28:17] Uh, there's been an article published in Thailand about the increase in the incidence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Uh, and that article was a bit concerning. Uh, they found that, uh, they were diagnosing an increase in this, uh, uh, thrombo thrombo thromboembolic disease, uh, in patients that have recovered from Omicron in itself. [00:28:40] With, with Omicron, I've always had the concern that it might attack the nervous system, the first wave, and the first variant had an affinity for the, uh, for the respiratory tract. The second for the gastrointestinal, the third seemed to be more circulatory. And so the thought, uh, looked like it was going to be neural. [00:29:00] Uh, cause we, we look at spike protein and VAERS system and the kind of effects we seeing there. The only thing that wasn't accounted for in the illness was neuropathies. And so I started, uh, watching patients to figure out whether we actually dealing with this kind of thing. And what I found was, as you see on the screen, I've been seeing some strange neuropathic headaches, uh, Retrobulbar headaches, extending temporarily, uh, vibrational sensations to headaches, uh, commonly shock like pain radiating from the neck, migrainous is in nature. [00:29:31] Uh, so, uh, I've also seen people presenting with burning hands and feet, some, uh, tingling sensations or burning sensations over the skin of the triceps. Uh, It seemed to have some nerve root involvement around the C4, 5, 6 brachial plexus seem to be radiating to the arms and shoulders. I've also seen patients which look like T10/T11 nerve root involvement, patients presenting with broncospasm indigestion, heartburn, uh, those, those kinds of symptoms. [00:30:05] Uh, we got to consider whether there's some bagel or sympathetic involvement here. Uh, I've seen patients presenting with a decrease in blood pressure as well, hypertension, which never occurred before in, uh, in the, in the clinical picture of the pandemic itself. Uh, so this, this all points to neurologic symptoms. [00:30:27] Uh, I've seen the patients with, uh, old neuropathies that have been under control, uh, after Omicron, seeing these neuropathies, uh, re resurfaced. And so I had to start considering how to treat these kind of, uh, pain syndromes differently. Cause neuropathies don't tend to respond to traditional analgesia. [00:30:49] Yeah. So I found that, uh, codeine, uh, containing paracetamal combination seem to help, sedation helps and we are considering low dose naltrexone. Uh, we, we did, the thing is to look at long-term implications of this virus, having an affinity for neural tissue. I've just had a conversation with Dr. McMillan as well. [00:31:11] And, uh, we trying to figure out why. Specifically the cavernous sinus is being targeted. It's proximity to the sinuses might be an issue. Uh, so we seeing some, some strange neuropathies with Omicron. I think we need to keep that very close, uh, in our minds. Uh, this might create long-term side effects that we didn't expect. [00:31:33] And so if we can understand, uh, the mechanisms that are causing this, because we're getting some, uh, nerve root involvement, uh, we considering whether it's CSF involvement, we seeing sympathetic, uh, problems, but patients seem to recover, uh, I hope in a month or two, we don't start to see the full ambit of what Omicron actually do. [00:31:56] And so I think we need to, we need to keep our eyes open and try to figure this out. [00:32:03] Dr. Naseeba Kathrada: Thank you so much for that, Dr. Chetty, um, uh, Dr. Gerlach, would you want to end off with anything? [00:32:11] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: Yes, there are some questions. I don't know how we are in the times, timeline. [00:32:17] Dr. Naseeba Kathrada: Yeah, I'm going to hand over to Jennifer. I just have one question, for Dr. Shankara, before I hand over Jennifer, um, Dr. Chetty, I've been seeing those same neurological, um, that, uh, manifestation that you mentioned Omicron with post jab injuries. [00:32:32] I mean from, uh, six, seven months ago. So the first, the very first post-Jab injury. I was involved in was with the CVS team. It was actually a friend of mine from medical school who had blurred vision and then, um, CT, uh, revealed that and a friend of hers, um, who got jab in the same week as her six weeks later developed blindness. [00:32:54] And that was post J&J jab. And she got, um, vein, um, it was optic vein thrombosis. So I'm like you mentioned, um, you know, what we were seeing with long, long COVID, but those are the very similar things we seeing post jab. So there was a question I think I saw Tess put the question. Are you seeing it, uh, with omicron and jab people or separately with Omicron? [00:33:16] Because I I've, I've seen the same thing with just post-jab. [00:33:20] Dr. Shankara Chetty: Uh, Naseeba I'm seeing it both with the vaccinated and unvaccinated that are getting omicron. So I think it's attributable to omicron itself, but what, what drew my attention to this was that we found that with every new variant, it seemed to have affinity for a new system. [00:33:38] And so to understand the spike protein and its diversity and the different systems that it affects, I think the best place to look would be the VAERS because that's the vaccine side effects. And that, that would give us an idea of the ambit of omicron's biologic, I mean, a spike proteins, biologic potential. [00:33:54] And so we, as we've seen with COVID illness, we've seen exactly the same with VAERS. We've seen the cardiac and the thrombotic events. We've seen the respiratory problems. The thing missing was nuerology,, the illness never really had any neuropathy associated. And that's the reason with this a fourth, the fourth wave, and with the changes in the spike protein, the 30 mutations and, uh, as a Joachim mentioned the Furin cleavage site, we were concerned that this would have an affinity for a different system. And so we started looking at neuropathy with something that was considered or from the start. So we started interrogating patients as to their symptoms. And you found that a lot of the pain was neuropathic. [00:34:40] I've also seen patients with a few occular symptoms, um, but it seemed to be a sensation, or sensoru ocular, sensory ocular symptoms, like a sensation of a fan on the eye. Uh that's that kind of tingling of the eyes. Uh, the headaches seemed to be migrainous, shocking shooting, uh, unilateral. So again, neuropathy, but it's strange in that the neuropathy effects the, uh, cervical spine, but more closer to the junction with the thoracic spine. And then it seems to affect the, the lower thoracic spine where there's a junction with the lumbar spine. So it seems to be diaphragmatic and more upper cervical brachial, plexus kind of neuropathy. So we all scratching our heads trying to figure out where the root of this problem might lie. We're looking at the CSF, we're looking at different receptors. [00:35:28] There might be an affinity for a different receptor that, uh, brings a neural tissue into the target. We wondering why cavernous sinus thrombosis is becoming a bit [inaudible] to Omicron. So I think we just need to find the root of where all this stems from. Vitally important, uh, to actually predict the long-term implications of omicron infection. [00:35:51] Rather than waiting for patients to show up at mass with chronic problems and we're still scratching our heads. [00:35:57] Dr. Naseeba Kathrada: Thanks Dr. Chetty, um, Dr. Gerlach, um, I wanted to just so that people don't panic because we know that Omicron is supposed to be mild. Um, what percentage, uh, um, are there serious illnesses? Because we don't want people to not say, you know, they heard something and everybody's panicking because Omicron's causing, um, CVST uh, what, what percentage and how treatable is, is that condition? [00:36:21] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: Okay. I wouldn't know about how treatable it is once it has manifested and has done real neurological damage. Uh, we have done a lot of research on these natural molecules. We might even add some other additional protocol if this turns out to be playing out more. Um, the problem might be that it will be in a latent phase. [00:36:41] It will take a time until it manifests. Like, you know, that especially what Dr. Seneff has pointed out in prime disease formation can take 5 to 10 years. And also you, you, you actually don't want any spike protein in your be it from, from SARS-CoV-2 or any other way. Now, if you ask my opinion, because it by itself has not been researched enough and we don't know really the longterm implications of what it's going to happen. [00:37:09] So it, the best thing is of course, to maintain the, the, the dosage of the vitamin C, D and, and, uh, and Zinc at all times. And I hope I could make a case today for natural molecules. It doesn't necessarily have to be Vedicinals. Uh, but it is of course, a very, um, comprehensive, um, mixture as you might've noticed today. [00:37:30] And so we are adding constantly here and there, depending on the, on the developing conditions here and their recommendations like CBD oil or other things. So we, I'm not a, uh, an expert on pharmaceutics. So that is more in, in your, in your league and, uh, Dr. Chetty and Dr. Korey and all the other doctors. So what I wanted to do today is to make a case for the, for the especially highly potent nutraceuticals, as an alternative, as an add-on, as an adjuvant, as a baseline kind of supplementation, to help the body, to deal with these things. [00:38:06] And then of course, as you've seen in our clinical trial settings, you can add ivermectin or any other allopathic drug to it, better is of course, to really check with us for the interactions. So I want to say just quickly two things, the product is available globally. Now we are shipping out of India with DHL express within four to five days, it goes well. [00:38:26] And slides of the presentation are, um, we have a bottom on the website now with a picture from this, uh, presentation so that you can ask for the slides because I went through them very quickly. So some other scientists might be really interested in looking at the mechanisms of what we have done here and what is possible. [00:38:46] And then, yeah, I, so I couldn't, I forgot to add my email address to this, um, to this presentation. So, um, just go through our website and contact us, please, uh, under Vedicinals.com and then you find all the information. [00:39:00] Dr. Naseeba Kathrada: Thank you, Jennifer, do we have any questions? Cause I see lots of popping up. [00:39:04] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Definitely. Definitely. Um, first of all, Dr. Gerlach, could you, could you post your, your website in the chat because everyone's able to copy the chat also with, I assume on your website, you mentioned that, uh, if people want to access your, your, your nutraceuticals and your medicines, they can go through your website. [00:39:24] Is that right? [00:39:25] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: Yes. Yes, no problem. And a PayPal and a button to order. And it's a very fast within that. [00:39:31] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Wonderful. Now regarding Omicron and the symptoms you're talking about, are we finding that these symptoms are mostly transient? Are we, are you finding that some of these neurological symptoms are just not going away? [00:39:44] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: Uh, we, we don't, we don't know yet. Um, Omicron is just like barely six weeks old, so, um, or eight weeks old. How can we know? Um, I think that it can, it also is depending on the patient, if he has any - we are all different. How so maybe with some persons, it will, it will, it will be fended off by the body and others, not. [00:40:05] It depends also on the area where you live. We found that the people in India eating, especially in the countryside, eating a lot of food that contains all these phenolic compounds are tending to be much better off than people in our regions in Europe or the us eating processed food and having a lack of micronutrition that is a remarkable compared to these kinds of populations that live a healthy lifestyle. [00:40:32] So we have to see, I mean, we have we having so many long COVID patients and my first question to them, Uh, were you healthy before you developed COVID and long COVID or did you have any preconditions because you cannot expect from, from us at the moment to be also covering all the preconditions. So if you have any precondition in, uh, in, in, in, in this, um, I think that you are prone to develop a long-term neurological problem. [00:41:00] We have no idea what will come out is too early, still in the game, even, even the whole COVID, uh, with two years, we can say if there will be a lot of neurological problems. Um, but it's very likely we don't know how much I hopenot so much!. [00:41:16] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Yes, we all hope so. And I guess we're in the process and your role in the process of collecting data on these patterns, in the jabbed, and in the unjabbed, right? Cause it's, again, especially in omicron it's so early on. [00:41:30] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: Yeah. I think that what Dr. Chetty has been observing and other doctors is maybe not the common thing to develop, but I just wouldn't. I would never underestimate that virus no matter how it comes in. How harmless is it looks at this, in this viron, I have learned to be very careful and I've seen too much of the little mechanisms what this little bugger can do. So let's always be risk with respect to this, uh, to this virus. [00:41:56] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Um, now all your medic medicine sound really promising. Are you planning to test your formulation among people experiencing side effects from the COVID vaccine? [00:42:06] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: And that is of course, okay. To develop a theurapeutic, um, that can work against the COVID condition by itself is already a risky endeavour because you all know that this is absolutely not wanted. And so we are doing already, uh, we're getting a little bit on, on thin ice by just by doing that project itself. [00:42:30] I don't really comment so much on vaccine side effects and whatever our suspension can do in that respect. But let me say it has been designed to tackle the problems that the spike proteins are doing in COVID infection. So of course it could be very helpful. Also if you have some problems, um, from the, from the, from the jab. Um, We have been, we have been severely attacked some weeks ago, which was for being in groups being discussed because people are using our product to do that. [00:43:03] And so, uh, I, I have to be a little bit careful here and yeah, so I leave it up to everybody's imagination to judge that. [00:43:12] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Thank you. Yes, we understand that's a delicate area, especially when you're trying to keep all your, all your avenues open to help people. [00:43:19] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: Exactly. [00:43:21] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Uh, uh, Dr. Rima Laibow label asked, um, how similar cause number of people are asking, how similar are your findings for other Corona viruses, uh, or for other viruses using your, uh, your molecules? [00:43:35] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: Um, most of the research that has been done on these molecules in previous years and decades, was on actually a lot of other viruses and infectious diseases. That's how we know about this host cell receptors and certain enzymes, because a coronavirus is not that different from a dengue or a, um, uh, Zika or other viruses that have been reported here with these molecules. [00:43:58] I think that, uh, we, we, uh, we have keeping that in mind for once we are finished with COVID to see how well, I think that tuberculosis and malaria, uh, could be two fields that we really want to go in this direction. And, uh, as, as we are, we are also in projects of sustainability, like, uh, re reforestation of rainforest. [00:44:19] And so what we want to do is close the circle. And bring like cultivate in a sustainable manner in a food forest, cultivate the ingredients for our product, and then bring it back to the areas where people are suffering and get that into a close circle system. Um, I hope we have the chance to do that. [00:44:38] I'm a little bit skeptical at the moment with the politics that we are facing. If we can really be operational in some years from now, that remains to be seen, thanks to people like you that are fighting for our rights to live a free life. Um, we have a chance, but it's not clear yet. [00:44:57] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Thank you. Now, Dr. Pri Bandara was asking, um, are you looking into any research that is, uh, relating to electro magnetic nature, uh, nature of genetic material? I mean, I know that steps into a whole other arena, but it is all relevant. We're all looking at all, everything right now. [00:45:18] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: Okay. There's a lot of theories out there that this, that COVID conditions can be caused by 5G or electromagnetic radiation. Uh, I, I don't think that that is possible in that specific way, uh, where we come from before COVID started, that was exactly the field of research and work we've been doing. [00:45:39] So, um, what I did, I worked very closely with professor Martin L Paul, who is the world's leading expert in EMF radiation damage from wifi and, and mobile phone radiation. And, uh, so I think that, um, we are working on solutions, but they're are still in a, in a early stage of development. And that is a whole different topic. Uh, I think that the re uh, the radiation from mobile phone wifi and the EMF radiation in general is fueling the disease severity. That is sure. Same like glyphosate would say these two things are, uh, let's say main drivers of the severity of this condition, but not the cause. [00:46:19] But our recommendation is always, especially if you're for the long haulers to, to switch off at least at night or the wifi and mobile phone radiation and stay away from closed sources, like stay away from the wifi. The distance is very important and protect yourself as good as possible from this radiation. [00:46:37] For sure. It's not helpful at all. It causes mass cell activation, the voltage gated calcium calcium channels. Open up, you have calcium influx into the cells. So that's very similar to severe COVID conditions. So they go hand in hand. Yes. Stay away from electromagnetic radiation. If you can, as good as possible. [00:46:57] Dr. Jennifer Hibberd: Thank you so much. Uh, I'm sure this will open up a whole slew of new questions. And if you can possibly just follow the chat and as questions come up, because this is such important, significant information everyone wants to know about. We really appreciate everything to share with us today. Thank you. [00:47:14] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: You're welcome, sure, anytime. [00:47:17] Dr. Naseeba Kathrada: Thank you. Thank you so much, Jennifer. And, and thank you so much to our speakers. Both of them were amazing. Um, on that last point that you mentioned, you know, we always need to keep reminding ourselves also back to basics, hydrate, rest, distress, eat a good, healthy diet. A lot of people just assume that, uh, they've got some condition, just pop a pill and it's going to get better, but your stuff's all based on natural things, which means that people should be looking after themselves and eating healthy, eating clean, and you know, staying positive, resting. [00:47:46] And de-stressing. So thank you so much for, for being here and joining us, the World Council for Health. And like Jen says, there are quite a few questions, very interesting questions in the chat, and I'd love to see your answers to them. So if you can please answer them in our chat directly. [00:48:02] Dr. Joachim Gerlach: Yes. Thank you so much for having me. [00:48:05] Dr. Naseeba Kathrada: Thank you "}
