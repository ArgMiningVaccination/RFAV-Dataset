Trump, Steven Dillingham, Bureau of the Census, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., United States Department of Commerce. There is no dispute that the Pres- ident has \" accustomed supervi- sory powers over his executive of-ficers, \" Franklin, 505 U.S. at 800, and thus retains some discretion in the conduct of the decennial cen- sus and resulting apportionment calculation. Nevertheless, where the authority of the President (or other members of the Executive Branch) to act is derived from statutes passed by Congre ss, the President must act in accordance with, and within the boundaries of, the authority that Congress has granted. For the reasons dis- cussed above, we conclude that 27 DATE DOCKET NUMBER PROCEEDINGS the President did not do so here and that the Presidential Memo- randum is an ultra vires violation of Congress's delegation of its con- stitutional responsibility to count the whole number of persons in each State and to apportion mem- bers of the House of Representa- tives among the States according to their respective numbers under 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 2a and 13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment with respect to their statutory ultra vires claims is GRANTED, Defendants (other than the President) are ENJOINED as set forth above, and the Presidential Memoran- dum is DECLARED unla wful. We need not and do not reach the merits of Plaintiffs' other claims and need not address their re-quest, in the alternative, for a pre- liminary injunction. Finally, De- fendants' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is DENIED and their motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is DE- NIED as moot. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate ECF Nos. 74 and 117 and to close this case. SO ORDERED. 28 DATE DOCKET NUMBER PROCEEDINGS (Signed by United States Circuit Judge Richard C.

Since 1790, no decennial census has excluded any category of persons who usually reside in the United States on their basis of their citizenship or immigration status for purposes of apportioning congressio nal rep- resentation. See, e.g. , Resi- dence Residence 28,950, (2015); Thompson Decl. \u00b6 8 (Ex. 57).1 2. Millions of undocumented immigrants live in the United States and many have lived in the Un ited States for many years. See Office of Immigration Statistics, U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Population Estimates: Illegal Alien Population Residing in the United States: January 2015 at 2 (Dec. 2018), https://www.dhs.gov/ sites/d efault/files/publications/18_1214_PLCY_pops -est- report.pdf. 3. California and Texas are consistently the two states with the largest populations of undocumented residents. Id. at 4-5. 4. According to the Department of Homeland Se- curity, California had 2. 9 million undocumented resi- dents and Texas had 1.9 million undocumented residents in 2015. Id. at 2. 5. As of the most recent Congressional reappor- tionment following the 2010 Decennial Census, the aver- age population of each U.S. House district is 710,767 1 Citations to \" Ex. __ \" are to the exhibits to the accompanying Dec- laration of Matthew Colangelo dated August 7, 2020. 42 people. See Kristin D. Burnett, Congressional Appor- tionment , U.S. census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br -08.pdf (last vis- ited July 30, 2020). 6. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2019, the population of the United States was estimated to be 328,239,523. U.S. Census Bureau, Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: Apr. 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019 (NST -EST2019- 02), https://www. census.gov/data/tables/timeseries/ demo/pope st/2010s - state -total.html (last visited July 30, 2020). 7. If the July 1, 2019 Census Bureau estimate of the total United States population is divided by the total number of seats in Congress (435), the quotient i s 754,574. See id. 8. The Memorandum states that \" [i]ncreasing con- gressional representation based on the presence of al- iens who are not in a lawful immigration status would also create perverse incentives encouraging violations of Federal law. \" Memorandu m on Excluding Illegal Al- iens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census , 85 Fed. Reg. 44,679, 44,680 (July 23, 2020) (the \"Memorandum\" ) (ECF No. 1 -1). 9. The Memorandum states: \"Current estimates suggest that one State is home to more than 2.2 million illegal aliens, constituting more than 6 percent of the State's entire population. Including these illegal aliens in the population of the State for the purpose of appor-tionment could result in the allocation of two or three more congressional se ats than would otherwise be allo- cated. \" Id. 43 10. A state in which 2.2 million people represent 6 percent of the population would have a total population of more than 36 million residents. 11. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of April 1, 2010, the total population of the State of California was 37,253,956. U.S. Census Bureau, An- nual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico: Apr. 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019 (NST -EST2019- 02), https://www. census .gov/data/tables/timeseries/ demo/popest/2010s - state -total.html (last visited July 30, 2020). 12. According to the Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2019, the total population of the State of California was 39,512,223. Id. 13. The second most populous state in the United States is Texas. Id. 14. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of April 1, 2010, the total population of the State of Texas was 25,145,561. Id. 15. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2019, the total population of the State of Texas was 28,995,881. Id. 16. After California and Texas, the next most popu- lous state is Florida, which, according to the Census Bu- reau, had a total population of 18,801,310 as of April 1, 2010, and an estimated total populatio n of 21,477,737 as of July 1, 2019. Id. 17. Based on the Census Bureau's 2019 estimate, 2.2 million people would constitute approximately 7.6 per- cent of the estimated total population of Texas as of July 1, 2019. See id. 44 18. Based on the Census Bureau's 2019 estimate, 2.2 million people would constitute over 10 percent of the estimated total population of Florida as of 2019. See id. 19. The Memorandum anticipates that excluding un- documented immigrants from the apportionment base would deprive California of at least one seat in the House of Representatives. See 85 Fed. Reg. at 44,680. 20. Dr. Christopher Warshaw modeled the effects of excluding undocumented immigrants from the popula- tion count used to calculate Congressional reapportion- ment after the 2020 Census. See Warshaw Decl. at \u00b6 11 (Ex. 58). 21. According to Dr. Warshaw, if undocumented im- migrants are excluded from the apportionment basis, the probability that Texas will lose a seat in the House of Representatives is 98.3%. Id. \u00a7 5.2, Tbl. 7. 22. According to Dr. Warshaw, if undocumented im- migrants are excluded from the apportionment basis, the probability that California will lose a seat in the House of Representatives is 72.1%. Id.

DONALD J. TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF ALLISON Arwady, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. My name is Allison Arwady, M.D., and I make this Declaration in connection with State of New York, et al., v. Trump, et al. I was confirmed by the Chicago City Council as Commissioner of the Chicago Depart-ment of Public Health ( \"CDPH \") in January 2020. I lead the City's public health response to the COVID -19 pandemic, ensuring thro ugh data analysis, testing, case investigation and contact tracing, quarantine/isolation, health care system support, and the dissemination of public guidance that the outbreak has remained well controlled. Under my leadership, CDPH has also been instrume ntal in enacting an expansion of services and strengthened policies for mental health, violence pre- vention, and environmental health. CDPH is now pre- paring to launch Healthy Chicago 2025, a four -year plan 54 created with more than 200 partner organizations and residents to advance health equity by reducing the city's racial life expectancy gap. 3. As the chief executive of CDPH, my primary re- sponsibility is to assure the health and wellbeing of Chi-cago's 2.7 million residents. My duties include managing the human, financial, and physical resources of CDPH to reduce health inequities while improving the health of the entire population. CDPH does this by establishing policies, developing systems, and implementing pro- grams that meet community health needs. 4. To assure the health and wellbeing of Chicago residents \u2014prioritizing the populations and neighbor- hoods of greatest need \u2014CDPH relies on complete and accurate census data. Monitoring the health status of Chicago residents requi res citywide and subpopulation level data, such as the numbers of individuals by race/ ethnicity, age, gender, socioeconomic status, and neigh- borhood of residence. Without accurate census data, CDPH will have difficulty assuring appropriate alloca-tion of resources to the most appropri ate populations and neighborhoods. We also will be unable to track progress or identify the best possible interventions to achieve our overarching goal of reducing the city's racial life expectancy gap. 5. T he census data for Chicago is particularly im- portant in 2020 as there have been unprecedented socio - demographic population shifts by race, ethnicity, and geography over this last decade. These changes include greater economic stratification, with many Latinos mov-ing to different neighborhoods due to gentrification, Af- rican Americans leaving the city in record numbers, and the population of young, upper -income White residents 55 on the rise. An incomplete count would strike at the core of our work as these underlying population num- bers are how we calculate disease prevalence rates, meas- ure racial and geographic disparities, and adjust rates for differences in population distribution by age. We use this data to monitor birth outcomes (e.g. teen birth), mortality (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, infectious dis- ease), and morbidity (e.g., HIV, lead poisoning preva- lence, opioid overdose rates, asthma ED visits, traffic crash injury, mental health hospitalizations). 6. Complete and accurate data is critical to CDPH's response to the COVID -19 pandemic. This data affects where we target our interventions including testing, com-munications, and policies to strengthen the local safety net and increase access to care. In the coming years, we will also use this data to inform how and where we pro- vide vaccines to stop the virus from continuing to spread in Chicago. 7. CDPH uses decennial census data to weight our Healthy Chicago Survey and the Youth Risk Behavioral Surve y data so that the survey sample accurately re- flects the entire population. All estimates of behavior (e.g. smoking), health screening (e.g. mammograms), ac- cess to care (e.g. regular doctor visits), and percent of the population with certain health condit ions (e.g. obe- sity, hypertension, diabetes) would be compromised by undercounts in Census 2020. 8. CDPH uses citywide and subpopulation disease and health behavior prevalence rates to: a. Determine disease and health behavior dispari- ties for geographic, racial/ethnic, gender, and so- cioeconomic subpopulations; 56 b. Inform where to provide services directly. For example, CDPH locates our clinical services (e.g., immunizations, STI, mental health) in high -need neighborhoods and focuses public awareness cam-paigns in communities with high rates of disease or disease promoting behaviors; c. Allocate financial resources. CDPH defines and prioritizes high -risk populations and neigh- borhoods and requires applicants to describe their ability to provide services for these popu- lations; and d. Identify and respond to outbreaks of disease. CDPH uses population data to establish and mon- itor baseline patterns of disease so that aberra- tions in disease patterns can be detected and ap-propriate interventions can be implement ed. As mentioned, this data is especially important to our response to the COVID -19 pandemic. 9. An incomplete count or inaccurate information on demographics from the census would undermine the interpretation of health data until at least the next de- cennial census (2030). Both today and a decade from now, lacking comparable data to previous years would make it much more difficult to track trends, particularly in sensitive areas where we as a city are at a critical juncture in making progress, like youth quality of life, HIV incidence, youth vaping, and, crucially, the chronic diseases that increase mortality rates from COVID -19. 10. Understanding and monitoring the relationship between health outcomes and the social determinants of health could be impacted by an incomplete or inaccurate census count. The decennial census is the gold -standard 57 data source for measuring population and neighborhood characteristics related to factors such as poverty, em- ployment, use of public benefits, housing, educational o ut- comes, and commuting behaviors, with an eye toward the needs of vulnerable populations like the disabled, el- derly individuals living alone, and those who face imped- iments to mobility. The proposed change to census ap- portionment, and its resulting impact on census data counts could have a profound impact on interventions related to community development \u2014and on emergency preparedness to deal with outbreaks and other urgent threats. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoing is true and correct. Exe- cuted on this 4th of Aug. , 2020 /s/ ALLISON ARWADY ALLISON ARWADY Commissioner, Chicago Department of Public Health 58 Exhibit 4 59 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 20 Civ. 5770 (JMF) STATE OF NEW YORK, ET AL ., PLAINTIFFS v. DONALD J. TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF MARC BALDWIN IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF STATE OF W ASHINGTON Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746(2), I, Marc Baldwin, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and, unless other- wise noted, I have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. I am an Assistant Director for Washington State's Office of Financial Management (OFM). I oversee OFM's Forecasting and Research Division, which includes the Population Unit. The Population Unit is the section of OFM that is working to ensure a complete count during the 2020 Census. I have been employed by O FM since 2013. 3. OFM's Population Unit is the primary state agency responsible for the compilation and maintenance of population data for Washington State. We provide Washington's official demographic data and information to other state agencies, local g overnments, tribal gov- ernments, local planning agencies, institutions of higher 60 education, special purpose districts, and the public. Nearly all of our daily work relies on census data or analyses derived from census data, most of which fall under the bro ad umbrellas of population estimates and population forecasts. Efforts to Ensure a Complete Count in the 2020 Census in Washington State 4. The Population Unit oversees Washington's an- nual population estimate (which is largely based on the decennial cens us) and also serves as the official state li- aison to the Census Bureau. The Population Unit has managed the state's Complete Count Committee since 2018. The Unit oversees the Committee's 2020 budget of $15 million, which is allocated to support community efforts to promote and ensure a complete count in the 2020 Census. Washington's $15 million budget repre- sents one of the largest state investments nationwide for census efforts (and sharply contrasts with 2010, when Washington invested no state dollars i n the national cen- sus effort). The Washington Legislature made the de- cision to allocate these funds to the 2020 Census com- plete count efforts after various stakeholders raised concerns that federal funding, procedures, and policies would disadvantage our state's diverse populations. 5. In the last two years, the Complete Count Com- mittee effort has generated a complete statewide net- work of local complete count committees and organizing activity run by local and tribal governments and commu- nity organizations. The Population Unit has worked with this network to provide information and resources needed to enable local trusted messengers to raise aware- ness about the importance of the 2020 Census and to in- still confidence in the confidentiality of responses as a 61 means of encouraging participation in the 2020 Census. Washington has seen a heightened need for these efforts as national activity around the 2020 Census has called into doubt how the federal gover nment may use census information in other contexts and whether sufficient re- sources have been allocated to national efforts to ensure an accurate count of hard -to-count populations. 6. Since October 2018, Washington's Complete Count Committee has met nine times. Its existence has led to the establishment of local Complete Count Committees throughout the state, representing local and tribal governments, regions, or specific ethnic or professional groups. Over 300 local and tribal govern- ments and community organizations have mobilized statewide to train trusted messengers, to organize Questionnaire Assistance Centers at food banks and drive -thru events, to sponsor Census challenge events or competitions, and to hold live social media events and regularly pos t reminders to complete the Census on so- cial media. In addition, approximately $2.5 million in state funds have been invested in advertising and pro- duction of promotional materials. 7. Washington State's self- response rates have been relatively high since the start of the 2020 Census. As of the end of July, Washington ranks 6th in the nation with 68.2 percent self -response. However, closer ex- amination of the self -response locations clearly indicates that census tracts with traditionally hard -to-count pop- ulations (people of color, renters, lower income house- holds, rural communities, foreign born, etc.) are a large part of the 31.8 percent who have not yet responded to the 2020 Census. 62 Impacts of the Presidential Memorandum and COVID -19 on Response Rates 8. Reports to our office out of both King and Snohomish counties, which contain significant urban populations, indicate that the July 21 Presidential Mem- orandum raised alarm within the immigrant communi- ties there and cast a chill on our state and local conti nu- ing efforts to encourage self -response. People are re- newing their concerns about the confidentiality of their responses and are confused about the impact of the Presidential Memorandum on the ongoing Census. As a result, a new toolkit for community organizations was hastily produced to provide new assurances to reinforce the message that there is no citizenship question on the census. 9. Census coordinators in both King and Sno homish counties report receiving alarming calls from commu- nity partners expre ssing concerns and confusion after the Presidential Memorandum. For example, one con- cerned census advocate in an email to our office stated: \"I've heard from some people who have expressed some regret in participating in the census and even fear as to where they will be getting the information to determine how many and who is here legally. \" Several statewide meetings of community organizations have been con-vened to strategize on how to respond to these commu- nity concerns. 10. Traditionally, Census worker s reach out directly to follow up with hard -to-count populations to encourage full census participation. COVID -19 has impaired such efforts; specifically, the inability to send individuals into communities due to COVID -19 has hampered the 63 trusted messenge r strategy of encouraging Census com- pletion through face -to-face interaction. Equally con- cerning, Washington has been forced to close libraries, churches, and community centers due to COVID -19, which in turn eliminated these important venues for community contact. The Commerce Department's tem- porary suspension of its \"Update Leave operation \" due to COVID- 19 has particularly impacted response rates in Washington's more rural counties, which have high numbers of immigrant farmworkers, which did not re- ceive invitations to participate in the census until as late as the end of June. In addition, response rates are lower in urban census tracts that have higher concentra- tions of immigrant communities, such as south King County. 11. Educating the public in light of the Presidential Memorandum presents enormous challenges, particu- larly with the Census deadline potentially sooner than anticipated; the primary Census educational and aware- ness materials were printed and published long ago. De-spite this, OFM has produc ed and disseminated infor- mation on the Presidential Memorandum and its impact on Census data collection despite the additional costs and challenges. The additional cost has been mainly staff time to research and prepare talking points and toolkits and to convene stakeholders for strategic com- munications. 12. The chilling effect of suggesting that immigrant status would be identifiable and lead to exclusion cannot be viewed in isolation from the pattern of administrative uncertainty that emerged early in th e 2020 Census ef- fort with the potential addition of an immigration status 64 question. The Presidential Memorandum has resur- faced and exacerbated many respondents' concerns and mistrust, requiring redoubling of efforts to remind re- spondents that the census d oes not contain the proposed citizenship question. 13. The Memorandum's focus on immigration status may have a uniquely toxic effect in Washington given the state's history with internment and Japanese com- munities.1 The state has invested significant resources and made extensive efforts to assure Washingtonians that their data is safe, that it will not be used for pur- poses outside the census, and that their community characteristics will be accounted for. The Presidential Memorandum seriously undermines that investment and those efforts. Washington's Use of Census Data and the Importance of Data Quality 14. OFM is also responsible for producing annual state, county, and city population estimates for state planning and fund distribution. About 200 million dol- lars of state shared revenues are distributed to counties and cities on a per capita basis annually. We rely on the decennial census data for these estimates be cause it is the only available count of the entire population for a single time point, repeated with a consistent methodol-ogy over time. The federal census is the definitive source from which almost all other demographic data analyses are based, even demo graphic products sold by 1 See, e.g. , J. Burton, et al., A Brief History of Japanese American Relocation During World War II , (Nat'l Park Serv., Apr. 1, 2016), https://www.nps.gov/articles/historyinternment.htm ; Inside -Out: Japanese Americans during World War II, (Wash. State Univ. Libraries Digital Exhibits), http://digitalexhibits.libra ries.wsu.edu/ exhibits/show/jaincarceration/jaincarcerationintro . 65 private companies. Conducting a census is prohibi- tively expensive for most governments and private com- panies, leading almost everyone to rely on the national decennial census. 15. OFM produces annual estimates of state popula- tion by age, sex, race and ethnicity, Small Area Esti- mates of total population and housing, and Small Area Demographic Estimates, which include the characteris- tics of age, race, gender and ethnicity. We also pro- duce estimates of populations with Limited Englis h Pro- ficiency. All of these estimates rely heavily on the ac- curacy of the decennial census data. For example, de- cennial census counts of county and city population housing by characteristic are the foundation of our an- nual county and city estimates progr am. Although an oversimplification, our annual estimates can be thought of as federal census data plus locally reported change. The impact of the accuracy of the decennial census data extends beyond just the population totals, as OFM de- rives household si ze and occupancy rates from the cen- sus for use in these local estimates. Even small devia- tions in these rates, after being applied to all housing units in the state, can cause large inaccuracies. These issues last for the entire decade, likely getting worse as time goes on. At a minimum, bad data will certainly lead to inaccurate distribution of funding within Wash- ington, impacting all levels of government for a decade. These estimates also form the foundation for all of our other estimates products, ma king any baked -in inaccu- racies even more impactful. 16. OFM produces our Small Area Estimates and Small Area Demographic Estimates using the decennial census as a base. Our Small Area Estimates apply to 66 statutorily defined areas and are used for planning and revenue distribution such as highway urban areas, pub- lic transportation benefit areas, and the thermal electric generating facilities area and non -statutory areas such as water resource inventory areas, hospital districts and fire protection areas. Our Small Area Demographic Estimates \u2014which rely heavily on accurate census age, sex, race, and origin data \u2014are distributed to every local health jurisdiction in the state through the Washington Department of Health's Community Health Assessment Tool or in re ports such as the Washington Department of Social and Health Services Community Risk Profiles. 17. In addition to these estimates, OFM also pro- duces annual forecasts that again rely on census data. We annually produce a state population forecast by age and sex with a 30 -year horizon. On years ending with a 2 or 7, we also produce a county population forecast series to satisfy the state's Growth Management Act re- quirements (Ch. 36.70A, Wash. Rev. Code). Among other things, Washington's Growth Management A ct is a unique economic development statute that guides planning for development and land preservation within the state, and it relies heavily on the geographic and de- mographic data in the census. 18. Our primary forecast model is a cohort compo- nent model, which uses the most detailed age and sex data available from the census combined with birth, death, and migration data from other sources. The census age and sex data is a key piece of this model be-cause it determines how a population will age forward, how many women are of childbearing age, and how many people are at risk of dying. This state -level forecast is 67 the baseline for all of our other forecasts. Even a dif- ference of 0.25% in the state total population in 2020 would result in a difference of over 20,000 people just 20 years later in 2040 under current assumptions. 19. Our Growth Management Act forecast extends our statewide forecast to the county level, which entails an increased level of detail and a greater need for accu- racy in census data. Accurate census age, sex, race and ethnicity data are essential for understanding, estimat-ing, and forecasting county populations because the dif- ferences within those characteristics play a large part in determining why counties increase or decrease in popu- lation size over time. For example, Whitman County has an extremely high proportion of men and women in their low twenties. Census group quarter counts help us understand how many of these young people are at-tending Washington State University and if the y are likely to move upon graduation. Unlike young people in other parts of the state, Washington State University students are historically unlikely to settle in Whitman County and raise families there. A break in the data series caused by poor -quality decennial census data would skew the historic patterns and relationships we use to estimate and forecast population at the county level, resulting in more uncertainty for counties and other end -users of our data. 20. Many of the models we use to inform the se fore- casts rely on the relationships of the federal census counts from one decade to the next. Consistency in counting is extremely important for trend analysis and statistical modeling. Again, small differences in these relation- ships can result in lar ge differences in predicted value when applied to hundreds of thousands of households 68 over many years. Accordingly, the U.S. Census Bu- reau recognizes the importance of consistency and has historically used a very rigorous process to assess the impacts of even the smallest changes in their question- naire. This is one reason why the Census Bureau's an- nouncement that it will cut short the Nonresponse Fol- lowup (NRFU) operation is very disturbing: this lack of follow up with hard -to-count populations will almo st certainly compromise the quality of 2020 Census data, resulting in potentially exponential errors. 21. OFM strives to provide the highest -quality, un - biased demographic data possible so Washington deci- sion-makers have the best information available to d o their work. Accuracy is a driving force in our work and it is why we have participated in every available 2020 Census preparation program. 22. In addition to the specific state responsibilities listed above, our office works closely with the Census Bureau. We are the lead census State Data Center, the official Federal State Cooperative for Population Esti- mates representative, and the state certifying office for city boundaries and annexation boundary changes that are submitte d through the Boundary Annexation Sur- vey and Boundary Validation Program. We have rep- resented Washington State by participating in every 2020 Census program available to us, including: Local Update of Census Addresses, Count Review Operation, Early Nonresponse Followup, New Construction Pro- gram, Participant Statistical Areas Program, Group Quarter and Transitory Location Identification project, and Urban Growth Area Boundary Delineation pro- gram. Our office has been the lead organization for the 2020 Census State Complete Count Committee, which is 69 dedicated to achieving a true count of the population, specifically through increasing self -response and aware- ness of non- response follow up. Reduced Census Self -Response Rates Undermine Data Quality 23. A census, by definition, is a count of everyone. If 2020 Census follow -up efforts are cut short, it will no longer be a census, but instead a sample. As the name \"sample \" implies, not everyone will be counted \u2014and certain areas will suffer more as a result, because re- sponse rates are different across population groups in different areas. 24. We know variation in response rates is not ran- domly distributed. The U.S. Census Bureau has done extensive research and documented which areas had low self-response rate s in the 2010 Census and which areas are likely to have low response rates in the 2020 Census. Their predictive \"Hard To Count \" scores are a guide to which communities are likely to be adversely impacted by an incomplete census. The Census Bureau itself notes that these communities are likely to have higher concentrations of racial and ethnic minorities, people with lower incomes, homeless individuals, undocument ed immigrants, children and young people, those with less consistent internet access, and those with higher levels of distrust for the government, among other character- istics. The current 2020 Census self -response rate map and data show many of the predicted Hard To Count ar- eas do indeed have lower 2020 response rates at this time. If the 2020 Census is rushed or ended early, ar- eas with low rates now are likely to have low rates when the census is complete. In the end, areas that are un- der-counted are likely to receive fewer resources than 70 they deserve because the census data will show propor- tionally fewer people there. 25. In terms of modeling, a botched census will im- pact population forecasts for years. A general rule of thumb in forecasting is that you need an indicator that goes back in time as far as you are forecasting forward in time. As mentioned above, OFM annually creates a 30-year population forecast by age and sex. As a re- sult, the 2020 census data will be used in forecasting un- til at least the 2050 census data is available, and proba- bly longer. Many estimate and forecast models rely on information about changes in trends over time. An in- accurate census this year will change the relationships in the data between censuses and make all future esti-mates and forecasts based on these trends less accurate. Those communities with low response rates are more likely to have less accurate estimated and forecasted populations than areas with consistent complete counts. Unreliable census data will impact the resources areas receive based on estimated or forecasted population. 26. Many of o ur estimates and forecasts use a \" top down approach \" (which the Census Bureau also uses for its own estimates). With the top down approach, we first estimate or forecast the state's total population, and all political subdivisions are aligned with (or \" fit\") to the state total. This fitting is not random: it is based on existing data sources. The federal decennial census is one of the most important data sources in that pro- cess. Fitting is often done on a proportional basis. If federal census counts are low in some but not all areas, the areas with low counts are likely to be allocated fewer people over time. 71 27. To take an example, local officials in several com- munities in Eastern Washington have reported that, fol- lowing a series of fires there in 20 14 and 2015, they were denied FEMA aid because too few people were reported to live there\u2014 a result directly attributable to low census self-response rates that resulted in an undercount in 2010. While anecdotal, this example illustrates how low self -respo nse rates, resulting in low official popula- tion counts, can impact communities during times of cri- sis. 28. Poor quality census data will harm Washington's ability to carry out the population data functions re- quired by law both in the short term and the lon g term. We have been working with state and local partners for decades. OFM has very good working relationships because we produce high quality data products people can rely upon. A poor census could jeopardize those relationships as inaccurate or unrel iable census data fil- ters into our estimates, reflecting poorly on us. Bro- ken relationships and lost trust are not in the State's best interest: they will cost the state in the long run. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge , the foregoing is true and correct.

DONALD J. TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF SUSAN BROWER Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746(2), I, Susan Brower, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. Because I have not yet served as State Demographer during a redis- tricting cycle, some of what I know and expect to occur related to my role in redistricting is based on infor- mation available to me as State Demographer, including business records. 2. I obtained my Ph.D. in sociology and population studies from the University of Michigan. 3. I am the State Demographer for the State of Minnesota. As State Demographer, I oversee the Min- nesota State Demographic Center ( \"the Center \"). By statute, I am appointed by the Commissioner of Admin- istration. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 4A.02(a). My duties are iden- in Section 4A.02(b), and include gathering and de- veloping demographic data relevant to the state; serving as the liaison to the United States Bureau of the Census; 74 coordinating state and federal demographic activities; and aiding the state legislature in preparing a census data plan and form for each decennial census. I have been employed as the Minnesota State Demographer since 2012. 4. The Center works to ensure a full count and re- duce non -response rates and undercounting. In Min- nesota, the groups that are more likely to be under- counted include: (a) tho se with language barriers; (b) residents who are highly mobile and/or homeless; (c) residents who are lower income; (d) residents with lower education levels; (e) children; (f) people of color because of the correlation with high mobility, low income, and low education levels; (g) rural populations; and (h) im- migrants and non -citizens. 5. Based on the 2010 census mail return rates, 150,000 Minnesota residents (or about 2.5%) are consid- ered https://mn.gov/admin/demography/census2020/ccc/hard tocount/. 6. You can also estimate hard to count numbers by using the ROAM database. This is a census bureau da- tabase called the 2018 planning database. ROAM vis- ually maps the 2018 planning database. Using a re- gression analysis, ROAM estimates what proportion of each tract will not respond to the census by mail. For Minnesota, the estimate is 941,000 (or about 17%). These individuals are those who are not likely to return their mailed census forms, and require additional follow up to obtain survey responses. This is based on the American Community Survey, that reflect changes that 75 have occu rred in Minnesota since the last census. See U.S. Census Bureau, 2018 Planning Database, Minne- sota State Demographic Center Population Estimates. 7. Over the past few years, thousands of Minneso- tans representing non- profit groups, communities of color, communities of faith, the business community, tribal nations, and local governments have been working together with the Center to reduce non -response rates and make sure all Minnesotans are counted in the 2020 Census. By making sure we count each resident o f Minnesota, we ensure that Minnesota gets proper rep- resentation in the federal government, state legislative districts are drawn to take into account all the people who live there, and assure the proper allocation of over $15 billion in federal funds that help support Minne- sota's schools, hospitals, agriculture, first responders, roads, businesses, and households. The Center's budget for these efforts is a total of $1,885,00, across three years; that does not include the $95,000 budgeted for the Local Upd ate of Census Addresses program. 8. The Center's efforts to ensure a complete count have included hiring additional communications staff; grants and training for local Complete Count Commit- tees; targeted mailing of print materials to residents with PO boxe s; sending over 1 million text messages to residents on Census Day; apartment canvassing; work- ing with the Minnesota Department of Commerce to provide Census information with LIHEAP application materials; working with the Minnesota Department of Revenue to provide Census information with communi- cations about low income tax credits; and training librar- ians to set up questionnaire assistance centers. 76 9. Once the COVID -19 pandemic began, the Center shifted its efforts to mailing print materials and online phon e banking. The Center has been tracking re- sponse rates and targeting residents living in areas with the lowest response rates. 10. To date, approximately 30% of Minnesotans still needs to be counted. This group largely consists of the hard -to-count popul ations described above. The re- cent decision to shorten the non -response follow up pe- riod by one month will make a complete count even more challenging. 11. Furthermore, I anticipate that the Presidential Memorandum about who will be counted for apportion- ment will have a negative impact in Minnesota. Based on my training, education, and experience, I am con- cerned that Minnesota residents will be less likely to re- spond to the census due to the Presidential Memoran- dum. The Memorandum sends the message that un- documented immigrants do not count, which conflicts with our \" We Count. Minnesota. \" messaging that em- phasizes \"Counting Every Minnesotan. \" See, e.g. , https://mn.gov/admin/2020 -census/ . 12. In addition, the Memorandum could harm the quality of the census data. If the Census Bureau were to rely more heavily on proxy responses in the 2020 Cen-sus, it would degrade the quality of the data and impact the usability of the data for Minnesota. The Census Bureau's own research shows that proxy responses have higher item non -response than those responses col- lected by household members. This means that de- tailed information such as race, age, sex is more likely 77 to be left unanswered with some types of proxy respond- ents. See https://www.census.gov/pred/www/rpts/ O.5. PDF 13. For questions that are answered by proxy re- spondents, there is evidence that some types of infor- mation are reported less accurately. Data on the age of household members, for example, are more likely to reported in numbers ending in 5 or 0 wh en a proxy is the resp ondent. See http://www.asasrms.org/Proceedings/ y2005/files/JSM2005 -000443.pdf This type of rounding error, called \" age heaping \" has a range of implications for the usability of the data. It degrades the quality of the data for any purpose that relies on accurate infor- mation about the age of residents \u2014including rates of death, disease prevalence, disability, and rates geographic mobility, among many others. 14. The Center needs accurate age data to be able to produce high -quality population projections which are then are used by the state, regional planners, counties and school districts to plan for future transportation, ed- ucation, and housing needs. For example, the Center has provided the following services that would be im- pact ed by poorer quality census data: State planning related to COVID -19. I re- cently provided an analysis for a state agency based on census data to show the number of chil- dren to parents of essential workers and the number of children and families potentia lly im- pacted by school closings. The Center has provided race and ethnicity data to the state courts, to ensure racial proportion- ality in jury pool selection. 78 The Center has detailed differing local commu- nity conditions (poverty, age structure, labor force participation, etc.) to help equitably dis- tribute resources, such as the Small Cities De- velopment Grant program and Public Facilities Authority infrastructure funds, both adminis- tered the Minnesota Department of Employ- ment and Economic Development. The Center has compiled age and sex data annu- ally for the Minnesota Department of Health's biennial report to the MN Legislature describ-ing the burden of cancer. Detail the number and percent of children under age 18 living in poverty for the Minnesota D e- partment of Education's needs assessment of the Preschool Development Grant. The Center has estimated the migration of young Minnesotans to help the Minnesota Office of Higher Education understand the implica-tions of setting up college savings accounts for young children. The Center has produced estimates of the vot- ing-age population by city for the Minnesota Secretary of State's office. 15. A Census undercount will also negatively affect redistricting in Minnesota. As liaison between the Cen- sus Burea u and the State of Minnesota with respect to redistricting, I inform the Census Bureau about the type of and format of data the State of Minnesota needs and wants to complete its redistricting. In order to identify what the State needs and wants in connection with re- districting, I anticipate communicating with the State of 79 Minnesota legislative redistricting committees. Those committees have not been formed yet for the 2020 Cen- sus; based on the process for redistricting following the 2010 census, I expect each party caucus (one Republican and one Democratic Farmer Labor ( \"DFL \")) to form one committee per legislative chamber, such that there are four redistricting committees. I also anticipate working with the redistricting committees to send them the census data file from the Census Bureau and help them understand the data. 16. The federal decennial census has an effect on re- districting. Public Law 94- 171 establishes that the Cen- sus Bureau must provide population data to all states within one year of the day the census is conducted. In Minnesota, upon receipt of the population data, the Gov- ernor then files a certified copy of the official census population counts with the Office of the Secretary of State. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 600.18. Those certified census re- sults are the official counts that are used to determine the population of every political subdivision in Minne- sota. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 600.18. Specifically, the Minnesota Legislature and local governments use \" block \" popula- tion counts to redistrict electio n districts. 17. State statute also provides that the political sub- divisions of the state \"for all purposes . . . shall be deemed to have the population thereby disclosed [in the certified copy of the federal census]. \" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 600.18. 18. In Minnesota, congressional and state legislative districts are redrawn after each U.S. Census. Even if the number of federal districts remains the same, the district borders are changed to make sure each district has approximately the same number of people in it. In 80 Minnesota, there are 67 state senate districts; each sen- ate district is divided into two house districts, for a total of 201 state legislative districts. Right now, Minnesota has eight congressional districts. Minnesota's nonpar- tisan Legislative Coordinating Commission is responsi- ble for assisting the legislature in carrying out its redis- tricting responsibilities under Minn. Stat. \u00a7 2.91. New congressional and legislative districts must be deter-mined at least twenty -five weeks before the prima ry election in the year ending in two (i.e., 2022). Minn. Stat. \u00a7 204B.14, subd. 1a. The redistricting process may happen through consensus among the four legisla- tive caucuses (House Republican Caucus, House DFL 1 Caucus, Senate Republican Caucus, and the Senate DFL Caucus), which is then passed by the legislature and signed by the Governor. Or, the redistricting pro- cess may occur as a result of a special redistricting panel appointed by the Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Jus-tice, which occurred following the 2010 census. 19. A census undercount would negatively affect Minnesota's representational interest. For example, if residents do not participate in the census, due to higher numbers of noncitizens in Minneapolis, an undercount means that Minneapolis will likely lose representation in the state legislature, and other parts of the state will have greater representation. Cities in Minnesota with the highest number of noncitizens are Rochester, Brook-lyn Park, Minneapolis, and St. Paul. 20. A loss of representation in the state legislature would harm residents in Minneapolis and other cities 1 DFL stands for Democratic -Farmer- Labor, Minnesota's Dem- ocratic party. 81 where the population is undercounted, because residents of those undercounted areas have less voice in their state government, and the one person, one vote stand- ard is potentially violated. 21. I am also aware of the impact of decennial census population counts on state/local funding and budgets. A number of programs use the census data in formulas for distributing funding. 22. For example, the distribution of road funds is af- fected by the decennial census. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 162.09 (census determines populations of cities for municipal state -aid street fund), 162.13 (funds are distributed in part based on the percentage that the population bears to the total popul ation of all cities qualifying for munici- pal state -aid street fund). In 2017, $173,218,364 in mu- nicipal state -aid street funds were apportioned by the State to 148 municipalities. See http://www.dot.state. mn.us/safinance/appmt/mnutdf -2017.pdf. Trunk high- way funds are distributed based on population. Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 161.081, subd. 3, 162.081, subd. 4. In 2017, $1,214,069,182 in trunk highway funds were spent by the State. 23. Education funding is also affected by census data. The population of a school district is to be certi- fied from the most recent federal census, except in any year in which no federal census is taken. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 275.14. Community education programs provide learn- ing and involvement opportunities for people of all ages including providing school district residents with the op- portunity to utilize educational facilities and programs during non- school hours. The amount of money avail- able to school districts for community education funding 82 is affected by the district's population, as defined by Section 275.14. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 124D.20. 24. Local Government Aid ( \"City LGA \"), one mech- anism to determine \"population \" is the \"most recent fed- eral census. \" Minn. Stat. \u00a7 477A.011. The funding provided to cities and towns is a function of their popu- lation. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 477A.011, subd. 34 (city rev- enue \"need \" is determined by population, or housing percentage, which is defined by Census data), 477A.013, subd. 1 (town aid based in part on population), 477A.013, subds. 8 -9 (city funds based in part on funding \" need \"). In 2018, the total amount of LGA certified for all cities was $534,398,012. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 477A.03, subd. 2a. 25. In my experience, these funding formulas are designed based on the Legislature's intent to target funding to certain populations \u2014of certain sizes or spe- cific characteristics. If the funding formula assump- tions are incorrect \u2014for example, based on inaccurate census data numbers \u2014then the funding will not be dis- tributed consistent with the Legislature's intent. It also means certain residents will not have access to the same amount of funding they would otherwise be entitled to, had the count been accurate. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoin g is true and correct.

TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF STEVEN K. CHOI STEVEN K. CHOI, pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, declares under penalty of perjury as fol- lows: 1. I am the Executive Director of the New York Immigration Coalition ( \"NYIC \"). In that capacity, I am responsible in part for NYIC's education and out- reach efforts around the 2020 Census. I am also one of the NYIC executives responsible for the organization's budgeting, fundraising, and policy priorities. I have been the Executive Director of NYIC for over seven 85 years. I am over 18 years old. I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth in this declaration. 2. NYIC is an umbrella policy and advocacy organ- ization for nearly 200 groups in New York State, repre- senting the collective interests of New York's diverse immigrant communities and organizations. NYIC is headquartered at 131 West 33rd St, New York, NY 10001. 3. NYIC's mission is to unite immigrants, m em- bers, and allies so that all New Yorkers can thrive. NYIC envisions a New York State that is stronger be-cause all people are welcome, treated fairly, and given the chance to pursue their dreams. NYIC pursues so- lutions to advance the interests of New York's diverse immigrant communities and advocates for laws, policies, and programs that lead to justice and opportunity for all immigrant groups. It seeks to build the power of im- migrants and the organizations that serve them to en- sure their sustainabili ty, improve people's lives, and strengthen New York State. 4. As Executive Director of NYIC, I have extensive familiarity with NYIC's membership and I am aware that NYIC's 200 plus member and partner organizations that are committed to advancing work on im migrant jus- tice, empowerment, and integration. NYIC's member organizations \u2014located throughout New York State and beyond \u2014all share NYIC's mission to serve and support the empowerment of immigrant communities. NYIC's members include grassroots community gr oups, social services providers, large -scale labor institutions, and or- ganizations working in economic, social, and racial jus-tice. Representatives of NYIC's member organizations serve on the NYIC Board of Directors. 86 5. The Decennial Census is a critical and constitutionally -mandated data -gathering instrument, used to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars in fed- eral resources and to apportion political power at the federal, state, and local levels. NYIC has an ongoing commitment to promoting engagem ent in the 2020 De- cennial Census among its members and constituents be-cause a complete and accurate Census count is critical to ensuring that our members receive the government funding and full political representation to which they are entitled to. We, o ur members, their members, and all New Yorkers benefit when our state has its full com-plement of Congressional representatives and electoral votes, as well as adequate funding for the facilities, pro- grams, and services they use which receive Census - guided federal funding. These facilities and services include parents with children enrolled in schools that re- ceive funding under Title I of the Elementary and Sec- ondary Education Act; families whose children benefit from insurance funded by the State Children's Health Insurance Program; drivers who use interstate high-ways and mass transit on a daily basis and thus depend on federal highway funds to perform their jobs; and peo- ple who rely on housing assistance through various funding provided under Sect ion 8, among other Census - guided funding streams. Promoting Census response can help ensure that the programs, services, and facili- ties that our members rely upon are adequately funded. 6. As such, NYIC, its member organizations, and the communities we serve all have a fundamental inter- est in ensuring as complete and accurate a Decennial Census as possible. 87 7. I have been extensively and personally involved in the research, development, and implementation of NYIC's 2020 Census education and outreach progra ms. To develop programs that achieve NYIC's goals of en- couraging greater Census participation in the communi- ties we serve, I have researched and gained familiarity with the importance of data gathered from the Census in apportioning political representation and the alloca- tion of some government funding sources. I have re- searched the concerns of our members and the commu-nities we serve around the Census for the purpose of de- veloping effective Census communications directed at immigrant communities. I have also researched how the communities we serve would be impacted by an un- dercount toward the end of designing communications and organizing strategies that address those concerns and increase their civic engagement, and Cens us partic- ipation in particular. 8. Because a complete and accurate count is critical to ensuring that our member organizations and the com- munities they serve receive the government funding and full political representation to which they are entitled, NYIC has an ongoing commitment to pro moting en- gagement in the Decennial Census among individuals served by its member organizations. 9. Because the Decennial Census requires a direct inquiry of every person in the United States, NYIC has invested significant organizational resources in encour- aging our members and the immigrant communities we serve to respond to the Census. 10. NYIC's education and outreach efforts for the 2020 Census have been underway for more than two years now. Since the beginning of 2018, it has helped 88 form New York Counts 2020, a growing, non -partisan coalition of more than 100 diverse organizational stake- holders across New York to advocate for a fair and com- plete enumeration, for which it serves as facilitator and convenor. This broad -based coalition, which was for- mally launched in March 2018, is composed of racial, eth- nic, immigrant, religious, health, education, labor, hous- ing, social services, and business groups working in partnership with state and local government officials. NYIC has invested resources to solidify the work and reach of New York Counts 2020 through robust advo- cacy, outreach, and mass educational forums, including coordinating \"train the trainer \" sessions throughout the state to equip leaders with tools to educate their com-munities on the importance o f the Census; devising ef- fective messaging to convince hard -to-reach to participate; empowering coalition members to as- sist their communities in completing the Census online; hosting conferences; developing and disseminating tool - kits and advoc ating to ensure that there are no unneces- sary barriers impeding marginalized communities from being counted while also ensur ing their privacy is pro- tected. 11. NYIC has also invested in Census education and outreach work in addition to the organization's w ork with the New York Counts 2020 Coalition. This work in- cludes, among other things, general education programs, workshops for members, presentations to ser vice organi- zations, such as legal service organizations, at \"Key to the City \" Events, and person -to-person outreach through phone and text -banking. We have also engaged in dig- ital organizing around the Census, including through webinars and presentations streamed over Facebook 89 Live. NYIC has continued Census education and out- reach during the pandemic and plans to continue en- couraging people to fill out the questionnaire, and sup- porting its membership in doing so, until the response period closes. 12. Our education and outreach efforts to encourage our members and people in the communities we serve to respond to the Census emphasizes two essential pur- poses of the headcount: (1) Determining political ap- portionment, including the number of representatives each state will have in Congress, the number of electors per state in the electoral college, and the boundaries and composition of Congressional districts; and (2) Deter- mining how much government funding communities will receive for matters such as education, public housing, transportation, and health care. Our education and outreach efforts also emphasi ze that the Census counts every resident of the United States, regardless of age, citizenship status, or ability to vote. This message is important because it affirms the humanity and dignity of all Americans and the responsibility that all Ameri- cans, including undocumented Americans, bear for re-sponding to the Census and ensuring that their home states and communities are allocated their fair share of political power and government funding. An example of one of our Census education and outreach documents is available at https://newyorkcounts2020.org/nyic -getting - immigrants -counted/ . We have relied upon infor- mation provided by the United States Census Bureau and other government agencies in drafting this docu- ment and other materials. 90 13. NYIC has been an d remains committed to Cen- sus education and outreach work in part because immi- grants and communities of color have been historically undercounted by the Census. Through my work and the work of my colleagues in immigrant communities, we understand that one reason that immigrants and com- munities of color have been undercounted is their reluc- tance to trust government officials and their fear of turning over personal information to the government due to potential adverse consequences with respect to their own immigration or the status of others in their households. 14. NYIC has already faced a challenging environ- ment for conducting outreach and encouraging immi- grant communities to respond to the 2020 Census be- cause of the heightened fear of immigrant communitie s towards interacting with government workers as a re-sult of the Trump Administration's persistently hostile and discriminatory actions and attitudes towards immi-grants of color. Among the racist and xenophobic acts that the Trump Administration has undertaken include separating children from their families at the border and keeping immigrant children in cages; banning indi- viduals from six majority Arab and/or Muslim countries from entering the United States; attempting to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed 800,000 individuals \u201490% of whom are Latino \u2014brought to this country as children to legally reside and work in the United States; rescinding Tem- porary Protected Status programs for individuals from El Salvador, H onduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Nepal; calling for an end to the diversity visa lottery; dramati- cally increasing interior enforcement raids in communi-ties across the United States; proposing to end family -91 based immigration, which would disproportionately harm immigrants from Latin America and Asia; refer- ring to some undocumented immigrants as \"animals \"; and attempting to include a citizenship question on the Census. instituting the \"Public Charge \" rule or \"wealth test, \" which has undermined access to critical healthcare and deterred immigrant New Yorkers from seeking important services; conducting ICE enforce-ment activity at City and State courthouses, which has prevented immigrant New Yorkers from accessing jus-tice; changing the rules of the asylum system, effectively cutting off humanitarian relief for those who need it most; attacking the family reunification immigration system and implementing an executive order shutting down most legal immigration into the United States. NYIC has consistently fought the se efforts to intimidate and marginalize immigrants of color in the courts, in the streets, and at the ballot box. 15. In the course of developing, implementing, and supervising NYIC's Census education and outreach work with its members and the communities they serve, including NYIC's work with the New York Counts 2020 coalition, I have observed that New York immigrant communities' heightened fear of interacting with gov- ernment workers has increased even further since the issuance of the July 21, 2020 Presi dential Memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce on the subject of \"Exclud- ing Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base Follow-ing the 2020 Census \" (\"Presidential Memorandum \"). The Presidential Memorandum is making our efforts to encourage Census participa tion more difficult. The Presidential Memorandum is sowing confusion and fear about the Census among the communities we serve. 92 16. The Administration's decision to exclude some non-citizens from the apportionment base directly and severely undermines our Census education and out- reach materials and programming by contradicting its core messages and discouraging Census response. 17. First, by excluding undocumented people from the apportionment count, the Presidential Memoran- dum creates confusion by contradicting one of the two core purposes of the Census that NYIC, its members, and its New York Counts 2020 coalition partners high-light in their education and outreach programming. Because the President has said that the Census re- sponses of some non -citizens w ill not be used for Con- gressional apportionment, some people may now neglect or decline to fill out the Census because of its diminished importance. The Presidential Memorandum dilutes the efficacy of our existing materials and programming, which will req uire NYIC to divert resources from other programmatic areas to conduct additional education and outreach to get the same number of people to respond to the Census questionnaire. By contradicting the mes- sage that filling out the Census is important to Cong res- sional apportionment, people in the communities will discount the value of our current education and outreach materials or programs, requiring us to make new mate- rials or conduct new outreach that addresses the Presi- dential Memorandum. We have engaged in member updates, press releases, press briefings and are now de- veloping messaging and social media campaigns to ad-dress the fact that everyone can and should still be counted in the Census. NYIC staff members have also had to divert time from other activities to respond to in- quiries from local media about this issue to assure peo-93 ple that everyone, regardless of their immigration sta- tus, should fill out the Census questionnaire; that their responses to the Census are private, confidential, and will no t be used against them by ICE or other law en- forcement agencies; and that every person will be counted for apportionment purposes. 18. Second, by excluding undocumented people from the apportionment count, the Presidential Memoran- dum dehumanizes and margin alizes undocumented res- idents by excluding them from the category of \" persons \" required by the Constitution to be included in the appor- tionment count. Furthermore, the exclusion of undocu- mented immigrants from the apportionment base in the Presidential Mem orandum indicates efforts by the Ad- ministration to identify where undocumented immigrants live and their numbers in order to exclude them from the Census. By undermining our messaging about the purpose of the Census and further marginalizing and confusing immigrants who are already among the popu- lation most often overlooked by the Census, the Presi- dential Memorandum makes it less likely that the immi- grant communities and communities of color we serve will be responsive to our Census education and outreach efforts. 19. Third, NYIC has also received an increased num- ber of questions from our member organizations and the public about the privacy and confidentiality of responses to the Census questionnaire since the Presidential Mem- orandum. NYIC's members and members of the com- munities we all serve are concerned that the Presiden- tial Memorandum's exclusion of people \"not in lawful im- migration status \" from the Census base count indicates that the Administration will use information from the 94 Census to attempt to i dentify undocumented immi- grants for deportation or other adverse consequences. NYIC is planning to conduct more education and out- reach than we would have otherwise to address those concerns and to assure people that they can respond to the Census without fear of immigration enforcement consequences for themselves or their families. 20. NYIC and its members will be forced to expend more resources than initially anticipated to try to reduce the negative effect of the President's announcement of the decision to exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base on Census response rates in the immigrant communities of color it serves. NYIC ex- pects that it will need to interact with its constituents more times than previously planned to try to convince them to participate in the 2020 census. NYIC expects that it will now need to spend more resources to reach the same number of people, and that ultimately, it will be less successful in convincing its constituents to par-ticipate in the 2020 Census due in large part to the Ad- ministration's decision to exclude undocumented immi- grants from the apportionment base. 21. NYIC will have to increase staff time and spend- ing devoted to its Census education and outreach efforts by approximately 20% percent over previously antici-pated levels to address the Presidential Memorandum. 22. Because of the need to increase the time and money spent on Census outreach due to the fear and/or confusion generated by the Presidential Memorandum, NYIC will need to divert resources f rom other areas critical to its mission including civic engagement and community organizing on other issues, including helping the immigrant community navigate the impacts of 95 COVID -19 and the unfolding economic crisis/recession, and preparing for the upcoming federal elections, which are critical programmatic areas right now. I have per- sonally spent at least ten hours on Census -related work that I would have otherwise spent on other areas of work, which includes the areas listed above in addition to organi zational management to our additional educa- tion and outreach efforts. 23. NYIC puts significant resources in Census edu- cation and outreach work because our members and the immigrant communities we serve face significant nega-tive consequences in the event o f an undercount. 24. Unfortunately, NYIC will have less time than anticipated to address the fear and confusion caused by the Presidential Memorandum among the immigrant communities that NYIC serves. The actual counting period of the Census is only a few months, but the con-sequences of the Census in terms of political power and funding allocation last for a decade. At the time the President Memorandum was published on July 21, there were 102 days remaining in the enumeration period, which was then schedul ed to end on October 31. How- ever, on July 31, the Census Bureau abruptly acceler- ated the end of the enumeration period to September 30. With only 55 days left in the headcount, every single day remaining is a critical opportunity for NYIC, its mem- bers, and its coalition partners to conduct further Cen- sus outreach and increase response rates in New York that have been below national averages, particularly in counties with large immigrant populations. NYIC will have to accelerate its remaining Census educ ation and outreach efforts to address the Presidential Memoran- dum's negative effect on Census responses. 96 25. Since the Presidential Memorandum, NYIC has had to divert resources to change its Census outreach messaging to combat the misinformation about appo r- tionment, as well as the discriminatory nature of the Presidential Memorandum and the President's remarks accompanying the memorandum. NYIC has had to di- vert resources from other programs areas to increase its outreach efforts to undocumented and other i mmigrant communities in our organization's Get -Out-The-Count efforts. At this late stage of the enumeration, NYIC had anticipated its Census efforts to be limited to e du- cation, strategy and outreach \u2014with however, due the Presidential Mem- orandum, NYIC must now divert significant time from senior leadership, communications, member engage-ment and communication engagement te ams, constitut- ing about 10 percent of their time, to combat the fear and disinformation resulting from this memorandum. 26. As Executive Director, my decision to authorize NYIC's increased investment in Census education and outreach work has been driven in part by the concerns of our member organizations and the communities they serve have raised about the Presidential Memorandum. NYIC's management, including Ms. Joshi and Ms. Anand, remains in regular communication with staff and man- agement at member orga nizations about the issues and policies affecting immigrant communities in New York. 27. NYIC's member organizations, including AMPHS, Chhaya CDC, and Neighbors Link, have reported to Ms. Joshi and Ms. Anand, who each work with me in making 97 decisions for NYIC regarding our investments in Cen- sus outreach, that our member organizations and our communications teams are reporting that the immigrant communities of color they serve are expressing reluc- tance to participate in the Census since the announce-ment of the Presidential Memorandum, which contrib- utes to the culture of fear. They have also reported to me through their work in NY Counts 2020 that counties working on the Census in New York State are concerned that the messaging around the Presidential Memora n- dum will depress the participation of immigrants in the Census. In particular, Ms. Joshi, Ms. Anand, and other NYIC staff have observed and reported to me that im- migrants of color have expressed fear that the Presiden- tial Memorandum indicates to them that answering the Census will give a hostile administration information that may be used by agencies like Immigration and Cus- toms Enforcement or other parts of the Trump Admin- istration that have been used to intimidate and margin-alize immigrants. I declare u nder penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Dated: Aug. 6, 2020 New York, New York /s/ STEVEN K. CHOI STEVEN K. CHOI 98 Exhibit 15 99 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 20 Civ. 5770 (JMF) STATE OF NEW YORK, ET AL ., PLAINTIFFS v. DONALD J. TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF MICHAEL E. CLINE Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746(2), I, Michael E. Cline, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. I am the State Demographer of North Carolina and work in the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management. Annually, I estimate the total popula- tion of 100 counties and 551 municipalities, the projec- tion of state and county populations, and analyze the im- plication of demographic trends for state agency plan- ning and budgets. I have been employed by the State of North Car olina since 2017 and have worked, in vary- ing capacities, with decennial census data since after the 1990 Census. 3. Housing, household, and demographic charac- teristics obtained every ten years are critical to the func- tioning of my office and the population estimates, popu- lation projections, and demographic analyses that I pro-100 duce. In turn, my population estimates are used in for- mulas that are used to distribute state revenues to local communities to support schools, transportation infra- structure, art progr ams, libraries, emergency services, parks programs, and other things. In addition, annu- ally, we produce county population estimates and popu- lation projections of up to twenty years into the future. These population estimates and projections provide de-tailed data by sex, race, age, and ethnicity for the state and for our 100 counties and are used within state gov- ernment in order to plan for and fund schools, roads and public transportation programs, aging services, public health services, economic development, etc. In addi- tion, local governments, nonprofit groups and private in- dustry use our demographic projections for their own programmatic and business planning. 4. There is no other source for comprehensive pop- ulation, household, and housing coun ts than the decen- nial census. While our annual estimates are prepared by using data from other sources (including vital statis- tics and administrative data) the census provides an im-portant benchmark for which to validate and adjust our models every ten years. Of our municipalities, 60% (330) have populations of less than 5,000. The decen- nial census is the most accurate source of information to obtain average household size and housing occupancy \u2014 critical values needed for the estimation of municipal populations (sample estimates produced by the Ameri- can Community Survey for small areas such as these do not provide precise estimates). Without this infor- mation, it will be more difficult to produce accurate pop-ulation estimates for these smaller municipali ties in fu- ture years. 101 5. In order to produce population projections, our office needs detailed historical census counts \u2014including population by age, sex, race, and ethnicity. These data are essential for understanding trends in the different components of population change\u2014 natural increase (births minus deaths) and net migration (i n-migration minus out- migration). These comprehensive historical benchmarks every ten years combined with vital statis- tics data help us understand how our state and counties in our state are changing in order to develop assump- tions about future change (including assumptions re- garding future birth, mortality, and migration rates). Census population counts are used in denominators to calculate rates and thus an undercount (or over count) of any particular population grouping (by race/ethnicity/ sex/age), can contribute to over - or underestimating cer- tain populations and the total population overall. This may lead to a greater risk of the state and local govern- ments to either be unprepared for future population needs (such as not building schools when school aged populations are under -estimated) or building infrastruc- ture that is not needed (when populations are over -esti- mated). 6. According to the US Census Bureau's own anal- ysis of the 2010 Census, at 7.6%, North Carolina had the seventh largest omission rate among the 50 states and District of Columbia1. These omission rates were 1 Mule, Thomas, \" Census Coverage Measurement Estimation Report: Summary of Estimates of Coverage for Persons in the United States ,\" U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Statistical Studies Division, May 22, 2012. 102 highly correlated with mail -in response rates (as re- sponse rates decreased \u2014omission rates increased)2. While imputation methods and differentials in under- counts may overcome these omissions, there remains a risk that certain groups will be excluded from the final 2020 results. Those at risk of being excluded include persons of color, young children, and r ural populations3. Thirty -eight percent of North Carolina's population are people of color \u2014including rapidly growing Hispanic and Asian populations and the second largest American In- dian population east of the Mississippi River4.

DONALD J. TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF SARA CULLINANE Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746(2), I, Sara Cullinane, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. I am the co -founder and Director of Make the Road New Jersey (\" Make the Road NJ \"), a community - based immigrants' rights organization with centers in Elizabeth, Pa ssaic, and Perth Amboy New Jersey \u2014 three cities with significant foreign -born populations. I have worked on immigrants' rights issues for the past fifteen years as a community organizer and an attorney. As Director of Make the Road NJ, I oversee the organ i- zation's community organizing and education programs, as well as our legal services department, which repre-sents individuals in immigration proceedings. Prior to founding Make the Road NJ in late 2014, I represented immigrants in labor and employment pro ceedings. I am also a member of the Complete Count Committee of Union County, Passaic, and Elizabeth, NJ. I served as 105 a commissioner for the New Jersey Complete Count Commission. 3. Make the Road NJ's mission is to build the power of immigrant and workin g-class communities through community organizing, legal services, policy advocacy, and transformative education. Annually, we serve more than 10,000 immigrant families by providing Know Your Rights trainings, legal services, worker safety trainings, ESL c lasses, and youth development pro- grams. The majority of immigrants we serve are non - citizens from Latin America. We also convene a statewide network of Deferred Action for Childhood Ar- rivals ( \"DACA \") recipients. 4. The Trump Administration's immigration poli- cies have made the immigrant communities that Make the Road NJ serves reluctant to engage with federal or state government representatives and have had a pro- found impact on immigrants and their U.S. citizen fami-lies in New Jersey. 5. Over the past year, our organization has held more than 30 events to educate immigrant communities about the census and to inform them of their responsi- bility to respond to the census. These activities include town halls, community forums, a census march where community mem bers handed out thousands of flyers to inform Passaic's immigrant communities about the cen-sus, and online forums. Make the Road NJ has also trained immigrant volunteers to become census out-reach ambassadors to inform other community mem- bers about the importance of responding to the census. I am a member of three local Complete Count Commit- tees, and our staff serve on another two committees (Middlesex and Passaic County). Our organization 106 also chairs a subgroup of immigrant community organi- zations that st rategizes about how to conduct outreach and share resources across the state. Through these efforts, we have reached more than 10,000 individuals, the majority of whom are immigrants, many of whom may be undocumented. 6. S ince President Trump issued the \"Memoran- dum on Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportion- ment Base Following the 2020 Census \" (the Presidential Memorandum) on July 21, Make the Road New Jersey has received numerous comments from community mem- bers, including immigrants and U.S. citizen fa mily mem- bers of immigrants about the Presidential Memoran-dum. Our organizers have had conversations with more than 50 community members about the Presidential Memorandum and have shared information on social media that has engaged more than 1,000 individuals. 7. The Presidential Memorandum states that it is U.S. policy to \"exclude from the apportionment base al- iens who are not in lawful immigration status under the Immigration and Nationality Act. \" Community mem- bers have expressed fear and resignation, observing that the Presidential Memorandum makes clear that they will not be counted in the census. For example, during a call with a number of members, a community member told one of our organizers t hat she was not go- ing to respond to the census because she would not be counted. 8. In addition to fomenting fears about not being counted among community members, the Presidential Memorandum has reinforced fears about immigration enforcement. The memorandum states that \" many \" individuals who are being excluded from apportionment 107 \"entered the country illegally in the first place \" and that counting them would \"create perverse incentives en- couraging violations of Federal law. \" Community members h ave expressed fear that because of the Pres- idential Memorandum, information regarding their im- migration status will not be kept confidential and will be turned over to ICE. For example, a community mem- ber recently reiterated her fear that if she responded to the census her information would not be protected from ICE. I could tell she was frightened because her voice trembled, and she told me she was scared. I worry that other community members have similar fears. 9. Overall, based on my experience and o bserva- tions, I anticipate that many immigrants and their U.S. citizen family members will choose not to respond to the Census as a whole because they believe that they will not be counted regardless of whether they answer the Census and they are frightened and anxious about what might happ en if they complete the Census (i.e., their in- formation may be shared with immigration authorities). This will lead to vast undercounting in communities of color, immigrant communities, and low -income commu- nities across Ne w Jersey. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoing is true and correct.

I am the Executive Director of FIEL Houston, Inc. (\"FIEL \"). I am over 18 years of age. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration. 2. FIEL is a nonpr ofit membership organization based in Houston. FIEL 's mission is to advocate for just laws for immigrants and their families, access to higher 110 education for all people regardless of immigration sta- tus, and access to justice for the community. To do that, FIEL engages in four core programs: access to higher education, immigration legal services, civic engagement, and community outreach. 3. FIEL has more than 11,000 members who reside in Harris County and neighboring counties in the greater Houston metropolitan area. FIEL maintains a very ac- tive membership comprised of individuals and families who receive FIEL 's services and those who volunteer in FIEL 's programmatic work, including door- to-door can- vassing, community outreach initiatives, direct actions, and public education. 4. In my capacity as Executive Director, I am respon- sible for managing the day -to-day operations of FIEL, overseeing FIEL 's communications and media out- reach, and developing FIEL 's programmatic work, in- cluding public edu cation and outreach efforts around the 2020 Decennial Census. As the founding director, I have been on staff at FIEL since May 2007. 5. FIEL members in Houston rely on a number of fa- cilities and services the funding for which is allocated based on the dat a generated by Decennial Census. These facilities and services include parents with chil- dren enrolled in schools that receive funding under Tide I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; fam- ilies whose children benefit from insurance funded by the State Children 's Health Insurance Program; drivers who use interstate highways and mass transit on a daily basis and thus depend on federal highway funds to per- form their jobs; and people who rely on housing assis- tance through various funding provided unde r Section 8, among other Census -guided funding streams. 111 6. Because a complete and accurate census count is critical to ensuring that our members receive the gov- ernment funding and full political representation to which they are entitled, FIEL has an ongoing commitment to promoting engagement in the Decennial Census among its members and constituents. In preparation for the 2010 Census, FIEL committed resources to educating immigrant communities on the importance of the Cen- sus. Since then, FIEL has b een and remains commit- ted to its Get Out the Count efforts and other Census education initiatives in part because FIEL understands that immigrants and communities of color have been consistently and routinely undercounted by the Census. 7. In the last coup le of years leading to the 2020 Cen- sus, FIEL has conducted outreach and engagement work with immigrant communities in the greater Hou- ston area to encourage Census participation. That work consists of educating constituents about the Decennial Census and i ts importance to the community \u2014in partic- ular, that the population count under the Census par-tially determines the level of governmental funding for programs and schools that our members rely on and the amount of political representation our members receive at the federal, state, and local levels. Specifically, we inform our members and the communities we serve that it is important to participate in the Census to ensure proper school funding and improve public education, topics about which our immigrant com munities care deeply. Our education and outreach efforts also em- phasize that the Census counts every resident of the United States, regardless of age, citizenship status, or ability to vote. This message is important because it affirms the humanity and d ignity of all Americans and 112 the responsibility that all Americans, including undocu- mented Americans, hear for responding to the Census and ensuring that their home states and communities are allocated their fair share of politica l power and gov- ernment fund ing. 8. FIEL is also part of a coalition of organizations par- ticipating in Harris County 's Complete Count Commit- tee, a local, community -driven initiative designed to im- prove the completeness and accuracy of the 2020 Census count in Harris County. Prior to the COVID -19 pan- demic, FIEL organized in -person forums and meetings for the public, as well as for canvassers and commu nity leaders, aimed at educating Houston residents about the purpose and uses of the Census as well as the im- portance of responding to the Census. During the pan- demic, FIEL continues to develop programs and out- reach strategies that incorporate Census education and outreach efforts. 9. From our work in the community, we understand that one reason that immig rants and communities of color have been undercounted is a fear of contact with the government and distrust of government officials. This level of fear and distrust of government among im-migrants and communities of color we serve has been exacerbated by t he Trump Administration and its offi- cials ' hostility to these communities, such as their re- peated attempts to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\" DACA \") program and their efforts to deny benefits to immigrants based on their percep- tion of immigrants as public charges. Now, Houston immigrant communities ' heightened fear of interacting with government workers has increased further due to the Administration 's attempt to exclude undocumented 113 immigrants from the apportionment base. The Memo- randum 's exclusion of undocumented immigrants cre- ates an incremental obstacle to Census participation be- cause it ties the fear and distrust of government that im- migrant communities of color have directly to the De- cennial Census count. By pursuing policies de signed to dissuade or confuse individuals about Census partici- pation, the Trump Administration has created signifi-cant challenges to the work of FIEL and its members who now have to overcome the community 's fear and lack of trust in the Census process by c ommitting more personnel and time to public education and outreach about the Census. 10. Based on my experience as FIEL 's Executive Di- rector and through my regular contacts with our mem- bers, our organizing staff, our communications staff, and the media, th e July 21, 2020 Presidential Memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce on the subject of \"Exclud- ing Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base Follow- ing the 2020 Census \" (\"Presidential Memorandum\") is making our efforts to encourage Census participation more difficult. The Presidential Memorandum is sow- ing fear and confusion about the Census among the com-munities we serve. 11. This fear and confusion is not unique to undocu- mented immigrants. Excluding undocumented immi- grants from the apportionment base will deter Census participation among the broader immigrant community, including family and household members of undocu-mented immigrants who are actually citizens or non -cit- izens with legal status. By excluding undocumented people from the apportionment count , the Presidential 114 Memorandum dehumanizes and marginalizes undocu- mented residents by excluding them from the category of \"persons \" required by the Constitution to be included in the apportionment count. Furthermore, the exclu- sion of undocumented immigrant s from the apportion- ment base in the Presidential Memorandum indicates efforts by the Administration to identify where undocu- mented immigrants live and their numbers in order to exclude them from the Census. By undermining our messaging about the purpose of the Census and further marginalizing and confusing immigrants who are al-ready among the population most often overlooked by the Census, the Presidential Memorandum makes it less likely that the immigrant communities and communities of color we serve wil l be responsive to our Census edu- cation and outreach efforts. 12. Based on conversations with members of FIEL who come from mixed -status households, I know that both citizens and non -citizens with legal status have ex- pressed concern that participating in the Census would invade their privacy and expose their family, friends, and neighborhoods to profiling by the law enforcement agencies of an administration hostile to immigrants of color. Members of the community we serve are con- cerned that the Presidentia l Memorandum' s exclusion of people \" not in lawful immigration status \" from the Census base count indicates that the Administration will use information from the Census to attempt to identify undocumented immigrants for deportation or other ad- verse consequences. 13. For example, different members of the community we serve have expressed to me their confusion about our messaging that the Census should count every person 115 regardless of immigration status based on the Admin- istration 's efforts to not count undocumented immi- grants. In some instances, members of the community have questioned our credibility as a result of the nega- tive messaging from the Administration about who should count for the Census. Further, even in my own mixed - status family, family members have questioned me on whether they should participate in the Census as a re- sult of their fears that the Government could probe into the undocumented individuals in my extended family. 14. The Administration 's decision to excl ude some non - citizens from the apportionment base directly and se- verely undermines our Census education and outreach efforts by contradicting our core messages and discour- aging Census response. FIEL is planning to conduct more education and outreach than we would have other- wise to address those concerns and to assure people that they can respond to the Census without fear of immigra- tion enforcement consequences for themselves or their families. FIEL 's increased investment in Census edu- cation, research, an d outreach, has been driven in part by concerns about the Census expressed by our mem- bers and the immigrant communities we serve. Be- cause of the information we have received concerning the heightened fear and suspicion among our members and the communitie s we serve created by the Admin- istration 's Presidential Memorandum, FIEL has re- cently had to refocus its programming and commit addi- tional resources to its Census work. FIEL will be forced to expend more resources than initially antici- pated to try to redu ce the negative effect of the Admin- istration 's policies on the response rate in the immigrant communities of color it serves. FIEL expects that it will need to interact with its constituents multiple times 116 to answer questions and try to convince them to partici- pate in the 2020 Census. 15. FIEL expects that for the remainder of the Census outreach period it will need to spend more resources to reach the same number of people and that ultimately it will be less successful in convincing its constituents to participate in the 2020 Census due to the Administra-tion's efforts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the Census apportionment base. Unfortunately, FIEL will have less time than anticipated to address the fear and confusion caused by the Presidential Memorandum among the immigrant communities that we serve. At the time the Presidential Memorandum was published on July 21, there were 102 days remaining in the non - response follow- up period, which was then scheduled to end on October 31. However, on Ju ly 31, the Census Bureau abruptly accelerated the end of non -response follow- up to September 30. With only 55 days left in the headcount, every single day remaining is a critical opportunity for FIEL to conduct further Census out- reach. FIEL will have to a ccelerate its remaining Cen- sus education and outreach efforts to address the Pres- idential Memorandum 's negative effect on Census re- sponses. FIEL anticipates having to divert approxi- mately $5,000 from other mission critical programs and services to 2020 Ce nsus education and outreach as a re- sult of the Presidential Memorandum. 16. To date, FIEL has set up both in -person forums and online forums to educate the community about the Cen- sus. We have also made an effort to include language about the Census in all of our online communications and media appearances. FIEL 's active membership has also spent over 750 personnel hours in the last year and 117 a half developing outreach strategies and researching the impact of an undercount towards the purpose of in- forming o ur members and the public about the 2020 De- cennial Census. We have also spent in -kind resources, including printing material in -house and allocating air time from our virtual studio, to explain the Census fur-ther. FIEL will have to increase staff time an d spend- ing devoted to its Census education and outreach efforts by approximately 40% percent over current levels to ad- dress the Presidential Memorandum. 17. Because of this need to increase the time and money spent on Census outreach, FIEL will need to div ert re- sources from other areas critical to its mission, including education, civic engagement, and community organizing on other issues. FIEL has already diverted resources from other areas in order to address concerns from its constituents stemming from the Presidential Memoran- dum. For example, staff time and other resources de- voted to FIEL 's Get Out the Count efforts and DACA advocacy will be diverted to communications to combat fear and disinformation resulting from the Presidential Memorandum. Moreover, FIEL has already, and will continue to, divert resources from its other organiza- tional priorities, including its work on access to educa-tion for students, to address these concerns about de- creased Census participation within immigrant commu- nities . 18. Beyond the increased fear FIEL members face due to the Trump Administration 's attack on undocumented individuals, these members also face significant nega-tive consequences in the event of an undercount. FIEL members reside in Houston, the population of which in-cludes some of the largest immigrant communities of 118 color in the state. An undercount of those populations will deprive FEEL members and the communities it serves of political influence and Census -guided funding to which they would be entitled by a more accurate count. Our members have communicated concerns to me that the exclusion of undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base will result in a significant un- derfunding of resources for all immigrant communities in Houston. 19. One of th e many FIEL members who will suffer in- jury due to the exclusion of undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base is Deyanira Palacios. Ms. Palacios is a lawful permanent resident and a resi- dent of Montgomery County, Texas. Because Ms. Pa- lacios resides in Texas, she will lose political power be- cause of Texas' loss of at least one seat in the House of Representatives. 20. Another FIEL member who will suffer injury due to the exclusion of undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base is Karen Ram os. Ms. Ramos is a resident of Harris County, Texas, where she works as a realtor. Because Ms. Ramos resides in Texas, she will lose political power because of Texas ' loss of at least one seat in the House of Representatives. Ms. Ramos is entitled to remain and work lawfully in the United States through the DACA program. She is entitled to be counted in the ongoing 2020 Decennial Census along with all other residents of Texas, regardle ss of their im- migration status. 21. While the President ial Memorandum is deterring Census participation and burdening our outreach ef- forts, potentially leaving little time to proactively en-119 gage on the Census with the communities we serve, get- ting relief from a court to clarify the fear and confusion sowed by t he Administration will allow us to do mean- ingful outreach to our constituents. Every single day available for us to carry our message to the community that everyone will count in the Census would be helpful to our outreach efforts.

KHALAF I, Samer E. Khalaf, pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, declare under penalty of perjury as fol- lows: 1. I am the National President of the American - Arab Anti -Discrimination Committee (\" ADC \") and ADC Research Institute ( \"ADCRI \"). My responsibilities in- clude overseeing all of the work of both organizations, and leading our efforts regarding the 2020 Decennial Census. 2. I am over 18 years of age and have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration. I 122 have acquired this personal knowledge after several years as ADC and ADCRI President. During that time period, I have familiarized myself with ADC 's in- ternal records and processes, our membership, includ- ing where our members live, and the Arab- American community nationwide and in specific areas in which many Arab Americans and ADC members live. 3. Before the COVID -19 outbreak, I also spent a good deal of time traveling the country a nd meeting with ADC members and other members of the Arab -Ameri- can community. Through this process, I have familiar- ized myself with prevailing views in the community con- cerning a number of issues, including the Trump Admin-istration 's treatment of Arab and Muslim Americans and immigration -related policies, and fears in the com- munity about the policies of this Administration. I also continue to meet with ADC members and other mem-bers of the Arab- American community through phone calls and video conferences, and as part of this process, I have gained personal knowledge about some of the likely effects of the recent Presidential Memorandum concerning undocumented immigrants and congres-sional apportionment on Arab Americans. 4. ADC is a civil rights membership o rganization that is committed to defending and promoting the rights and liberties of Arab Americans and other persons of Arab heritage. Senator James G. Abourezk founded ADC in 1980. Senator Abourezk was the first Arab American to serve in the United Sta tes Senate, and he founded ADC in response to stereotyping, defamation, and discrimination directed against Americans of Arab origin. ADC 's mission focuses on combating stereo- types and discrimination against and affecting the Arab -123 American community in the United States and serving as its public voice on domestic and foreign policy issues, as well as educating the American public in order to pro- mote greater understanding of Arab history and cul-ture. ADC advocates, educates, and organizes to de- fend and pro mote human rights and civil liberties of Arab Americans and other persons of Arab heritage, from recent immigrants to citizens born in the United States. ADC also participates in legal advocacy efforts on issues that have a large impact on the Arab Americ an community. 5. ADC is the largest American -Arab grassroots civil rights organization in the United States. As I detail more below, ADC has several thousand dues -paying mem- bers nationwide, with members in all 50 states including California, Texas, Florida , and New Jersey. Its mem- bers are also active through ADC 's 28 local chapters and organizing committees, located in 20 states and the Dis- trict of Columbia. Its members include both U.S. citi- zens and different types of noncitizens. 6. ADCRI was founded by Senator Abourezk in 1981. It is a corporation exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. AD- CRI sponsors a wide range of programs on behalf of Arab Americans and of consequence to the wider Amer- ican community including pro grams train Arab Ameri- cans in the exercise of their constitutional rights as citi-zens. Its work includes sponsoring and promoting re- search studies and publications, seminars, and confer- ences, which document and analyze the discrimination faced by Arab Americans in the workplace, schools, me- dia and government agencies. These programs, publi- cations and events also promote a better understanding 124 of the rich Arab cultural heritage by the public, policy makers, and the new generations of Arab Americans. ADCRI also publishes and distributes educational ma- terials to Arab Americans, educators, academic institu-tions, policy makers, and the public at large. 7. ADC and ADCRI have a longstanding and ongo- ing commitment to promoting engagement in the Decen- nial Census among its members and constituents. Since the 1980s, ADC has served in numerous capacities on the Census Bureau advisory committees. In 2000, ADC re- invigorated its census campaign and policy initiatives, actively educating Arab Americans and other minority populations about the importance of the census and mo-bilizing participation and outreach events. In 2008, ADC actively worked with the Census Bureau to iden-tify classification concerns of Arab Americans on the United States census. For the 2010 Decennial Census, ADC and ADCRI created messaging about participat- ing in the Decennial Census that was focused on the Arab -American community including launching a na- tional campaign advocating for the completion of census forms and holding outreach e vents to counter concerns of sharing of information with government and law en- forcement agencies. ADC and ADCRI also engaged in efforts to \" get out the count\" in that community as well, hosted town halls and symposiums in select cities across the country, and produced and published material for distribution which encouraged participation in the 2010 Census. ADC also served on the U.S. Census Bureau 's 2010 Census Advisory Committee. 8. In line with this history, ADC and ADCRI have been active in promoting and encouraging Arab Ameri- cans to respond to the 2020 Decennial Census, efforts 125 that I have personally led. I have led Census townhalls across the country, including in Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, Florida, Texas, California, Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland, to name a few. Since the onset of the COVID -19 Pandemic, I appeared on and led doz- ens of online conversations with community members about the Census. I have worked with our organizing and media outreach staff to publish and promote infor- mational material for our community encouraging them to complete the Census. In the lead up to the end of the Census period our office was planning multiple out- reach events online, as well as phone banking, and email follow up, encouraging completion of th e Census. We have and anticipate additional expenses related to the online services needed to hold digital outreach events. 9. Despite these efforts, I know from my experi- ences as ADC 's President that ADC is already facing a much more challenging environm ent for conducting out- reach and encouraging Arab Americans, both citizens and noncitizens, to respond to the 2020 Census than the 2010 Census. This is due in part to many of the policies and statements of President Trump and his administra- tion targeting immigrants of color, Muslim and Arab Americans, and immigrants generally. Additionally, the failed effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census also helped created an environment of height- ened fear and suspicion that has made encouraging cen-sus responses among Arab Americans more challenging. 10. I also understand from my role and experience that there is also a particular fear among many Arab Americans about how the data collected in the Census will be used, including fears in areas with high co ncen-126 trations of Arab Americans like Orange County, Califor- nia. These concerns include use of the data for purposes of deportation, censorship, and surveillance, including the Department of Homeland Security targeting partic-ular communities, as occurred after September 11, 2001. 11. Based on my experience as ADC 's President and the knowledge I have gained from working with ADC staff members, ADC members, and others in the Arab - American community, the July 21, 2020 Presidential Memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce on the sub- ject of \" Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportion- ment Base Following the 2020 Census \" (the \"Memoran- dum \") is already making and will continue to make our efforts to encourage Census participation much more difficult. 12. The Memoran dum has already generated signif- icant fear and increased distrust about the Census in Arab American communities. These reactions are not limited to undocumented immigrants or other non -citi- zens, but also to family, household members, friends, and communit y members of non -citizens, people for whom the new policy articulated in the Memorandum has gener- ated fear about responding at all and having those re- sponses weaponized against their communities. The new policy announced in the Memorandum to exclude undoc umented residents from the apportionment base directly and severely undermines our Census education and outreach also contradicts the messaging we have tried to promote in those efforts, making it necessary to expend more resources at the expense of other organi- zational priorities in the remaining months of the 2020 Census, including legal work, organizing, issue advocacy efforts, and educational initiatives. 127 13. The Memorandum will likely make ADC/ADCRI 's census work harder and more time consuming and costly in several ways, including contradicting current messaging, the fact that targeting undocumented immi- grants creates fear, distrust, apprehension, and raises greater concerns about privacy, and that it demoralizes community members. The impact of th e Memorandum will be immediately felt. In addition to making work related to the Census more difficult, it will lead to ulti- mately lead to a lower count in areas with minority pop- ulations, including centers with high Arab populations. By changing the ter ms of the Census, it will give cre- dence to the notion that the Trump Administration is not being honest about their intention of the Census which will result in decreased participation. 14. ADC has already been forced to expend more re- sources and will continue needing to do so to respond to the Memorandum and expects that it will need to inter- act with community members many more times than previously planned to try to convince them to participate in the 2020 census. Even though the Memorandum will cause AD C to expend more resources to reach the same number of people, it unfortunately is likely that it will have less success in convincing many community mem- bers in the 2020 Census due in large part to the Memo-randum. ADC and ADRCI will have to increase staff time and spending devoted its Census education and outreach efforts by approximately 25% percent over current levels to address the Memorandum. In addi- tion to my work, I had to direct my National Organizer and our Media Coordinator to divert some of their time away from other priorities to do additional Census work 128 15. Because the Memorandum has caused and will continue to cause ADC and ADRCI to spend more time and money spent on Census outreach, ADC and ADCRI will need to divert resources from other imp ortant pro- grammatic areas, including pro bono legal services, voter protection work, working with victims of hate crimes, policy work related to upcoming elections, policy work related to COVID -19, community organizing and out- reach efforts, as well as educ ational programs typically implemented at the start of each school year. These are critical programmatic areas right now given the on- going COVID -19 Pandemic, upcoming elections, and the economic crisis. I have personally spent at least 35 hours on Census -related work since the release of the most recent Memorandum, that I otherwise would have spent on other areas of work, including on development, implementation, overseeing daily operations, coordinat-ing with partner organizations, and overall day to day operations. 16. ADC puts significant resources in Census edu- cation and outreach work because our members and the communities we serve face significant negative conse- quences in the event of an undercount. As noted above, ADC has members in all 50 states pl us Washington, DC, as well as a national network of chapters. These in- clude chapters in; Los Angeles and Orange County, Cal- ifornia; Miami and Orlando, Florida; Austin and Dallas, Texas; Northern New Jersey; New York, New York; and Tucson and Phoenix, Ariz ona. ADC has Board of Directors, most of whom membership elects, and all of whom are also ADC members and represent a cross - section of the United States. 129 17. For example, ADC has members in California, including Dr. Souhail Toubia, who is based in Orange County, California, and George Majeed Khoury, a San Diego, California member. I understand that Califor- nia is likely to lose at least one seat in Congress if the Memorandum is implemented. Therefore, these mem- bers will be directly harmed by the policy t o exclude un- documented residents from the apportionment base, as they will lose political representation. These mem- bers ' communities are likely to also lose federal funding as a result of this policy, as they live in areas with sig- nificant populations of undocumented individuals and noncitizens generally, who will also be less likely to fill out the 2020 Census because of this policy as well. 18. ADC has members in Florida as well, including Shata Atiya, who is based in Miami. I understand that Florida is likely to lose at least one seat in Congress if the Memorandum is implemented. Therefore, Ms. Atiya will be directly harmed by the policy to exclude undocumented residents from the apportionment base, as she will lose political representation. Ms. Atiya 's com- munity is also likely to lose federal funding as a result of this policy, as she lives in an area with a significant pop- ulation of undocumented individuals and non -citizens generally, who will also be less likely to fill out the 2020 Census because o f this policy as well. 19. ADC also has members in New Jersey, including Tawfiq Barqawi, who lives in Gloucester County, New Jersey. I understand that New Jersey is likely to lose at least one seat in Congress if the Memorandum is im- plemented. Therefore, these members will be directly harmed by the policy to exclude undocumented resi-130 dents from the apportionment base, as they will lose po- litical representation. Mr. Barqawi 's community is likely to also lose federal funding as a result of this pol-icy, as h e lives in an area with significant populations of undocumented individuals and non -citizens generally, who will also be less likely to fill out the 2020 Census because of this policy as well.

KHALAF 131 Exhibit 28 132 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 20 Civ. 5770 (JMF) STATE OF NEW YORK, ET AL ., PLAINTIFFS v. DONALD J. TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF MONTEREY COUNTY SUPERVISOR CHRIS LOPEZ Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746(2), I, CHRIS LOPEZ, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. I am a member of the Board of Supervisors of the County of Monterey, California, th e elected decision - making body of the County. I represent District 3, lo- cated in Southern and Central Monterey County. Dis- trict 3 is predominantly rural, agricultural, and is the largest Supervisorial District in terms of geographic area. 3. I grew up i n the same District that I now serve. Currently, I serve as the Chair for the Monterey County Board of Supervisors and sit on several California Brown Act legislative bodies, including the 2020 Census Steer-ing Committee and Behavioral Health Commission, am ong others. 133 4. Our Central Coast California region encom- passes a diverse mix of coastal and inland areas best known for agricultural production and tourist destina- tions. Accordingly, our largest employment industries are in agriculture and hospitality. D istrict 3 of Monte- rey County is home to a diverse population made up of over 80% of Hispanic and Latino residents. Across Monterey County, nearly 21% of the total residents are noncitizens, including lawful permanent residents, refu- gees granted asylum, im migrants granted temporary relief under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\" ) program, and other groups. According to the Census estimate of 2018, Monterey County is home to 437,907 people, with 30.4% of the residents being for- eign born. Indeed, according to the Public Policy In- stitute of California, Monterey County has the highest percentage of non- citizens of any California County. Based on my experience in residing and working in Dis-trict 3 my entire life, I estimate that nearly half th e res- idents are undocumented or members of mixed status household families. 5. T he County 's dynamic immigrant population is deeply integrated, both socially and economically; one in four children in the County is an immigrant. Overall, approximately 247, 792 County residents live in a noncit- izen or mixed citizen household per 2017 U.S. Census Bureau figures. 6. Monterey County is one of the nation 's top agri- cultural producers. Agriculture is the County 's largest economic and employment sector, generating $8.1 bil- lion annually and providing 76,054 jobs. In District 3, the Agricultural Sector is the leading employer. While 134 most crops across the United States are machine- har- vested, many of the crops grown in Monterey County must be picked, sorted, and/or pa cked by hand, so the County is dependent on a large and skilled labor force. 7. The County 's \"Hard to Count \" communities are well documented by the U.S. Census Bureau, with an es-timated 35% of the population living in Hard to Count neighborhoods compromise d of populations historically missed in the census at disproportionately high rates. These populations include the majority of the residents of my District: people of color, young children, and im- migrants. 8. According to the Public Policy Institute of Cali- fornia, Monterey County 's overall poverty rate is ap- proximately 17.4%. In District 3, a predominantly His- panic community, 22% of the 67,399 people live in pov- erty. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly one in four households in our District live s in overcrowded conditions. Our immigrant population includes a high percentage of farm workers, both migrant and perma-nent. Farmworkers commonly face a variety of chal- lenges, including difficulty accessing affordable hous-ing, inconsistent seasonal inco me, and low wages rela- tive to the cost of living. The farmworker population in Monterey County, and in particular District 3, is plagued by overcrowded living conditions. A 2018 Farmworker Housing Study revealed that 54% of farmworker dwell- ings had joint or \"extra \" tenants and that less than half lived only with family. This longstanding problem has come into focus recently because such living conditions greatly increase the risk of contracting COVID -19. 9. Monterey County depends on critical funding from the Federal and State government to implement 135 and administer health, welfare, public safety, infrastruc- ture improvement, and transportation programs. The total Federal and State aid for fiscal years 2017 -2018 is estimated at 33% of total financing. Social Services and Health programs administered by the County Health De- partment rely heavily upon this aid. 10. With my personal experience of growing up in South Monterey County and ultimately serving the Count y as an elected official, a role in which I oversee critical government functions as a member of the Board of Supervisors, I strongly believe that the recent execu- tive decision to exclude undocumented immigrants from the 2020 Census apportionment will have serious nega- tive effects on the representation, health, safety, and well- being of Monterey County residents. 11. Based on my experience overseeing the near $4 billion dollar annual County budget, critical federally funded programs with funding allocations based on Cen- sus data would suffer substantial cuts affecting a variety of social safety programs, including, school behavioral health counseling programs, lunch programs, Limited English Proficiency education, Children 's Health Insur- ance Program, Women, I nfants and Children program, public health research and interventions, transporta- tion, roads and other critical infrastructure, as well as affordable housing programs. 12. For example, California state law recognizes that local governments play a vital rol e in developing afford- able housing. The state of California mandates that all cities, towns and counties plan for the housing needs of its residents regardless of income. This mandate is called Housing Element and Regional Housing Needs 136 Allocation, whic h is driven by Census data. The Cali- fornia Department of Housing and Community Develop- ment utilizes Census data to determine the total number of new affordable homes that need to be built in each local jurisdiction. Without accurate Census data, I be- lieve that the availability of affordable housing may be significantly and negatively impacted in Monterey County. 13. District 3 is home to over two -thirds of the total geographical area of the County of Monterey. Its size and rural inland location makes pub lic transportation, and public infrastructure projects a critical part of our residents ' ability to go to work, access healthcare ser- vices, and access education for their children. Our lo- cal government depends on high quality census data to obtain funding to develop and build new schools, im- prove roads, highway safety, and adequately plan public transportation routes and accessibility 14. Without accurate Census data, calculating ap- propriate class sizes in schools would be difficult, inhib- iting children 's access to a quality education. For ex- ample, age information from the Census is vital to allow-ing Monterey to make appropriate decisions regarding school funding and services. In the recent shutdown of local schools in response to the COVID -19 pandemic, Wi-Fi services were allocated based on Census data, in order to make online learning possible for children with-out internet access. 15. Inaccurate Census reporting would also inter- fere with Monterey County 's children accessing critical behavioral health se rvices at local schools, a service pro- vided by our County Health Department. In our Dis-137 trict, King City Elementary School is the leading loca- tion for children to access Behavioral Health counseling services for children suffering from psychological trauma . This program is dependent on funding made available by federal allocations, which are based on accurate Cen- sus counts. Given that our District has a high popula- tion of undocumented immigrants, deterring residents from responding to the census could res ult in an under- count that would put programs like this at risk. For some of the children accessing these services, school is the only safe location for them to obtain this care. Without it, children would be deprived of critical mental health services, w orsening their mental health outcomes and potentially adversely impacting them for the rest of their lives. 16. As District 3 Supervisor, I have first- hand know ledge of the fear that exists in my community in re- sponding to the 2020 Census. I am gravely co ncerned that the recent action by the Trump Administration will \"chill, \" or deter, participation in the 2020 Census by my constituents, impacting the quality of the data that is ul-timately reported. I have personally discussed with my constituents the fea r they face in participating in the Census. In addition, my office and staff have received calls regarding this issue. 17. District 3, like other parts of Monterey County, is home to a hardworking and exceptionally skilled farm-worker workforce, who hand -pick fresh strawberries, lettuce, tomatoes, artichokes, kale, and brussels sprouts, and broccoli for national consumption. Many of these workers are recruited to come in from Mexico, while oth-ers have resided in the region over many generations. 138 The decision to exclude some of these hardw orking res- idents from the 2020 apportionment count would send the message that their representation deserves to be di- luted and that their lives are somehow worth less. And the pernicious effects of this redistricting would affect everyone in the region, citizen or noncitizen, documented or undocumented. 18. Given the nature of the Monterey County popu- lation, including the significant presence of farmworker, undocumented, and immigrant families and individuals, I expec t that substantial efforts and resources will be required to ameliorate the chilling effects on participa-tion in the 2020 Census caused by the Administration 's recently announced plans. The County will have to dedicate significant resources to ensure part icipation without fear, and to help the County obtain the funding necessary to prevent its residents from going hungry, homeless, or witho ut access to healthcare. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on this 3rd day of Aug. , 2020 /s/ CHRIS LOPEZ CHRIS LOPEZ Monterey County Supervisor 139 Exhibit 31 140 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 20 Civ. 5770 (JMF) STATE OF NEW YORK, ET AL ., PLAINTIFFS v. DONALD J. TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF MELISSA McCAW Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746(2), I, Melissa McCaw, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. I am the Secretary of the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management (OPM). Consistent with the powers bestowed on me and my agency through Con- necticut General Statutes 4 -65a, et seq. , I oversee budget and policy matters on behalf of the Governor of the State of Connecticut. I have been employed in this capacity since January 2019. 3. Connecticut 's Office of Policy and Management functions as the Governor 's staff agency and plays a cen- tral role in state government, providing the information and analysis used to formulate public policy for the State and assisting state agencies and m unicipalities in imple- menting policy decisions on the Governor 's behalf. OPM prepares the Governor 's budget proposal and im- plements and monitors the execution of the budget as 141 adopted by the General Assembly. OPM provides the Governor with a global overv iew of proposed policy ini- tiatives, identifying the full range of financial and policy implications of proposed actions. On the Governor 's behalf, OPM analyzes and assesses financial, program-matic, and legislative proposals of state agencies, the General Assembly, and the federal government. Un- der Connecticut law, OPM is also responsible for \" all as- pects of state staff plannin g and analysis in the areas of budgeting, management, planning, energy policy deter-mination and evaluation, intergovernmental polic y, crimi- nal and juvenile justice planning and program evalua- tion. \" Conn. Gen. Stat. 4 -65a. 4. In everything we do, OPM \u2014like all of Connecti- cut's state agencies \u2014strives to be informed by the best available data. U.S. Census Bureau data is indispensa- ble to our work, and to that of the state agencies whom we support and assist in budgeting and policy formula- tion and implementation. It is the sole available source for a wide range of characteristic data \u2014data on sub- groups within the overall population \u2014that are essential to effective and accurate planning. In essence: In many critically important areas, unless a Connecticut resident participates in a state program or accesses a service, the State has no way \u2014other tha n the census \u2014 of knowing critical characteristic data about the popula- tion. 5. Accurate characteristic data is particularly im- portant in Connecticut, which has no county -level gov- ernment and is subdivided into 169 municipalities. Even small inaccuracies in characteristic data relative to our overall population can have significant implications for planning on the municipal and regional level, especially 142 where data must be disaggregated by multiple charac- teristics. 6. Because of OPM 's planning and budgeting role for all Connecticut state agencies, I am familiar with several instances in which either OPM or Connecticut state agencies have relied and continue to rely on accu- rate characteristic data from the census to plan effi- ciently and effectively. Some of t hose include: a. Fighting COVID -19: Connecticut has developed and deployed a statewide program of testing and population -based control measures that have helped us become a national leader in flattening the curve and reducing sickness and mortality due to the coronavirus and its associated sick- ness, COVID -19. Our D epartment of Public Health makes targeted decisions about locating testing sites based on characteristic data that speak to COVID -19 risk factors including popu- lation density, poverty, and the race and ethnic-ity of residents. The accuracy of that data is a matter of life and death, and impacts both Con-necticut 's immediate -term public health and its ability to reopen its economy and thrive in the medium - and long -terms. b. School Construction : OPM works closely with Connecticut 's Office of School Construction Grants & Review (OSCG&R), which is responsible for the grant administration of all Connecticut pub- lic school construction projects seeking authori- zation for a State grant commitment. Munici- palities that seek State bonding for school con-struct ion must work with, and seek authoriza- tion from, OSCG&R. To ensure that state 143 bonding resources are used wisely, OSCG&R re- quires municipalities to document the need for their requested facilities using enrollment projections \u2014including, most importantly, pro- jected school -aged populations \u2014that draw on characteristic data including population age, child -bearing rates, and mobility. I am partic- ularly familiar with this process because Section 10-282 of the Connecticut General Statutes re- quires me, as OPM 's Secretary, to review OSCG&R 's list of eligible projects and provide comments and recommendations. In the ab- sence of accurate data, Connecticut will be una- ble to make the best possible decisions around where, and how, to build its next generation of school facilities. c. Equal Employment Opportunities in State Gov- ernment : Connecticut 's Department of Labor (DoL) relies on accurate and detailed character-istic data to generate projections for policy and planning purposes. To cite just one instance: To promote equal opportunity in employment, Con- necticut law requires that state agencies, munic-ipalities, and some companies develop and im- plement affirmative action plans. In relevant part, those plans articulate hiring and promotion goals in light of the overall w orkforce by occupa- tional category. Our DoL relies on occupational data from the census \u2014among other sources \u2014to promulgate accurate information and set goals and benchmarks for state agencies to use in de- veloping those Affirmative Action Plans. In other wo rds: Connecticut's objective of increas-144 ing equity and reducing barriers to equal em- ployment opportunity depends, in part, on accu- rate characteristic data from the census. OPM prepares a biennial Affirmative Action Plan that is filed with the Commission o n Human Rights and Opportunities, relying on the census data pro-vided by DoL to formulate our hiring and pro- motion goals. d. Labor, Employment and Economic Development Trends : Other DoL uses of characteristic data from the census include targeting job training to particular populations and neighborhoods and projecting both labor supply and consumer de- mand to assist in economic development activi- ties. For example: Knowing the number of people over a certain age helps DoL to project demand for health care and assisted living facil- ities, while knowing the number of people under a certain age in particular geographies helps DoL to project the demand for employment in education, da ycare, and related industries. This is all relevant to programmatic and funding de- cisions vetted and approved by OPM. e. Public Transportation : Connecticut 's Depart- ment of Transportation (DoT) relies on accurate characteristic data to forecast travel demand, identify commuting patterns, and forecast the impact of new transportation projects across the state. Characteristic data are also used to en- sure transportation options are accessible and do not discriminate based on demographic and socio -economic fa ctors such as race, color, in- come levels, vehicles available, or national origin. 145 For instance, census data on languages spoken at home informs the development of signage and materials in other languages for public involve- ment at various levels of the sta te's transporta- tion planning processes. As the Secretary of OPM, I am the Secretary of the State Bond Com- mission, which approves funding through bonding for eligible DoT projects. The State Bond Com- mission approves funding requests by DoT based on demons trated need, and the underlying travel demand forecasts utilizing characteristic data are often a component of that assessment. f. Revenue Projections and Budgeting : OPM is responsible for analyzing big -picture trends that may impact Connecticut 's long -term economic and budget health. That analysis informs state policy on issues ranging from revenue genera-tion to economic development incentives. For example, pursuant to Section 4 -74a of the Con- necticut General Statutes, OPM prepares an an- nual \"Economic R eport to the Governor \" that re- lies on information on Connecticut 's population and migration trends, drawing heavily on census data on characteristics including income, age, and migration, in order to make recommenda- tions concerning the economy and appropri ately analyze the impact of both proposed spending and proposed revenue programs on the employ- ment, production and purchasing power of the people and industries within the state. 146 7. In each of these instances, and in myriad others, our planning will be less effective if it is informed by in- accurate data. In conclusion: census accuracy matters, and it matters not just for total population counts but also for characteristic data. The effectiveness and effi- ciency of our government \u2014and the health and wellbeing of our residents \u2014relies on accurate characteristic data from the census. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on this 5 day of Aug. , 2020 SECRETARY OF THE OFFICE O F POLICY AND MANAGEMENT By: /s/ MELISSA McCAW MELISSA MCCAW 147 Exhibit 34 148 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 20 Civ. 5770 (JMF) STATE OF NEW YORK, ET AL ., PLAINTIFFS v. TRUMP , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF BITTA 28 1746(2), I, Bitta Mostofi, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. I am the Commissioner of the City of New York (the \"City \")'s Mayor 's Office of Immigrant Affairs (\"MOIA \"). I have worked at MOIA since 2014, becom- ing Acting Commissioner in 2017 and appointed Com- missioner in 2018. As Commissioner, I provide advice and gu idance to the Mayor, his staff in other divisions of the Mayor 's Office, and other City agencies, on a range of issues related to immigration. I also guide and over- see the work of approximately 70 City employees as- signed to work on fulfilling MOIA 's missi on. 3. MOIA, established in the Charter of the City of New York in 2001 by referendum, develops and imple- ments policies designed to assist immigrants across the City by enhancing their economic, civic, and social inte- gration into the community, including, encouraging par-ticipation in the Census. In order to achieve that mis- sion, MOIA conducts research and analysis, provides 149 guidance to and partners with other City agencies, de- velops partnerships with community -based organiza- tions, and advocat es at all leve ls of government. 4. My office and I have been engaged in a variety of efforts to increase the participation of the City 's im- migrant community in the Census. I was Commis- sioner on the New York State 's Complete Count Com- mission after being appointed by Gov ernor Cuomo in January of 2019. The commission issued its final re- port in October of 2019. During my tenure at the Com- mission, I spent hours listening to testimony and con-cerns raised by local elected officials, community based organizations, community members and others about their concerns and needs for achieving a complete count. These concerns consistently included specifically immi-grant community fears and concerns about privacy, the inclusion of a citizenship question, and distrust of the federal government. It was difficult to overcome these barriers and to focus on the benefits and importance of getting counted. Even after the Commission con- cluded, I have continued to work with the New York City Census Team to advise on the issue of encouraging par- ticipation in our immigrant communities. I also con- tinue to be involved in many community and press events to ensure a complete count of the City 's immigrant com- munities. 5. My office has expended significant staff time across teams in an effort to in crease the participation of the City 's immigrant community in the Census. MOIA 's Outreach and Organizing team ( \"Outreach Team \") has engaged in extensive community outreach related to in- creasing the participation of the City 's immigrant com-150 munity in the Census. The Outreach Team has incor- porated the Census into almost all of its activities. When our organizers canvass neighborhoods and hold in -per- son and virtual events, they distribute Census materials and include information about the importance of partic- ipation in the Census by all NYC residents, regardless of their immigration status, in their remarks. Our or- ganizers also participate in Census Days of Action coor- dinated by the New York City Census team. During these Days of Action, hel d in neighborhoods with histor- ically low response rates, our organizers often distribute literature and speak to community members to encour- age participation and dispel misinformation about the Census, including reminding community members that there will be no citizenship question and that the infor- mation contained in their Census responses will not be shared with other parts of the federal government. Many of our organizers have created informational vid-eos on social media in several languages describing the Census and providing information about where to get assistance with completing the Census. They also use various messaging applications favored by different im- migrant communities to send out information on the Cen- sus to constituents about the importa nce of participation and to answer any questions to dispel misinformation. Recently, the Outreach Team held a five -hour virtual telethon event, entitled \"Que Cuente Mi Gente! (Make My People Count!), \" that included appearances by elec - ted officials encour aging undocumented community members to respond to the census and educating them on its importance. 6. In support of this work, MOIA 's Policy Team provides federal policy updates to teams across MOIA, 151 including updates on Census and the Census enumera- tion period. These policy updates keep MOIA staff in- formed, including the Outreach and Organizing team, so that they have accurate information to convey when en- gaging with members of the community. Three mem- bers of MOIA 's policy team have already devoted sev- eral hours to analyzing and explaining the Presidential Memorandum to MOIA 's staff. 7. In addition, MOIA 's communications team has worked for over a year with the New York City Census team on an outreach campaign focused on hard to count communities, like immigrant communities, emphasizing the importance of responding to the 2020 Census. The joint efforts are focused on posting and elevating Cen- sus related content on social media, advising on the pro- duction of multimedia messaging campaigns specifical ly targeted towards immigrant communities, fielding me- dia inquiries, developing talking points and fact sheets, and conducting a series of roundtables with community and ethnic media outlets across New York City discuss- ing the Census. 8. Throughout its Cen sus outreach efforts, MOIA has faced a number of challenges, many of which stem from the City 's immigrant communities ' distrust of the federal government, and by association, any other gov- ernment entity. With the anti -immigrant rhetoric con- tained in the July 21, 2020 Presidential Memorandum excluding undocumented immigrants from the appor- tionment count, President Trump sowed fear, mistrust, and confusion amongst the immigrant communities in New York City. Official Presidential statements that undocumented persons don 't count cultivate distrust and resentment of the federal government throughout 152 immigrant communities, which has a chilling effect on immigrant response to the Census. As a result, the July 21, 2020 Memorandum is a significant setback to our efforts to ensure that immigrant communities re- spond to the Census. 9. Despite the recency of its promulgation, the Trump Administration 's Census Apportionment Memo- randum has already proven to be a barrier to the City 's efforts to increase participation in the Census among immigrant communities. News of the Trump Admin- istration 's most recent memo has spread through immi- grant communities in New York City incredibly quickly, and MOIA is concerned that the current news cycle will continue to make immigrants, specifically those who are undocumented, afraid or reluctant to complete the Cen-sus. Though the memorandum has only been pub- lished for roughly two weeks, members of our Outreach team have already encountered individuals in the com- munity expressing concern s, fears, and confusion about completing the Census. In one instance, a member of our Outreach team shared information about the Census with a constituent during the NYC Census Week of Ac- tion, held from July 27, 2020 to August 2, 2020. The constituent as ked whether individuals who are undocu- mented had to complete the Census because she had heard that the President had stated that undocumented immigrants did not have to be counted. Another constit- uent who works as a street vendor expressed to another Outre ach team member that she did not think she had to fill out the census because she was not born in the United States and that she had heard in the news that people who are undocumented do not count. In an other example, a community member from Jackson Heigh ts ex- pressed specific concerns about the federal government 's 153 plan to exclude undocumented persons from the Census. She also expressed that the Trump administration would punish undocumented persons who filled out the Census by tracking and deporting them. She further explained that many within her community have the same con- cerns. Since the promulgation of the new memo, a mem- ber of the Outreach team has encountered individuals who are undocumented as well as those living in mixed status households who have expressed concerns about the security of their identifying information being shared with the federal government, specifically expressing concerns that the Trump Administration would seek to use Census information against t hem. 10. Regardless of whether the Trump Administra- tion's memo is successful in excluding immigrants from the apportionment count, it is impossible to ignore the chilling effect that this memo is already having on the completion of the Census among immigra nt communi- ties in New York City. 11. In response to the Presidential Memorandum, our teams have had to devote more time and energy to combatting misinformation, fear, and confusion, and we expect to continue expending more energy than previ- ously anticipate d on these efforts. In engagements with community members since the Presidential Memo- randum, our Outreach team has increasingly had to en- gage in very personalized and community specific out- reach to build a level of trust that is much higher than necessary in their outreach on other services or topics. Likewise, our communications strategy moving forward will continue to prioritize messaging that explains why it is important for everyone to fill out the Census, that 154 in fact everyo ne can get counted regardless of their im- migration status and there is no citizenship question on the census, and that the information provided to the Census Bureau is confidential and protected. For ex- ample, I will be authoring an Op -Ed in the Queens Chronicle 's Immigration Corner column on the right of every New Yorker, regardless of immigration status, to be counted in this decennial Census. The Presidential Memorandum undercuts this messaging and makes it harder for our office to encourage immigrants to re- spond to the census. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoing is true and correct.

The City supported the committee 's work to en- sure a complete count of Franklin County 's population of approximately 1.3 million residents by providing com-munications and community outreach support, funding a census micro -grant program, hosting numerous pro- motional events, and providing City office space to the Census Bureau for employee training purposes. In to- tal, the City allocated $300,000 for the censu s, including $150,000 for micro -grants, $100,000 for a marketing and community outreach contract, and $50,000 for supplies and services. The City developed its own 2020 Census \"Columbus Counts \" branding and printed hundreds of thousands of promotional han douts and items for volun- teer committee members to distribute. Promotional materials and digital communications were translated into five different languages including Spanish, Somali, Bhutanese, and Nepali. The City hired a marketing firm to develop and implement a comprehensive digital, in-person, radio, and TV marketing and communications strategy to encourage census participation among Frank- lin County 's hard to count (HTC) populations. Fur- ther, the City allocated $150,000 through the United Way to pr ovide over 40 community -based non -profits with micro -grants to conduct census outreach and com- munications to HTC communities. Mayor Ginther, Franklin County Commissioner Kevin Boyce, and other local elected officials hosted various social media events 158 and in-person events with national organizations like the National Association of Latino Elected Officials. 5. Columbus and Franklin County residents have expressed concerns and fears regarding completing the 2020 Census. Our message has been \"Columbus Counts \" which has been used for years to build trust and encour- age all people to complete the census. We have noticed that, as a result of the Trump Administration decision to try and add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census and a Presidential Memora ndum prohibiting the count- ing of undocumented individuals for purposes of redis- tricting, that there has been an increase in confusion and fear among our residents. For example, immigrant and New American residents have expressed concerns to City employees and committee members about not being counted in the 2020 Census because of the Presi- dential Memorandum. In order to try and counter this, we have had to increase our social media presence and emphasize that the census counts all people in the country \u2014not just citizens or permanent residents. Our response rates compared to 2010 are down and we have been working to increase it. 6. As a result of public health restrictions in place due to COVID -19, the Census Bureau has significantly delayed non -response follow- up operations. The com- mittee has communicated to residents for years that in - person counting would begin in the spring of 2020 and many communities are confused about the continued de- lays. In particular, committee members representing immigrant communities and organizations note that their constituents, including many Latino, Somali, and West African communities, are confused about census opera-tions. Moreover, response rates are down in Columbus 159 census tracts with significant immigrant, Latino, and African American populations. 7. As noted above, we have noticed that there is concern in our immigrant and New American communi- ties specifically as a result of the Presidential Memoran- dum excluding noncitizens from the reapportionment numbers. Several committee members have heard di- rectly from residents that they are confused about the census as a result of the Presidential Memorandum and have concerns about completing it. Response rates to the census have traditionally been lower among our im- migrant and New American communities due to distrust of government. This distrust of government and gen- eral lack of awareness of the census have been exacer-bated by the Presidential Memorandum excluding non cit- izens from the reapportionment numbers. Moreover, many residents believe that completing the census will negatively impact their government benefits. 8. The City and its community partners will con- tinue to adjust messaging to reflect that all residents, regardless of immigration status, count in the census. The City notes that the U.S. Constitution clearly states that all people count, not just citizens. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoing is true and correct.

I am the Deputy Director at Make the Road New York ( \"MRNY \"). I have been on staff at MRNY since 2005. I am over 18 years of age. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration. 2. MRNY is a nonprofit membership organization with offices and service centers in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Suffolk County, and White Plains. MRNY 's 162 mission is to build the power of immigrant and working - class communities. To do that, MRNY engages in four core strategies: Legal and Survival Services, Trans- formative Education, Community Organizing, and Pol- icy Innovation. MRNY has more than 24,000 members who reside in New York City, Nassau County, Suffolk County, and Westchester County. These members lead multiple organizing committees across numerous issues and program areas of concern to the organization. Members take on leadership roles in the campaigns, de- termine priorities, and elect the representatives who comprise most of the Board of Directors. MRNY mem- bers include individuals who do not have lawful immi- gration status. 3. In my capacity as Deputy Director, I am respon- sible for overseeing our census work and our services teams, which include our legal, health, and adult educa- tion departments. I am also part of the Executive Leadership Team of MRNY and am responsible for fundraising and shaping many of MRNY 's organiza- tional priorities. Throughout my tenure with MRNY, I have been in regular contact with MRNY members and I frequently meet with members in the communities in which they reside where I learn about their neighbor- hoods, their needs, and their concerns to inform commu- nications, organizing, and civic engagement prog rams for MRNY. During my 15 years at MRNY, I have also familiarized myself with MRNY 's internal records and processes; our staff and their responsibilities; our pro-grams and program areas; and our members, and their needs. 4. The Decennial Census is a cr itical and constitutionally -mandated data -gathering instrument, 163 used to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars in fed- eral resources and to apportion political power at the federal, state, and local levels. MRNY has an ongoing commitment to promoting engagement in the 2020 De-cennial Census among its members and constituents be- cause a complete and accurate Census count is critical to ensuring that our members receive the government funding and full political representation to which they are entitled. Our members in New York benefit when our state has its full complement of Congressional rep-resentatives and electoral votes, as well as adequate funding for the facilities, programs, and services they use, which receive Census -guided federal funding. These facilities and services include parents with children en-rolled in schools that receive funding under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; families whose children benefit from insurance funded by the State Children 's Health Insurance Progr am; drivers who use interstate highways and mass transit on a daily basis, and thus, depend on federal highway funds to perform their jobs; and people who rely on housing assistance through various funding provided under Section 8, among other Census -guide d funding streams. Promoting Cen- sus response can help ensure that the programs, ser- vices, and facilities that our members rely upon are ad-equately funded. 5. I have co -led MRNY 's strategy and work around the 2020 Census including our education and outrea ch programs. To develop programs that achieve MRNY 's goals of encouraging greater Census participation in the communities we serve, I have gained familiarity with the importance of data gathered from the Census in appor- tioning political representation and the allocation of some government funding sources. I am familiar with 164 the concerns of our members and the communities we serve around the Census for the purpose of developing effective Census communications directed at immigrant communities. I am also familiar with how the commu- nities we serve would be impacted by an undercount to-ward the end of designing communications and organiz- ing strategies that address those concerns and increase their civic engagement, and Census participation in par-ticular. 6. B ecause the Decennial Census requires a direct inquiry of every person in the United States, MRNY has invested significant organizational resources in encour- aging our members and the immigrant communities we serve to respond to the Census. This work includ es, among other things, general education programs, work-shops for members, presentations in schools, and person - to-person outreach. We have also engaged in digital organizing around the Census, including through webi- nars and presentations streamed over F acebook Live. To date, we have called over 100,000 people and have as-sisted with or confirmed participation by over 7,500 peo- ple. MRNY has continued Census education and out- reach during the pandemic and plans to continue en-couraging and assisting people in filling out the ques-tionnaire until the response period closes. 7. Our education and outreach efforts to encourage our members and people in the communities we serve to respond to the Census emphasizes two essential pur- poses of the headcount: (1) Determining political appor- tionment, including the number of representatives each state will have in Congress, the number of electors per state in the electoral college, and the boundaries and 165 composition of Congressional districts; and (2) Deter- minin g how much government funding communities will receive for matters such as education, public housing, transportation, and health care. Our education and outreach efforts also emphasize that the Census counts every resident of the United States, regardless of age, citizenship status, or ability to vote. This message is im- portant because it affirms the humanity and dignity of all Americans and the responsibility that all Americans, including undocumented Americans, bear for respond- ing to the Census and ensu ring that their home states and communities are allocated their fair share of politi-cal power and government funding. An example of one of our Census education and outreach documents is at-tached as Exhibit 1, and is also available in both English and Span ish, at the following link: https://maketheroadny. org/census2020/ . 8. MRNY has been and remains committed to Cen- sus education and outreach work among immigrants and communities of color because those groups have been undercounted. Based on my knowledge as a staff mem- ber at MRNY and a leader in these communities, includ- ing on Census issues, I understand that one reason that immigrants and communities of color have been under- counted is a fear of contact with the government and dis- trust of government offici als, particularly how they will use the data they collect. 9. MRNY has already faced a challenging environ- ment for conducting outreach and encouraging immi-grants of color to respond to the 2020 Census because of our members and constituents ' heightened fear of inter- acting with government workers as a result of the Trump Administration 's persistently hostile and discriminatory 166 actions and attitudes towards immigrants of color. Among the racist and xenophobic acts that the Trump Administration has undertaken include separating chil- dren from their families at the border and keeping im- migrant children in cages; banning individuals from six majority Arab and/or Muslim countries from ente ring the United States; repeatedly attempting to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed 800,000 individuals \u201490% of whom are Latino\u2014 brought to this country as children to legally reside and work in the United States; resci nding Temporary Pro- tected Status programs for individuals from El Salva-dor, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Nepal; calling for an end to the diversity visa lottery; dramatically increas- ing interior enforcement raids in communities across the United States; proposing to end family -based immi- gration, which would disproportionately harm immi-grants from Latin America and Asia; instituting a dra- conian \"public charge \" rule to obstruct lawful immigra- tion both domes tically and through U.S. embassies and consulates abroad, which disproportionately affects im- migrants of color and has dramatically increased fear among immigrant and mixed -status families; referring to some undocumented immigrants as \"animals \"; and at- tempting to include a citizenship question on the Cen- sus. MRNY has consistently fought these efforts to in- timidate and marginalize immigrants of color in the courts, in the streets, and at the ballot box. 10. Based on my experience as an MRNY staff mem- ber regularly in contact with our members, our organiz- ing staff, our communications staff, and the media, the July 21, 2020 Presidential Memorandum to the Secre-tary of Commerce on the subject of \" Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 167 Census \" (\"Presidential Memorandum \") is making our efforts to encourage Census participation more difficult. The Presidential Memorandum is sowing fear and con- fusion about the Census among the communities we serve. Individuals contacted by our census team since the Presidential Memorandum have state d that they no longer believed they needed to complete the census and even in some cases fear and concern that their comple- tion of the census already may now expose them to pen- alties. The fear and confusion are not unique to undocu- mented immigrants or non -citizens with documented le- gal status, but also to mixed -status households in which individuals are fearful that the census invades their pri-vacy and exposes their family, friends, and neighbor- hoods to profiling by the law enforcement agencies of an admin istration hostile to immigrants of color. When MRNY 's census team encourages these individuals to complete the Census despite these fears, we now con- front questions about what the point is to taking this risk\u2014given that immigrants without lawful status wi ll now not be counted regardless. 11. The Administration 's decision to exclude some non-citizens from the apportionment base directly and severely undermines our Census education and out- reach materials and programming by contradicting its core messages an d discouraging Census response. 12. First, by excluding undocumented people from the apportionment count, the Presidential Memoran- dum creates confusion by contradicting one of the two core purposes of the Census that MRNY highlights in its education and o utreach programming. Because the President has said that the Census responses of some 168 non-citizens will not be used for Congressional appor- tionment, some people may now neglect or decline to fill out the Census either because they no longer believe they a re supposed to fill out the census or because of what they perceive as the diminished importance of their participation. The Presidential Memorandum di- lutes the efficacy of our existing materials and program-ming, which requires MRNY to divert resources fr om other programmatic areas to strategize around how to make our education and outreach effective and to get the same number of people to respond to the Census ques- tionnaire. By contradicting the message that filling out the Census is important to Congres sional apportion- ment, people in the communities will discount the value of our current education and outreach materials or pro- grams, requiring us to modify or make new materials or conduct new outreach that addresses the Presidential Memorandum. For insta nce, MRNY had to prepare and share internal guidance on what the Presidential Mem-orandum means and how to respond to questions; we also now have to revisit previous plans for outreach ma- terials to address the concerns raised by this Memoran- dum. MRNY staff members have also had to divert time from other activities to respond to inquiries from Spanish -language media about this issue to assure peo- ple that everyone, regardless of their immigration sta-tus, should fill out the Census questionnaire and that every person will be counted for apportionment pur- poses. For instance, a single one of MRNY 's Civic En- gagement Coordinators has done over half a dozen Spanish -language media interviews to address the con- fusion and deterrent effect created by the Memoran- dum. 169 13. Second, by excluding undocumented people from the apportionment count, the Presidential Memoran- dum dehumanizes and marginalizes undocumented res- idents by excluding them from the category of \"persons \" required by the Constitution to be included in the appor-tionment count. This has been reflected in constitu- ents whom MRNY 's census team contacts asking \" what is the point \" of completing the census, with the concom- itant risks, when the President has made clear his inten-tion to ensure that undocumented immigrants do not count. By undermining our messaging about the pur- pose of the Census and further marginalizing and con-fusin g immigrants who are already among the popula- tion most often overlooked by the Census, the Presiden-tial Memorandum makes it less likely that the immigrant communities and communities of color we serve will be responsive to our Census education and outreach ef- forts. 14. Third, MRNY 's staff have also observed an in- crease in fear among immigrant community members about completing the Census questionnaire since the Presidential Memorandum. Members of the commu- nity we serve are concerned that the Administration will use information from the Census to attempt to identify undocumented immigrants for deportation or other ad- verse consequences. For instance, one member of MRNY 's census team who regularly walks constituents through completing the census while on the phone has observed many more concerns since the Presidential Memorandum about providing an address or phone number. To address those concerns and to assure peo- ple that they can respond to the Census without fear of immigration enforcement consequences for themselves or their families, MRNY is being forced to revisit and 170 strategize about how to make its education and outreach efforts ef fective, diverting staff time. 15. MRNY will be forced to expend more time than initially anticipated to try to reduce the negative effect of the President 's announcement of the decision to ex- clude undocumented immigrants from the apportion- ment base on Census response rates in the immigrant communities of color it serves. MRNY expects that it will now need to spend more reso urces to convince the same number of people to complete the Census, and that ultimately, it will be less successful in convincing its con- stituents to participate in the 2020 Census due in large part to the Administration 's decision to exclude undocu- mented immigrants from the apportionment base. 16. Because of the need to increase the time and money spent on Census outreach and media work due to the fear and/or confusion generated by the Presidential Memorandum, MRNY will need to divert resources from other areas critical to its mission, including civic engagement and community organizing on other issues, such as obtaining crucial funding for excluded workers and housing advocacy for people struggling with rent during the pandemic, which are critical programm atic areas right now due to the health pandemic and eco- nomic crisis. 17. MRNY puts significant resources in Census ed- ucation and outreach work because our members and the immigrant communities we serve face significant neg- ative consequences in the event of an undercount. MRNY members reside in New York City, Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk Counties, the populations of which include immigrant communities of color that far exceed state and national averages. An undercount of those 171 populations will deprive MRNY members of political in- fluence and Census -guided funding to which they would be entitled by a more accurate count. 18. The shortening of the census self -response dead- line from October 31 to September 30, 2020 also nega-tively impacts MRNY because we anticipate it will cause a further undercount of the immigrant communities that we serve and from which our membership is drawn. This change will also force MRNY to attempt to conduct more outreach and media work in a shorter period of time, straining our s taff capacity and diverting staff time from other priorities at a crucial time in the elec- toral calendar. 19. One MRNY member who will suffer injury due to the Presidential Memorandum is Julissa Bisono. In addition to being a MRNY member, Ms. Bisono is M RNY 's Associate Organizing Director and has been an organ-izer at MRNY for nearly 20 years. I have known Ms. Bisono personally for several years. I know that Ms. Bisono is a resident of Queens County and the parent of two children attending public school, in Community School Districts 24 and 27, that receives Title I funding. Because the number of Latino and immigrant residents of Queens County far exceeds the New York state aver- age, an undercount of Latino and immigrant residents of Queens County will cause Ms. Bisono and other MRNY members in Queens to be deprived of political power and funding that will instead go to other states or other ar-eas o f New York State. 20. Another MRNY member who will suffer injury due to the Administration 's decision to exclude undocu- mented immigrants from the apportionment base is Perla Lopez -Liberato. In addition to being a member 172 of MRNY, Ms. Liberato is a Youth O rganizer at MRNY. I also have known and worked regularly with Ms. Lib- erato for several years. I know that Ms. Liberato is a resident of Queens County, New York. Because the number of Latino and immigrant residents of Queens County far exceeds the New Yo rk state average, an un- dercount of Latino and immigrant residents of Queens County will cause Ms. Liberato and other MRNY mem- bers in Queens to be deprived of political power and funding that will instead go to other states or other ar-eas of New York State. 21. Another MRNY member who will suffer injury due to the Administration 's decision to exclude undocu- mented immigrants from the apportionment base is Yat- ziri Tovar. In addition to being a member of MRNY, Ms. Tovar is a media specialist at MRNY. I also ha ve known and worked regularly with Ms. Tovar for several years. I know that Ms. Tovar is a resident of Bronx County, New York. Because the number of Latino and immigrant residents of Bronx County far exceeds the New York state average, an undercount of La tino and immigrant residents of Bronx County will cause Ms. To-var and other MRNY members in the Bronx to be de- prived of political power and funding that will instead go to other states or other areas of New York State. 173 I, Theo Oshiro, declare under pena lty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and recollection.

TRUMP , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF ROBERT RAPOZA Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746(2), I, Robert Rapoza, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. I am the Executive Director for the Rhode Is- land Board of Elections. I oversee the regulation of various aspects of the elections process within Rhode Is- land. I have been employed by the Rhode Island Board of Elections since 1998 and was appointed Executive Di- rector in 2017. 3. The mission of Rhode Island Board of Elections is to protect the integrity of the electoral process and to effectively and efficiently administer the provisions of the election laws of the United States and the State of Rhode Island. 4. The Rhode Island Board of Elections has an im- portant interest in providing and ensuring for an accu- rate election and that persons who lawfully vote in an elect ion have their ballot counted. The manner in which the State draws its redistricting lines also affects the 176 electoral process since it determines what candidates may run in a given district and who may vote (and be represented) in a given district. 5. Other sources of data for the purposes of redis- tricting is not possible, as use of Census data is man- dated by the Rhode Island Constitution and by statute. See R.I. Const. art. VIII \u00a7 1; R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 22 -1-2 and 22 -2-2. Census data is used to establish R hode Is- land House and Senate districts. For example, the Rhode Island Constitution states that \" the general as- sembly shall, after any new census taken by authority of the United States, reapportion the representation to conform to the Constitution of the state \". R.I. Const. art. VII \u00a7 1. Identical language is used with respect to the Senate. See R.I. Const. art. VIII \u00a7 1. 6. As Executive Director, I have regular contact with dedicated professionals throughout the state who work to carry out the mission of the Board. Through these contacts and through my duties as Executive Di- rector, I have firsthand knowledge of the negative im- pact that an undercount will have on Rhode Island 's rep- resentational interest. 7. Furthermore, as someone who works to ensure a fair and accurate electoral process in a state with a large immigrant community, I can attest to the fact that a Census undercount will negatively impact Rhode Is- land 's representational interest due to its diverse popu- lation. For example, due to higher num bers of noncit- izens in the City of Providence, an undercount means that Providence will likely lose representation in the Rhode Island General Assembly, and other parts of the 177 state will have greater representation. Other commu- nities with high numbers of noncitizens will similarly suffer from undercounts and its representational effect. 8. Lastly, in executing my duties and responsibili- ties as Executive Director of the Rhode Island Board of Elections, I have personal knowledge of the harmful im- pact that a Census undercount will have on providing for and ensuring an accurate and fair electoral process in Rhode Island. Residents of likely undercounted areas such as Providence will have less of a voice in their state and local governments and they will be den ied equal pro- tection of the laws. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoing is true and correct.

I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. I am the Chief Demographer for New York City (the \"City \"), a post I have held since 1994. I was em- ployed by the New York City Department of City Plan- ning (DCP) from 1982 until February of 2020. I am now employed (part -time) by the New York City Economic Development Corporation and detailed to the Popula- tion Division of DCP as Chief Demographer. The Pop- ulation Division serves as the City 's inhouse demo- graphic consultant, providing expertise to agencies for a whole host of applications involving assessments of need, program planning and targeting, and policy formulation. 3. As Chief Demographer for the City, I head a team at the Department of City Planning that has been and continues to be the technical lead on the City of New York 's census efforts. We were responsible for review- ing the address list used in the 2020 decennial census, 180 through participation in the Local Update of Census Ad- dresses (LUCA) program, a function we have performed since 1998, when the LUCA program was instituted. We also provide dem ographic expertise in support of census outreach efforts through a regular series of ana-lytical reports on patterns of self -response to the census by neighborhood. We produce and share these reports so that outreach efforts throughout the City, such as those coordinated by NYC Census 2020 (New York City 's census outreach initiative), the Regional Office of the United States Census Bureau, and other community - based groups, can more efficiently target populations with low self -response rates. I am also actively en- gaged at a national level, promoting the use of methods that will provide a more accurate count for the nation 's cities during the 2020 census. 4. As I have testified in previous litigation related to the 2020 census, self -response is the most a ccurate and efficient way to collect data in the census. 1 As of July 23, more than four months into the 2020 census, self-response rates in New York City have been lagging, at just 53.7 percent, compared to 62.3 percent for the nation. While any comparis on with 2010 is limited by the unique timetable the pandemic has imposed on the 2020 Census enumeration, it is safe to say that self -re- sponse rates for the City and the nation are below their 1 See, e.g., State of New York v. U.S. Department of Commerce, 18-cv-2921 (JMF), Nov. 6, 2018 t rial transcript, at 292, 302, 325- 26. In addition to these excerpts, my entire testimony during the citi- zenship question trial supports this point as well as most of the other assertions in this declaration. See id. at 288 -453. 181 2010 levels for comparable periods.2 Moreover, there are substa ntial differences in self -response rates by neighborhood within New York City. For example, there is a pattern of lower self -response in black and selected Hispanic neighborhoods. 5. If households do not self -respond (which can be done at any point in the enumeration) the next best thing is for them to cooperate with census enumerators when they knock on the door during a process called Non-Response Follow -Up (NRFU). Like self -responses, responses provided in -person to census enumerators come directly from the household being enumerated and thus include self -reported data about both the number of household members and their demographic charac- teristics (such as age, gender, and race), similar to house- holds that self- respond by mail or online. But when households neither self -respond nor answer the door for census enumerators, the quality of the data regarding such households significantly declines. 6. If no one responds to the knock on the door, the Census Bureau will leave a \"notice of visit, \" and then check administrative records from the postal service to see if there is evidence that the unit is occupied. Field workers will talk with neighbors, landlords, or others who may serve as \"proxy respondents, \" by providing in- formation on the number of person s and other charac- teristics of the non -responding household. Another check of administrative records from social security, the IRS, and from other sources, may help complete the 2 Based on a response rate comparison for 2010 and 2020, approx- imately thirty -seven days from the initial mailout (April 23), as cited in Weekly Report on Self -Response (Rates Issued on April 23), NYC Department of City Planning, Population Division, April 24, 2020. 182 enumeration for the household. But such records may not exist, especially fo r historically marginalized groups 7. In cases where enumerators cannot obtain a re- sponse from a household after multiple visits, there are no proxy respondents, and administrative records are not available, the Census Bureau relies on its operation of las t resort: statistical imputation. Households in the neighborhood that responded in the census (also known as \"donors \") are used in a statistical model as a substi- tute for the missing household. Since this form of im- putation extrapolates data based on neighboring house- holds, error is introduced because the demographic char-acteristics of households that do not respond are un- known and may differ substantially from the character-istics reported by households that do. In fact, it is a maxim in statistical s cience that those who fail to re- spond in surveys are inherently different from those who do respond. And since information on the actual number of persons in the household that failed to re-spond is frequently speculative or unknown, the count itself (in a ddition to the data on the characteristics of household members) is likely to be increasingly compro- mised as imputation levels rise. 8. For these reasons, it is extremely important to maximize census self -response rates and, failing that, the rates at which households respond in -person to cen- sus enumerators during NRFU. Any action that low- ers these rates, or that undermines efforts to increase them, impairs the quality of the data collected during the census. But President Trump 's July 21, 2020 \" Memo ran- dum on Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportion- ment Base Following the 2020 Census \" does just that. 183 9. Immigrant communities already confronted se- rious challenges for the accuracy and completeness of the 2020 census stemming from concerns about privacy, a hostile environment facing immigrants on the heels of efforts to add a citizenship question to the census, fear of government authorities, and unprecedented language diversity. On top of that, in March 2020 COVID -19 halted all manner of on -the-ground census outreach, just as the census was about to begin. While \"virtual \" efforts continued, on -the-ground outreach has always been a vital part of promoting awareness of the census and increasing self -response rates. The limitation on physical outr each posed by COVID -19 makes it all the more important \u2014particularly with respect to tradition- ally hard -to-count groups such as immigrants\u2014 to avoid any further disincentive to self -respond or cooperate with enumerators and to maintain a clear message that everyone counts in the census. 10. But instead, President Trump 's July 21, 2020 \"Memorandum on Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Ap- portionment Base Following the 2020 Census \" will fur- ther depress response rates in immigrant communities because it discredits the essential message that every- one's response matters and makes an already fearful group more apprehensive about the perceived risks as- sociated with responding. Time and time again, Cen- sus Bureau research and my own local experience have confirmed that messages about the importance of the census from \"trusted voices \" in the community are a ma- jor factor affecting response. It is a major impetus be- hind the emphasis on local area partnerships, which has been codified in census implementation plans, startin g in earnest with the 2000 Census and continuing through today. Also, it is one big reason why some immigrant 184 communities have higher response rates than others, with Washington Heights in Manhattan being the best example of a high response neighborhood, despite its large non-English -speaking immigrant population but with strong \"trusted voices \" and good community organ- ization. Given that approximately one million individuals live in mixed -immigration -status households in New York City,3 the President 's memorandum \u2014by discred- iting the \" everyone counts \" messaging, including from \"trusted voices \" in the community, and by increasing fears about the perceived risks of responding \u2014will have a chilling effect on census participation not only for the undocumente d, but for a wider net of the city 's more than 3.1 million immigrants. 11. Moreover, the timing of the President 's memo- randum compounds its negative impact. This disincen- tive to participation is occurring just as the Census Bu- reau begins its NRFU operatio ns, where thousands of census enumerators will begin knocking on doors of those who have not responded. Making matters worse, on July 30, 2020, it was reported that the Trump admin- istration would be shortening the time during which the Census Bureau will be allowed to conduct NRFU oper- ations. As a result, those operations are reportedly scheduled to end by September 30, 2020 \u2014one month earlier than the planned October 31 end date, which the Census Bureau had proposed earlier this year (at the urging of loc al officials), in order to properly complete the census enumeration during the pandemic. The com- pressed timeframe imposed on the NRFU operation, in unprecedented circumstances that call for a much longer 3 See Mayor 's Office of Immigrant Affairs, State of Our Immigrant City (March 2018), at 6, 12, available at https://on.nyc.gov/39QD8fT. 185 operation, further exacerbates the negative impact of the President 's memorandum on census data quality and count accuracy. The President 's memorandum disin- centivizes self -response and cooperation with in -person enumerators, and the compressed timeframe will mag- nify the impact of that disincentive as there will be less opportunity for repeated enumerator visits. 12. For all these reasons, the July 21, 2020 Presi- dential memorandum is likely to make the Census Bu- reau resort to less -reliable methods, including statistical imputation, more frequently in im migrant communities than it otherwise would. As described above, this re- sults in poorer quality (less accurate) data both in terms of demographic characteristics as well as the actual count of persons. 13. The decennial census is the statistical backbone of our country, and from the standpoint of a local city planning agency, if a decennial census fails to produce accurate data, informed decision -making cannot occur. This is because the census is more than just a count of people. It also contains other i nformation that helps with school planning, guides policy decisions, assists in the direction of city resources generally, and informs re- sponses to public health emergencies and disasters. And census data drive other surveys that are vital to these areas as well. When the census characteristics data are inaccurate \u2014even if the total population count is correct \u2014cities cannot accurately target resources to address needs, by creating, managing, and effectively im- plementing programs. 14. For example, the Population Division at DCP dis- seminates census data to the New York City Depart- ment of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). The 186 characteristics data on population subgroups form a base for DOHMH' s calculation of disease and other health -related event rates by po pulation subgroups. In addition, DOHMH conducts surveys to track pro- gress toward the reduction of chronic diseases. Many of these surveys rely on sampling and weighting designs that are linked to the American Community Survey (ACS), which is based on the decennial census. A prime example is tracking the prevalence of uninsured New Yorkers as a means of targeting programs for health insurance enrollment. And, most recently, cen- sus data were used to create COVID -19 rates, for the purposes of identifying relative incidence of the disease in the City 's neighborhoods. 15. In addition, we regularly provide data and con- sultation to the New York City Department of Educa- tion (DOE) and the School Construction Authority (SCA). DOE relies on our analysis of recent c hanges in the composition of the population in neighborhoods to inform decisions on how to change the zones around schools as conditions demand, particularly new entrants to the neighborhood and their characteristics, such as the number of children. To pe rform that analysis, we use data from the decennial census, the ACS, and vital statistics. For the SCA, we use decennial census data, along with counts of recently -constructed housing, to project the number of school children who are likely to be associat ed with new housing. SCA uses this infor- mation to plan for new schools and/or the expansion of existing facilities. 16. Another example of the City 's use of demogra phic characteristics data from the census involves planning for the elderly. The populatio n that is 65 years and 187 over is projected to increase nationally and in New York City over the next 20 years. As part of the Age - friendly NYC initiative, a partnership between the City of New York and the New York Academy of Medicine, the Population Divisi on uses age data from the decennial census as a basis for projections of older population groups by neighborhood. These data are used to tar- get neighborhood services for the aged, and to help gov- ernment agencies, elected officials, health care and so- cial service providers, planners, funders, and research- ers understand and analyze spatial and socio- demographic patterns and trends involving the burgeoning older pop- ulations of the City. This neighborhood -level approach is based \u2014first and foremost \u2014on data fro m the decen- nial census. Inaccuracies in population counts and characteristics data from the census and from the ACS compromise the City 's ability to target current services, to determine priorities, and to ensure a more accurate projection of older popula tion for future years. 17. New York City also relies on demographic data from the census and from the ACS for emergency pre- paredness. Whether it is COVID -19, coastal flood events, or blackouts, City agencies need to be able to quantify the size of affecte d populations for everything from evacuations to pandemic response. Census and ACS data at the neighborhood level for persons with mo- bility limitations and other disabilities, especially older populations who require special assistance during pan- demics or other natural disasters, are cases in point. Teams evaluate these numbers on a continuous basis as part of plans for mitigation in times of natural disasters and in other emergencies, such as the activation of cool- ing centers for vulnerable populations wh en an extreme heat wave strikes. 188 18. These examples of how New York City uses not just total population counts but also demographic char- acteristics data from the census put into clear perspec- tive why we cannot afford any federal actions that will further d epress self -response rates, make NRFU efforts less effective, and result in poorer quality census data. But the President 's order excluding undocumented im- migrants from the apportionment does just that. The President 's order will confirm immigrant 's fears about the census, undermine efforts to alleviate those fears, and provide immigrants with an additional disincentive to answer the door when the Census Bureau comes knocking. 19. This is the 4th decennial census I have worked on in a professional cap acity and I am very familiar with the challenges we 've faced in the past, some quite formi- dable; but, I can say without hesitation that the current climate is unprecedented in its potential to affect the enumeration. And, on top of a global pandemic, the last thing we needed was an order from the President of the United States stating that undocumented immi- grants will not be counted. The July 21, 2020 Presiden- tial memorandum will likely undermine outreach efforts and depress response rates in immigrant co mmunities (both self -response and in -person response to enumera- tors), and thus lower the quality of data that the City relies upon to make crucial policy decision impacting ed- ucation, health, and emergency planning, among other things. 189 I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoing is true and correct.

DONALD J. TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF MONICA SARMIENTO Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746(2). I, Monica Sarmiento, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. I am the Executive Director for the Virginia Co- alition for Immigrant Rights (VACIR). I oversee a co- alition of thirty -six member organizations and partner- ships with nearly one hundred organizations in the im- migrant rights movement. I have been employed by VACIR since 2015. I also serve as a commissioner on Governor Northman' s 2020 Complete Count Census Commission. 3. VACIR has been preparing for the 2020 census since 2016. In 2016, we organized community members to comment on the correc t terminology for lan guage use on the 2020 census, and successfully got Governor McAuliffe to sign Virginia up to the Local Update of Census Addresses Operation (LUCA) program. From 192 2017- 2019 we participated in local, stale, and federal or- ganizational me etings on how to create successful cen- sus outreach efforts in the immigrant community. We also fundraised and gave out grants to local community organizations to provide guidance and assistance to those who needed help filling out the census. Finally we worked with media outlets and government offices in creating in language information for non -English speak- ers. 4. As a Commissioner on the Virginia 2020 Census Commission I serve as the in house expert on providing outreach to the Virginia immigrant community. Gov- ernor Northam has made it an initiative of his Admin- istration to have all individuals counted, regardless of immigration status, as has always been the practice by the United States Census Bureau. 5. Members of the coalition and partners of the co- alition have shared with me that the new memorandum signed and promoted by President Trump has hindered their efforts in getting members of the undocumented community to fill out the 2020 census form. Organiza- tional leaders have informed me that communi ty mem- bers see this newest memorandum as a continued attack on their ability to trust the Trump Administration to make good decisions for an accurate and scare count. Community leaden informed me that undocumented Virginians feel that this memorandum dehu manizes them, and does not acknowledge that they are worthy of being counted. Personally, for me it echoed the shame- ful clause that enslaved African Americas would only be counted as three -fifths of a person and would n ot be counted as whole person. A s I listed to community lead- ers share their stories I could hear the frustration and 193 hurt that so many undocumented Virginians, including those who have U.S. citizen children that were born in Virginia, have been left feeling scared and dehumanized by the Tru mp Administrations stance to change the long held practice of counting all who reside in the United States for reapportionment (with the exclusion of tour- ists and temporary business travelers, as well as resi- dents of the District of Columbia) and not just those they categorized as worthy. 6. Coronavirus has forced all of us to change work habits, and dramatically shifted on how business is car- ried out in our country. In Virginia organizations have been forced to changed plans and grassroots outreach effort s to ensure a complete count. Coronavirus has made the census exponentially more difficult. Organ- izers are now doing outreach efforts at food banks, phone banking, and mailing census literature instead of canvassers knocking on people 's door. Unfortunately, President Trump 's memorandum has exac erbated a highly difficult situation to encourage every Virginian, including undocumented Virginia ns, to fill out the cen- sus form Community leaders informed me that undocu- mented Virginians have told them explicitly that they don't see a benefit in filling out the form if they will not be counted. 7. Organiz ational leaders have informed me that community members have refused to fill out the census form. They told me that they have had to spend more time speaking with community members, and even with the extra effort made many community members still refuse to fill out the census form. Organizational lead- ers and community members repeatedly told me that undocumented Virginians have been scared out or fill ing 194 out the 2020 census form. Longer conversations means more staff time is spent on easing the fears and explain- ing to community members why filling out the census is still important. With limited time and budgets organi- zations are reaching fewer people, and spending more money on staff time to do so. 8. At VACR we have put out statement, informed member organizations of the memorandum, and worked with organizations on outreach efforts. The new mem- orandum has required that we use staff time in the midst of a pandemic to address the concerns, issues, and dis- tress this memorandum has caused. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoing is true and correct.

I am the Legal Service Director for Plaintiff Ahri for Justice ( \"Ahri \"). I am a founding member of Ahri and have been on staff since December 2019. I am over 18 years of age. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration. 197 2. Ahri is a nonprofit membership organization with offices in Los Angeles, California. Ahri is a fiscally sponsored project of Tides Advocacy, a 501(c)(4) non- profit organization. Ahri 's mission is to pave new path- ways to justice through the power of community organ- izing, empowering youth, and creating radical change. Through community education, direct legal services, and civic engagement, Ahri seeks to provide individuals with the tools and skills necessary to be progressive agents of change in their communities and to improve the lives of individuals and communities in Southern California. 3. Ahri focuses on empowering low -income commu- nities, immigrant communities, and communities of color. It currently has a staff of seven and spends a large ma- jority of its time on civic engagement work, including substantial censu s-related outreach. As part of its work, it also provides legal services to these communi- ties, with a focus on immigration and employment. It also has a hotline to address questions and community concerns, including regarding census participation, and receives approximately 320 -350 calls per month. There was a surge in the number of calls that Ahri 's hotline received following news of the July 21, 2020 Presidential Memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce on the sub- ject of \" Excluding Illegal Aliens from t he Apportion- ment Base Following the 2020 Census \" (\"Presidential Memorandum\"). Community members called with con- cerns and confusion about the Presidential Memoran-dum and what it means for their households and the pri- vacy and confidentiality of their Census responses. 4. Ahri has roughly 220 individual members, with most residing in Orange and Los Angeles Counties. 198 Ahri 's members include U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, and individuals who do not have lawful immi- gration status. Members pay monthly dues to support Ahri 's mission and volunteer for pho ne-banking and other campaigns. 5. In my capacity as a founding member and Legal Service Director of Ahri, I am responsible in part for com- munity organizing and communications, includ ing Ahri 's education, outreach, and research efforts around the 2020 Decennial Census in the communities Ahri serves. Throughout my tenure with Ahri, I have been in regular contact with Ahri members to learn about their neigh- borhoods, their needs, and the ir concerns to inform com- munications, organizing, and civic engagement pro- grams for Ahri. As a founding member, I have also fa- miliarized myself with Ahri 's internal records and pro- cesses; our staff and their responsibilities; and our pro-grams and program areas. 6. Ahri has an ongoing commitment to promoting engagement in the 2020 Decennial Census among its members and constituents because a complete and accu-rate Census count is critical to ensuring that our mem- bers receive the government funding and full political representation to which they are entitled. Our mem- bers include parents with children enrolled in schools that receive funding under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; drivers who use interstate highways and mass transit on a daily basis and thus de-pend on federal highway funds to perform their jobs; families that rely on food assistance programs; and peo-ple who rely on housing assistance through various funding provided und er Section 8, among other Census - guided funding streams . Promoting Census response 199 can help ensure that the programs, services, and facili- ties that our members rely upon are adequately funded. 7. I have been extensively and personally involved in the research, development, and implementation of Ahri 's 2020 Census education and outreach programs. To develop programs that achieve Ahri 's goals of en- couraging greater Census participation in the communi- ties we serve, I have researched and gained familiarity with the importance of data gathered from the Ce nsus in apportioning political representation and the alloca- tion of some government funding sources. I have re- searched the concerns of our members and the commu- nities we serve around the Census for the purpose of de- veloping effective Census communications directed at im- migrant communities. I have also researched how the communities we serve would be impacted by an under- count toward the end of designing communications and organizing strategies that address those concerns and increase their civic engagement, and Census participa-tion in particular. 8. Because the Decennial Census requires a direct inquiry of every household in the United States, Ahri has invested significant organizational resources in en-couraging our members and the immigrant communities we serve to respond to the Census. This work includes, among other things, phone banking and digital organiz- ing such as webinars and presentations over Zoom. To date, we have contacted over 4,000 people and have as- sisted many of them with filling out the Census ques- tionnaire. Ahri has continued Census education and outreach during the pandemic and plans to continue en- couraging and assisting people in filling out the ques- tionnaire until the response period closes. 200 9. Our Census education and outreach efforts in- form community members on how billions of Census - guided dollars are allocated for public services and how these funds go back into the community. We empha- size that all members of our communities, regardless of age, citizenship status, or ability to vot e, count and must participate in the Census to receive the full funding and resources they need to thrive. We also emphasize the importance of a full Census count for determining polit- ical representation, including the number of represent- atives each state will have in Congress, the number of electors per state in the electoral college, and the bound-aries and composition of districts at all levels of govern- ment, from local school boards and city councils to state legislatures and the House of Representatives . These messages are important because they affirm the human- ity and dignity of all Americans and the responsibility that all Americans, including undocumented Americans, bear for responding to the Census and ensuring that their home states and communities are allocated their fair share of political power and government funding. An example of one of our Census education and outreach documents is attached as Exhibit 1, and is also available at the following link: https://www.instagram.com/p/ B-c2watlog1/ . We have relied upon information pro- vided by the United States Census Bureau and other government agencies in drafting this document and other materials. 10. Ahri has been and remains committed to Census education and outreach work among immi grants and communities of color because those groups have been undercounted. Based on my knowledge as a staff mem- ber at Ahri and an organizer in these communities, in- cluding on Census issues, I understand that one reason 201 that immigrants and communities of color have been un- dercounted is a fear of contact with the government and distrust of government officials, particularly how they will use the data they collect. Households with immi- grants are concerned that their information will be shared with immigrat ion and law enforcement agencies. 11. Ahri has already faced a challenging environ- ment for conducting outreach and encouraging immi- grants of color to respond to the 2020 Census because of our members and constituents ' heightened fear of inter- acting with go vernment workers as a result of the Trump Administration 's persistently hostile and discriminatory actions and attitudes towards immigrants of color and Asian -Americans. The racist and xenophobic acts that the Trump Administration has undertaken include the Administration improperly referring to the COVID -19 pandemic as the \"kung flu\" or the \" Chinese virus \" amid a surge in anti -Asian incidents and hate crimes; at- tempting to include a citizenship question on the Cen- sus; dramatically increasing interior enf orcement raids in communities across the United States; proposing to end family -based immigration, which would dispropor- tionately harm immigrants from Latin America and Asia; separating children from their families at the bor- der and keeping immigrant child ren in cages; threaten- ing jurisdictions that enact undocumented immigrant sanctuary policies, such as Los Angeles, with the loss of federal funds; banning individuals from six majority Arab and/or Muslim countries from entering the United States; attemptin g to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( \"DACA \") program, which allowed 800,000 individuals brought to this country as children to legally reside and work in the United States; rescind-202 ing Temporary Protected Status programs for individu- als from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Nepal; calling for an end to the diversity visa lottery; and referring to some undocumented immigrants as \"animals. \" 12. Based on my experience as an Ahri staff member regularly in contact with our members, our organizing staff, our communications staff, and the media, the Pres- idential Memorandum is making our efforts to encour- age Census participation more difficult. The Presiden- tial Memorandum is sowing fear and confusion about the Census among the communi ties we serve. The fear and confusion are not unique to undocumented immigrants or non -citizens with documented legal status, but also to family and household members of non -citizens, who have expressed concern that participating in the Census will invade their privacy and expose their family, friends, and neighborhoods to profiling by the law enforcement agencies of an administration hostile to immigrants of color. Our members and constituents that have al- ready responded to the Census have likewise expre ssed concern that they may have improperly responded to the Census because they included undocumented indi- viduals in their response, and are confused about what to do and about whether there will be repercussions for responding to the Census. 13. The Admin istration 's decision to exclude some non-citizens from the apportionment base directly and severely undermines our Census education and outreach materials and programming by contradicting its core messages and discouraging responses to the Census. 203 14. Firs t, by excluding undocumented people from the apportionment count, the Presidential Memoran- dum creates confusion by contradicting one of the key messaging about the Census that Ahri highlights in its education and outreach programming: political repre- senta tion. Because the President has said that the Cen- sus responses of some non -citizens will not be used for Congressional apportionment, some people may now ne- glect or decline to fill out the Census because of its di- minished importance. The Presidential Mem orandum dilutes the efficacy of our existing materials and pro- gramming, which will require Ahri to divert resources from other programmatic areas to conduct additional education and outreach to get the same number of peo-ple to respond to the Census questio nnaire. By contra- dicting the message that filling out the Census is im- portant to Congressional apportionment, people in the communities we serve will discount the value of our cur- rent education and outreach materials or programs, re-quiring us to make new materials or conduct new out- reach that address the Presidential Memorandum. This includes training staff and volunteers on how to address these concerns, editing our hotline and phone banking scripts, sending emails and mailers to members about the Presid ential Memorandum, and updating our web- site. Ahri staff members have also had to divert time from other activities to respond to inquiries from Korean -language media about this issue to assure peo- ple that everyone, regardless of their immigration sta- tus, should fill out the Census questionnaire and that every person will be counted for apportionment pur- poses. 204 15. Second, by excluding undocumented people from the apportionment count, the Presidential Memoran- dum dehumanizes and marginalizes undo cumented res- idents by excluding them from the category of \" persons \" required by the Constitution to be included in the appor- tionment count. Furthermore, the exclusion of undocu- mented immigrants from the apportionment base in the Presidential Memorandum indicates effor ts by the Ad- ministration to identify where undocumented immi- grants live and their numbers in order to exclude them from the Census. By undermining our messaging about the purpose of the Census and further marginalizing and confusing immigrants who are alr eady among the population most often overlooked by the Census, the Presidential Memorandum makes it less likely that the immigrant communities and communities of color we serve will be responsive to our Census education and outreach efforts. 16. Third, Ahr i has received an uptick in questions from the public concerning the privacy and confidential- ity of responses to the Census questionnaire since the Presidential Memorandum. Members of the commu- nity we serve are concerned that the Presidential Mem- orandum 's exclusion of people \"not in lawful immigra- tion status \" from the Census base count indicates that the Administration will use information from the Census to attempt to identify undocumented immigrants for de- portation or other adverse consequences. Ahri is plan- ning to conduct more education and outreach than we would have otherwise to address those concerns and to assure people that they can respond to the Census with- out fear of immigration enforcement consequences for themselves or their families. 205 17. Ahri will be forced to expend more resources than initially anticipated to try to reduce the negative effect of the Presidential Memorandum on Census re- sponse rates in the immigrant communities of color it serves. Ahri expects that it will need to interact wi th its constituents more times than previously planned to try to convince them to participate in the 2020 census. Ahri 's target is to contact at least 10,000 individual househol ds, and it expects that it will now need to spend more resources to reach the same number of people and that ultimately it will be less successful in convincing its constituents to participate in the 2020 Census due in large part to the Administration 's decision to exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base. Ahri 's funding is based in part on meeting our target, and Ahri will thus also have to divert resources away from other priorities and program areas to meet this target and avoid losing this funding. Ahri will have to increase staff time and spending devoted it s Census education and outreach efforts by approximately 15 per- cent over current levels to address the Presidential Memorandum. 18. Because of the need to increase the time and money spent on Census outreach due to the fear and/or confusion generated by th e Presidential Memorandum, Ahri will need to divert resources from other areas crit- ical to its mission including civic engagement, commu-nity organizing, youth programs, and legal services. In particular, Ahri will have to divert staff time away from our a dvocacy and outreach campaigns on DACA, ethnic studies, education funding, voter education and outreach, housing insecurity related to the COVID -19 pandemic, and raising money for a COVID -19 commu- nity assistance fund, critical programmatic areas right 206 now during the COVID -19 and ahead of an important general election. I have personally spent at least 35 hours on Census -related work that I otherwise would have spent on other areas of work, including direct legal services, to develop, coordinate, and implement our ad- ditional education and outreach efforts. 19. Ahri puts significant resources in Census educa- tion and outreach work because our members and the immigrant communities we serve face significant nega-tive consequences in the event of an undercount. Ahri members reside in Orange and Los Angeles Counties, the populations of which include immigrant communities of color that far exceed national averages. An under- count of those populations will deprive Ahri members of political influence and Census -guided funding to which they would be entitled by a more accurate count. 20. One of the many Ahri members who will suffer injury due to the Presidential Memorandum and the ef- fects of this policy on Census response rates is Julie Kim. I have known Ms. Kim for over 10 years. I know Ms. Kim is a U.S. citizen and a resident of Ana-heim, California, and that she works as a high school guidance counselor in Orange County, California. I know that Ms. Kim is a commuter and thus depends on federal highway funds. As a re sident of California, Ms. Kim will also lose political power because of California 's loss of at least one seat in the House of Representatives and the loss of a presidential elector due to the Memo- randum 's exclusion of undocumented immigrants from the appo rtionment count. 21. Another Ahri member who will suffer injury due to the exclusion of undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base and the effects of this policy on 207 Census response rates is Simon Lee. I have known Mr. Lee for eight years. Mr. Lee is a resident of Los An- geles, California, where he works for an accounting firm. As a resident of California, he will also lose political power because of California 's loss of at least one seat in the House of Representatives and the loss of a presiden- tial elector. Mr. Lee is entitled to remain and work lawfully in the United States through the DACA Pro- gram. He is entitled to be counted in the ongoing 2020 Decennial Census and included in the apportionment base along with all other residents of Californ ia, regard- less of immigration status. 22. Unfortunately, Ahri will have less time than an- ticipated to address the fear and confusion caused by the Presidential Memorandum among the immigrant com- munities that we serve. The actual counting period of the Cen sus is only a few months, but the consequences of the Census in terms of political power and funding al- location will last for a decade. At the time the Presi- dential Memorandum was published on July 21, there were 102 days remaining in the nonresponse follow -up period, which was then scheduled to end on October 31. However, on July 31, the Census Bureau abruptly accel- erated the end of non -response follow -up to September 30. With only 57 days left in the headcount, every sin- gle day remaining is a criti cal opportunity for Ahri to conduct further Census outreach. Ahri will have to ac- celerate its remaining Census education and outreach efforts to address the Presidential Memorandum 's neg- ative effect on Census responses. 208 I, Jenny Seon, declare under pena lty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and recollection.

MIRA, founded in 1987, is the largest immigrant and refugee advocacy organization in New England, rep-resenting approximately 130 organizational members, including organizations that provide services for immi- grants and foreign- born individuals such as community 215 health care centers, unions, English for Speakers of Other Languages groups, faith -based and grassroots organi- zations, and ethnic groups and associations. Through our membership and networks, MIRA represents around 1.2 million foreign -born people, many of whom are part of the 1.6 million people in Massachusetts who are \" hard to count \" for purposes of the decennial census. Since our founding, we have worked diligently in collaboration with our partners across the state and nation to build trust, provide services and resources, and share critical information with our immigrant communities. MIRA 's mandate is to increase the economic, social, civil, and lin- guistic integration of foreign -born individuals and their families in the Commonwealth. 4. MIRA has participated in past decennial census efforts, including in the 2000 and 2010 censuses. MIRA's past census work centered on organizing outreach efforts with partner organizations, including media and faith - based groups, to conduct door -to-door canvassing, dis- seminate tr anslated materials in key spaces, and create public service announcements and advertising to at- tempt to increase participation and reduce the amount of any undercount. 5. For the 2020 Census, MIRA is the recipient of a grant from the Secretary of the Commo nwealth to assist with community education and outreach aimed at ensur- ing a complete count of the residents of Massachusetts. As a part of this work, MIRA convenes the Statewide Complete Count Committee, which includes partner or- ganizations from around th e state, including MassCounts (a coalition of nonprofits working on census outreach), service providers, state agencies ( i.e., Department of Secondary Education, Council on Aging), faith -based 216 groups, immigrant -led organizations, local and regional complete count committees, and other civic organiza- tions, including ethnic groups and associations. MIRA also coordinates census messaging with national and state partners; trains local partner organ izations on out- reach to hard -to-count populations; produces educa- tional, communication, and advertising materials for lo- cal distribution to encourage participation in the census; and tracks response rates for planning and targeting ef- forts to increase resp onse rates in historically under- counted areas and populations. 6. Notwithstanding our preparations and commit- ment to achieving a complete count, the 2020 Census has been beset with challenges and barriers to participation that were not present during the 2000 or 2010 census. These issues include the ultimately unsuccessful attempt to add an untested citizenship question to the 2020 cen- sus form, the COVID -19 global pandemic, and, now, a last - minute Presidential Memorandum directing the Depart-ment of Comme rce to omit undocumented people from the population count to be reported to Congress for the purpose of apportioning seats in the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives. 7. These unforeseen challenges have seriously im- pacted implementation of the 2020 Census. For exam- ple, Non -Response Follow -Up ( \"NRFU \")\u2014the critical, in-person phase of the census designed to help count hard -to-count populations and other non -responders \u2014 was scheduled to begin in Massachusetts on May 13, 2020. However, due to COVID -19, NRFU will not begin until August 11, 2020, for most of the state (however, there are soft launches in certain areas that started on and around July 30, 2020). In addition to this delay to 217 NRFU, Massachusetts census partners have had to re- duce outreach activities due t o coronavirus. Moreover, many local partners lack funding and are working at re-duced capacity. For instance, one entire region of our state no longer has an organization to convene its local Complete Count Committee because the convener 's fund- ing for cen sus-related activities ran out in July, when NRFU was originally supposed to have been completed. 8. Additionally, we just learned on Friday, July 31, 2020, that the Census Bureau is shortening its timeline for NRFU: it is now planning to conclude its efforts by September 30 versus October 31, 2020, effectively halv- ing the tim e to complete NRFU activities. 9. Each of these unprecedented challenges to the 2020 Census has also had real world consequences on people' s trust in the confidentiality of the decennial cen- sus as well as their willingness to participate in the count, particularly among Massachusetts ' immigrant communi- ties. 10. Prior to the launch of the census in mid -March, MIRA identified forty -five historicall y hard -to-count municipalities for participation monitoring. These are cities with large immigrant populations that had low participation rates (less than 76%) in the 2010 census. As COVID -19 surged in Massachusetts, we saw more and more of these municipalities fall below the statewide response rate; and, as of July 31, 2020, more than half (26) had fallen below the statewide response rate. At an even more granular level, there are nearly 300 census tracts with immigrant populations of at least 30 %, and all of these tracts are below the statewide response rate. These immigrant -rich communities in cities such as Chelsea, Everett, Lawrence, Worcester, and Boston, 218 among others, are also some of the places that have been hit the hardest by both the he alth and economic impacts of COVID -19. 11. Presently, I am working to anticipate and address the impact of President Trump's July 21, 2020, memoran-dum (the \"Memorandum\"), which, among other t hings, di- rects the Department of Commerce to exclude undocu-mented residents from its transmittal of the population count for purposes of apportionment in Congress. In short, despite MIRA 's ongoing efforts to achieve a com- plete count and the efforts of our local partners and sim-ilar organizations nationwide, the Preside nt has direc - ted that undocumented residents be retroactively disre-garded for calculating Congressional apportionment. 12. We are very concerned that the Memorandum will have the effect of discouraging undocumented indi- viduals from participating in the ce nsus: if un docu- mented individuals will be erased from the count, why should they participate at all? Moreover, a major com- ponent of our messaging thus far has been that census participation is critical because it determines the alloca- tion of resources an d representation over the next dec- ade. This is a simple and historically accurate message that runs parallel to messaging from the Census Bu- reau. However, the Memorandum directly contradicts this messaging. 13. We are also very concerned that the Memora n- dum discourages documented individuals, including U.S. citizens, from participating in the census. Many docu- mented individuals and U.S. citizens live with undocu-mented individuals. There is already pervasive fear about participation in the census in imm igrant commu- nities, spurred on by the Trump Administration 's earlier 219 effort to include a citizenship question. A major com- ponent of our messaging \u2014again borrowed from the Cen- sus Bureau \u2014has been that the census is safe and confi- dential. We have highlighted the Title 13 protections, which threaten severe financial penalties and imprison- ment for any Census Bureau staff who discloses individ- uals' data. Yet, the Memorandum undermines this mes- sage by directing the Census Bureau to identify and re- move undocumented people from the apportionment base. As we have heard directly from communities across Massachusetts, given this latest development, im- migrants are afraid that legal protections will be ins uf- ficient. They fear that if the President wishes to iden- tify undocumented individuals, he will use any means to do so, regardless of present assurances regarding cen- sus confidentiality. In fact, several partners, including Agencia Alpha, are no longer willing to champion the se-curity and confidentiality of the 2020 Census. 14. This Memorandum has been incredibly disrup- tive to MIRA 's complete count work, particularly in light of the already significant delays and strained fund-ing and resources for ce nsus outreach due to COVID -19. 15. Among other things, prior to the Memorandum, MIRA had developed messaging that was consistent with our national partners for use by local partners in their outreach efforts. Following the issuance of the Memorandum, we have had to spend time reconsidering our messaging to evaluate if it is still accurate and if it sufficiently addresses new concerns raised by the Mem- orandum. 16. At the very least, we know that this Memoran- dum will make our work and that of our partner organi- zations significantly more difficult as we continue to 220 work toward a complete count in Massachusetts. In the first ten days following issuance of the Memoran- dum, my staff and I collectively spent more than 25 hours reviewing it, researching its impact on the census and our own messaging, and meeting internally to dis-cuss these issues and coordinate our response and ex- ternal messaging. We also attended meetings with na- tional partners such as Census Counts to stay on top of the developments and ensure that our message to immi- grant communities would stay consistent nationally. 17. I have spent significant time since the Memoran- dum was issued talking to local partner organizations who contacted me concerned and confused about the Memorandum and its impact on t heir census outreach and on the communities they are helping to count. These include Agencia Alpha, a faith -based non -profit serving Latinos across the Commonwealth, the Immigrant Fam-ily Services Institute, a Massachusetts non -profit that provides targeted academic and enrichment services to immigrant children, and the Brazilian Women' s Group, a non -profit serving the Portuguese -speaking commu- nity. We anticipate needing to provide additional train- ing to our partner groups relating to this Memorandum and h ave scheduled an emergency webinar for August 5 to address the Memorandum and other related opera-tional changes by the Census Bureau. Additionally, given the resource constraints, I am concerned that even if we expend the necessary resources to produce and run such trainings, some of our partners may not have capacity to participate. 18. Prior to the Memorandum, we had created digi- tal graphics and physical outreach materials, including palm cards, for partners to distribute in the areas in 221 which they work . We ordered 30,000 of these cards in mid-July and ordered another 30,000 in late July, which cost approximately $6,000. To date, the total cost of the creation of digital graphics and advertising, as well as the staff time required to research and devel op these materials, is well over $60,000. Because of the Memo- randum, I am concerned that these materials will not be as effective, especially in our immigrant communities and with mixed -status households. As I discussed in paragraphs 12 and 13 above, the Memorandum critically undermines our present messaging about the importance of the decennial census for all inhabitants of our Com- monwealth and its safety and confidentiality. There was no way to anticipat e the existence or issuance of this Memorandum when we designed our outreach materi- als, so our current materials do not address any new questions arising from the Memorandum. For instance: \"Is it safe for undocumented individuals to participate if the government is going to investigate their status in or- der to exclude them for the purposes of apportionment? \" and \"Why bother to be counted at all if the government is just going to exclude you later? \" While, out of neces- sity, our original messaging may stil l ultimately be used, additional one -on-one conversations and relational out- reach are necessary to maintain trust among communi-ties and census partners to ensure confidence that cen- sus information will remain confidential and that there are still important benefits to responding to the census, such as ensuring receipt of critical federal funding. 19. At this stage, we do not have the time or funding to replace the palm cards, translate new messaging to reach our immigrant communities, hire additional out- reach workers, or provide financial support to our part- ner organizations to conduct effective in -person, direct 222 outreach. Organizations, including government depart- ments , are already overwhelmed by adjusting census outreach plans during COVID -19. It is espe cially chal- lenging to conduct the necessary outreach with limited capacity during the shortened NRFU period. 20. The week of July 27 through July 31, 2020, was supposed to be a huge organizing surge before NRFU begins. However, I and other MIRA staff, as well as our partner organizations, have had to divert time and resources to dealing with issues related to the Memoran- dum rather than focusing on the planned surge. We an- ticipate that the loss of time dedicated to encouraging residents to self -respond wil l result in a significantly larger non -response rate on August 11, 2020, thereby in- creasing the necessary scope of the resource -intensive NRFU process. 21. Moreover, MIRA partner organizations, includ- ing those mentioned in paragraph 17, are reporting that they believe their outreach efforts will be less effective because of the Memorandum, and that people who have not responded to the 2020 Census to date are even less likely to respond to NRFU efforts following the Memo-randum. I share these concerns. 22. Since the issuance of the Memorandum, MIRA and our partner organizations have received questions and concerns from other census partners and commu- nity members. Local census partners reached out to us to ask if the messaging and outreach needs to be change d, in light of the Memorandum, to include special messaging to immigrants who live in mixed -status house- holds in order to avoid or reduce fear, misinformation, or disinformation and clarify the directives in the Mem-orandum for these households. A few of o ur partners 223 have also specifically asked for guidance on communi- cating the impacts of the Memorandum to immigrants who already took the census and feel that their info r- mation will no longer be kept confidential. As one ex- ample, Agencia Alpha 's outreach wo rkers shared that when they followed up with immigrant families, those families asked whether or not they should be worried about the information they had shared when they com- pleted the census. Partners have requested simple and clear talking points expla ining: the importance of taking the census; the present attempt by the Trump Admin- istration to exclude undocumented individuals from the apportionment base; that undocumented individuals will still be included in the count for other purposes; and how the C ensus Bureau could discern documentation status data while maintaining confidentiality (to the extent that an answer exists to this question). Grassroots part- ners have also shared that they anticipate an increase in community fears that the census could b e used to iden- tify people for deportation, similar to the wave of fear that followed the 2018 attempt to add a citizenship ques- tion to the 2020 census questionnaire. 23. Although MIRA and our partner organizations are still planning the extent of our response to the Mem- orandum, it is clear that we must act to mitigate the an- ticipated negative impacts of the Memorandum on cen- sus response rates in Massachusetts. While this is a novel situation, our years of experience in organizing underscore our concern that an effective response will require significant additional expenditures of time and money, during a very short period of time, to develop messaging and materials, as well as to ensure these ma- terials reach the hard -to-count communities we are work- ing to engage in the census. 224 24. Mitigating the negative impact of the Memoran- dum on response rates will be a costly, time -consuming effort, which comes at a time wh en funding for census outreach is essentially exhausted and time to complete the census count is running out. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoing is true and correct.

DONALD J. TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF R OSA MAR IA Y . SOTO (AKA ROSEMARY SOTO) Pursuant to 28 I, Rosamaria Y. Soto (AKA Rosemary Soto), hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. I am Management Analyst III for the County Administrative Office for the County of Monterey. I oversee special projects and strategic initiatives of the Board of Supervisors, including the 2020 Census Com- plete Count Committee for Monterey County. I have been employed by the County of Monterey since 2007. 3. The County is a partner of the California Com- plete Count Committee, Chaired by Secretary of State Alex Padilla, and the County Administrative Office leads a local Complete Count Committee (CCC) charged with the task of educating, encouraging, and empowering Hard -to-Count (HTC) populations in Monterey County. My role has been to establish and manage the Monterey County CCC, which was established in October of 2018 227 with the commitment of all incorporated cities, commu- nity leaders representing unincorporated co mmunities, elected officials, and community -based organizations. The cross -sector membership of partners provided a vast diversity of expertise in community organizing and cultural awareness needed to reach the HTC popula- tions who most feared and mistrusted government, and exhibited the greatest reluctance to participate in the 2020 Census. I have led the development of strategies for outreach and education: media messaging and re-cruitment of trusted voices to disseminate Census infor- mation and encourage HTC populations to participate in the Census; the development of Census training curric- ulum; recruitment and training of volunteers; leading the implementation of Census assistance kiosks to meet the digital divide by providing access to the online ques- tionnaire; answering questions; addressing concerns peo- ple might have about the Census questionnaire; ensur- ing completion and submission of the questionnaire by participants; and developing and implementing strate- gies for the Non -Response Follow Up Period (NR FU), this being the final effort to get out the count during the last three months of the Census enumeration period. 4. For the 2020 Census, the County of Monterey has invested $300,000 to support organizing, outreach, and advertising efforts, leveraging C alifornia CCC funding of $441,446 and local philanthropic contributions of $622,650. Collectively, a total investment of $1,364,096 has been made to ensure a complete count of all people living in Monterey County. 5. Efforts to increase participation in t he 2020 Cen- sus and reduce undercounting began with building part- nerships with organizations and community leaders who 228 have deep connections with the HTC populations. To- gether we developed a social marketing campaign with culturally relevant and linguistic ally appropriate key messages to educate and inform communities about the importance of the decennial Census, and its impact on community resources through federal funding and the apportionment of Congressional representation. Mes- sages were centered on \"E veryone Counts, \" highlight- ing the U.S. Census Bureau 's own message of \" Every- one living in the United States is required by law to be counted in the 2020 Census. \" Other key messages fo- cused on education about the fact that the Census ques-tionnaire does not ask about one 's citizenship or immi- gration status. Trusted messengers were recruited and trained to disseminate key messages in a variety of forms and through various outlets, including public service an-nouncements, print images, social media memes and graphics, radio show features, theater skits and \"fotono- velas, \" or photobook dramatizations of theater skits. The social marketing campaign launched in April 2019 with an eleven -month series of community outreach ac- tivities conducted in census tracts where HTC popula- tions reside and congregate, particularly Latino immi- grant populations. 6. The Presidential Memorandum completely un- dermines our efforts to ensure a complete and accurate count of everyone living in Monterey County and con tra- dicts our social marketing campaign 's message. More importantly, the Presidential Memorandum contradicts the U.S. Constitution 's mandate to count whole persons living in the United States, further increasing the deeply rooted pre -existing mistrust of government of immi- grant populations living in Monterey County. 229 7. The impacts of COVID -19 on Census outreach has been significant: a series of planned community events with mobile Census questionnaire assistance cen- ters were canceled; public spaces previously frequented by community members, such as recreation centers, public libraries, shopping malls, school -based sporting events, spring and summer social gatherings and celebrations, all had to be canceled; all of our planned in -person out- reach strategies were brought to a scre eching halt. Many of the volunteers were retirees who, because of their age and/or underlying health conditions, were forced to scale back or terminate their community outreach activ- ities. The involvement of students and young adults was constrained by th eir educational institutions ' adher- ence to State and County shelter -in-place ordinances, further impacting our volunteer base and immobilizing our outreach capacity and ability to implement our \" get out the count \" strategies. 8. While our outreach strategies have shifted to \"virtual \" online efforts, we have managed to operate contactless questionnaire assistance centers in the cen- sus tracts with the highest rates of HTC populations. 9. Monterey County has the most census tracts with high indexes of HTC populations of any region in the central coast of California. Those high index cen- sus tracts are currently responding at rates below 50%, among the lowest in the country. Many of the census tracts are in either high density urban parts of the county or in rural communities predominantly inhabited by La- tino immigrant populations. 10. Computer literacy and internet access have proven to be barriers for many if not all the HTC popu-230 lations. The Census Bureau 's late start has exacer- bated this challenge. Not only have the Census Bu- reau 's operations been delayed, there has been no ap- parent effort to shift their operations to virtual or con- tactless operations. As of July 30, 2020, Monterey County 's response rate is at 60.1%, trailing be hind the state 's rate of 64.1% and the nation 's rate of 62.8%. 11. Since the Presidential Memorandum was issued on July 21, 2020, our community partners have reported an increase in concerns in immigrant communities. Con- fusion has set in about why our messages over the past year highlighting the importance of counting everyone in the decennial Census, and emphasizing the security of Census data, are now contradicted by the U.S. Presi-dent. 12. Immigrants and their families, including those who do have legal status, have long lived in the shadows of our society due to the fear that providing personal information to the government would potentially expose them to harm. After having h eard messages of empowerment \u2014to be visibl e and counted for the sake of their community 's future \u2014the President 's words have renewed their fears, and generated mistrust of the federal government 's commitment to upholding their Constitutional right to be counted in the Census and included in the app ortion- ment of Congressional representation. Remarks I and my colleagues have commonly heard following the issu- ance of the Presidential Memorandum while hosting mo- bile Questionnaire Assistance Kiosks at the open air market La Cocina on Broadway Ave in King City, La Princesa Market and EZ Wash & Dry both on N. Sanborn Rd. in East Salinas, all locations in a high HTC index census tract, include statements such as \" if the 231 President can force a federal agency to manipulate the Census count, what more can we exp ect he will do to de- stroy us and our access to resources that provide for our basic needs \"; \"why would I fill out the Census, giving you the address of where my family and I sleep, which is supposed to be my safe place, knowing that all the President has t o do is issue an order and we could be wiped out by the stroke of a pen? \"; and, \"We don 't mat- ter, why be counted if at the end of the day being counted doesn 't matter in terms of political power, which is where we need it most. \" Many such comments come from doc- umented immigrants who have been discouraged and dissuaded from participating in the enumeration pro-cess. 13. The Presidential Memorandum already has de- terred many people in Monterey County from partici- pating in the decenni al Census and contributed to the low response rate. We are once again forced to adjust our outreach messaging and strategies to mitigate the negative impact of the Presidential Memorandum. To do so, we will need additional investment to augment fund-ing t o increase messaging through media outlets and in - person contactless outreach strategies. Such strate- gies will bear significant unexpected costs, but are im- perative as we try, at the last minute, to address the chal- lenges of carrying out our mission to co unt everyone. I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge, the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on this third day of Aug ., 2020 /s/ ROSEMARY SOTO ROSEMARY SOTO 232 Exhibit 46 233 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 20 Civ. 5770 (JMF) STATE OF NEW YORK, ET AL ., PLAINTIFFS v. DONALD J. TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF JONATHAN STERNESKY Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746(2), I, JONATHAN STERNESKY, hereby declare as follows: 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein. 2. I am the Manager of Policy and Legislative Af- fairs for the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Fi- nance Agency (NJHMFA). In this role, I oversee NJHMFA 's executive policy team and work directly with NJHMFA 's programmatic divisions to develop and implement new Agency programs, as well as analyze and review the efficacy of existing Agency programs. I have been employed by NJHMFA since 2018 and have a bach-elor's degree from Kean University and a master 's de- gree in public administration from Seton Hall Univer-sity. 3. NJHMFA is the State of New Jersey 's primary vehicle for developing and funding affordable homeown- ership and rental housing for New Jersey residents. Agency staff rely heavily on data prepared by the United 234 States Census Bureau to administer federal and state housing programs. Decennial Census and American Community Survey data provide NJHMFA with socio- economic and population characteristics (e.g., age, race and ethnicity, individual and household income, employ- ment, poverty, form of tenure (i.e., rental or ownership), housing quality, rent and mortgage costs, and housing vacancy), as well as aggregate characteristics of geo- graphic areas (e.g., area median income; housing cost burden; fair market rent; qualified low -income Census tracts; and Difficult to Develop Areas). To operate most effectively, NJHMFA nee ds accurate Census data, which is directly or indirectly utilized to inform a significant subset of programmatic targeting and policy determina-tions. 4. NJHMFA regularly relies on Census data for policy and programmatic decision -making for two pri- mary reasons. First, the Decennial Census is the gov- ernment and policy -making reference point for better understanding the diverse populations within communi- ties across the United States, acting as the baseline for key forward -looking economic and population esti mates. Second, the Decennial Census \u2014unlike other data ser- vices and products provided by the United States Cen- sus Bureau \u2014is an actual enumeration, or count, of the total population of the country, providing a fuller, more comprehensive point -in-time unders tanding of the pop- ulation when compared to an estimate derived from a sample. 5. Census data deeply influences the way that NJHMFA designs and plans for the allocation of hous-ing funds across the state. For example, the Agency uses income, poverty, employment, housing density, and 235 housing vacancy data from the Census to direct its an- nual $20 million to $25 million allocation of federal 9% Low -Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC). These credits are then used to leverage roughly a ten -fold in- flux of private investment into equity for development costs to both high -opportunity and high -need areas of New Jersey. 6. Census data also determines the design and pa- rameters of state -level programs. For instance, Ne w Jersey 's First -Time Homebuyer mortgage and down payment assistance programs are targeted toward low - and moderate -income households, using Census -derived data, including area median incomes and Urban Target Areas, which are referred to as \" Targeted Areas \" or \"Targeted Area Residences \" for federal purposes. Simi- larly, several special needs housing trust funds in New Jersey rely on Census- informed area median incomes to target units to the most vulnerable renters and to set affordable rents. 7. Finally, w e use Census data to evaluate our pro- grams and determine whether we are serving low -income and other historically marginalized or otherwise vulner- able populations effectively. Most recently, we carried out a racial equity analysis on our down payment assi s- tance program to determine whether we were serving homebuyers of all races and ethnicities effectively. With- out accurate Census data, including accurate data re- porting the characteristics of the enumerated popula-tion, we would not be able to assess the Ag ency 's perfor- mance and make adjustments to be able to serve all New Jerseyans in an equitable manner. 236 8. As illustrated in the preceding paragraphs, Cen- sus data underpins so much of NJHMFA 's program de- sign, planning, and implementation that its accuracy is necessary in order to make key decisions affecting af-fordable housing in New Jersey. 9. Poor quality Census data would have a deleteri- ous effect on the residents of New Jersey. For exam- ple, NJHMFA is charged with distributing state and federal resource s critical to advancing the socioeconomic opportunities of New Jersey 's most vulnerable residents. Without an accurate representation of the State 's popu- lation, NJHMFA would be at risk of inadvertently di-verting such resources away from the residents and communities the programs are designed to serve. In- accurate Census data would also place NJHMFA at in-creased risk of setting policies and goals that are re- sponsive to the faulty data, instead of the actual needs of these communities. Additionally, poor qu ality cen- sus data would compromise the calculation of maximum permissible rents for both 4% and 9% LIHTC projects. Those rents are calculated based on affordability for families at different income levels. If data regarding the number of households and ar ea median income measures are distorted because the Census disproportionately un-dercounts certain communities and income brackets or because the quality of the Census data is otherwise de- graded, there would be a direct impact on the maximum rent calculatio ns. For example, if poor -quality Census data inaccurately reflected an inflated median income for an area, maximum rent levels would be set higher than what is truly \" affordable \" for low - and moderate - income families in those areas. 237 10. In sum, inaccurate Census data would produce substantial harm to NJHMFA, compromising its ability to effectively administer programs serving vulnerable communities.

TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS DECLARATION OF GUSTAVO TORRES I, Gustavo Torres, pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct: 1. I am the Executive Director of CASA de Mary- land, Inc. ( \"CASA \"). In this capacity, in which I have served since 1994, my job is to lead an organization that builds power and fights for justice alongside the immi- grant, Latino, and working class community in the United States. Over my 26 years at CASA, we have grown from a small welcome center for Central Ameri-240 can refugees to the mid -Atlantic 's largest immigrant ad- vocacy organization, serving our community in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. Through that work, we have grown our membership to over 110,000 lifetime members. We have done this through providing ser- vices our community needs and deserves, through or- ganizing working class immigrants from over 140 coun- tries around the world whom we are proud to count as members, and by standing with them in the streets, in the halls of power, and in courtrooms as they fight for justice, dignity, and the opportunity to thrive. 2. Based on my more than 25 years of professional experience working for Latino and immigrant serving organizations in both the public and private sectors, the current outreach to immigrant communities I oversee in my current capacity at CASA, and my conversations with individual CASA members, I believe the Presiden- tial Memorandum to the Secretary of Commerce on the subject of \"Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportion- ment Base Following the 2020 Census \" (\"Presidential Memorandum\" ) will deter participation of many individ- uals in the Latino and immigrant communities, and re- sult in a disproportionate u ndercount of Latinos. As a result of the decision to add this question, CASA has di-verted and will continue to be required to divert re- sources from core organizational priorities to additional, remedial outreach to counteract the Presidential Mem- orandum 's negative effect on Census response rates in our community. 3. The Presidential Memorandum will directly in- jure CASA members, many of whom live in areas of the United States in which immigrants of color and other 241 communities of color exceed national and state aver- ages. Specifically, they will be harmed because the ex- clusion on undocumented residents from the apportion- ment base will diminish their political power relative to other parts of their states. In addition, they will be harmed because the disprop ortionate undercount that will result from the Presidential Memorandum among immigrants of color will well as the amount of Census - guided funding those areas receive for key programs, services, and facilities that our members and their fam- ilies rely on to succeed in the communities in which they live. I. CASA 's Mission and Activities 4. CASA is a non -profit 501(c)(3) membership or- ganization headquartered in Langley Park, Maryland, with offices in Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Founded in 1985, CASA is the largest membership- based immigrants ' rights organization in the mid -Atlantic re- gion, with more than 100,000 all -time members. 5. CASA 's mission is to create a more just society by increasing the power of and improving the quality of life of low -income immigrant communities. To advance this mission, CASA offers social, health, education, job training, employment, and legal services to immigrant communities. CASA serves nearly 20,000 people a year through its offices and provides support to addi- tiona l clients over the phone and through email. 6. As Executive Director, I work to increase the power of immigrant voices, including the political power of these communities, by promoting voting rights and participation by our communities in the democratic pr o- cess. I oversee all aspects of CASA 's work, including 242 our community organizing, services, communications and other departments and programs. I am deeply in- volved in all key decision making aspects of the organi-zation, including our large scale Census ou treach and education efforts across Maryland, Virginia and Penn-sylvania. 7. CASA works with members in navigating and enrolling in public benefits for which they are eligible. This work includes connecting members with public ben e- fits related to health, e ducation, and legal services. CASA assists eligible members in enrolling in food as- sistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food assis- tance to low -income individuals, and the Special Supple- mental Nut rition Program for Women Infants and Chil- dren (WIC), which provides supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education to eligible indi- viduals. CASA also assists eligible members in enrol- ling for health care coverage through Medicaid, or en- rolling their children in the Children 's Health Insurance Program. 8. CASA 's Education Department works with fam- ilies residing in dense immigrant neighborhoods to nav- igate them through the school enrollment process in Ti- tle 1 funded public schools serving these neighborhoods. Staff also provide information about early childhood ed- ucation programs available in the neighborhoods served by CASA and partner with local providers to enroll eli- gible children in those programs. 243 II. CASA 's Census- Related W ork 9. CASA has an ongoing commitment to promoting engagement in the Decennial Census among its mem- bers, constituents, and communities. Member partici- pation in the Decennial Census advances CASA 's mis- sion by increasing the political power of low -income im- migrant communities. 10. Given CASA 's 35 year history working with im- migrant communities throughout the Mid -Atlantic re- gion and the trust it has developed with these communi- ties as a result of this history, CASA has consistently been a \"go-to\" organizati onal partner in conducting out- reach and education around the Decennial Census and other related activities. 11. In 2019- 2020, CASA partnered with various state and local government education and outreach campaigns throughout Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Vir ginia. In addition, CASA received dedicated funding from other sources to conduct door -to-door outreach, facilitate group educational sessions as well as conducting follow up out-reach via phone and text message, and social media, and ongoing work with loc al, ethnic media to inform, engage, and encourage participation in the Census among Lim- ited English Proficient, immigrant communities in the region. 12. CASA 's messaging has focused on the impor tance of the Decennial Census in ensuring that the political power of the districts where our members live reflect the total population of these areas. CASA has emphasized that every person, regardless of citizenship status and whether they are documented or not, is counted in the Census for purposes of political apportionment and 244 Census -guided funding. As part of these efforts, CASA developed Census outreach materials in English and Spanish, reaching the community through social media and direct outreach, as well as by phone. We uti- lized physical and digital \" Census pledge \" cards, gath- ering commitments from community members to partic- ipate in the Census. These efforts were targeted par- ticularly at the immigrant and Latino community, and were specifically designed to reach individuals in fami- lies with mixed imm igration status. CASA has an on- going commitment to promoting our members ' engage- ment with the Decennial Census, because a complete and accurate Census count is critical to ensuring that our members receive the full political representation and funding to which they are entitled. III. Harm to CASA as a Result of the Exclusion of Undocumented Residents from Apportionment 13. As described below, the Presidential Memoran- dum harms CASA members, as well as the organization more broadly. The Presidential Memora ndum is in- creasing already heightened levels of fear among immi- grants. The Trump Administration 's anti -immigrant policies and rhetoric have led to decreased engagement with the government generally, and specific fear of par- ticipating in the Decennial Cens us. This latest step by the Trump Administration to exclude undocumented residents from the apportionment base is only serving to increase this fear, and discourage participation in the Decennial Census. This fear and decreased participa- tion harms CASA as an organization, because it under- mines our core messaging regarding the importance of the Decennial Census, and is requiring us to divert our resources to encourage participation in the Decennial 245 Census. In addition, this latest move requires us to change our messaging after nearly 11 months of pro- gramming aimed at increasing participation in the De- cennial Census. A. Fear in the Latino Immigrant Community under the Current Administration 14. Based on our conversations and work in the com- munity, immigran t members of CASA have felt tar- geted, bullied and attacked by the rhetoric and actions of the Trump administration. Starting with the presi- dential campaign, through to its current policies, CASA members have expressed fear, frustration and despair over how they feel this administration has scapegoated them. In particular, they have expressed fear over the emphasis this administration has placed on increased deportations and immigration enforcement. 15. Policies such as family separation at the border, the \"zero -tolerance policy \" for immigrants entering the United States without documentation, and the attemp ted elimination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arri- vals (DACA) and the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programs have all increased the fear among immigrant communities of being targeted by agencies such as ICE. This fear has led to a chilling effect on the willingness of immigrant communities of all types, regardless of immi- gration status, to interact with the federal government in any way. 16. CASA and its partner providers have begun to track a decrease in the number of individuals applying for certain public benefits. Most troubling has been a de- crease in the number of enrollments into benefits com- pletely unrelated to as of yet announced policies, such as 246 a decrease in the number of immigrants applying for health insurance made available through the Affordable Care Act or a decrease in the number of Legal Perma-nent Residents applying for citizenship. We have also noted a marked decrease in in dividuals accessing food stamps, which has not only made families less food se- cure but also contributed to local schools systems losing funding, because aid is tied in part to the number of chil- dren in the schools who are receiving food stamps. To those o f us at CASA, this decreased participation indi- cates that the Trump Administration 's policies are not only affecting those directly targeted by these policies, but are increasing fear among the immigrant commu- nity more broadly. Similarly, CASA has noticed a gen- eral distrust of government resulting in increased hesi- tancy among naturalized US Citizens and their family members to register to vote for the first time. B. CASA Members are Less Willing to Engage with the Decennial Census Due to Increased Fear 17. Under the current environment, CASA mem- bers have expressed fear of even a knock on their door by a stranger given the high number of arbitrary immi- gration enforcement actions that have resulted in the deportation of immigrants with little or no criminal background in the communities CASA serves. During CASA 's census outreach efforts, one of the most effec- tive messages for ensuring that residents completed their census forms was that by self- reporting, they would avoid a surprise visit from a census burea u employee. In addition, Many CASA members have expressed doubts and fears about how information within the government 247 is shared, and whether an answer to a question on a par- ticular document or application may lead to their family being harmed or separate d. 18. Following the announcement by the Trump Ad- ministration that they were seeking to exclude millions of immigrants from the Census count, CASA was ap- proached by a number of media outlets, including CNN, to represent the reaction of our community. We c on- veyed how harmful the action is and our commitment to ensuring that our members are fully counted. 19. The threat that undocumented residents will not be counted for apportionment purposes even if they do participate in the Decennial Census has further d iscour- aged individuals from participating in the Census. This action by the Trump Administration is the latest iteration of its attempts to dehumanize undocumented residents, by stating that they are not \" persons \" under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Cons titution. In ad- dition, this latest action has heightened concerns re- garding the privacy and confidentiality of Census ques- tionnaire responses. The announcement that the Ad- ministration will exclude undocumented residents from the apportionment base has le d to concerns that the Ad- ministration is gaining detailed information regarding where undocumented residents reside, and could use this information to target our members ' communities with immigration enforcement actions or other adverse consequences. 20. The Presidential Memorandum decreases the likelihood that CASA members will participate in the Decennial Census, where the perceived costs of poten-tial adverse immigration enforcement actions appears to outweigh the potential benefits, particularly when th e 248 Decennial Census will not contribute to promoting the political power of these communities. C. CASA is Diverting Resources to Encourage Par- ticipation in the Decennial Census 21. CASA recognizes the importance of the Decen- nial Census for its members and the broader Latino im- migrant community. Participation in the Census is nec- essary to preserve the political power of these com muni- ties, and to ensure that these communities receive the vital federal resources that so many of our members rely upon. In orde r to combat the increased fear in the La- tino immigrant community, and the unwillingness of many CASA members to participate in the Decennial Census, CASA has planned and is currently implement-ing a massive response to try and overcome the many barriers to participation. 22. This latest action by the Trump Administration to exclude undocumented residents from the apportion- ment base has diluted the efficacy of our Census out- reach materials and programming, as it directly contra- dicts a key component of CASA 's messaging and out- reach materials. As a result, CASA must now devote additional resources to addressing the confusion and fear that have resulted from this latest action after 15 months of preparation and action in our Decennial Cen- sus programming. 23. To address the fear and confusion raised by the Presidential Memorandum in the immigrant communi- ties, CASA will have to reorganize its communication team, reassign staff to Census outreach and education, and revise and redistribute messaging materials that CASA has prepared regarding the Decennial Census. 249 Given that the significant additional funding for this work was not anticipated, some of the resources re- quired to do this work will have to be diverted from other programs that are key to CASA 's mission, in clud- ing community and issue organizing and other civic en- gagement efforts, as well as funded through other sources, perhaps including CASA reserves, precious unrestricted funds including membership dues, and leveraged with volunteers. CASA 's outreach prog ram was scheduled to end at the end of July, but we have been forced to con- tinue to dedicate staff time to respond to calls and ques- tions, and to place additional funding into communica- tions and digital work to reassure community members and encourage them to complete their census form. The increased focus on Census outreach and education and need to revise all of CASA 's Census education and messaging materials will necessarily divert CASA 's lim- ited resources, resulting in less resources being allo-cated to other vital CASA programs. 24. Unfortunately, CASA will have less time than anticipated to address the fear and confusion caused by the Presidential Memorandum among the immigrant communities that CASA serves. The actual counting period of the Census is only a few months, but the con- sequences of the Census in terms of political power and funding allocation last for a decade. At the time the Presidential Memorandum was published on July 21, there were 102 days remaining in the enumeration pe- riod, which was then scheduled to end on October 31. However, on July 31, the Census Bureau abruptly accel- erated the end of the enumeration period to September 30. With only 56 days left in the headcount, every sin- gle day r emaining is a critical opportunity for CASA and 250 its members to conduct further Census outreach and in- crease response rates in the immigrant communities we serve. CASA will have to accelerate its remaining Cen- sus education and outreach efforts to address t he Pres- idential Memorandum 's negat ive effect on Census re- sponses. 25. I declare under penalty of perjury that the fore- going is true and correct. Executed: [Aug. 5], 2020 Prince Georges County, MD /s/ GUSTAVO TORRES GUSTAVO TORRES 251 Exhibit 56 252 Expert declaration of Matthew A. Barreto, Ph.D. I. Background and Qualifications 1. I am currently a Professor of Political Science and Chicana/o Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am the co -founder and faculty director of the Latino Politics and Policy Initiative (LPPI) in the Luskin School of Public Affairs, a national research cen- ter that studies policy issues that impact the Latino and immigrant community. 2. Before I joined UCLA in 2015, I was a pro fessor at the University of Washington for more than nine years, where I was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure, and then Full Professor with tenure. At the University of Washington, I was an affiliated faculty member of the Center for Statistics and the Social Sci- ences, and an adjunct Professor of Law at the UW School of Law. I am also the co -founder of the re- search firm Latino Decisions. 3. Throughout my career, I have taught courses on Immigration Policy, Racial and Ethnic Politics, Electoral Politics, Public Opinion, Voting Rights, Chicano/Latino History, Introduction to Statistical Analysis, and Ad- vanced Statistical Analysis to Ph.D. students. 4. I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science at the Uni- versity of California, Irvine in 2005, with an emphasis on racial and ethnic politics in the United States, political behavior, and public opinion. 5. I have published multiple peer -reviewed aca- demic research papers on Latino participation in the U.S. Census, immigrant public opinion and immigrant political engagement (among other topics). 253 6. In 2018 I provided expert reports and testimony in three federal lawsuits challenging the Department of Commerce 's inclusion of a citizenship status question on the 2020 Census, which included an extensive literatu re review and evaluation of how immigrants react to changes to the U.S. Census. In all three federal trials, the courts recognized my expertise in studying immigrant political and civic participation, and cited my literature review in ruling in favor of the plaintiffs. 7. I have conducted research nationwide and in New York, California, Indiana, Wisconsin, Pennsylva- nia, Alabama, Texas, North Dakota, and North Carolina in connection with litigation assessing, among other things, how the public responds to, and is affected by, changes in the law. Courts have accepted my research studies as viable and methodologically accurate instru- ments to understand how the public responds to changes in state law. In particular, my previous research has focused on underst anding sub -group analysis to evalu- ate differential impacts by race and ethnicity. Re- cently in North Carolina, a federal court relied on my re- search in issuing an injunction against the state 's voter ID law. In addition , the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota stated in Brakebill v. Jae- ger (No. 1:16 -cv-008) that \"the Court gives the findings of the Barreto/Sanchez Survey, and the other studies and data presented by the Plaintiffs, considerable weight. \" Prior to this, in 2014 in Veasey v. Perry (No. 13-CV-00193), the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, and in findings affirmed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, found that my survey was statistically sound and relied upon my survey find- ings to evaluate the impact of Texas' s voter ID law. 254 Likewise, in Frank v. Walker (No. 2:11- cv-01128), a sur- vey I administered and included as part of my expert report was given full weight by the United States Dis- trict Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in a voter ID case in Wisconsin. 8. In Fish v. Kobach (No. 16 -2105 -JAR -JPO), the plaintiffs retained me as an expert witness to evaluate the methodology of t he defendant 's survey , and the United States District Court for Kansas found me to be an expert on best practices of survey research and cred- ible and qualified to discuss survey methodology. 9. I have also regularly presented my expert re- view and summary of social science literature as part of expert witness reports and declarations, which have been accepted as valid and relied upon by the courts. Review of published social science literature is a well - established method among political scientists and social scientists in general for drawing valid conclusions re- garding the general consensus in the field. Literature reviews are an essential component of all academic re- search and a requirement for publishing peer -reviewed academic research because they establish the baseline set of knowledge and expectations within the field. As noted above, in litigation ch allenging the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census, three federal courts in New York, California, and Maryland relied upon my literature review as providing credible and valid evidence to help the courts form their opinions. 10. Earlier in 2020, in New York v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , I provided an in-depth liter- ature review examining how immigrant communities re- spond to increased immigration enforcement, surveil- lance and monitoring of undocumented immigrants. 255 11. My f ull professional qualifications and activities are set forth in my curriculum vitae, a true and correct copy of which I have attached hereto as Appendix A. II. Scope of Work 12. Plaintiffs in this action retained me to evaluate whether the Presidential Memorandum (PM) issued by President Donald Trump on July 21, 2020 to exclude un- documented immigrants from the apportionment base in 2020 would have a negative impact on the Census par-ticipation rates of immigrant communities, including un- documented immigrants, legal permanent residents, and naturalized U.S. citizens. To conduct my evalua- tion, I reviewed two sources of information. First, I compiled an analysis of news coverage of the PM to as- sess the reach of the announcement. Second, I conducted a compr ehensive literature review on survey methodol- ogy, response rates, sensitive questions and methodol- ogy, and census procedures addressing missing data and imputation. 13. I worked on this project with Mr. Marcel Roman, a Ph.D. student in the department of Political Science at UCLA and Mr. Chris Galeano, a J.D. student in the UCLA School of Law. Mr. Roman and Mr. Galeano both helped me compile sources for the literature review and news coverage of the aforementioned PM. III. Executive Summary 14. Based on my review of the news coverage of the PM, the extant literature published in the social sci- ences, and my own extensive experience with immigrant civic engagement, I conclude that the July 21 PM will reduce participation in the 2020 census, and ultimately will reduce the accuracy of the 2020 census. The PM 256 generates the perception of real and immediate threat for undocumented immigrants that will erode their trust in the census, which will lead to increased non -response in immigrant communities. Calling atten tion to the cit- izenship or immigration status of immigrants in a nega- tive light causes immigrants to reduce their civic en- gagement. The new PM sends a signal of government monitoring citizenship status as it relates to the 2020 Census population count, er oding trust that was re- stored after the threat of a citizenship question on the Census was removed. The strength of that negative signal is visible in coverage of the PM in Spanish - language media, which is a trusted source of news within Latino and immig rant communities. Signals of a threat to the status of undocumented immigrants generate a well- documented \"chilling effect \" on public participation for immigrant s, i.e., the perception of threat will erode trust that leads to a reduction in immigrant engagement with government programs and officials. However, subsequent official act ion to counteract such threats \u2014 either court orders or changes in agency policy \u2014have positive effects on trust and engagement. The percep- tion of immigration status -related threat generated by the PM will make undocumented and mixed -status households less likely to engage with the Census \u2014 particularly with enumerators conducting in- person Non -Response Follow -Up (NRFU). The reduction in response rates among undocumented immi grant and mixed -status households will result the Census Bureau using proxy -response and imputation techniques that are error -prone and tend to undercount immigrant households. 257 15. My review of news accounts following President Trump 's July 21 PM finds there was widespread cover- age, particularly within Spanish -language news media. Whether through television, print, or online outlets, the message relayed by the media was that the PM singled out immigrants through a process that invoked citizen- ship status, or a lack thereof, as part of the 2020 Census, in an effort to exclude them from the apportionment process. Spanish -language news journalists reported that as a result of the PM there was confusion, fear, and anxiety in immigrant communities about fully partici- pating in the 2020 Census. According to a journalist for Telemundo 1 who spoke with many people familiar with the PM , \"activists have already reported that this attempt may have scared many people off from respond- ing to the Census, which is particularly detrimental to states with high immigrant populations such as Califor-nia, Texas, and New York. \" This sentiment was widely reported across Spanish -language news in the days and weeks following the July 21 PM. 16. Extensive research studies sho w Spanish -lan- guage media acts as a catalyst for engaging, informing and mobilizing Latino and immigrant communities. Spanish -language journalists and news anchors act as a medium for the feelings and concerns prevalent within Latino immigrant communities, specifically those who are undocumented. Spanish -language media plays a 1 Telemundo. \"Trump Ordena Al Censo Que No Incluya a documentados En El Recuento Que Determina El Reparto De Es- central role in mobilizing and educating the immigrant community on immigration issues in particular. The high levels of trust in Spanish -language media amongst immigrants plays a k ey role when listening and learning about the issues that matter most to them, in particular those related to immigration policy. Research studies have documented that many immigrants take direct cues related to civic engagement and participation from what they hear, read, and watch on Spanish -language media. 17. Undocumented immigrants are deeply inter- twined into the fabric of American communities. Re- search and statistical reports have repeatedly found that undocumented immigrants see themselves as part of American society and indeed have longstanding ties in the cities and towns in which they permanently live. A clear majority of undocumented immigrants have lived in the United States for over five years and have families, hold jobs, own houses, and are part of their community. A survey of Latino undocumented immi- grants 2 found that 89% had lived in the U.S. over five years, that 74% have children living with them in the U.S. and 85% have a family member in the U.S. who is a U.S. citizen, and indeed that 87% of undocumented im- migrants themselves said they hoped to one day become U.S. citizens if legislation were passed to provide that opportunity. 18. Following the June 2019 ruling by the U.S. Su- preme Court blocking the inclusion of a citizenship ques- 2 https://latinodecisions.com/wp -content/uploads/2019/06/NALEO_ AV_Undoc_Results.pdf 259 tion, Census partners known as Trusted Voices con- ducted extensive outreach to undocumented immigrants to assure them that the federal government would not be monitoring their citizenship status as it relates to the 2020 Census. The new PM sends a signal of go vern- ment monitoring citizenship status as it relates to the 2020 Census population count, significantly eroding trust. 19. The published literature is quite clear: a critical component to ensure an accurate response rate on any survey, including the census , is trust between the public and the survey administrator. The prior published studies conclude that response rates will fall without a high degree of trust. The new PM erodes the trust that many community -based organizations with experience serving imm igrants had built up over the past year. 20. Trust is particularly important in communities with undocumented populations as many prior reports and publications by the Census Bureau have made clear. The Census Bureau has identified vulnerable population subgroups concerned about the potential misuse of per- sonal information provided to the Census as at -risk for low participation rates and for undercounts. From this perspective, the new PM lowers trust and makes it much harder to stimulate participation in the census from vul- nerable populations such as immigrant 3 and minority communities, if such communities do not trust the Cen- sus. 3 Here we mean persons who are foreign -born and emigrated to the United States. 260 21. Far-ranging social science research documents a phenomenon called \"the chilling effect \" in which immi- grant communities withdraw and avoid interactions with government officials or agencies if they believe there could be a risk of adv erse consequences for their own immigration status or the status of others in the commu- nity. Specifically, so me studies have found that Cen- sus participation rates drop in immigrant communities when federal immigration enforcement is perceived to be connected to the Census. In fact, the Census Bu- reau has published studies pointing to fears over the federal govern ment learning their about citizenship sta- tus as a major obstacle in some immigrant communities. 22. Social science research since the 1990s, but es- pecially so in more recent years, is near consensus in finding evidence of the \" chilling effect, \" i.e., stron g pat- terns of avoidance, withdrawal, and exclusion during times of increased immigration enforcement. This re search is often community -focused and highlights how increased attention to immigration status or immigration monitor- ing by authorities, results i n noticeable withdrawal in that specific context. Immigrants, and often their chil- dren and others in their close network, will purposely avoid or withdraw from an environment where they fear potential immigration enforcement. The fear associ- ated with detention, separation from their children or family, and possible deportation is so paralyzing that many immigrants \u2014when faced with p ossible immigra- tion enforcement \u2014avoid even necessary public services such as police protection, health services, going to work , sending their children to school, or attending court to defend their rights. The takeaway is clear \u2014increased negative attention to citizenship status issues decreases 261 trust in those specific agencies or actors and leads to im- migrant withdrawal. 23. If trust is low, attempts to re -interview or re - contact households will be far less successful either. Census respondents must believe that there is no jeop- ardy or threat of disclosure to ensure their participation in a survey, regardless of how many attempts one might make to prompt their participation. 24. Already, a prior study from 2018 about percep- tions of the 2020 Census found that levels of trust in im- migrant and minority communities in the United States were low as a result of concerns over citizenshi p. The extensive media attention to the citizenship question re-sulted in high levels of fears among immigrants. When asked about the protection of their and their family members ' sensitive information, including citizenship status, immigrant respondents were statistically less likely to trust that the Trump administration will pro- tect their information and not share it with other federal agencies (just 35% were trusting). Among Latino re- spondents overall, just 31% trust the Trump administra- tion to protec t their personal information, which is sta- tistically lower than among non -Latinos. While the June 2019 SCOTUS decision may have alleviated these fears by striking the citizenship question, the July 2020 PM effectively re -confirms those immigrant fears be- cause it sends a signal to immigrant communities that the Trump administration will be monitoring their citi- zenship status so they may subtract these participants from the 2020 base population count for the apportion- ment base. In essence, Trump has returne d the immi- grant community to a condition of wariness similar to 262 when the citizenship question was to appear on the cen- sus. They believe their participation is either no longer safe, or not required due to the PM of July 2020 to specifically single out undocumented immigrants. 25. The survey also found that large percentages of immigrants and minorities are concerned specifically that their personal information reported on the census will be shared with Immigration and Customs Enforce- ment (ICE). Overall, 4 1% of immigrants surveyed state they are concerned about this, along with 40% of Latinos. 26. When households do not initially self -respond to the census, the Census relies on nonresponse follow up (NRFU) to re -contact households to encourage them to respond. In simulated re -contact, my research has dem - onstrated that a majority of non -responders to the 2020 census will not switch and become participants when asked again to do so. In particular, research has found that NRFU is less successful when im migrant commu- nities have fears about information concerning their cit- izenship status being collected or revealed. 27. Larger households will be the most difficult to successfully convert from nonparticipation to participa- tion if there are fears about citiz enship status data being collected or monitored, further undermining an accurate count. Existing research has found that among immi- grants who would take the census upon NRFU recon-tact, their average household size is 2.91 compared to an average household size of 3.94 for immigrants who would not participate upon recontact, leaving them, and their larger households uncounted. 263 28. One of the ways Census Bureau officials try to account for people who refuse to respond to the census is to mathematically accoun t for non -responders through statistical methods such as \"substitution \" or \"imputa- tion. \" Both of these methods use information on re- sponding households to estimate population information on non -responding households. However, when there are fears about citizenship status are introduced, non - responding households are statistically different than responding households on a variety of critical demo- graphics, which violates an important assumption of substitution or imputation. For these methods to serve as viable alternatives, missing units and reported units should be roughly equivalent. However, the existing research reveals that when fears over citizenship status emerge, non -responding households are more likely to be larger in size, be foreign -born, an d have different age and educational outcomes than responding households. This will make substitution and imputation inaccurate and unreliable, and makes it highly likely that there will be a net undercount of households refusing to respond to the census due to the citizenship question. IV. Literature Review and Research Findings A. The July 21 Presidential Memorandum Re- ceived Wide Coverage in Spanish News Media and Created Confusion and Fear About the 2020 Census 29. On July 21, 2020 President Trump issu ed a Pres- idential Memorandum declaring that undocumented im- migrants will be excluded from the decennial census for 264 apportionment purposes .4 Specifically, following the completion of the 2020 Census, the PM requires that in- dividuals without lawful immigration status be excluded from the apportionment base for the purpose of the re- apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives. The PM refers to last year 's Executive Order 138805 which instructed executive departments and agencies to share inform ation with the Department of Commerce . . . to obtain accurate data on the number of citizens, non-citizens, and illegal aliens in the country. \" This or- der signals to hard -to-count populations, such as undoc- umented immigrants and mixed status families, that the federal administration is compiling citizenship related data on them, and that they are to be excluded from the 2020 Census .6 While there are technicalities that an undocumented immigrant may fill out the Census form, and then be deducted later, this nuance is lost on a com- munity that has been under constant attack and threat from President Trump and his administration. A 4 Memorandum on Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportion- ment Base Following the 2020 Census (July 21, 2020), 5 Collecting Information About Citizenship Status in Connection With the Decennial Census (July 11, 2019), 6 Some point out that matching census and administrative data will lead to matching errors and exclude millions of U.S. citizens from the apportionment process. Randy Capps et al., M illions of U.S. Citizens Could Be Excluded under Trump Plan to Remove Unau- thorized Immigrants from Census Data, Migration Policy Institute (July 2020), https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/millions -us-citizens - could -be-excluded- under -plan -remove- unauthori zed-immigrants - census 265 memorandum issued by the President stating that un- documented immigrants will be identified in specific communities and then ex cluded from the official Census population count sends a clear message of exclusion. 30. In particular, the PM reverses recent progress that has been made by community -based organizations following the June 2019 Supreme Court ruling which blocked the citi zenship question from being added to the 2020 Census. In an effort to mitigate the challenge posed by the citizenship question, outreach advocates also sought to use the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision as a starting point \" to convince everyone to participat e in the census count \" and emphasize the benefits of partici- pating in the census.7 Because the highest and defini- tive court in our country had struck down the citizenship question, outreach to immigrant communities could em- phasize this as a selling point to fill out the census with- out any fears about someone 's immigration status being reported. For the Census Bureau 's part, they would en- act a public outreach plan that involved \"working with local organizations to encourage census participation among immigrants, communities of color and other groups the bureau considers hard to count \" to combat the mis- trust by these communities.8 31. The new PM undermines these efforts and im- plies the government is attempting to enumerate the un- documented immigrant pop ulation, which could under- cut participation. Because of the 2019 Supreme Court 7 https://www.huffpost.com/entry/2020 -census 266 decision, there is no direct mechanism for assessing whether a Census response includes data from an un- documented immigrant using Census responses. If the federal government is attempting to exclude undocu- mented immigrants from the Census count, immigrant communities are likely to draw two conclusions. First, undocumented immigrants, the people they live in the same household with, and others in immigrant commu- nities may be worried the government is attempting to find out their legal status through other means. This is not beyond the realm of possibility, given that the Trump administration has instructed federal agencies to use ex- isting state and federal records to determine citizenship status (Levine, 2020)9. This could generate a chilling effect and incentivize households w ith undocumented immigrants to provide no additional information to the Federal Government that they feel would implicate their immigration status. Second, undocumented immi- grants and those with ties with undocumented immi- grants may think the government wi ll use other means to find them, such as their responses to questions asking about nativity or ethnic/racial group. Therefore, they will not fill out the Census form writ large since proba- bilistically, providing information on other characteris- tics might fac ilitate government efforts to track and identify undocumented immigrants. 32.

Since the PM was signed, it has prompted discussion by Spanish - language news segments on its implication s for the im- migrant community . 17 These reports have conveyed to 16 Jes\u00fas -excluir -a-inmigrantesindocumentados - del-censo/ ; and Schneider, Trump Firma Memo Que Afectar\u00eda Conteo de Migrantes, El Nuevo Herald (July of undocu- mented immigrants living in the U.S. would not be counted when deciding how to apportion congressional seats be- cause of the PM, affecting states such as California, Florida, and Texas, each of which includes large undoc-umented immigrant populations within their communi- ties. 18 33. Across these news accounts, immigrants, as well as individuals who worked with community -based or- ganizations that serve immigrants, and even journalists, all stated that they believed the July 21 PM was an ef- fort to sow confusion and distrust, and to reduce the count of Latinos and immigrants on the 2020 Census.

The PM has threatened to upend a year 's worth of outreach efforts by groups focused on hard -to-count populations. These groups now face a big challenge: reach out to people who haven' t filled out their census form yet who are now worried the federal administra- tion will use whatever information they provide in the 2020 Census to target them. Solving this challenge is now more urgent for these groups given the Census Bu-reau 's recent decision to shorten the period for collect- ing responses, including NRFU operations, by 31 days . 23 35. According to Arturo Vargas, the CEO of NALEO , one of the nation 's top civic engagement organizations in the Latino and immigrant community, the new PM is a setback that creates fear in the immigrant community. NALEO has been identified by the Census Bureau itself as one of t he most important \"trusted voices \" to earn trust in the Latino commun ity. Vargas stated on Twit- ter24: \"With a successful #NALEOVirtual Conference 22 Mike Schneider. \"Orden De Trump Afecta Censo En Califor- nia, Florida y Texas.\" Houston Chronicle.

Spanish -Language News Media is a Trusted Source for Immigrants 36. Studies show Spanish -language media acts as a catalyst for engaging and mobilizing Latino and immi- grant communities. Spanish -language journalists and news anchors act as a me dium for the feelings and con- cerns felt amongst Latino immigrant communities, in particular among undocumented immigrants. Green - Barber discuss these trends in Spanish -speaking me- dia.26 She found that Spanish -speaking households have h igh utilization of i nternet and Spanish TV and ra- dio, indicating the large presence and critical role of the Spanish -language media has in Spanish speaking homes. She also found that the Spanish -speaking media plays a 25 https://twitter.com/ArturoNALEO/status/12917925603907297 28?s=20 26 Lindsay Green -Barber, Latinos and the media: Patterns, changes and ideas for more connection, Center for Investigative Reporting. 275 central role in mobilizing and educating Latino commu- nities on immigration issues in particular. 37. Research shows that households who more closely follow Spanish -language news rely on that information when it comes to civic and political engagement.27 Garcia- Rios and Barreto (2016) investigated media habits of La- tino immigrants and found that people with high rates of Spanish -language news consumption were more in- formed and had high rates of immigrant identity, mean- ing that they were particularly aware and responsive to immigration -related news and cu rrent affairs .28 In 2012, a positive association between Spanish news cov- erage of President Obama 's DACA program and immi- grant i dentity spurred naturalized citizens to vote at higher rates. In other instances, exposure to negative information can lead to withdrawal. 38. Research on Spanish- language media by Fed- erico Subervi -Velez (2008) notes \"the intersection be- tween media and Latino s when assessing political social- ization and mobilization of Latinos. \"29 To put simply, Spanish -language media is a critical bridge that informs 27 Barreto, Matt.

One example is the reliance of Spanish -language radio to share and spread information about anti -immigrant legislation in t he U.S. Congress (Felix et. al, 2008). Re- search found that Spanish media personalities such as Almendarez Coello (El Cucuy), Eduardo Sotelo (El Pio- lin) and Christina Saralei presented and educated the community on the anti -immigration rhetoric that was becoming prominent in politics (Felix et al, 2008). Coello and Sotelo 's provided daily updates and created awareness about H.R. 4437, a bill that could negatively impact immigrant communities. In particular, re- search has found that the high leve ls of trust in Spanish - language media plays a key role when Latino immi- grants read or hear about the issues that matter most to them, like immigration policy. C. Trust and Socio -Political Context are Two Key Factors That Impact Survey Response Rates and Accuracy 39. The decennial census is a population survey. There have been extensive studies across the social sci- ences documenting the best practices and potential pit-falls in collecting accurate survey data. With respect to evaluating the 2020 Census there are two k ey takea- ways that are quite clear in the published literature. First, trust between the public and the survey adminis-trator is crucial. Prior studies conclude that response rates will fall without a high degree of trust, leading to a biased survey projec t because it excludes people from the data and is no longer representative. Second, the social and political context during survey implementa-277 tion can greatly impact trust, confidence, and participa- tion rates. This is especially the case for vulnerable populations when they perceive an unwelcoming envi- ronment or context. Of these key takeaways, the hall- mark of cooperation in any survey is trust. Subjects are more likely to participate in a survey, to complete survey items accurately, and respond fully to survey items when they trust the survey administrator. When potential respondents are suspicious, uncertain, anxious or untrusting, nonresponse rates significantly increase. An early study on this topic framed the issue as how much threat potential respondents perceive through the source of the survey (Ball 1967; Bradburn et al. 1978). When subjects identify the survey as being imple- mented on behalf of authorities who they perceive could use their answers against them, they are likely to not - respond , or to respond untruthfully (Ball 1967). From this perspective, newfound fears about citizenship sta-tus due to the July 21 PM will make securing participa- tion of immigrant communities much harder than if the PM had never been issued. 40. A research study by the U.S. Government Ac- countability Office in 2003 (GAO- 03-605) laid out the most appropriate approaches to surveying the Latino population specifically. The report was commissioned because prior government surveys, in particular the Census, were chara cterized by high rates of non -re- sponse with Latino respondents. The report stated that distrust \u2014especially of those representing the gov- ernment \u2014was a leading factor in Latino immigrant non- response. To fix this, the report recommended in- creasing trust so that potential survey respondents are not fearful of their participation, and not suspicious of 278 the census questions being asked, or the census enumer- ators visiting their community. The July 21 PM re- lated to undocumented immigrants does precisely the oppo site, increasing distrust and, therefore, making it substantially less likely that members of the Latino im- migrant subgroups will respond to the census. 41. De la Puente (1995) examined issues related to trust, confidentiality and fear among potential census respondents in El Paso, Texas and found that fear and apprehension on part of the sample area residents led to concealment of information from the Census Bureau and from the ethnographers, due to their belief that the gov- ernment will not keep their information private or con- fidential when it comes to highly sensitive questions. This research establishes that the Census Bureau al- ready knows it has challenges with trust in some immi- grant communities and attempts to overcome those challenges by not ask ing sensitive questions that make it very difficult to persuade communities with low trust. While the threat of a citizenship question was dropped, this brand new PM of July 21 instills a new sense of con- fusion and fear and will result in increased proble ms with trust in such communities and a corresponding re- duction in Census response. 42. In a follow -up study a decade later, de la Puente (2004) concluded that individuals with unstable immi- gration statuses were much less likely to trust the gov-ernment and specifically less likely to fill out the census questionnaire. Indeed, properly counting undocu- mented immigrants has long been a concern for the Cen- sus Bureau. De la Puente's research demonstrated that respondents with irregular immigration statuses are un-279 likely to directly cooperate with the Census if they per- ceive their immigration status will be revealed. The July 21 PM does precisely this,; it sends a strong signal to undocumented immigrants that the federal govern- ment is collecting data about them, and will match vari- ous government records to find and exclude certain im-migrants. One respondent in the de la Puente study, who did have legal status as a student, was afraid to par- ticipate in the Census because she feared that at some point in the futur e she may go out of status and that the information she provided to the Census Bureau might be used to track her down. According to de la Puente, it is critical that immigrant respondents clearly under-stand that their immigration status is not associated with the Census population count. 43. An important practice that ensures higher par- ticipation rates in surveys is respondent anonymity, par- ticularly when there might be concerns over immigra- tion status. The Census violates anonymity by requir- ing the respo ndent to list the names of all household members. If respondents do not trust the survey ad- ministrator, and there is no anonymity, vulnerable re- spondents are far less likely to participate. Tou- rangeau and Yan (2007) explain how the \" threat of dis- closure \" can result in non -response. Generally, people have concerns about the possible consequences of par- ticipating in a survey, or giving a truthful answer should information become known to a third party with enforce- ment powers. The authors explain a survey may be \"sensitive\" if it raises fears about the likelihood or con- sequences of disclosure of the answers to agencies or in- dividuals directly, or not directly involved in the survey. As an example, Tourangeau and Yan (2007) discuss ask-280 ing a question about m arijuana use to a group of teenag- ers. If the teens suspect that the answers could be shared with their parents, they opt out of the survey or lie. But if the survey is completely anonymous and im- plemented by their peers, they are much more likely to part icipate and be truthful. The perceived threat of disclosure to authorities is what matters. With the July 21 PM, the federal government has clearly created a perception of threat for immigrants and the 2020 Cen- sus. 44. A review of findings across differe nt surveys suggest that the likelihood of survey response largely depends on timing and contextual factors, including the respondent 's personal situation and the features of the data collection, such as the degree of privacy it offers. The exact same surv ey might be highly sensitive and risk non -participation in one setting, but be acceptable and proper in another. To this point, a comprehensive review of survey environment research indicates that highly sensitive surveys will be disruptive, produce non- response, or result in biased data when the respondent is concerned that their answers could be known by au- thorities. However, if the respondent feels secure and has total privacy and anonymity, they are likely to par-ticipate and provide truthful answ ers (Tourangeau and Smith 1996). In particular, Krysan (1998) found evi- dence that respondents greatly modified their answers to questions and issues related to views about race, eth- nicity, and immigration based on how they felt the inter-viewer would perceive or judge their responses. 45. Concerns about confidentiality are likely to ex- acerbate the unwillingness of certain communities to re-281 spond to the Census in the current socio -political con- text created by the July 21 PM. A study of immigrant communit ies' knowledge and awareness of the Census found that one major concern was confidentiality of per- sonal information (Raines 2001). Beyond the Latino immigrant community, this study reported evidence that immigrants from Laos, Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia, and Haiti expressed concerns over anonymity and confidentiality. The general takeaway is that as additional private, per- sonal, or sensitive questions are added, the degree of concern over anonymity and confidentiality raises con- siderably. Even if the Census Bureau provides assur- ances, many may not believe or trust those assurances. In part, this might be due to the current social and po- litical context (laid out above in paragraphs 29 -34) or could also be due to prior experiences in their home country with authorit arian regimes and government data collection. Thus, for a population survey to be ac- curate, it is critical that respondents truly believe their answers to questions will always remain confidential and not used against them. The July 21 PM opens the door to that exact fear because the federal government plans to use administrative data and records to exclude undoc- umented immigrants from the base population count. D. The Threat of Non -Response is Real and Immediate 46. The overall national sociopolitical environment has raised awareness and alertness among immigrant communities, but by itself, the national context does not depress immigrant participation. Instead the pub- lished literature is clear that immigrants react to spe-cific threats as they develop, and they engage fully when those threats are removed. Indeed, in areas with low 282 levels of immigration enforcement and threat of depor- tation, or in so- called sanctuary cities, research does not find evidence of a chilling effect or withdrawal (e.g. Gar-cia 2019). However, the national context does cause immigrants to take more notice of their surroundings and be aware of the potential for a negative interaction with immigration officials. When immigration enforce- ment is heightened, the current (2017 -2020) national so- ciopolitical climate can result in a more significant with- drawal. Put simply, President Trump has put the im- migrant community on edge. In June of 2019, they had the protection of the U.S. Supreme Court which gave as- surances that their citizens hip status could not be con- nected to the 2020 Census. The July 21 PM changed the risk of threat in the minds of many immigrants who hear Trump 's words as connecting a federal monitoring program of undocumented immigrants to the 2020 Cen-sus. They may not do the full research to realize they can still fill out the Census safely, because they hear the news which is connecting the July 21 PM to Trump 's longstanding desire to increase deportation of undocu- mented immigrants. Further, the July 21 PM sends the signal to undocumented immigrants to avoid the Census because they will not be counted. If the Presi- dent issues a memorandum saying you will not be counted on the Census base population count, and you have a lingering fear over your citizenship status, there is virtually no reason at all to transmit your entire household 's personal information to the federal govern- ment. Existing research makes clear that when new threats emerge due to changes in policy, immigrants take note and withdraw. 283 47. Perhaps the best summary of how the combina- tion of federal policies and political environments inter- act is found in a new book by Angela Garcia, Legal Pass- ing: Navigating Undocumented Life and Local Immi- gration Law (2019). In this book, Garcia reviews a plethora of data and research on how immigrant com- munities respond and react to both threatening and ac- commodating environments, and how a national climate of hostility does not automatically create a chilling effect for immigrants everywhere. Rather, Gar cia showed with extensive evidence that specific context and the proximate threat of immigration enforcement versus ac-commodation is what matters the most. Instances with the highest levels of threat produce the most with-drawal. In her study of more acco mmodating or wel- coming environments, Garcia finds immigrants are able to navigate life effectively, writing \"At the same time, this book also argues against the popular depictions of undocumented immigrants being pushed u nderground, their perception of threat so strong that they avoid en- gaging in public life . . . As compared to restrictive destinations, the integrative outcomes of accommodat- ing locales that I describe in this book are evident in un- documented Mexicans ' ease of phys ical navigation, deeper willingness to interact with local police, and place -based sense of belonging. \" Of particular im- portance is the timing of when threat pop up or become visible. Garcia describes \"initial reactions immediately after new clampdowns \u2014sweeps, raids, and che ckpoints \" being the most intense periods of avoidance. However eventually immigrants learn how to navigate their com- munities, and to avoid locations of particular threat, but otherwise effectively go about their day. 284 48. Thus, the literature demonstrates that the cur- rent era is a particularly anxiety -inducing period in American history for undocumented immigrants, and those concerned about immigration enforcement. How- ever, this just serves to frame the environment, it does not by itself lead to wholesale withdrawal. Rather, the literature points to the importance of specific instances of threat that result from new policies that create fear, anxiety and avoidance. 49. Prior survey research in January 2020 30 as- sessed how Latinos in New York reacted to information about whether or not ICE was present in and around state courthouses. The question there was whether in- creased threat of immigration enforcement resulted in immigrant withdrawal. ICE was sporadically conduct- ing immigration -related searches in or near state court- houses across New York. In our survey experiment, we randomly assigned one set of respondents to a condi- tion in which we reminded them of ICE presence at state courthouses, while other respondents were randomly assigned to a condition without the information about ICE presence. 50. Across the full sample of Latinos in New York, the survey experiment results demonstrate that being informed about ICE presence at state courthouses has a strong, and statistically significant causal effect o n in- creasing avoidance behavior and withdrawal. This ef- fect is consistent across eight different types of engage- ment. When confronted with information about ICE conducting arrests and detention at courts in New York, 30 Survey conducted as part of the expert declaration by Matthew A. Barreto in NY v. ICE lawsuit. 285 Latino participants reduced their intention to attend state court as a witness, as a defendant, to accompany a family member, to protect their rights, or to testify about a housing complaint. In addition, they were less likely to go to the police as witness, or to call the local police if th ey witness a crime, or to submit a police re- port as a victim. This suggests that when Latinos and immigrants learn about a new threat, they respond im- mediately with reduced intention to participate or en- gage. 51. Because the overall sample size of the survey was large (n=1,001) the New York courthouse research included additional analyses on immigrant segments within the main sample. The results of the subset anal- ysis are consistent with the extant literature and expec-tations, with much stronger causal effects of avoidance and withdrawal among the foreign -born Latinos, and much stronger effects among non -citizens, and the strongest causal evidence of the chilling effect among Latinos are acquainted with an undocumented immi- grant. These analyses provide very strong evidence that is theoretically motivated and consistent with dec-ades of social science research on the immediate chilling effect of immigration enforcement. 52. A newer study conducted during the period of Trump 's presidency finds similar resu lts. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) allows women who are vic- tims of domestic violence to petition to change their im- migration status and was used effectively when women felt safe enough to call immigration officials. However, in February 2017 the Trump administration reactivated the Secure Communities program which coordinated lo-286 cal police databases with ICE. As such, in areas of in- creased ICE presence, the study found that fewer and fewer women initiate police reports of domestic violence. The a uthors explain this is due to fears over being re- ported to, or detained by ICE. As the authors con- clude, \"intensified immigration en forcement might in- crease misreporting due to fear of being over scrutinized and, potentially, placed in a position that jeopardizes the possibility of staying in the country. \" (Amuedo - Dorantes and Arenas -Arroyo 2019). This is yet an- other example of a before/after study which finds direct and immediate evidence of immigrant withdrawal after a change in policy, in this case , by the Trump admin- istration. E. Extensive Research Confirms Fears About Immigration Enforcement and The Chilling Effect 53. Additional ethnographic research has revealed that undocumented immigrants and mixed -status house- holds are likely to avoid government contact when they suspect it is not safe to participate (de la Puente 1995). This is especially the case when sensitive topics will be potentially discussed or revealed. Velasco (1992) main- tains that undocumented immigrants in his sample area in San Diego, CA avoided contact with government. He argues that this avoidance was one of the important contributing factors to census omission and estimates that over half of the sample area residents were undoc- umented immigrants. Similar situations we re also re- ported in the Miami, FL sample area (Stepick 1992) and in the 26 rural Marion County, OR sample areas (Mon-toya 1992). However, the ethnographic research all concludes that participation barriers can be overcome 287 by not including worrisome questio ns about citizenship status and by working with community based organiza- tions and cultural facilitators to increase trust and con- fidence in data privacy. 54. Levels of trust in immigrant and minority com- munities are very low with respect to issues related to citizenship. In a prior national survey about the 2020 Census, when asked about protecting sensitive infor- mation, including citizenship of themselves and family members, only 35% of immigrants expressed trust that the Trump administration will protect their information and not share it with other federal agencies. Among Latino respondents overall, just 31% trust the Trump administration to protect their personal information. According to my prior survey research, a very large per- cent of immigrants and minorities believe the Trump ad- ministration will share their personal information with other federal agencies. 55. Research related to the 2020 Census suggests that the Census Bureau was well aware of potential is- sues related to non -response over immigrat ion fears. A comprehensive study by the Census B ureau 's Center for Survey Measurement presented at the National Ad- visory Committee on Racial, Ethnic, and Other Popula- tions Fall Meeting 2017 (Meyers 2017) reported an in-crease in respondents expressing concerns to research- ers and field staff about con fidentiality and data access related to immigration, legal residency, and citizenship status, and their perception that certain immigrant groups are unwelcome. There was an observation of increased rates of unusual respondent behaviors during pre -test- ing and production surveys, including item -nonresponse, break -offs, and refusals, especially when the questions 288 involved citizenship status. The most commonly occur- ring finding was that respondents appeared vis ibly nervous about disclosing their private information and who would have access to such data. The current polit- ical climate was of concern to respondents: in one Spanish interview, a respondent stated, \"the possibility that the Census could give my inf ormation to internal security and immigration could come and arrest me for not having documents terrifies me. \" 56. As this finding makes clear, immigrant commu- nities can be especially vulnerable to the social and po- litical context surrounding the implement ation of a sur- vey. A study of immigrants in California and Texas found that respondents ' fear over citizenship status cor- related with their non-participation in the health sector (Berk and Schur 2001). This study found strong evi- dence that a threatening context can lead immigrants to withdraw and limit their access to public services, in- cluding access to medical care which they greatly needed. Likewise, anxiety and fear over immigration status has been found to reduce utilization of services related to health care, law enforcement, and education (Pedraza and Osorio 2017). In particular, research has identi- fied the context of heightened \" immigration policing \" as one that erodes trust in other public institutions and cre- ates an environment in which immigr ant communities are very selective as to where, when, and how they en- gage with government agencies (Cruz Nichols, LeBr\u00f3n and Pedraza 2018). The finding is not just limited to first -generation immigrants themselves; the research also finds a strong spillov er effect to U.S. -born Latinos who have immigrant parents, or feel connected to the immigrant community, and also demonstrates non -par- ticipation during times of threatening context. 289 57. Studies have shown that the political context af- ter 2016 and the elect ion of Donald Trump has signifi- cantly diminished Latinos ' trust of the federal govern- ment . For instance, Michelson and Monforti (2018) find that Latinos, including those who are undocu- mented, were less trusting of government in 2016 than in 2012. In 2012, trust amongst Latinos was strong across all su bgroups of Latino immigrants \u2014citizens, non-citizens with legal status, and undocumented immi- grants. Four years later, Latinos registered lower lev- els of trust in government, with fewer than 1 in 20 Lati- nos i n any subgroup responding that they trust the gov- ernment \"just about always. \" In addition, Sanchez and Gomez -Aguinaga (2017) report that an overwhelming majority of Latinos described Trump and his policies as scary (74%), dangerous (77%), hostile (78%), and unwel- coming (80%) and they conclude that the current context is creating tension, anxiety, and nervousness among La- tinos and immigrants. While the June 2019 Supreme Court decision striking the citizenship question allowed community outreach groups to push reset and create a campaign that citizenship would not be associated with the Census at all, the new PM reinjects concerns about citizenship status into the 2020 population count. 58. Beyond the Latino and immigrant communities, there is also reason t o expect that increased fears about citizenship could increase non -response rates among Arab and Middle Eastern Americans. Research by Os- kooii (2016) and Lajevardi and Oskooii (2018) demon-strates that American Muslims and those of Arab and Middle Eastern ancestry currently perceive a high rate of discrimination and an unwelcoming environment. Oskooii (2016) explains how perceived social exclusion can result in withdrawal and non- participation by these 290 communities and documents this fact empirically in his published research. In research by the Center for Sur- vey Measurement, focus groups conducted in Arabic among immigrants from the Middle East revealed the potential for Census non -response due to questions about citizenship status in light of the current political climate. (Meyers 2017). Some focus group partici- pants referred to the \" Mus lim Ban\" when expressing why they woul d be nervous about reporting their immi- gration and citizenship status to the federal govern- ment. 59. This context is particularly important as it re- lates to the issues about citizenship status, because this is the point of tension for many in the immigrant com- munity today. That is, there is grave concern over providing information to the federal government given the perceived high r ates of immigrant policing. And now that newfound distrust and fear is directly related to cit-izenship status as a result of the July 21 PM, a consider- able non -response is the likely outcome. 60. A clear implication identified in the relevant lit- erature on surveys is that when respondents perceive a threatening survey, and if trust is low, non -participation will result in an inaccurate survey. Further, attempts to re -interview or re -contact households will not be suc- cessful, and some re -contact may only se rve to further erode trust. Survey respondents must believe that there is no potential jeopardy before participating. Once a respondent believes that participation in the sur- vey could bring them harm, and that the survey enumer-ator is acting on behalf of an official agency, attempts at repeated re- contact typically do not result in a com-291 pleted survey (Ball 1967). In interviews with the enu- merators themselves, there is a sense that the issues re- lated to citizenship status will make their jobs harder, if not impossible (Meyers 2017). 61. Prior experiences with census data collection ef- forts that overlapped with anti -immigrant contexts pro- vide evidence that non -response follow -up (NRFU) will be much more difficult in 2020 given the political climate and the PM. Terry et al. (2017) describe the connec- tion between a threatening context and Census non -re- sponse in Arizona and Texas among immigrant commu- nities: \"the wider social context also had an important role in enumeration. Just before the NRFU enumera- tion program started in 2010, Arizona passed a very strong anti -immigration law that coincided with legal or- dinances in two Dallas -area cities. These ordinances were aimed at identifying illegal immigrants through police stops or the reporting of immigration s tatus of ap- plicants wishing to rent apartments. The new law pro- voked heightened tensions around th e country, particu- larly in the Dallas/Fort Worth -area Hispanic community. As a result, these reports conclude that non- response was high and that NRFU was l ess successful. 62. Undocumented immigrants may already fear providing their information to the government. They are a hard -to-reach population that is difficult for enu- merators to gain access to and follow -up on in the event of non -response. To overcome these difficulties, non- governmental organizations and the Census Bureau have engaged in targeted messaging toward immigrant com- munities that participation in the Census would help in- crease access to public resources, federal funding, and political representation (Levine, 2020; Liptak et al., 292 2020; Smith, 2020). However, the PM, by excluding the count of undocumented immigrants from the apportion- ment base, completely undercuts this incentive to par- ticipate. If the government is going to remove them from t he base population count, why bother filling out the 2020 Census at all? Undocumented immigrants are likely to perceive that there is no benefit to participa-tion, as the July 21 PM states they will not count, and there is now an increased risk of their in formation being linked to immigration records and facing immigration enforcement. 63. It is important to note undocumented immi- grants and their social ties are often risk-averse, assume the worst -case scenario, and are highly suspicious about whether their information would be shared with Federal immigration authorities (Yoshikawa, 2011; Dreby, 2015; Torres -Ardila, Bravo, and Ortiz, 2020). For example, even U.S. -citizen Latinos reduced their participation in Medicaid as a result of a punitive immigration enforce-ment environment (Watson, 2014; Vargas, 2015). It is unlikely Medicaid service providers will use their rec-ords to find undocumented friends or family, but the per- ception of legibility to immigration author ities was suf- ficient to produce system - avoiding behaviors. In an- other research paper, U.S. -born children of undocu- mented immigrants avoided a variety of record -keeping institutions (e.g. banking, formal employment, voter registration) as a result of their social ties with an un- documented paren t (Desai, Su, and Adelman, 2019). 64. Undercounting undocumented immigrants will have spillover effects on effectively counting the broader legal non -citizen and citizen population. Mixed -status households are affected by the PM. The PM suggests 293 the gove rnment may be using various forms of infor- mation to identify undocumented immigrants. If un- documented immigrants are the head of the household or if the head of household is responsible for undocu- mented immigrant friends and/or family members, they may no t respond or allow themselves to be contacted by follow- up enumerators in order to protect the anonym- ity of their undocumented social ties. This means citi- zen children, documented spouses of undocumented im- migrants, documented partners of undocumented imm i- grants, and/or documented family of undocumented im-migrants will be less like ly to be counted in the census. 65. One implication of the fear and unrest in the im- migrant community is the increased mobility which could render any attempt at imputation or su bstitution incom- plete and inaccurate. For imputation to work, the miss- ing unit household cannot be vacant, and likewise cannot be a second home or vacation home of someone already counted. The missing unit household should have some- one living there as their primary residence. However, as Frost notes that many undocumented immigrants who receive government letters or notices may pick -up and move their entire family, rather than wait around and figure out a way to interact with public officials. Similar ly, this is documented by O 'Hare (2017) who notes that Latino children are especially susceptible to being undercounted due to mobility. There is evidence that if immigrants are fearful of attempts by the federal government to obtain the personal informat ion, identi- ties, and citizenship statuses of all members of their house- hold, they may vacate their homes and move to avoid be-ing contacted again (Meyers 2017). To the extent this happens, attempts at imputation or substitution will be 294 inaccurate, both on the national level, but especially on state and local levels. F. When Subsequent Official Action is Taken to Remove Threats Related to Immigration Status, Immigrants Respond with Participa- tion 66. On January 9, 2018, a federal court in the North- ern District of California issued a nationwide prelimi- nary injunction against the Trump administration effort to phase -out DACA. The January 2018 decision al- lowed existing DACA recipients to apply for renewals. Later, on February 13, 2018 a second federal cou rt in the Eastern District of New York also issued a nation- wide preliminary injunction to allow DACA renewals to continue. When the court enjoined the effort by the Trump administration to repeal DACA and allowed un-documented immigrants to begin applying for DACA, there was an immediate rush of applications by undocu- mented immigrants who held DACA status, but were ex- pired. According to data from the United States Cus- toms and Immigrant Services ( \"USCIS \"), 64,210 immi- grants applied for renewal immediately a fter the Janu- ary 2018 injunction, and 31,860 were approved by March 31, 2018 and 32,280 were pending, w ith only 70 having been denied. 31 Over the course of 2018, USCIS reported 287,709 total requests for DACA renewal were made by 31 Approximate Count of DACA Receipts: Since January 10, 2018, As of Mar. 31, 2018 https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/ data/DACA_Receipts_Since_Injunction_Mar_31_2018.pdf 295 undocumented immigrants.32 Despite additional legal challenges, throughout 2019 the injunctions from North- ern California and Eastern New York remained in place nationwide and 406,586 persons applied for DACA re- newals across 2019.33 Despite the Trump administra- tion's continued legal challenges to DACA, public state- ments denigrating immigrants, once the courts issued the injunctions to protect DACA, undocumented immi- grants became trusting of this program,. 67. On July 2, 2015, the Priority Enforcement Pro- gram (PEP) was implemented by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). It was announced by then -DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson in a November 2014 memo, and was meant to replace the then -existing Se- cure Communities program, which coordinated local po- lice databases with ICE. PEP impl emented a series of mandates that immigration enforcement should priori-tize individuals who have engaged in serious criminal ac- tivity or who pose national security threats. In short, it mandated that ICE cast a smaller net in identifying, detaining, and d eporting undocumented immigrants. In addition, PEP made it more difficult for ICE to exe- cute immigration detainers. ICE had to state probable cause (via reference to the priorities) in order to execute a detainer in addition to the local law enforcement agency 32 Number of Form I- 821D,Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Status, by Fiscal Year, Quarter, and Case Sta- tus: Aug. 15, 2012- Mar. 31, 2020 https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/ files/docu ment/data/DACA_performancedata_fy2020_qtr2.pdf 33 Number of Form I- 821D,Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Status, by Fiscal Year, Quarter, and Case Sta- tus: Aug. 15, 2012- Mar. 31, 2020 https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/ files/docume nt/data/DACA_performancedata_fy2020_qtr2.pdf 296 having to serve a copy of the detainer request on the in- dividual in order for it to take effect. The intent of the new policy was for police to collaborate less with ICE and to only focus their detention efforts on serious crim- inals. The Dallas County Sheriff, which controls the county jails and oversees the processing of immigrants detained agreed to participate in the PEP program to reduce the local prominence of ICE in Dallas. 34 A re- search paper analyzing Dallas Police Department (DPD) police reports finds clear evidence that the im- plementation of PEP increased crime reporting to DPD by Hispanic and immigrant subjects in Dallas.35 The data shows Hispanic and immigrant engagement with police increased significantly in the immediate q uarter after PEP was implemented. And in the six quarters following the change in policy, Hispanics and immigrants voluntarily reported around 6,000 more incidents to the police than they would have been if the enforcement pri- orities had not changed. Thus, reversals or limitations imposed on executive actions may have measurable con- 34 Dallas county jails complied with the PEP. Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez formally agreed to participate in the program after meeting with ICE representatives in July and August 2015. In August 2015, Dall as County officials began reviewing ICE 's re- quest prior to honoring them with the vetting guidelines being sim- ilar to PEP priorities, ensuring only individuals who posed a threat to public safety were transferred to ICE 's custody. This is evi- denced in data by Jacome (2018), who finds total detainers dropped by roughly 1,000 by the end of 2015 due to decreases in detainers issued for individuals convicted of misdemeanors and those with no conviction. 35 Jacome, Elisa. \"The Effect of Immigration Enforceme nt on Crime Reporting: Evidence from the Priority Enforcement Pro- gram. \" Available at SSRN 3263086 (2018). 297 sequences on promoting trust among immigrant com- munities and influencing behavioral interactions with various aspects of government. 68. In prior survey research in 2018 to te st the im- pact of a citizenship question being included or excluded from the 2020 Census, there was a clear finding of in- creased Census participation after removing any fear of immigration status being exposed.36 Initially, after be- ing told about the citize nship question, a sizable share of respondents said they would not participate in the 2020 Census. Later in the survey, respondents were ran- domly assigned to a condition in which they were told the government changed their mind and a citizenship question would NOT be included after all. A second set of participants were randomly assigned to a condition in which it was reaffirmed that the government would in fact include a citizenship question. Among Latinos who said they would not participate in the cens us with a citizenship question, 80 percent changed their mind and said they would participate once they learned that the citizenship question would be re- moved. The mechanism here is whether or not those in the immigrant community believe their participati on 36 See Tr. 687- 89; Trial Ex. 677, NY v. Dep't Commerce, 351 F. Supp. 3d 502 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), aff 'd 139 S. Ct. 2551 (2019). Barreto expert declaration NY v. Dept Commerce, September 7, 2018. 298 creates increased risk of exposing themselves to immi- gration enforcement. Members of immigrant commu- nities are very concerned about their citizenship status being monitored or revealed. When they believe the threat is real, they will withdraw from the Census, and when that threat has been removed, they reengage. This provides very strong evidence that when fears about citizenship status being revealed are removed, a large share of Latinos will indeed increase their partici- pation in Census 2020. 37 69. Across the wide -ranging literature, a key finding is that immigrants are normally eager to engage in pub- lic life and with political institutions, but when there is a threat of negative consequences for their immigration status, avoidance behavior is likely . (e.g. Garcia 2019). G. Non -Response Follow -Up (NRFU) and Imputa- tion of Non -Responding Households 70. The Census Bureau is aware that some house- holds will not respond to the initial request for partici- pation, and as such they have long had a program called Non -Response Follow- Up (NRFU) which provides follow- up contact with any households that do not ini- tially respond. The Census Bureau estimates they con- ducted follow- up with around 50 million households in 2010 (Rao 2017). NRFU is critical for the Census Bu- reau to increase participation rates, but it is a costly and difficult undertaking by their own admission. Any in- creased non -response at initial contact makes NRFU much more difficult, especially if non -responding house- holds come to not trust the survey questions that enu- merators are attempting to ask. What 's more, NRFU 37 See id. 299 is now profoundly more difficult due to COVID -19 and the time available has been shortened. As discussed in this report, the PM increases the likelihood that Lati- nos, immigrants, and noncitizens are less likely to self- respond to the 2020 census. These non -responding in- dividua ls are also unlikely to respond after household visits by census enumerators because of fear of govern- ment interaction. (de la Puente 1995; 2004). 71. In fact, with the new focus on excluding undocu- mented immigrants directed by the PM, the Census out- reach efforts after July 21, 2020 could actually create more fear and anxiety in immigrant communities and further drive down response rate and increase the net undercount. For example, the Census Bureau plans to send enumerators into non -responding communities on behalf of the federal governm ent, and if nobody is home, they will leave a \" Notice of Visit\" from the federal gov- ernment which includes a unique house hold \"census identification number. \" Further, they inform the house- hold that additional visits will be made back to their house by enumerators on behalf of the federal govern- ment. This sends a clear signal of federal government monitoring of the household and will result in increased anxiety and concern over cooperating (e.g. Menj\u00edvar 2011; Szkupinski Quiroga et al. 2014). Research by Ha- gan et al. (2011) documents with clear evidence the ex- tensive chilling effect of increased presence of govern-ment officials who appear to be monitoring immigrants and checking on their status. They find immigrants \"withdrawing from the community \" as well as \" avoiding public places \" and that they \"spend most of their non - working hours in their homes because it is t he safest way to avoid detection. \" (Hagan et al. 2011.) Accord- ing to Abrego (2011), undocumented immigrants will go 300 to great lengths to reduce their visibility in society when they perceive a potential threat of deportation. Her research identifies with drawal from interactions with government agencies as awareness of immigration checks increases. From the perspective of an anxious immigrant, each additional household visit from a gov- ernment Census worker, following a PM directing the exclusion of undocu mented people, is the exact environ- ment that would produce withdrawal. Accord ing to Abrego: \"In effect, their well -being and stability are perennially threatened because, as they are constantly reminded, there may be an ICE raid . . . at any time \" (2011). 72. Research also finds that increased presence and visibility of government officials who appear to be col- lecting immigration information creates withdrawal and also misreporting on government forms (Rodriguez and Hagan 2004). Increased prese nce of immigration offi- cials in the community lead to a decline of student at- tendance in the nearby school to avoid any contact with the government officials. However, in communities without ICE presence, school attendance is not im- pacted. The research s tudy observed this trend across three different cities in Texas and attributed increased withdrawal to an increased visibility and presence of government officials asking about immigration status. Further, the same study reported that Hispanics began to change their racial identification to White on govern- ment forms at health clinics to avoid any risk of associa- tion with immigration officials (Rodriguez and Hagan 2004). 73. Another study specifically examined the willing- ness of immigrants to participate in surveys and data 301 collection efforts, in particular examining how fear of deportation impacted response rates and general en- gagement with government services (Arbona et al. 2010). One of the most important findings of this study was that if immigrants fea r their participation could somehow lead to their deportation, they will not partici- pate unless they are fully comfortable and trusting of the survey taker. As the research study progressed, Ar- bona et al. reported, through quantitative data, that fear of deportation was a strong motivating factor for avoid- ance and that over 80% of immigrants in their sa mple stated that they avoided activities such as \" ask[ing] for help from government agencies, report[ing] an infrac- tion to the police, attend[ing] court if requested to do so,\" and other items. The more census enumerators visit im- migrant communities to at tempt household counts, follow- ing the July 21 PM to exclude undocumented immigrants, the more likely they will be to not participate. That is, the outreach itself will produce further non -response as a result of the socio -political climate following the PM. 74. NRFU enumerators may not be able to make contact with adult households. Enumerators may not be sufficiently linguistically or culturally competent in order to persuade undecided households to respond. For example, they may not be able to effectively con-vince Latinos who may be concerned about immigration issues or enforcement to respond. Many Latinos, in the context of heightened immigration enforcem ent, are told to not open the door to strangers due to commercial scams and guidance from immigration legal advisors re- garding ICE visits (Kissam et al., 2019). Moreover, even if enumerators are able to convince members of im- migrant communities to respond despite the existence 302 of a chilling effect, it may be logistically difficult for enu- merators to make contact wit h adult householders. In many immigrant communities, work hours are long and weekend work is common, increasing the difficulty for NRFU enumerators to conduct a direct interview of the household (Kissam et al., 2019). 75. NRFU also cannot account for households omit- ted from the Master Address File as a result of \" complex households \" in low -visibility unconventional and/or hid- den housing un its (Kissam, 2019). These complex house- holds may be more likely to be made up of immigrants and their direct social ties. Kissam (2019) notes in the San Joaquin Valley, only 95% of the Latino immigrant study population live in housing units included in the Census Bureau 's Master Address File, resulting in a 5% household omission rate. The only way these house- holds can be counted in the Census is if they proactively respond via online non -ID processing operations or by phone. However, these alternative mechanisms may not work if these complex households are concerned about the prospect of providing information to a govern- ment seeking to identify their citizenship status or ex- clude them from the count for specific purposes, such as apportionment , as require d by the PM. 76. Even if NRFU results in data production, it may be faulty data. High levels of nonresponse force the Census Bureau to rely on alternative statistical proce-dures such as triangulation via administrative records, proxy interviews with neigh bors, and, imputation. Some of these alternative efforts might fail in immigrant communities. Proxy interviews may fail to resolve un- dercounting due to mistrust of Federal authorities and lack of willingness to provide information on neighbors. 303 Indeed, only 17% of respondents in a survey of the San Joaquin Valley immigrant community indicated they were willing to provide an enumerator with information about neighbors in the San Joaquin Valley (Kissam, 2019). It is important to note proxy interview effor ts are error- prone, since they are, at best, estimates by neighbors of the number and characteristics of neigh- boring households. The same survey of immigrant communities in the San Joaquin Valley indicates less than half of potential Census respondents belie ve they know enough about their neighbors to provide accurate responses (Kissam, 2019). 77. Moreover, finding administrative records that match households is likely to be more difficult for immi- grant households, who may be less prone to providing person al or household information to various aspects of government and may not be eligible for a variety of gov-ernment programs that keep records (Kissam, 2019; Asad, 2020). While the Trump administration may as- sume they can rely on administrative records, the real- ity is that this creates major methodological problems for NRFU and then imputation. The data is fraught with errors and inconsistencies and will lead to lower quality data and undercounts. Research by Bhaskar, Fernandez, and Porter (2018), who are C ensus Bureau researchers, indicates matching an administrative rec-ord to a household requires a Personal Identification Key (PIK). They also find fore ign-born households are less likely to have a PIK than U.S. -born households. Lack of having a PIK is ass ociated with more people in a household, living in a Census tract with a high density of foreign -born individuals, Latino/Hispanic race/eth- nicity, non -citizen status, limited English or no English 304 proficiency, and being a recent immigrant. IRS ad- ministrat ive records may not serve as effective proxies for enumeration given not all undocumented immigrants file income tax returns on a regular basis (Gee, Gardner, and Wiehe, 2016). Social Security Administration (SSA) records may be incomplete if immigrant workers have only worked in the informal or underground economy. Parents also may never apply for an SSN for foreign - born children without legal status. Foreign -born non- working spouses may have never applied for an SSN (Kissam, 2019). Often, the use of borrowed SSNs is prevalent among immigrant workers, which may result in potential undercounts or discrepancies in the count. Moreover, employer reports of emplo yee's earnings do not provide reliable or exhaustive information on house- hold size. 78. Even if a match to an administrative record is found for a specific address, it may not accurately enu- merate household size and composition because the rec- ord may be out of date or exclude peripheral household members who are not part of the primary core family living in the housing unit (Kissam, 2019). There may be discrepancies via administrative matching in neigh- borhoods where low -income renter households move of- ten and administrative records may not update fre- quently in immigrant communities such that newly b orn children will be disproportionately omitted (Kissam, 2019). If information via administrative records or proxy interviews do not bear fruit, the Census Bureau may attempt to use hot -deck imputation to determine the characteristics of households that d id not respond. The problem is that nonresponding households in immi- grant communities may be systematically larger than 305 those that do respond. Thus, each imputation will con- tribute to a differential undercut given that \"donor \" households have less inhabitants (Kissam, 2019). 79. In addition to trying to match households to their administrative records, the Census Bureau has indicated that it may employ statistical imputation techn iques to ad- dress nonresponse. During the collection of any sur- vey, tw o types of nonresponse can emerge: unit nonre- sponse and item nonresponse. Unit nonresponse con- cerns an entire missing case resulting from either non- contact, refusal, or inability to participate. Item non- response concerns missing values on certain questi ons in the survey. Bias, or incorrect and faulty data, can emerge from nonresponse when the causes of the non- response are linked to the survey statistics being meas- ured, which is referred to as nonignorable nonresponse (Groves et al 2004). By way of illu stration, public health officials designed a survey to measure the prevalence of HIV in the population during the early days of the HIV epidemic. Despite incentives, cooperation rates among those who were HIV -positive were extremely low be- cause of the sti gma of the disease. Thus, the key sta- tistic sought \u2014namely, the percentage of HIV -positive people\u2014 was causally related to the likelihood of self - response; specifically, in that case, those who were HIV - positive did not want to participate in the study at all. Non -ignorable nonresponse is particularly egregious because even if the causal influence is known \"there is no way that the statistic among respondents ca n be made free of nonresponse bias (without making heroic assumptions about the status of the nonrespondents) \" (Groves et al. 2004). What this means is that if a factor influencing the decision to not respond is correlated with 306 an important outcome variable, imputation is impracti- cal because you cannot observe the existence of the pre- cise variable you are trying to count. In the case of the 2020 Census, the key outcome variable is producing an accurate count of total household size; yet, prior re- search establishes that larger households are more likely to not respond when the responder 's citizensh ip status may be implicated. Thus, the decision whether to re- spond is correlated with household size, a key outcome variable of interest. 80. Some statistical tools are available to deal with nonresponse. At one end of the spectrum, if every var- iable of interest is known for the nonrespondent, except one, then we can use these variables to form an imputa- tion model that will predict a value for the missing value \u2014for example, we may know the existence of the re- spondent and that person 's age, but may not know their income level and can use predictive models to impute in- come for that respondent. At the other end of the spec- trum we have entire missing cases (unit nonresponse), where the existence of the person is unknown. Imputa- tion for unit nonresponse , some times called \"whole per- son imputation, \" is used almost exclusively in longitudi- nal surveys where ample data from prior waves exists for a missing respondent. It is extremely rare to im- pute for unit nonresponse if little is known about the nonrespondent case (Groves and Couper 1998). Unit nonresponse is typically dealt with by some form of post - stratification or response rate weighting adjustment 38 38 After the survey data are collected, statisticians can use the known universe of respondent demographics to apply weights and possibly correct for non -response, however this only corrects the da- taset for use in a data analysis project or academic research paper, 307 (Kalton 1983). While imputation can be useful for missing values in an otherwise co mpleted survey form (item nonresponse), it is particularly problematic for im- puting the existence of whole persons, and is especially likely to end up with an undercount in vulnerable com- munities. This is part of the reason that social scien- tists and gove rnment statisticians want the decennial census to be as non -burdensome and non -sensitive as possible, to ensure an overall accurate count through high rates of participation (Wines 2018). 81. In general, whole -person imputation itself relies on a number of assumptions to work correctly. If data is missing completely at random (MCAR) (Rubin 1976), then non- response generally introduces less bias. Models are of less help with non -ignorable nonresponse, as noted above, where nonresponse depends on the val- ues of a response variable. In this case, models can help but never eliminate all nonresponse bias (Lohr 1999). Indeed, recent reviews of cutting edge imputa- tion procedures like \"hot deck imputation \" argue that \"hot deck \" methods for situations where nonres ponse is non-ignorable have not been well explored (Andridge and Little 2010). Whole person imputation, then, has its dangers. The Census Bureau currently acknowl- edges that \"whole person substitutions and whole per- son imputations are not very accurate. \" (See Abowd 30(b)(6) Deposition 2018) 82. With respect to the U.S. census and counts of Latino and immigrant households, previous research not necessarily population counts, which are supposed to serve as the baseline universe estimate in the first place. 308 has shown that whole person imputation efforts are se- riously error -prone. Because family arrangements, housing style s and total household sizes vary considera- bly, attempts to impute the population of non -respond- ent households have been shown to undercount the pop- ulation (Kissam 2017). First, many non -traditional housing units are simply not included in the imputation, leaving them as vacant when in reality they had tenants or dwellers. Second, the household size of missing units tends to be larger, on average, than of reported units. Reports also document differences by socioeco- nomic status. The end result is that ev en with imputa- tion, there can still be a significant undercount of the Latino immigrant population. 83. Beyond the raw count being inaccurate, there is also evidence of misattribution of those imputed, be- cause they rely on higher acculturated units for whi ch there is data to make adjustments (i.e. substituting data on U.S. -born, English -speaking and college educated households when in fact missing cases are more likely to be foreign -born, Spanish -speaker, less educated house- holds), suggesting the imputed da ta do not accurately describe the true population (Kissam 2017). The U.S. Government Accountability Office has itself admitted this is a problem with respect to getting a complete count of Latinos. In the 2003 report on trying to im- prove the Latino count , they wrote \"even with the Bu- reau 's guidelines and training, deciding whether a house is unfit for habitation or merely unoccupied and boarded- up can be very difficult. An incorrect decision on the part of the census worker could have caused the dwell- ing and its occupants to get missed by the census. \" U.S GAO Report (2003) (GAO -03-605). 309 84. By examining data from a prior 2018 survey spe- cifically about the Census, we can conclude that unit non-response on the 2020 census will not be at random. Households that do not respond and represent missing units, are certain to have very different characteristics and demographics than the households that do respond. In this event, it makes it nearly impossible to impute or infer the population totals or any other demographic in- formation about missing units (e.g. missing households) because we do not have enough reliable information on \"matched \" or similar units. Further, it is quite likely that unit non -response in 2020 will be clustered geo- graphically, meaning that there will be fewer available adjacent units for imputation, and that analysts will have to rely on dissimilar households for imputation, thus violating the most important assumption needed for accurate imputation. In particular, non -responders were found more likely in dense urban areas and locales with high numbers of renters. These factors are known to be related to census undercounts and make NRFU difficult and result in erroneous imputation (U.S. GAO Report, 2003). 85. It is virtually certa in that the reduced self -re- sponse caused by the July 21 PM related to citizenship status will lead to a net undercount among those popu- lations with lower rates of self -response. Previous cen- sus reports have documented that high rates of non -re- sponse to the initial questionnaire result in undercounts, and that NRFU is not always successful in converting those cases into respondents. In addition, matching household to administrative records can be an unreliable method of enumerating the household, particularly for immigrant communities. Prior census reports have also documented that errors are made in imputation and 310 that undercounts persist even after attempted imputa- tion. Ultimately, the worse the initial non -response is, the worse the initial undercoun t is, making it increas- ingly more difficult to convert those cases into respond- ing cases, and increasing more difficult to impute miss- ing units (US Census Bureau 2017b; National Research Council 2002; 2004). 86. This problem has been documented to be worse in Latino and immigrant communities where the Census admits the undercount is problematic, and that their ef- forts at NRFU and imputation have errors (Ericksen and Defonso 1993; O 'Hare et al. 2016). One primary reason is that issues related to trust of go vernment offi- cials significantly hampers the NRFU process, and in 2020 the citizenship question will greatly exacerbate is- sues of trust in immigrant communities (See section be- low \"Perceptions of Trust and Confidentiality \" at para- graph 96). In particular, young children in Latino house- holds have been found to be regularly undercounted by previous census efforts and that imputation methods do not appropriately find or count this population. The best assurance for an accurate count is high response rates on the initial census request for participation, which requires a high degree of trust (O 'Hare et al. 2016; Casey Foundation 2018). Previous self -reports by the Census Bureau are clear: immigrant communities are already at -risk of an undercount because of lower levels of trust of government officials, and have particular anx- iety over citizenship infor mation being shared. What 's more, these previous census reports have documented that low self -participation on round one of invitations ul- timately leads to an undercount that no amount of NRFU, administrative -record matching, or imputation can correct. In 2020, the PM will only create more 311 problems, more anxiety in immigrant communities, and less self-participation on round one. With nearly 17 million people, including 6 million citizen children, living in households with at least one person who is an undoc- umented immigrant (Casey Foundation 2018), there is enormous potential for a massive non -response with a newly created anxiety over citizenship status as a result of the July PM. 87.

TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS EXPERT DECLARATION OF MR. JOHN THOMPSON I. Introduction 1. On July 21, 2020 President Trump issued a Memo- randum for the Secretary of Commerce on Exclud- ing Illegal Aliens from the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census (in the remainder of this document I will use the term \" Memorandum\" to re- fer to this document ). I am extremely concerned that this action will adversely affect the quality and accuracy of the 2020 Census. 323 2. The 2020 Census results will be of great importance to our nation. The Constitution requires that the census be used for reapportioning the Congress of the United States and the Electoral College. The 2020 Census will also be used for numerous other functions to support good policymaking and eco- nomic growth including: redrawing congressional and state legislative voting districts; allocatin g over $1.5 trillion of federal funds annually; informing sound policy development; providing critical infor- mation for state, local and tribal government plan- ning; and supplying critical information to large and small businesses to generate growth and job crea- tion. Inaccuracies or errors in the 2020 Census will have grave consequences on these uses for the subsequent 10 -year period. 3. I have carefully reviewed the Memorandum in- structing the Secretary of Commerce to provide in- formation to exclude undocumen ted persons from the Apportionment counts. I have also reviewed the 2020 Census Operational Plans as well as the documentation that the Census Bureau has issued describing the actions it is taking in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. I have two serious concerns regarding the Memorandum: (1) it will signifi- cantly increase the risk of larger total and differen- tial undercounts, relative to previous censuses, for the hard -to-count populations, including immigrant communities; and (2) it lacks transparency a s re- quired by law and the Census Bureau Statistical Quality Standards that would allow for the assess- ment of the methodology that might be used in re-sponse to the direction to exclude undocumented 324 persons from the 2020 Census Apportionment counts. II. Qual ifications 4. Below I briefly describe specific aspects of my qual- ifications and work experience that establishes my credentials as an accomplished statistician and an expert on the Census Bureau and Decennial Cen- sus. I have also attached a copy of my CV to this declaration. 5. I have served as both the Director of the U.S. Cen-sus Bureau and as the career senior executive in charge of management of all aspects of the 2000 De-cennial Census. I am also a distinguished profes- sional in the area of statistics and survey design. I have a deep understanding of the processes that are necessary to achieve a complete and highly accurate Decennial Census. 6. I served as the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau from August 2013 to June 2017. Prior to becoming Director, I worked at the Census Bureau for 27 years (from 1975 to 2002). I started my career as a mathematical statistician in 1975. I spent the majority of my employment at the Census Bureau focused on the D ecennial Census and ultimately served as the Associate Director for the 2000 De- cennial Census, with management responsibility for all phases of the 2000 Decennial Census. 7. The Census Bureau is the largest Statistical Agency and produces a wide range of demographic and eco- nomic statistics including: the Decennial the Current Pop- ulation Survey; the National Crime Victimization 325 Survey, the National Health Interview Survey; the Economic Census; the release of 13 princip le key economic indicators on a monthly or quarterly basis; and conducts about 100 additional surveys. The Director of the Census Bureau is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. 8. My responsibilities as Director of the Census Bu-reau inc luded overseeing the research and testing that produced the design for the 2020 Census. During my tenure, the original operational plan for conducting the 2020 Census was released, as was an updated version 2.0 of this plan. In addition, major field test s were conducted in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. The results of these tests informed the final 2020 Census Design that was tested in the 2018 end- to-end test. During my service, the Census Bu- reau reviewed the residence criteria used to deter- mine where to c ount the residents of the United States. A preliminary proposal for the 2020 resi- dence criteria was issued for public comment on June 30, 2016. 1 In particular, the Census Bureau was following the same principles that had guided each previous Decennial Census \u2014the Constitution requires that everyone living in the United States should be included in the enumeration, regardless of immigration status, for all uses of the census, in- cluding Apportionment. The final 2020 Census residence criteria were issued o n February 5, 2018, and again followed these same principles to count everyone living in the United States at their usual 1 Federal Register, 81 FR 42577, Proposed 2020 Census Resi- dence Rule and Residence Situations, June 30, 2016. 326 place of residence regardless of immigration status for Apportionment and all other uses.2 9. Prior to being appointed Director of the Census Bu- reau I was at National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, serving as Executive Vice President from 2002 to 2008 and President from 2008 to 2013. NORC is an objec- tive, non -partisan independent research institution that d elivers reliable data and rigorous analysis to guide critical programmatic, business, and policy decisions. Clients include government, corporate, and nonprofit organizations around the world who partner with NORC to transform increasingly com- plex informa tion into useful knowledge. NORC conducts research in five main areas: Economics, Markets, and the Workforce; Education, Training, and Learning; Global Development; Health and Well -Being; and Society, Media, and Public Affairs. NORC services include designing and conducting surveys (telephone, Internet, and in -person) as well as analytical studies. 10. From July 2017 to August 2018, I served as the Ex-ecutive Director of the Council of Professional As- sociations on Federal Statistics (COPAFS). CO- PAFS is an organization with a membership consist- ing of professional associations and research organ-izations that depend on and support high quality federal statistics. The Executive Director of CO- 2 Albert E. Fontenot, Jr., 2020 Census Residence Criteria and Res- idence Situations, 2020 Census Program Memorandum Series: 2018.04, February 5, 2018. 327 PAFS must have a deep understanding of the Fed- eral Statistical Syste m and the wide range of data products that are produced. Serving as the Exec- utive Director of COPAFS reinforced my apprecia- tion of the importance of high -quality Decennial Census data to the entire Federal Statistical Sys- tem. 11. In addition to the work experience described above, I am an elected Fellow of the American Statistical Association and was selected to serve on the Na-tional Academies of Science, Engineering, and Med- icine Committee on National Statistics. III. Concerns A. Background on the Decennial Census 12. The uses of the data generated by the Decennial Census are extremely important for all components of our democracy and economy, including: the constitutionally required reapportionment of the Congress; redrawing congressional and stat e legis- lative voting districts; allocating over $1.5 trillion in federal funds annually; supporting evidence based policy making by state, local and tribal govern- ments; and allowing informed decisions by large and small business to generate economic growth and job creation. Inaccuracies or undercounts in Decen- nial Census data will result in under -representation of the affected population groups not just in the im- mediate term, but for ten subsequent years until the next Decennial Census results are availabl e. B. The 2020 Census was already facing unprec- edented challenges prior to the release of the Memorandum. 328 13. The COVID -19 pandemic forced the delay of key op- erations out of concerns for the safety of both cen- sus workers and the general public. The in -person components of the local partnership program to in- crease response rates of the traditionally hard -to- count populations were delayed, as was the opera- tion to collect responses from those households that do not self-respond. This operation is referred to as nonresponse follow -up or NRFU. In my opin- ion, NRFU is the most critical operation to achiev- ing a fair and accurate enumeration. Currently the national self -response rate is 63 percent, which means that over 37 percent or over 50 million hous- ing units and their occupants must still be enumer-ated. 3 A successful NRFU is therefore essential to achieving a complete enumeration for the 2020 Cen- sus. 14. The NRFU operation had been scheduled to start on May 15, 2020 and run throu gh July 31, 2020. However, as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, the Census rescheduled it to start in most of the United States on August 11, 2020 and initially planned to complete it by October 30, 2020. 15. In order to accommodate this delay, the Censu s Bu- reau had requested, through the Department of Commerce, a four -month e xtension of the legal deadlines4 to deliver Apportionment and redistrict- ing data. For Apportionment this would extend 3 US Census Bureau 2020 Census daily response rate tracker, https://2020census.gov/en/response -rates.html (last accessed Au- gust 6, 2020) . 4 Title 13, US Code, Section 141, (b) and (c). 329 the current deadline of December 31, 2020 to April 30, 2021. For re districting data, the requested ex- tension was from March 31, 2021 to July 31, 2021. 16. However, the Census Bureau has announced that the deadlines will not be extended, and that the NRFU will now be completed by September 30, 2020. 5 The Census Burea u will have to take steps to complete the NRFU more rapidly than they planned. 17. In this situation the risk that the hard -to-count pop- ulations will be underrepresented increases greatly. Cooperation on the part of the households in NRFU is going to be e ssential. However, as I discuss be- low, the issuance of the Memorandum will most likely decrease cooperation and willingness to par- ticipate further reducing the effectiveness of NRFU in achieving a fair and accurate enumeration. C. The confidence of respondents that the 2020 Census will be confidential will be signifi- cantly eroded leading to increased under-counts 18. The Census Bureau has made good progress since the 1990 Decennial Census, and had great success during both the 2000 and 2010 Decennial Censuses in reducing undercounts. A key component of this success has been the deployment of a combined na-tional and local advertising and local partnership 5 Statement from U.S. Census Bureau Director Steven Dilling ham: Delivering a Complete and Accurate 2020 Census Count, https:// www.census.gov/newsroom/press -releases/2020/delivering -complete - accurate -count.html , August 3, 2020. 330 program to deliver a message to hard -to-count pop- ulations that the census is important to their co m- munity, and that the data collected through the cen- sus is completely confidential. No individual 's in- formation is shared with any other organization or law enforcement entities. 19. This messaging program was responsible for dra- matic gains in the accurac y and coverage of the 2000 and 2010 Decennial Census relative to the 1990 Cen-sus, which did not include such a program. For ex- ample, the undercount of Black or African Ameri-cans dropped from 4.6 percent in 1990 to 2.1 percent in 2010. 6 For the Hispanic p opulation the under- count dropped from 5.0 percent to 1.5 percent.7 20. Census Bureau research conducted in planning for the 2020 Census has identified serious concerns that potential respondents have with respect to the con-fidentiality of their information prior to the release of the Memorandum. For example: a. Census Bureau researchers conducted qualitative research that was presented at the 2018 American Association of Public Opinion Research annual conference that indicated that fear of government was 6 P. Cantwell, DSSD 2010 Census Coverage Measurement Memo- randum Series # 2010-G- 01, (May 22, 2012), https://www.census.gov/ coverage_measurement/pdfs/g01.pdf . 7 P. Cantwell, DSSD 2010 Census Coverage Measurement Memo- randum Series # 2010-G- 01, (May 22, 2012), https://www.census.gov/ coverage_measurement/pdfs/g01.pdf. 331 higher than had been experienced in prior years.8 b. The 2020 Census Barriers Attitudes and Motivators Study was conducted to under- stand the concerns of potential respondents to help shape the 2020 Census advertising and communication program themes and messages. The study found that the two most significant barriers to participation in the 2020 Census were: (1) concerns that the Census Bureau would share infor-mation with other government agencies; and (2) that the information that respond-ents provided would be used against them 9. Non -White and Hispanic groups were much more concerned than the White non -His- panic group. In addition, respondents that were not proficient in English were much more concerned than those who were (39 percent compared to 23 percent). c. The Census Bureau also conducted re-search on the potential effects of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census questionnaire. 10 This research indicated 8 AAPOR Panel on Changes in Respondent Privacy, Confidential- ity, and Data Sharing Concerns, Mey ers, Goerman, Harris- Kojetin, Terry, and Fobia, Denver, Colorado, May 18, 2018 9 CBAMS report 10 J. David Brown, Misty L. Heggeness, Suzanne M. Dorinski, Lawrence Warren, and Moises Yi Understanding the Quality of Al- ternative Citizenship Data Sources for th e 2020 Census , August 6, 2018. 332 that the question would reduce self -re- sponse of the non -citizen population. Fur- thermore, the research found that it was likely that households that refuse to re- spond to the census questionnaire because of the citizenship question are also likely to not respond to NRFU enumerators. It is my opinion, based on my experience in im-plementin g the 2000 Census and my work in leading the design and planning for the 2020 Census, that the Memorandum is likely to have similar effects on NRFU response. 21. In order to address these concerns, a cornerstone of the 2020 Census advertising and partnership pro- gram, is a message that respondent information is confidentia l. The Census Bureau will not share it with any outside entities, including law and immi-gration enforcement. It is my opinion that the Memorandum will reduce the effectiveness of the 2020 Census advertising and partnership program in gaining the confidence of respondents in tradi- tionally hard -to-count communities. 22. For example, a critical factor in underlying re- sponse and participation in the 2020 Census is the macro environment under which the NRFU is being conducted. While the 2020 Census advertising and partnership program is designed to positively influ-ence this environment, other factors such as the is- suance of the Memorandum can have the opposite effect. As Census Bureau Chief Scientist, Dr. 333 John Abowd, acknowledged during recent trial tes- timony11 in the matter considering the potential ef- fects of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census questionnaire, the macro environment was likely to be affected by actions to add a citizenship question. Furthermore, Dr. Abowd acknowledged that the political environment around immigration could amplify the effects of a citizenship question on decreased response. 23. It is my opinion that the effects of the Memorandum on the curr ent macro environment are likely to be as great if not greater than the addition of a citizen-ship question. Therefore, immigrants and the families of immigrants will be reluctant to partici-pate in the NRFU and many will not be enumer- ated. It is also like ly, in my opinion, that this re- luctance to participate will extend to other hard -to- count populations as well. The issuance of the Memorandum has significantly increased the risk of larger total and differential undercounts, relative to previous censuses. D. Lack of transparency 24. At this point, little is known about the ultimate qual-ity and accuracy of the 2020 Census. The location and magnitude of errors caused by potential under-counts and overcounts has not been determined. In addition, the level of inclusion of undocumented persons in the 2020 Census is also unknown. 11 Trial Testimony of Dr. John Abowd, Nov. 13, 2018, New York Immigration Coalition, et al. v. United States Department of Com- merce, et al., 18- CV-5025- JMF (S.D.N.Y), at 926 -27. 334 25. It will be very challenging for the Census Bureau to determine the number of undocumented persons that are included in the 2020 Census at the time when Apportionment data is requi red to be re- ported. It is critical for the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce to describe the method- ology that they intend to utilize to estimate the num-bers of undocumented persons enumerated in the 2020 Census and what are appropriate measures of accuracy that would support the usage of such methodologies. The Memorandum does not pro- vide any specific directions and the Census Bureau has not described how it will comply with the Mem- orandum. 26. There are legal and statistical standards that the Census Bureau has followed and should continue to follow with respect to transparency: a. The Census Bureau is a Federal Statistical Agency and as Director Dillingham noted in sworn testimony July 29, 2020, the Cen-sus Bureau intends to follow the princi ples and practices identified by the Committee on National Statistics for Federal Statisti- cal Agencies. 12 Principle 2, Credibility among Data Users , states: \"Also essen- tial to building credibility are for an agency to be open and transparent about its dat a sources and their limitations, demonstrate understanding of users ' needs and priori- ties, fully document the processes used to 12 Committee on National Statistics, Principles a nd Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency 2 (6th ed. 2017). 335 produce and disseminate statistical prod- ucts, and take proactive steps to preserve data for future use. \" b. The Office of Management and Budget is- sued a Memorandum on April 24, 2019 Im- proving Implementation of the Infor- mation Quality Act to the Heads of all Ex- ecutive Departments and Agencies strengthening p revious guidance in this area. 13 This document states: \"The IQA requi res agencies conduct pre -dissemination review of their information products. During this review, each agency should consider the appropriate level of quality for each of the products that it disseminates based on the likely use of that information. \" 27. In 2013 the Census Bureau issued Statistical Qual- ity Standards that are currently guiding the conduct of all their programs including the 2020 Census . 14 a. In particular: Statistical Quality Standard F1, Releasing Information Products Re- quirement F1 -6 states: \"Information pro d- ucts must comply with the Census Bureau 's statistical quality standards and must be free of serious data quality issues in order to be released outside the Census Bureau without restrictions. \" Statistical Quality Standard F2, Pro viding Documentation to 13 Russel T. Vought, Acting Director OMB, Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, Subject: Improv- ing Implementation of the Information Quality Act (Apr. 24, 2019). 14 U.S. Census Bureau Statistical Quality Standards (Jul. 2013). 336 Support Transparency in Information Products Requirement F2 -2 states: \"Doc u- mentation must be readily accessible in suf- ficient detail to allow qualified users to un- derstand and analyze the information and to reproduce (within the constraints of con-fidentiality requirements) and evaluate the results. \" 28. The most important information produced and re- leased by the Census Bureau is the constitutionally mandated Apportionment data. Because this in- formation is so vital to our democrac y, it is critically important that the Department of Commerce and the Census Bureau are transparent in their adher- ence to their legal and statistical standards. At a minimum, the Census Bureau has an obligation to assure the public and stakeholders that a ny meth- ods it develops for determining the number of un- documented individuals is statistically sound. VI. Conclusion In conclusion, it is my opinion that the issuance of the Memorandum will significantly increase the risk of much larger undercounts for th e 2020 Census than measured in previous censuses, including under- counts of immigrant communities. In addition, there is no transparency or documentation of how the quality and fitness for use of the Apportionment counts will be determined, nor is there an y documen- tation of how the number of undocumented persons potentially included in the 2020 Census will be deter-mined.

I have been an Assistant Professor of Political Science at George Washington University since August 2017. I was recently awarded tenure, and will become a tenured Associate Professor on September 1, 2020. Prior to working at George Washington University, I was an Associate Professor at the Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology from July 2016 - July 2017, and 340 an Assistant Professor at MIT from July 2012 - July 2016. 2. I have been asked by counsel representing the plaintiffs in New York Immigration Coalition v. Trump and State of New York v. Trump to analyze relevant data and provide my expert opinions. 3. More specifically, I have been asked: T o forecast the populations of every state in the United States in 2020. To estimate the proportion of the population in every state in the United States likely to be ex- cluded if undocumented immigrants are not in-cluded in the Census enumeration used for ap- portionment. T o analyze the likely effects of the exclusion of undocumented immigrants on the apportion- ment of representatives across states for the U.S House of Representatives. 4. My opinions are based on the knowledge I have amassed over my educati on, training and experi- ence, including a detailed review of the relevant ac-ademic literature. They also follow from a statisti- cal analysis that I describe in detail below. A. Qualifications and Publications 5. My Ph.D. is in Political Science, from Stanfo rd Uni- versity, where my graduate training included courses in political science and statistics. I also have a J.D. from Stanford Law School. My aca- demic research and teaching focuses on public opin-ion based on surveys and Census data, as well as the stud y of representation, elections, and polarization 341 in American Politics. I have also taught courses on statistical analysis. 6. My curriculum vitae is attached to this Declaration at Appendix C. All publications that I have au- thored and published appear in my curriculum vi- tae. I have published 30 academic articles and book chapters. My work is published or forthcom- ing in peer -reviewed journals such as: the Ameri- can Political Science Review , the American Jour- nal of Political Science , the Journal of Politi cs, Po- litical Analysis, Political Science Research and Methods , the British Journal of Political Science , Political Behavior , the Annual Review of Political Science , the Election Law Journal , Nature Energy , Public Choice , and edited volumes from Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press. My non -academic writing has been published in the New York Times and the Washington Post . 7. Most relevantly, I provided an expert report and declaration in New York Immigration Coalition et al v. United States Department of Commerce , No. 18-CV-2921- JMF (S.D. NY). In that report, I as- sessed the consequences of an undercount caused by a potential citizenship question on the U.S. Cen- sus. Specifically, I examined the effects of a net differential unde rcount of people who live in immi- grant households on congressional apportionment. I found that the inclusion of a citizenship question on the Census would likely have led to substantial effects on the population counts of each state, and the apportionment of representatives across states for the U.S House of Representatives. In that 342 case, the court found my analysis and findings \"credible and persuasive. \" 8. I have also previously provided expert reports in League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania v. Com- monwealth of Pennsylvania , No. 159 MM 2017 (PA 2018); League of Women Voters of Michigan v. Johnson, No. 2:17 -cv-14148 (E.D. 2019); and PRI et al v. Smith et al., No. 18 -cv-357 (S.D. Ohio 2018). 9. The opinions in this declaration are my own, and do not represent the views of George Washington Uni- versity. B. Research Design 10. President Trump recently issued a presidential mem-orandum charging the Secretary of Commerce to \"exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status under the Im- migration and Nationality Act. \" 1 In order to as- sess the consequences of excluding undocumented immigrants from the count of people in the United States used for apportionment, I conduct the follow-ing steps: A. I estimate the baseline population of each state in 2020 based on the Census Bureau 's annual estimates of the population of each state from the past three decades. 2 The 1 See https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential -actions/memorandum - excluding -illegal- aliens -apportionment -base- following -2020- census/. 2 For the state populations from 2010- 2019, I used the file ' nst- est2019- 01.xlsx' which I obtained from https://www.census.gov/newsroom/ press -kits/2019/national -state -estimates.html. For the populations from 2000- 2009, I used the file ' st-est00int -01.xls ' https://www. census.gov/data/ for apportionment also in- clude overseas federal employees and their dependents. Then, based o n data from the U.S. Military and the Census Bureau, I esti- mate the number of overseas federal em-ployees and dependents that would be added to the population of each state for apportion-ment. B. I use data from the Pew Research Center to estimate the numbe r of undocumented im- migrants in each state in 2020. These are the most widely used data in the academic literature on the undocumented immigrant population. However, I reach very similar conclusions using a variety of alternative sources of data on the n umber of undocu- mented immigrants in each state. C. Based on all of these data, I estimate the proportion of each state' s population that would be excluded from the enumeration used for apportionment due to the presiden- tial memorandum. I then use the offi cial apportionment table published by the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate the number of congressional seats that states would gain or lose. Finally, I report the uncertainty in all of my analyses. 2010- state.html. For the population counts from 1990- 1999, I used the data available at https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time- series/ demo/popest/intercensal -1990- 2000- state -and-county -totals.html. 344 D. I evaluate the robustness of my findings to a variety o f alternative data sources and mod- eling strategies. I also compare my find- ings to four other independent reports from different research groups. My findings are robust to alternative modeling assumptions and are similar to these other groups ' find- ings. C. Summary of Findings 11. Based on my analysis, I have reached the following conclusions: The exclusion of undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base (i.e., the population enu- meration used for apportionment) is likely to have substantial effects on the population counts of each state, and the apportionment of repre-sentatives across states for th e U.S House of Representatives. It will almost certainly lead Texas to lose a seat in Congress. It is likely to lead California and New Jersey to lose a congressional seat. It also could lead other states, such as Arizona, Florida, New York, or Illinois, to lose seats. These con- clusions are similar across multiple data sources on the prevalence of undocumented immigrants. They are also similar to the conclusions reached by a variety of independent analysts and organ- izations. The exclusion of undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base would affect political representation in Congress. For instance, it is likely to affect the distrib ution of federal funds 345 to each state, and the general power that each state holds in Congress. II. Projecting the State Populations in 2020 12. The first stage of my analysis is to develop baseline projections of the population of each state in the country in 2020. These projections are critical to determining the likely effects of excluding undocu- mented immigrants from the apportionment base. In order to develop these estimates, I use the Cen- sus Bureau 's official estimates of the population of each state from 1990- 2019. The Census Bureau does not provide public estimates of each geo- graphic unit 's populations in future years. 13. In this section, I first discuss several possible ap- proaches for estimating future populations. I show that my preferred approach performs as well or bet-ter at a similar modeling problem than alternative approaches. I then discuss how I incorporate un- certainty into my population projections. Finally, I present estimates of the 2020 population s in each state in the country. A. Data 14. The Census Bureau 's Population Estimates Pro- gram (PEP) produces estimates of the population for the United States, states, counties, cities, tow ns, and other geographic areas. These aggregate es- timates are based on the demo graphic components of population change (births, deaths, and migration) 346 at each level of geography.3 My population projec- tions are based on these official population esti- mates for each state for the period from 1990 -2019.4 B. Statistical Model for Population Projections 15. There are a number of potential options for fore- casting the likely population of each state in 2020. One possible forecasting option would be to allow the forecasts to increase or decrease over time, where the amount of change over time (called the drift) is set to be the average change in the histori- cal data (see Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2018, 48-49). Some related methods in this family of forecasting approaches are: M odel 1: Linear trend between 2010 -2019 : One approach would be to project forward based on the linear trend in the population estimates since the last Census (e.g., Election Data Services 2017). This approach assumes that each geo- graphic unit 's population follows the same linear 3 I do not directly use the more detailed cohort -component method used by the Census for my population projections because this infor- mation is unavailable for some geographic levels, particularly for the 2000- 2010 period. It is also unclear whether the additional com- plexities associated with this approach would yield substantial gains in predictive accuracy. 4 For the state populations from 2010- 2019, I used the file ' nst- est2019- . For the the population counts from 1990- 1999, I used the data available at https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time - series/demo/popest/intercensal -1990- 2000- state -and-county -totals. html. 347 rate of change in t he future that it has followed over the past decade. This approach has the benefit of using many years of data, but it could yield biased estimates if the population trends have changed over this period. I estimate lin- ear trends using a simple linear reg ression model in the software program R. Model 2: Linear trend between 2016 -2019: Another possibility is to project forward based on the linear trend in the population estimates over the past 4 years. This approach assumes that each geographic unit 's population follows the same linear trend in the future that it has followed over this shorter time period. This ap- proach has the benefit of being sensitive to more recent trends, but it could be noisier than esti-mates based on the longer time series. That is, it could be overly sensitive to short -term trends. I estimate linear trends using a simple linear re- gression model in R. Model 3: Change between two most recent years (i.e., 2018 to 2019) : A third possibility is to fo- cus on the change between each geographic unit 's populations in the two most recent years and as- sume that future years will follow this recent trend. This approach has the benefit of being based on the most recent changes in populations, but it could also be overly sensitive to short -term idiosyncratic trends. I estimate these short- term trends using the software program R. 16. As Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018, 50) dis-cusses: \"Sometimes one of these simple methods will be the best forecasting method available; but in 348 many cases, these methods will serve as bench- marks rather than the method of choice. That is, any forecasting methods [] will be compared to these simple methods to ensure that the new method is bet- ter than these simple alternatives. If not, the new method is n ot worth considering. \" I consider one more complex app roach against these benchmarks: Model 4: A state space model with exponential smoothing : This approach uses an exponential smoothing model that weights levels and trends to an extent determined by the data (Hyndman et al. 2008; Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2018). This model uses all of the available data, but it gives more weight to the most recent years. I estimate the exponential smoothing model using the ets function in the forecast package in R. C. Validation of Population Projections 17. The accuracy of forecasting models can only be de-termined by considering how well a given model performs on new data that were not used when fit-ting the original model (Hyndman and Athana- sopoulos 2018, 62). In order to choose the best model for this analysis, I evaluated each model us- ing a benchmark that is similar to the challenge of forecasting the 2020 populations. Specifically, I forecasted the 2019 population estimates in each state based on 1990 -2018 population data. For each analysis I used the following evaluation met-rics (see Hyndman a nd Athanasopoulos 2018, 64 - 65). 349 The mean error across states (ME) : This helps assess whether a given metric has a systematic bias in one direction or another. The root mean -squared error across states (RMSE): This helps assess the accuracy of the forecasts. It penalizes larger errors more than smaller errors. The mean absolute error across states (MAE) : This helps assess the accuracy of the forecasts. It penalizes all errors equally. The mean percentage error across states (MPE): This helps assess whether a given met- ric has a systematic bias in one direction or an- other. It has the advantage of being unit -free (i.e., the interpretation is similar in sm all and large states). The mean absolute percentage error across states (MAPE) : This metric also helps assess the accuracy of the forecasts. It has the ad- vantage of being unit -free (i.e., the interpreta- tion is similar in small and large states). 18. Table 1 shows the results. Overall, the state space model (4) and delta model (3) perform the best in this validation exercise. These models have much less error than the other models across all the met- rics. Other studies have shown that state space 350 mod els generally outperform other modeling ap- proaches due to its flexibility (Hyndman et al. 2008; Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2018). It also pro- vides measures of uncertainty. As a result, I use this approach in my main analysis. I also show be- low, however, that I reach very similar findings us- ing the delta model (3) (see Additional Scenario #6). D. Baseline estimates of 2020 populations 19. The next stage is to use the official Census popula- tion estimates to project each geographic unit's pop- ulation in 2020. Table 2 shows the results.5 Note that all of the analysis of apportionment that follow fully incorporate the uncertainties in these projec-tions. 5 The projections shown here do not include the overseas military population, federal employees, and dependents. However, the ap- portionment projections in Table 6 do include these groups. 351 352 III. Estimating the Overseas Federal Population Allo- cated to each State 20. The population estimates above include all people living in the United States. However, the popula- tions used for apportionment also include overseas federal employees and their dependents. 6 Thus, it is necessary to estimate how overseas federal em-ployees and dependents would be allocated for pur- poses of apportionment. 21. In the 2010 Census, the overseas military popula- tion were generally allocated to their \"home of rec- ord\" (the address provided when the service mem- ber entered the military) for purposes of apportion- ment. 7 For the 2020 Census, however, all overseas federal personnel will be counted at their usual res- idential address in the United States.8 In other words, military personnel will typically be counted as residing in or near the domestic base where they are stationed. Unfortunately, there is no currently available public estimate of how these overseas per- sonnel will be allocated to individual states. The Census Bureau has stated that it plans to count fed- eral personnel living outside the United States, and 6 \"Overseas \" is defined as anywhere outside the 50 U.S. States and the District of Columbia. 7 See the Census Bureau 's FAQ on Congressional Apportionment in the 2010 their dependents living with them outside the United States, using administrative data provided by the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.9 22. I used the following process to estimate the number of overseas federal population that will be allocated to each state for apportionment: First, I estimated the number of military per- sonnel overseas in each branch using data from the Department of Defense from March, 2020.10 Second, I allocated these personnel to each state in proportion to the number of service members in each branch based in each state.11 This ap- proa ch implicitly assumes that each member of the military has an equal probability of being as-signed abroad. While this is clearly a simplifi- cation, I believe it is the most reasonable analyt-ical approach with currently available data. Third, I assumed that military personnel have the same number of dependents (1.44) as they did in the 2010 Census. 12 9 See https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/oia -02052020- census- and-the-military.pdf. 10 I used the that is a vailable from https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/ dwp_reports.jsp. 11 I used the spreadsheet DMDC_Website_Location_Report_2003. xlsx that is available from https://www.dmdc.os d.mil/appj/dwp/dwp_ reports.jsp. 12 I used the \"2010 Census Federally Affiliated Overseas Count Op- eration Assessment Report \" that is available at https://www.census. 354 Finally, I assumed that the overseas federal ci- vilian population is the same as in 2010 (39,674). Since the majority of overseas federal civilian employees are with the State Department, 13 I assume these are all headquarters staff that work in Washington D C. I use ACS Commut- ing Flows from the Census to allocate them be-tween the District of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland. 14 I also assumed that these civilian employees each have 1.44 dependents. Of course, this estimation method has consider-able uncerta inty. So I assumed that there is a standard error associated with my estimates of the overseas federal population for each state that is equal to 10% of the size of the estimates. 23. Based on this methodology, I estimate that there are about 230,000 over seas federal personnel. In- cluding dependents, I estimate there are about 561,000 federal employees and dependents overseas population will be included for purposes of appor-tionment for the 2020 Census. Table 3 shows the state -by-state results. A copy of Table 3 is pro- vided in Appendix A to this Declaration. My esti- mates indicate that California, North Carolina, gov/2010census/pdf/2010_Census_Federally_Af filiated_Overseas_ Count_Operation_Assessment.pdf. 13 See the ' 2010 Census Federally Affiliated Overseas Count Oper- ation Assessment Report ' that is available at https://www.census. gov/20 10census/pdf/2010_Census_Federally_Affiliated_Overs eas_ Count_Operation_Assessment.pdf. 14 98% of people that work in Washington DC live in Maryland, Vir- ginia, or Washington, DC. See https:/ /www.census.gov/data/tables/ 2015/demo/metro -micro/commuting- flows -2015.html. 355 Texas, the larges t overseas fed- eral populations.15 It is important to note that the federal overseas population is down by nea rly 50% since the 2010 Census.16 This likely reflects the re- duction in the nation 's military deployments in con- flict areas over the past decade.17 IV. Estimating the Number of Undocumented Immi- grants in Each State 24. The President 's Memorandum charges the Secre- tary of Commerce to \"exclude from the apportion- ment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\"18 In order to assess the impact of this mem- orandum, we next need to estimat e the number of undocumented immigrants in each state. 25. There is no official estimate from the Census Bu- reau or any other federal government agency of the number of undocumented immigrants in each state that would be affected by the President 's memoran- dum. The most commonly used estimates of the 15 These estimates seem to be in -line with discussions in news cov- erage onal -balance/. 16 I use information on these populations from the 2010 apportion- ment available at https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2010/dec/2010- apportionment -data.html. 17 See Pew 's report on the number of overseas military personnel at https://www.pewres number of undocumented people have been devel- oped by the Pew Research Center.19 There are hundreds of citations in Google Scholar for Pew 's estimates of the number of undocumented immi- grants in the United States. As a result, I use these estimates in my main analysis. However later, I also examine the estimates of the number of undoc- umented immigrants from a number of other organ- izations that use a variety of slightly different meth-odologi es. Each of these analyses yields substan- tively similar conclusion as my main analysis using Pew 's data. 26. Pew estimates the U.S. unauthorized immigrant population from 1995 -2017 in each state based on a residual estimation methodology that compare s a demographic estimate of the number of immigrants residing legally in the country with the total number of immigrants as measured by either the American Community Survey (ACS) or the March Supple-ment to the Current Population Survey (CPS). 20 The difference is assumed to be the number of un- authorized immigrants in the survey, a number that later is adjusted for omissions from the survey (see below). The basic estimate is: Unauthorized Immigrants (U) = Survey, Total Foreign Born (F) Estimated Lawful Immigrant Population (L) 19 See https://www.pewresearch.org/fact -tank/2019/06/12/us - unauthorized -immigrant -population -2017/. 20 The next few paragraphs of this section are adapted from Pew 's discussion of their methodology at https://www.pewresearch.org/ hispanic/2018/11/27/unauthorized -immigration -estimate -methodology/. 357 27. The lawful resident immigrant population was esti- mated by applying demographic methods to counts of lawful admissions covering the period since 1980 obtained from the Department of Homeland Secu- rity's Office of Immigration Statist ics 21 and its pre- decessor at the Immigration and Naturalization Service, with projections to current years, when necessary. Initial estimates were calculated sepa- rately for age -gender groups in six states (Califor- nia, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New Yor k and Texas) and the balance of the country. This resid- ual method has been used in a wide variety of gov- ernment reports and peer reviewed articles (e.g., Baker 2018; Warren and Warren 2013; Passel 2016). 28. The overall estimates for unauthorized immigran ts built on these residuals by adjusting for survey omissions in these six states and the balance of the country, subdivided for Mexican immigrants and other groups of immigrants (balance of Lati n Amer- ica, South and East Asia, rest of world) depending on sample size and state. Once the residual esti- mates were produced, Pew assigned individual foreign - born respondents in the survey a specific status (one option being unauthorized immigrant) based on the individual 's demographic, social, eco- nomic, geographic and family characteristics in numbers that agree with the initial residual esti- mates for the estimated lawful immigrant and unau-thorized immigrant populations in the survey. A 21 See https://www.dhs.gov/immigration -statistics/yearbook/2016/. 358 last step in the weighting -estimation process i n- volves developing state -level estimates that take into account trends over time in the estimates. 29. Overall, Pew estimates there were about 10,481,000 undocumented immigrants in the United States in 2017.22 They estimate that the states with the most un documented immigrants are California, Texas, Florida, New York, and New Jersey. The states with the fewest undocumented immigrants are Maine, Montana, Vermont, and West Virginia. 30. Of course, Pew 's estimation process has substantial uncertainties inhere nt in it. First, there is no way to know that individual respondents to the ACS and CPS are undocumented immigrants. Pew esti- mates undocumented status based on a variety of pieces of information. 23 Second, the ACS and CPS are themselves surveys, subject to sampling error. There could also be misreporting of country of birth on the ACS and/or unit non response by undocu- mented immigrants (Brown et al. 2018). In order to characterize these uncertainties, Pew provides a 90% confidence interval for their est imates of the number of undocumented people in each state. 31. Lastly, Pew 's data of the number of undocumented immigrants in each state between 1995 -2017 need to 22 These estimates seem plausible since the Department of Home- land Security estimated there were 12 million undocumented immi- grants in the country in January 2015 (Baker 2018). They are also similar to estimates of the number of undocumented immigrants de- veloped by other think tanks (see below). 23 See https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2018/11/27/unauthorized - immigration -estimate -methodology/. 359 be pro jected 3 years forward to 2020.24 To deter- mine how to forecast the number of undocumented immigrants in each state, I compared the same four modeling strategies that I discussed earlier for the state population projections. For each method, I used data through 2014 to evaluate its performance at predicting the number of undocument ed immi- grants three years forward in 2017. 32. All of the models generate significant levels of error compared to the population forecasting validation shown above in Table 4. However, the state space model (4) and a linear time trend (2) using the pre- vious four years of data perform somewhat better than the other models. In my main analysis, I use the state space model to project the number of un- documented immigrants in 2020. Moreover, I en- sured that the state space model estimates fully in- corporate the uncertainty in Pew 's estimates in the number of undocumented immigrants (see Treier and Jackman 2 008; Caughey and Warshaw 2018). 25 I checked the robustness of my analysis by showing 24 Pew's data are available at https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/ interactives/unauthorized -trends/. 25 Specifically, I used the following approach. First, I construc ted 100 simulations of the number of undocumented immigrants in each state from 2005- 2017 using Pew 's estimates and the associated con- fidence intervals. For each simulation, I used the state space model to forecast each state 's number of undocumented immigrants in 2020. I then constructed a bootstrap sample of the forecast of un- documented immigrants i n each state based on the mean and confi- dence intervals in the state space model 's population forecast. Fi- nally, I estimated the number of undocumented immigrants in each state in 2020, and its associated standard error to represent uncer- tainty, based on these simulations. 360 that I reach similar substantive conclusions using the linear time trend model (see Additional Scenario #7). 33. Table 5 shows the estimates of the number of undoc-umented immigrants in each state (standard errors that represent uncertainty are in parentheses). A copy of Table 5 is provided in Appendix A to this Declaration. Its shows that California, Florida, Il- linois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas each have at least 400,000 undocumented immigrants. 26 34. These final estimates take into account the uncer- tainty in Pew 's initial estimates of the number of un- documented immigrants from 2005 -2017. They also take into account the uncertainty in projecting the trends in each state from 2017 -2020. In gen- eral, the additional uncertainty associated with forecasting to 2020 approximately triples the size of Pew 's confidence intervals for their estimates of un- documented immigrants in each state in 2017. 26 These state- by-state figures are similar to those in a 2015 De- partment of Homeland Security report, which provided estimates of the number of undocumented immigrants in several states (Baker 2018). 361 A. Incorporating Uncertainty 35. All modeled estimates have uncertainty. My anal- yses uses bootstrap simulations to incorporate three sources of uncertai nty in all my models: The uncertainty in the population forecast s in every state for 2020. The uncertainty in the estimates of the overseas federal employees and dependents, and how they are allocated to states. The uncertainty in the estimate of the number of undocumented immigrants in each state in 2020. V. State -level Effects of Excluding Undocumented Immigrants from Apportionment Base 36. Now that we have calculated population projections and estimates of the number of undocumented im- migrants in each state, we are in a position to esti- mate state -level impacts. A. Effect on State Population Enumerations 37. To begin, I analyzed the effects on the enumerated population of each state in 2020. The results are shown in Table 6. Column (1) of Table 6 shows the baseline apportionment population projections for each state (including the overseas military popula-tion, federal employees, and dependents). Column (2) shows my estimate of the number of undocu-mented immigrants in each state in 2020. Column (3) shows my estimate of the percentage of the ap- portionment population in each state that consists of undocumented immigrants. 362 363 38. Overall, Table 6 indicates that each state would be affected by an exclusion of undocumented immi- grants. Figure 1 shows a map of the percentage of people in each state that would be dropped from the Census apportionment base if undocu mented immi- grants are excluded. Arizona, California, Colo- rado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Mary land, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington would all lose at least 3% of their population from their apportionment base. Thus, they could be at risk of losing a congressional seat during apportionment. B. Effect on Apportionment 39. Next, I used the population projections and esti- mates of undocumented immigrants in each state to examine the likely effect of excluding undocumented immigrants from the Census count on the appor- tionment of seats in the House of Representatives. Article 1, Section 2, of the United States Constitu- tion states: \"Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States 364 which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers. \" 40. Since the first census in 1790, five methods of appor- tionment have been used. The government current ly uses a method called the Method of Equal Propor-tions, which was adopted by Congress in 1941 follow- ing the census of 1940. This method first assigns each state one seat. Then, additional seats in the House of Representatives are assigned to a \"prior- ity\" value. The priority value for each seat is deter- mined by multiplying the population of a state by a \"multiplier. \" The multiplier is . So the formula for calculating the multiplier for the second seat is or 0.70710678, the formula for calculating the multiplier for the third seat is or 0.40824829, and so on. The Census provides an official table of these multipliers, whi ch I used for my calculations. 27 41. The next step is to multiply the multipliers by the population total for each of the 50 states (the Dis- trict of Columbia is not included in these calcula-tions). The resulting numb ers are the priority val- ues. Multipliers and priority values must be calcu- lated for the largest number of seats that could be assigned to a state. In my analysis, I calculated the priority values for each state for seats 2 through 60. The next step is to rank and number the re- sulting priority values starting with seat 51 until all 435 seats have been assigned. The final step is to tally the number of seats for each state to arrive at 27 See https://www.census.gov/populati on/apportionment/about/ computing.html. 365 the total number of seats in the House of Represent- atives apportioned to each state. 42. I conducted these steps for 1,000 simulations of the population projections and undocumented popula- tions in each state. Table 7 shows the results.28 Column (1) shows the rounded, baseline projections for the number of seats that each s tate is likely to receive in 2020 if there is a full population enumer- ation. Column (2) shows the rounded projections for the number of seats that each state is likely to receive in 2020 if undocumented immigrants are ex- cluded from the apportionment base. Column (3) shows the rounded, average change in the number of congressional seats each state would gain or lose due to the exclusion of undocumented immigrants. Finally, column (4) shows the probability that each state would lose at least one seat. 28 Table 12 in the Appendix A shows unrounded numbers for this table. 366 367 43. My analysis indicates that there is a 98% chance that Texas would lose a Congressional seat if undoc- umented immigrants are excluded from the appor-tionment base. It loses a seat in nearly every sin- gle one of my simulations. In addition, my analysis indicates that there is a 72% chance that California would lose a Congressional seat. On average, it loses .83 seats across my simulations (i.e., in most simulations it loses 1 seat, in some it loses 2 seats, and in some it loses zero seats). My analysis als o indicates that there is a 70% chance that New Jer- sey would lose a Congressional seat if undocument ed immigrants are excluded from the apportionment base. There are smaller chances that several other states could lose seats, including Connecticut, Fl or- ida, Illinois, and New York. 29 44. The states that lose seats in Congress would likely see decreases in their share of federal outlays due to their reduction in voting power in Congress. A number of economics and political science studies have found that distributive spending is allocated in part based on the number of seats that a geographic area has in Congress (e.g., Ansolabehere, Gerber, and Snyder 2002; Cascio and Washington and Meredith 2009). For instance, Elis, Malhotra, and Meredith (2009) find that a 10% in- crease in a state 's share of the U.S. House of Rep- resentatives equates to a 0.7% increase in a state's share of the federal budget. This implies that an 29 Note the rounded numbers in Table 7 imply that Florida and New York would lose seats. The unrounded numbers in the Appen- dix (Table 12), however, show that there is a less 50% chance that they would lose a seat. 368 extra congressional seat can gain a state as much as $100 per capit a in additional federal funding (360). VI. Robustness Checks 45. It is always helpful to evaluate the robustness of any analysis to alternative modeling assumptions. In this section, I undertake four different robustness checks. First, I evaluate the impact of using alter- native sources of information on the number of un-documented immigrants in each state on my analy- sis. Second, I evaluate the impact of alternative population forecasting methodologies. Third, I evaluate whet her my conclusions would di ffer if for- mer Census Director John H. Thompson is correct that the exclusion of undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base would cause an under-count of immigrant populations. I used the foreign - born population in the United States to evaluate th e impact of an undercount of immigrants. Fourth, I compare my results to the conclusions of various or- ganizations ' reports on the impact of excluding un- documented immigrants on apportionment. 46. Overall, the analysis in this section shows that my conclus ions are robust to a wide variety of alterna- tive data sources and modeling strategies. They are also consistent with the findings of other organ- izations and analysts. All of these alternative data sources, methodologies, and third -party reports in- dicate that Texas would lose a congressional seat if undocumented immigrants are excluded from the apportionment base. They nearly all indicate that California would lose a seat. They also indicate that some mix of Florida, New Jersey, and New York could lose s eats. 369 A. Robustness to Alternative Estimates of the Number of Un documented Immigrants 47. Due to the substantial uncertainties in Pew 's esti- mates of the number of undocumented people in each state, I conducted a canvass of alternative sources of estimates for the undocumented popula- tion. I identified sever al alternative sources of data: A dditional Scenario 1 : The Migration Policy Institution (MPI) has developed estimates of the number of undocumented people in each state based on the U.S. Census Bureau's 2012- 16 American Community Survey data. 30 They es- timate there are about 11,300,000 undocumented immigrants in the United States. Their na- tional estimate is very similar to Pew 's esti- mate.31 However, their estimates differ more in some states. For instance, MPI estimates that there are about 50% more undocumented immigrants in California than Pew estimates. They do not provide measures of uncertainty for their estimates so I assume that each state has a standard error that is 10% of the state 's point es- timate. A dditional Scenario 2 : The Center for Migra- tion Studies (CMS) has developed estimates of the number of undocumented people in each 30 See https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/us -immigration - policy -program -datahub/unauthorized -immigrant -population -profiles. 31 MPI 's national estimate is about 8% higher than Pew 's esti mate. 370 state in 2018.32 Their methodology is described in two articles that were published in the Jour- nal of Migr ation and Security (Warren 2014, 2019). They estimate there are about 10,543,500 undocumented immigrants in the United States, which is nearly identical to Pew 's national esti- mate.33 They do not provide measures of un- certainty for their estimates so I assume that each state has a standard error that is 10% of the state 's point estimate. Additional Scenario 3 : Third, I examine a sce- nario where the national estimates of the num- ber of undocumented immigrants are somewhat too high. To do this, I simply decrease all of my main estimates using Pew 's data of the number of undocumented immigrants in each state by 20% to examine the effects on apportionment if the Pew, MPI, and CMS estimates of the total number of undocumented immigrants in the United States are all too high. Additional Scenario 4 : Fourth, I examine a scenario where the national estimates of the number of undocumented immigrants are much too high. To do this, I decrease all of my main estimates using Pew 's data on the number of un- documented immigrants in each state by 40%. A dditional Scenario 5 : Finally, I examine a scenario where the national estimates of the 32 Their estimates are available at http://data.cmsny.org/state. html. 33 CMS 's national estimate is about 0.5% higher than Pew 's esti- mate. 371 number of undocumented immigrants are much too low. To do this, I increase all of my main estimates using Pew 's data on the number of un- documented immigrants in each state by 50%. 48. Table 8 compares my main findings (the \"Main Analysis\" column) to analyses based on alternative estimates of the number of undocumented immi-grants. It shows each of the states that at lea st one scenario (including my main analysis) finds has a 33% chance or more of losing a seat if undocu- mented immigrants are excluded from the appor-tionment base. For each of these states, it shows the probability that my analysis indicates the state would lose a seat and the probability it would lose a seat under the various alternative scenarios. 49. Overall, all of these analyses yield substantively similar results as my main analysis. In each sce- nario, Texas has more than 95% chance of losing a congres sional seat if un documented immigrants are excluded from the apportionment base. Moreover, in all of the additional scenarios but one, California has about a 50% chance or more of losing a congres-sional seat. There is also a significant chance that Florida, New Jersey, and New York could lose a seat in most of the scenarios. B. Robustness to Alternative Modeling Approaches 50. As I discussed above, there are a number of alter-native approaches we could use to project the 2020 populations and estimates of undocumented immi- grants in each state. In this section, I discuss al- ternative forecasting methodologies for each of these: 372 Additional Scenario 6 : For the population fore- casts of each state in 2020, I use a forecasting methodology based on the delt as in the two most recent years. In Table 1, I found that this ap- proach was roughly equivalent to the state space model. The state space model is preferable be- cause it is more flexible and provides a measure of uncertainty. Additional Scenario 7 : For the forecasts of the number of undocumented immigrants in each state in 2020 based on Pew 's data, I use a meth- odology based on a linear time trends over the four most recent years. In Table 4, I found that this approach performed nearly as well as the state space model. The state space model is preferable because it is more flexible and re- quires fewer assumptions about future time trends. 51. Both of these alternative -modeling strategies pro- duce similar results as my main results (Table 9). In each s cenario, Texas is nearly certain to lose a seat. California and New Jersey are likely to lose seats in each scenario. Florida and New York also have significant chances of losing a seat in each sce- nario. 373 C. Robustness to a Possible Census Undercount 52. The testimony of the former U.S. Census Bureau Director, John H. Thompson, to Congress on July 29, 2020 raises the possibility that the president 's memorandum could lead to nonresponse to the Cen- sus by hard -to-count populations, including nonciti- zens and immigrants.34 This, in turn, could lead the Census to undercount foreign -born people. It is possible that planned reductions in door -to-door canvassing due to COVID -19 could lead to a further unde rcount of foreign -born people.35 53. In this section, I examine whether an undercount of foreign -born people would affect my findings about the effects of excluding undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base. I use my estimates from New York Immigration Coalition et al v. United States Department of C ommerce , No. 18 -CV-2921- JMF (S.D. NY) of the number of foreign -born peo- ple in each state. I then assess the consequences of a scenario with a 10% undercount of foreign -born people using the same methodology that I use in my main analyses. I am adopting m y declaration pro- vided in that matter by reference and include a copy in Appendix B. 34 See Statement of John H Thompson, Former Director U. S. Cen- sus Bureau (August 2013- June 2017), For the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, U.S. House of Representatives, July 29, 2020 https://tinyurl.com/y67ojjqb. 35 See https://www.npr.org/2020/07/30/896656747/when -early.html. 374 54. Table 10 compares my main findings to the results of this undercount scenario. It shows each state that my analysis indicates has a significant chance of losing a seat if undocumented immigrants are ex- cluded from the apportionment base. Once again, in this scenario Texas is likely to lose a congres- sional seat if undocumented immigrants are ex- cluded from the apportionment base. California and New Jersey are also li kely to lose congressional seats. D. Comparison with Other Organizations ' Analyses 55. There have been a number of studies and reports by various organizations estimating how excluding un- documented immigrants would a ffect apportion- ment. These include: The Pew Research Center36 The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)37 36 12/camarota - apportionment -12-19_1.pdf. 375 The Center for Politics at the University of Vir - ginia (CfP)38 A peer reviewed academic study published in 2019 (Baumle and Poston Jr 2019). 56. Table 11 compares my main findings to the results of these studies. It shows each state that at least one study finds would lose a seat if undocumented immigrants are excluded from the apportionment base. For each of these states, it shows t he proba- bility that my analysis indicat es the state would lose a seat and an X for each of the other studies that shows it would lose a seat. 57. Overall, each of these four other studies reaches substantively similar conclusions as the ones in this Declaration. They all conclude that Californ ia and Texas would lose congressional seats if undocu- mented immigrants are excluded from the appor-tionment base. They also find a mix of other states 38 See http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/a rticles/excluding - undocumented -immigrants -from -the-2020 -u-s- house -apportionment/. 376 that might lose seats, including Arizona, Florida, New Jersey, and New York. VII. Conclusion 58. Based on the analyses in this Declaration, I con- clude that failing to count undocumented immi- grants for apportionment is likely to have effects on the population counts of each state, and the appor- tionment of representatives across states for the U.S. House. Texa s is nearly certain to lose a con- gressional seat. California and New Jersey are very likely to each lose a congressional seat. Other states, such as Florida and New York could lose seats as well. This would affect political represen- tation in Congress. For instance, it is likely to af- fect the distribution of federal funds to each state, and the general power that each state holds in Con- gress.

II. Projecting Future Populations 8. The first stage of my analysis is to develop baseline projections of the population of each state, county, and city in the country in 2020. These projections are critical to determining the likely effects of an undercount in the Census due to the inclusion of a citizenship question. In order to develop these es- timates, I use the Census 's official estimates of the population of each state, county, and city from 2000 - 2017. The Census does not provide public esti- mates of each geographic unit 's populations in fu- ture years. A. Data 9. The Census Bureau 's Population Estimates Pro- gram (PEP) produces estimates of the population for the United States, states, counties, cities, towns, 386 and other geographic areas. These aggregate es- timates are based on the demographic components of population change (births, deaths, and migrati on) at each level of geography.1 10. My population projections are based on these offi- cial population estimates for each state, county, and city for the period from 2000 -2017. 11. For the state populations from 2010 -2017, I used the file 'nst- est2017- 01.xlsx ' which I obtained from https:// www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/state - total.html. For the populations from 2000- 2009, I used the file 'st-est00int 12. For the county populations from 2010 -2017, I used the file ' co-est2017- alldata.csv ' from https://www. census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/counties - total.html. For the populations from 2000- 2009, I used the file ' For the count y populations from 2010 -2017, I used the file ' co-est2017- alldata.csv ' from https://www. census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/counties - total.html. For the populations from 2000- 2009, I used the file ' co-est00int -tot.csv ' from https://www. 1 I do not directly use the more detailed cohort -component method used by the Census for my population projections because this infor- mation is unavailable for some geographic levels, particularly for the 2000- 2010 period. It is also unclear whether the additional complex- ities associated with this approach would yield substantial gains in predict ive accuracy. 387 census.gov/da ta/tables/time -series/demo/popest/ intercensal -2000 city populations from 2010 -2017, I used the data in Factfinder available from https://www.census. gov/data/tables/2017/d emo/popest/total -cities -and- towns.html. For the populations from 2000 -2009, I used the file ' sub-est00int.csv -series/demo/popest/ intercensal -2000 -2010- cities -and-towns.html. B. Statistical Model for Population Projections 15. There are a number of pote ntial options for fore- casting the likely population of a geographic unit (e.g., states) in 2020. One possible forecasting op- tion would be to allow the forecasts to increase or decrease over time, where the amount of change over time (called the drift) is set to be the average change in the historical data. See Hyndman and Athanasopoulos 2018, at 48-49. Some related methods in this family of forecasting approaches are: a. Linear trend between 2010 -2017: One possibility is to project forward based on the linear trend in the population esti-mates since the last Census (e.g., Election Data Services 2017). This approach as- sumes that each geographic unit 's popula- tion follows the same linear rate of change in the future that it has followed over the past de cade. This approach has the ben- efit of using many years of data, but it could yield biased estimates if the popula- tion trends have changed over this period. 388 I estimate linear trends using a simple lin- ear regression model in the software pro- gram R. b. Linear trend between 2014 -2017 : An- other possibility is to project forward based on the linear trend in the population estimates over the past 4 years. This ap- proach assumes that each geographic unit 's population follows the same linear trend in the future that it has followed over this shorter time period. This approach has the benefit of being sensitive to more re-cent trends, but it could be noisier than es- timates based on the longer time series. That is, it could be overly sensitive to short -term trends. I estimate linear trends using a simple linear regression model in R. c. Change between two most recent years (i.e., 2016 to 2017) : A third possibility is to focus on the change between each geo-graphic unit 's populations in the two most recent years, and assume that future years will follow this recent trend. This ap- proach has the benefit of being based on the most recent changes in populations, but it could also be overly sensitive to short - term idiosyncratic trends. I estimate these short -term trends using the soft- ware program R. 16. As Hyndman and Athanasopoulos discuss, \"Some- times one of these simple methods will be the best forecasting method available; but in many cases, 389 these methods will serve as benchmarks rather than the method of choice. That is, any forecasting methods . . . will be compared to these simple methods to ensure that the new method is better than these simple alternatives. If not, the new method is not worth considering. \" Id. at 50. 17. I consider one more complex approach against these benchmarks, a state space model with exponential smoothing: This approach uses an exponential smoothing model that weights levels and trends to an extent determined by the data. See Hyndman and Athanasopoulos. This model uses all of the available data, but it gives more weight to the most recent years. I estimate the exponential smooth- ing model using the ets function in the forecast package in R. 2 C. Validation of Population Projections 18. The accuracy of forecasting models can only be de- termined by considering how well a given model performs on new data that were not used when fit-ting the original model. Id. at 62. In order to choose the best model for this analysis, I evaluated each mode l using two benchmarks that are similar to the challenge of forecasting the 2020 populations. 2 For my state -level population projections, I used the default pa- rameters for the ets function in R, which allowed the function to choose the exponential smoothing state space model that best fit the data in each state. The best model was usually an ' MAN ' or 'AAN ' model. For the population projections for cities and counties, I es- timated an ' MAN ' state space model using the ets function. The de- tails of the state space model specification, however, do not affect any of m y substantive conclusions. All of the state space mod els yield very similar results. 390 First, I forecasted the Census 2010 population in each state based on 2000 -2007 population estimates data. Second, I forecasted the 2017 population es- timates in each state based on 2007 -2014 population data. For each analysis, I used the following eval- uation metrics. Id. at 64-65. a. The mean error across states: This helps assess whether a given metric has a sys- tematic bias in one direction or another. b. The mean absolute error across states: This helps assess the accuracy of the fore- casts. c. The mean absolute proportional error across states: This metric also helps as- sess the accuracy of the forecasts. It has the advantage of being unit -free (i.e., the interpretation is similar in small and large states). 19. Table 1 shows the results. For the forecast of the 2010 population, the state space model performs the best, with the lowest error, the second lowest mean absolute error, and the lowest absolute proportional errors. The two linear trend models perform the worst on this forecasting exercise. For the fore- cast of the 2017 population, the state space model and the linear trend model using data from 2010 - 2017 perform the best. The state spa ce model has slightly lower mean errors, and the two models have similar mean absolute errors and absolute propor- tional errors. 391 20. Overall, the state space model performs the best across the two validation exercises. It has an av- erage absolute proport ional error of only .8% and an average absolute error of only about 40,000 people in each state. As a result, I use the state space model as my main forecasting model to generate popula- tion projections. However, the results of all the analyses that follo w would be substantively similar using any of these population forecasting ap- proaches. D. Incorporating Uncertainty 21. All modeled estimates have uncertainty. My anal- yses use bootstrap simulations to incorporate two sources of uncertainty in all my models: The uncertainty in the population forecasts in every geographic unit W here available, uncertainty in the under- count estimates for each group E. Baseline estimates of 2020 populations with no undercount 22. I used the official Census population estimates to project each geographic unit 's population in 2020. Table 2 shows the population projections for a selec- 392 tion of cities and counties involved in lawsuits re- garding the citizenship question. Table 3 shows the population projections f or each state.3 All of the analysis of apportionment that follows fully in- corporates the uncertainties in the projections dis- cussed above. But for simplicity, the tables them selves do not show the uncertainties. 3 The projections shown here do not include the overseas military population, federal employees, and dependents. However, the ap- portionment projections in Table 5 do include these groups. 393 394 III. Estimating Proportion of People Likely to be Un- dercounted Due to Citizenship Question 23. I was not asked to and I did not attempt to calculate the specific undercount that the addition of the citi- zenship question might cause. However, I evalu- ated a range of potential undercounts of individuals who live in households with at least one non -citizen, Hispanics or foreign -born member to demonstrate the potential effects that the addition of the citizen-ship question might have. Theory indicates that the addition of a citizenship question could lead to unit non -response, which occurs when a household does not respond to the Census, thereby depressing response rates among non -citizens and immigrant communities. Indeed, the Census acknowledges that it is \"a reasonable inference that a questi on on citizenship would lead to some decline in overall self-response because it would make the 2020 Cen- sus modestly more burdensome in the direct sense, and potentially much more burdensome in the indi- rect sense that it would lead to a larger decline in self-response for noncitizen households. \" (Abowd 2018, Section B2, p. AR 001281) 24. In my analysis, I use this information to look at three potential undercount scenarios: a. First, I used a 5.8% undercount estimate based on the results of the Census Bu- reau 's internal study of the effect of a citi- zenship question on self -response rates. For these analyses, I assumed that re- spondents that do not self-respond would not be enumerated. 395 b. Second, I was asked by legal counsel to ex- amine a potential 10% undercount for the analysis of state -level apportionment as an outer bound for the potential effects of the citizenship question on population enumer- ations and apportionment. This high er number reflects the Census 's finding that the differences between citizen and noncit- izen response rates and data quality are likely to be \"amplified \" compared to histor i- cal levels (Abowd 2018, Section B4, p. AR 001282). The Chief Scientist at the Cen- sus has acknowledged that the 5.8% esti-mate of the effect of the citizenship ques- tion on self -response rates is \"a conserva- tive estimate of the differential impact of the citizenship question on the self -re- sponse rates of noncitizens compared to citizens \" (Abowd, J. Dep., Aug. 15, 2018, p. 202). c. Third, I was ask ed by legal counsel to ex- amine a potential 2% undercount as a lower bound for the potential effects of the citizenship question on population enu- merations. My report shows the results for cities an d counties, and the calculations for a 2% undercount in states are PX -324. I was not asked to and I did not do any analysis of the impact of the Census Bu- reau 's Non -Response Follow -Up (\"NRFU \") on non -response rates, but note that the 2% scenario could be vi ewed as taking into account some NRFU success after an ini- tial larger nonresponse rate. 396 25. The recent Census Bureau studies discussed above focus largely on the effects of a citizenship question on self -response rates in non -citizen households. As a result, the first set of analyses I conducted for each of these undercount scenarios focuses on peo- ple in households with a non- citizen in them. Be- yond the effects on non -citizen households, there are also strong theoretical reasons to believe that citize n Hispanics would also be less likely to re- spond to the Census if a citizenship question is in-cluded. Citizen Hispanics in immigrant communi- ties could fear deportation due to their Census re- sponses. 4 Moreover, a large fraction of citizen His- panics are likely to know non -citizens or even people that have been deported. The Census 's internal analysis has shown that citizenship -related ques- tions are likely to be more sensitive for Hispanics (Brown et al. 2018, p. 10). Indeed, the Census has found clear e vidence there are likely to be differen- tial impacts on self -response rates among Hispanics from the addition of a citizenship question. His- panics have a greater breakoff rate (i.e., item non - response) on the citizenship question on the Ameri- can Community Survey (ACS) than other demo- graphic groups.5 There is also evidence of growing unit nonresponse rates among Hispanics on the ACS (Brown et al. 2018, p. 12). For these reasons, 4 Title 13, U.S.C. prohibits the use of Census data for enforcement purposes, but respondents may still have this concern (Brown et al. 2018). 5 See Abowd (2018, Section b3) and Brown et al. (2018, 7). 397 I analyzed the effect of all three undercount scenar- ios (2%, 5.8% and 10%) on both people in noncitizen households and citizen Hispanics. A. Undercount Estimate Based on Original Sur- vey Experiment 26. An empirical approach to determine the potential undercount caused by a citizenship question is through a randomized control trial (RCT). The Census Bu- reau suggests that an appropriate RCT could com- pare self -response rates between households \" ran- domly chosen to have [] a citizenship question (the treated group), and a randomly chosen set of control househo lds [that] receive a [] Census questionnaire without citizenship\" (Brown et al. 2018, p. 39) 27. We were unable to conduct a real -world RCT. A similar approach, however, is to conduct an experi- ment that mimics an RCT on a nationally repre- sentative survey of Americans. As part of this case, the State of New York and other plaintiffs funded a nationally representative survey that in- cluded an experiment along these lines to examine whether the inclusion of a citizenship question would reduce the likelihood t hat pe ople would com- plete the Census. 6 This survey was designed by 6 As part of my work as an expert in this matter, I reviewed Pro- fessor Barreto 's expert report that describes the survey methodol- ogy and his analysis of the results. However, I ran all of the anal- yses of the survey used in this report myself. I did not directly use any of Professor Barret o's findings for my report. 398 Dr. Matt Barreto and conduc ted by Pacific Market Research.7 1. Design of Survey 28. This survey included a probability sample of 6,309 people, including over -samples of Hispanics, Cali- fornians, and people in several cities and counties (San Jose, CA, Cameron Count y, TX, and Hidalgo County, TX). 8 It was conducted via phone by Pa- cific Research Group to both landlines and cell phones using live interviews and random digit dial-ing. The survey asked a number of questions about the Census and assessed reactions to the in-clusion of a citizenship question. The survey did not include a question about the citizenship of re- spondents. But it did include a question about whether respondents w ere born in the United States or a foreign country. 29. In my analysis, I focus on an experiment embedded in the survey that mimics the RCT approach sug- gested by Brown et al. (2018). This enables us to estimate the causal effect of the citizenship questio n on the likelihood that various demographic sub- groups will complete the Census. 30. In the experiment on our survey, the control group received a vignette stating that the government had decided not to include a citizenship question on the census, while the treatment group received a vi- gnette stating that the government had decided to 7 Data and statistical code to replicate my analysis of this survey is availab le in my replication materials. 8 The survey includes sampling weights that incorporate these over- samples and make the results representative at the national -level. 399 include a citizenship question on the census. Then the survey asked whether respondents would 'par- ticipate and fill out the 2020 Census form, or not? ' Control Group : Now t hat you 've heard a little bit about the 2020 Census let me ask you one final question about how likely you are to participate. If the govern- ment decides in 2020 to NOT include a question about citizenship status, and instead only asks you to report the ra ce, ethnic background, gender of people living in your household, and the government provides assur- ances that your information will be kept confidential and ONLY used for purposes of counting the total popula- tion and nothing more, would you participate and fill out the 2020 Census form, or not? Treatment Group : Now that you 've heard a little bit about the 2020 Census let me ask you one final question about how likely you are to participate. If the govern- ment decides in 2020 to include a question about cit izen- ship status, and asks you to report the race, ethnic back-ground, gender and citizenship status of people living in your household, and the government provides assur- ances that your information will be kept confidential and ONLY used for purposes of coun ting the total popula- tion and nothing more, would you participate and fill out the 2020 Census form, or not? 31. This experimental design is a strong one for as- sessing the causal effect of the citizenship question on the likelihood that people will complet e the Cen- sus. However, it does have limitations. First, the experiment on the survey imperfectly captures the actual experience of completing the Census. Sec- ond, many respondents are probably already aware of the potential inclusion of the citizenship q uestion 400 on the Census, which could lead to Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) violations. These SUTVA violations could attenuate the effects we detect in the experiment by artificially reducing the differences between the treatment and control groups. Overall, I think these li mitations mean the survey -based analysis is conservative in its esti- mates of the citizenship question on self -response rates on the Census. 2. Results of Survey 32. My primary analyses focus on two immigrant com- munities that theory indicates are particularly likely to be impacted by the citizenship question. First, I analyze the impact on Latinos.9 This anal- ysis is helpful because there is little publicly availa-ble Census analysis of the potential effects of the citize nship question on this group. Second, I ana- lyze the impact on non-Latino people that are not born in the United States. 10 33. I ran three sets of analyses that are shown in Table 4. My primary analysis of the effect of the citizen- ship question on each gro up is a weighted regres- sion that evaluates the treatment effect of the citi- zenship question. In other words, it evaluates whether people in the treatment group, that were told the Census would include a citizenship ques-tion, are less likely to indicate th ey would respond 9 Note that I use the terms Hispanic and Latino interchangeably throughout this declaration. 10 I include in this group both people that explicitly stated they were born in a foreign country and the small number of people that refused to an swer the nativity question on the survey. 401 to the Census than people in the control group that were told it would not include a citizenship question. 34. As robustness checks, I also ran two additional mod-els. The middle column of Table 4 for each group is a weighted regression model that includes control variables for other factors that might affect re- spondents ' willingness to complete the Census, in- cluding their age, race, and state of residence. The third column of Table 4 for each group is an un-weighted regression model that includes this same set of control variables for other factors that might affect respondents ' willingness to complete the Cen- sus. All of my main analyses in the results below are based on linear probability models. However, logistic regression models yield similar results. 35. Overall, Table 4 shows that the citizenship question makes both Latinos and Foreign -born non-Latinos less likely to respond to the Census. The weighted regression model in column (1) indicates that Lati- nos are about 5.9% less likel y to complete the Cen- sus if it includes a citizenship question. The re- sults are similar in the other two models shown in columns (2) and (3). For foreign -born, non -Latinos, the weighted regression in column (4) indicates that they are about 11.3% less li kely to complete the Census if it includes a citizenship question. The results are substantively similar, though more sta- tistically significant, in the other two model s shown in columns (5) and (6). 402 IV. Baseline Estimates of Proportion of Population in Immigrant Communities Vulnerable to Undercount 36. In order to analyze the effects of an undercount of individuals that live in households with at least one non-citizen and Hispanic on total population enu- merations, I used the American Community Survey (ACS) to generate baseline estimates of the propor- tion of the 2020 population in each state, county, and large city in the following groups that are vulnera-ble to an undercount: Non -citizen households (based on whether any member of a household in the ACS self-repor ts that they are a noncitizen) 11 11 It is important to note that the Census has found that the ACS might be drastically undercounting the number of households with noncitizens. The ACS implies that about 10% of people live in house- holds with a noncitizen in them. However, Census Bureau found that many people may be misreporting their citizenship status on the 403 All Hispanics and citizen Hispanics Foreign -born, non -Hispanics 37. To forecast the population margins of each group within each state (e.g., percent Hispanic), I used the individual -level data in the Americ an Community Survey (ACS) from 2007 -2016 to forecast the 2020 population distributions using the same approach that I used to forecast state populations. Individual - level data in the ACS is not readily available below the state -level (e.g., for counties and cities). As a result, I used population tables published by the Census based on the five- year ACS samples (2012 - 2016) to estimate the demographic distributi ons within counties and cities. 12 I did not attempt to estimate how these substate population d istribu- tions are likely to change between 2016 and 2020. Thus, my estimates of the percentage of county and city population that are members of immigrant com- munities are probably low due to the general growth of these populations. ACS. Based on administrative records, they estimate that 28.6 per- cent of all households could potentially contain at least one nonciti- zen. So my estimate of the percentage of people that reside in households with a noncitizen based on the ACS is likely conservative. 12 For the selection of cities and counties in Tables 2, 7, and 8, I converted the number of non- citizens to the number of people in households with a non -citizen using the ratio of these groups in the individual - level 5 -year ACS sample (2012 -16) for people in the PU- MAs that overlapped each city and county. This analysis is neces- sarily approximate since PUMAs in the ACS micro -data contain multiple cities and counties. 404 A. State -level Effects of Undercount \u2014Effect of Undercount on State Population Enumera- tions 38. I analyzed the effects of each undercount scenario on the enumerated population of each state in 2020. The results are shown in Table 5. Column (1) shows the baseline apportionment population projections for each state. Column (2) shows the average change in the enumerated population if 5.8% of people in non-citizen ho useholds are not counted due to the citizenship question. Column (3) shows the average change in the enumerated popu lation if 5.8% of non - citizen households and Hispanics are not counted due to the citizenship question. Column (4) shows the average change in the enumerated population if 10% of people in non -citizen households are not counted due to the citizenship quest ion. Column (5) shows the average change in the enumerated population if 10% of non -citizen households and His- panics are not counted due to the citizenship ques- tion. Column (6) shows the average change in the enumerated population in each state based on the results of the survey experiment. Specifically, this scenario assumes that 5.9% of Hispanics and 11.3% of foreign -born, non-Latinos are not counted in the enumerated population. 39. For the analysis of apportionment, I also incorpo- rated estimates of the overseas military population and federal employees, and their dependents living with them. Specifically, I used the 2010 population figures for the overseas military population and fed-eral employees, and their dependents living with them, for each sta te, and divided this number by 405 half to approximately reflect the reduction in the na- tion's military deployments over the past decade. See https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2010/dec/2010 - apportionment -data.html, for 2010 population fig- for more information on the reduction in the number of overseas military personnel over the past decade. 406 40. Overall, Table 5 indicates that each state would be affected by an undercount on the Census. The largest impacts would be in states with large num-bers of Hispanics, non -Citizens, and foreign -born residents. For example, California would be un- dercounted b y 1.7 -5.0% in these scenarios; Florida would be undercounted by 1 -3.4%; New Jersey would be undercounted by 1.2-3.3%, New York would be undercounted by 1.2 -3.2%; and Texas would be undercounted by 1.3 -4.6%. 41. Figure 1 shows a map of the results from the survey experiment (column 6 in Table 5). This map graphically shows that heavily Latino states on the southern border have the largest impacts from an undercount. States in the northeast, such as New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, with signifi- cant foreign -born populations also have significant impacts. 407 42. I used the population projections and estimated ef- fects of the various undercount scenarios on the enumerated population of each state to examine the likely effect of the citizenship question on the appor- tionment of seats in the House of Representatives. Article 1, Section 2, of the United States Constitu- tion states: \"Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers. \" 43. Since the first census in 1790, five methods of ap por- tionment have been used. The government cur- rently uses a method called the Method of Equal Pro-portions , which was adopted by Congress in 1941 following the census of 1940. This method first as- signs each state one seat. Then, additional seats in the House of Representatives are signed to a \"pri- ority \" value. The priority value for each seat is de- termined by multiplying the population of a state by a \"multiplier. \" The multiplier is . So the formula for calculating the multiplier for the second seat is or 0.70710678, the formula for calculating the multiplier for the third seat is or 0.40824829, and so on. The Cens us provides an official table of these mul- tipliers, whi ch I used for my calculations. 13 44. The next step is to multiply the multipliers by the population total for each of the 50 states (the Dis- trict of Columbia is not included in these calcula- 13 See https://www.census.gov/population/apportionment/about/ computing.html. 408 tions). The resulting numbers are the priority val- ues. Multipliers and priority values must be calcu- lated for the largest number of seats that could be assigned to a state. In my analysis, I calculated the priority values for each state for seats 2 through 60. The next step is to rank and number the re- sulting priority values starting with seat 51 until all 435 seats have been assigned. The final step is to tally the number of seats for each state to arrive at the total number of seats in the House of Represent- atives apportioned to each state. 45. I conducted these steps for 500 simulations of the population projections and undercount scenarios in each state. Table 6 shows the results. Column (1) shows the baseline projections for the number of seats that each state is likely to receive in 2020 if there is a full population enumeration. Column (2) shows the average change in the number of congres-sional seats if 5.8% of people in non -citizen house- holds are not counted due to the citizenship ques-tion. Column (3 ) shows the average change in seats if 5.8% of non -citizen households and Hispan- ics are not counted due to the citizenship question. Column (4) shows the average change in seats if 10% of people in non -citizen households are not counted due to the citizen ship question. Column (5) shows the average change if 10% of non -citizen households and Hispanics are not counted due to the citizenship question. Column (6) shows the average change in seats in each state based on the results of the survey experiment. Specifically, this scenario assumes that 5.9% of Hispanics and 11.3% of foreign -born, non-Latinos are not counted in the pop-409 ulations. Also, each column includes 95% confi- dence intervals for the seat projections in parenthe- ses. This means that there is a 95% chance that the true number of seats gained or lost in each sce- nario will be in this range. 46. First, we can examine Columns (2) and (3) of Table 6, which show the effects of a 5.8% undercount of people in non -citizens households and Hispan ics. In these scenarios, California is extremely likely to lose a seat. Additionally, if there is an undercount of 5.8% of both people in non -citizen households and Hispanics, there is more than a 51% chance that Texas will lose a seat. There is also a risk that Ar- izona, Florida, Illinois, and New York could lose seats in some simulations. 47. Columns (4) and (5) of Table 6 show the effects of a 10% undercount of non- citizen households and His- panics. If only people in non -citizen households are undercou nted, California and Texas would be more likely than not to lose a seat. Arizona, Flor- ida, Illinois, and New York would also be at risk of losing seats. If both non -citizens and Hispanics are undercounted, Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas would be likely to lose seats. Illinois and New York would also be at risk of losing a seat. 410 411 48. Column (6) shows the effects of the undercount of Hispanics and foreign -born residents found in the survey experiment. In this scenario, California, Florida, an d Texas would most likely all lose seats. Arizona, Illinois, and New York could lose a seat as well. 49. The states that lose seats in Congress would likely see decreases in their share of outlays of federal funding due to their reduction in voting power in Congress. See Elis, Malhotra, and Meredith 2009 (PX-325). The Elis article attached here is just an example. It is a well -established finding in politi- cal science and political economy that the l oss of po- litical power as a result of the loss of representation leads to the loss of funding. This finding is based on a body of research showing that counties in areas of states that were underrepresented in state legis- latures or Congress due to malappo rtionment re- ceived substantially lower shares of distributive spending. In the wake of the Baker v. Carr family of Supreme Court cases that required one -person, one-vote, counties that were underrepresented due to malapportionment saw both their represent ation in legislatures and their share of spending increase substantially when the equal populace district re- quirement was implemented. See Ansolabehere, Gerber, and Snyder 2002 (PX -326). Additionally, it is also based on another body of research compar- ing states that barely gain or lose Representatives in Congress. See PX-325. The census thresholds sometimes are quite close where a state could gain or lose seats. So this research compares those states that are just above and below the population thresh-olds to gain or lose a seat, and it has found that the 412 states that just barely gain a seat receive more money than the states that barely lose a seat. B. City and County Effects of Undercount 50. I also examined the effects of the various under- count scenarios for cities and counties. Irrespec- tive of state -level impacts on apportionment, the enumeration of subnational areas is crucially im- portant for a number of purposes. It affects the distribution of federal and state funds that are tied to population formulas. In addition, it affects the allocation of legislative seats within states since leg- islative districts are required to be equipopulous. 51. This allocation of voting power within states, in turn, affects distributive spending programs influ- enced by the legislature. See PX-326. Areas with greater population enumerations, and thus more voting power, are likely to receive more funding. This article is just another example of this well -es- tablished finding in political science. There is a large body of political science research concluding that vote dilution due to malapportionment leads to a reduction in voting power and less distributive spending. 52. It is reasonable to assume that undercounts like those addressed in my report will more likel y than not impact intrastate redistricting because there is no reason to think that a state legislature would cor- rect an undercount on the Census. I think it 's a rea- sonable assumption that state governments would not consciously try to remedy an undercount. 413 53. Table 7 shows the impact on the counties and cities that are involved in the lawsuits regarding the citi- zenship question. The left column shows the base- line 2020 population projection. It also shows the absolute change in population and percentage change in the geographic unit 's population due to three un- dercount scenarios. First, I examine a 2% under- count scenario. Second, I examine a 5.8% under- count scenario. For each of these scenarios, I ex- amine und ercounts among people in non -citizen households and among noncitizens households + Hispanics. Finally, I examine a scenario based on the results of the survey experiment. 54. Table 7 shows the effects on a selection of cities and counties involved in the lawsuits regarding the citi- zenship question. All of these local governments would most likely face smaller population enumera- tions due to an undercount from the addition of a citizenship question. Some of the largest effects would be in Miami, F L, New Yo rk, NY, Central Falls, RI, and Providence RI. In the survey exper- iment scenario (right -hand column), each of these cities could see a reduction of around 4% or more in their enumerated populations. 414 55. The three Texas counties would also face particu- larly negative impacts. Each of these heavily La- tino counties could have a reduction in their enu- merated populations of over 5%. 56. Figure 2 shows the reduction in the enumerated population for every county in the country based on the survey exper iment (last column of Table 7). It shows that the largest effects are in counties on the southern border, the California coast, and in the re-gion around New York City. The counties and cit- ies that are plaintiffs in this suit are labeled on the graph. All of these geographic units are in the most heavily impacted areas of the country. 415 57. Table 8 shows the change in each area 's share of its state population due to the undercount. This sta- tistic is important for estimating the potential ef- fects of the undercount on state -level formula grants, as well as on the relative voting power of each geo-graphic area in congressional and state legislative elections. Geographic areas that see a reduction in their share of the state population are likely to get less representation in Congress and their state leg- islature. This reduction in voting power is likely to lead to less distributive spending. See PX-326. As stated before, this article is just an example. There is a large body of political science research that finds localities have their vote diluted because they are malapportioned. This implies that if the enumerated populations used for redistricting are smaller than their actual populations, then this re- duction in voting power is very likely to lead to less distributive spending. 416 58. Table 8 shows the relative change in each area 's pop- ulation using three undercount scenarios. First, I examine a 2% undercount scenario. Second, I ex- amine a 5.8% undercount assumption. For each of these scenarios, I exa mine undercounts among peo- ple in non -citizen households and among non -citi- zens households + Hispanics. Finally, I examine a scenario based on the results of the survey I dis- cussed in depth above. 59. Under nearly every scenario, each of the cities and counties would face declines in their share of their respective state populations due to an undercount from the citizenship question. Once again, some of the largest effects would be in Miami, FL, New York, NY, Central Falls, RI, Providence RI, and the three Texas counties. Each of these areas would have a reduction in their 'relative populations ' (i.e., 417 share of the state population) of several percentage points based on the survey experiment. V. Aggregate Effects on Share of Population in Differ- ent Types of Counties 60. I examined the macro effects of an undercount due to the addition of a citizenship question on the dis- tribution of the enumerated population across ur-ban and rural areas. For simplicity, I use the sur- vey estimates on foreign -born people and Hispanics. But the results are broadly similar for other under- count scenarios. 14 The best available definition of urban and rural areas is based on a classification system developed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).15 This classification system is often used to study the associations between the ur- banization level of residence and health and to mon- itor the health of urban and rural residents. NCHS has developed a six -level urban -rural classification scheme for U.S. counties and county -equivalent en- tities. The most urban category consists of \" cen- tral\" counties of large metropolitan areas and the most rural category consists of nonmetropolitan \"noncore \" counties. Figure 3 shows a map of the NCHS classification scheme. 14 For confidentiality reasons, it is not possible to match the ACS micro -data to smaller cities and counties. So, for this analysis, I cal- culated the ratio of people in non -citizen households to individual non-citizens for each state in the 2016 ACS. I then multiplied these ratios by the estimates of the number of non-citizens in each city and county to estimate the number of people in hous eholds with a non - citizen. 15 See https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm. 418 61. Figure 3 shows that an undercount due to a citizen- ship question would have the most substantial im- pact in large metropolitan counties with major cit- ies. Based on the survey experiment, these coun- ties would have a reduction in their enumerated pop-ulation of 2.9%. 16 This group of counties would also have a reduction in their share of the national pop-ulation of 1.1%. This reduction in urban areas ' rel- ative population would likely lead to dilution in their voting power and a reduction in their representa tion in Congress and state legislatures. At the other end of the continuum, noncore rural counties would only have a reduction in their enumerated population of .5%. Moreover, they would actually see a sizable 16 The patterns are broadly similar in the other scenarios. 419 1.4% increase in their share of the national popu la- tion. This would lead to an increase in their repre- sentation in the legislature. Thus, the undercount caused by a citizenship question on the Census would lead to a redistribution of political power in America. It would reduce the representation of urban counties, and increase the voting power of rural counties. VI. Conclusion 62. I have reached the following conclusions: a. The undercount caused by the inclusion of a citizenship question on the Census is likely to have effects on the population counts of each state, and the apportionment of rep- resentatives across states for the U.S House. There is a very high probability that California will lose a congressional seat, and it is more likely than not that Texas will lose a congressional seat. There is also a substantial risk that Ari- zona, Florida, Illinois, and New York could lose a seat. b. The citizenship question is also likely to have effects on the population counts of 420 large counties and cities within each state. This will affect the distribution of voting power within states, and lead to the dilu- tion of the voting power of New York, NY, Miami, FL, Providence, RI, and other large cities with substantial immigrant populations. c. Overall, the citizenship question will lead to a large -scale shift in the distribution of political power in the United States. It would dilute the voting power of urban counties, and increase the voting power of rural counties. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Abowd, make the following Declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, and state that under pen- alty of perjury the following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and be lief: Qualifications 1. I am the Chief Scientist and Associate Director for Research and Methodology at the United States Census Bureau. I have served in that capacity since June 2016. The following state- ments are based on my personal knowledge or 423 on information supplied to me in the course of my professional responsibilities. These state- ments ar e provided in support of the De fend- ants ' opposition to the Plaintiffs ' motion for par- tial sum mary judgment or in the alterna tive for a preliminary injunction. 2. In 1977, I received my Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago with specializations in econometrics and labor economics. My B.A. in economics is from the University of Notre Dame. 3. I have been a university professor since 1976. My first appoi ntment was assistant professor of economics at Princeton University. I was also assistant and associate professor of econo met- rics and industrial relations at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. In 1987, I was appointed associate profes sor of industrial and labor relations with indefinite tenure at Cor- nell University. I am currently on unpaid leave from Cornell University to work in my current position at the Census Bureau as part of the Ca- reer Senior Executive Service. 4. I am a member and fellow of the American Sta- tistical Association, Econometric Society, and So- ciety of Labor Economists (president 2014). I am an elected member of the International Sta-tistical Institute. I am also a member of the America n Economic Association, Intern ational Association for Official Statistics, National Asso- ciation for Business Economists, American As- sociation for Public Opinion Research, Associa- tion for Computing Machinery, American Asso-424 ciation for the Advancement of Science, and Amer- ican Association of Wine Economists. I regu- larly attend and present papers at the meetings of all of these organization s. 5. I have served on the American Economic Asso-ciation Committee on Economic Statistics. I have also served on the National Academy of Sciences Commit tee on National Statistics, the Confer- ence on Research in Income and Wealth Execu-tive Committee, and the Bureau of Labor Statis- tics Technical Advisory Board for the National Longitudinal Surveys (chair: 1999- 2001). Relevant professional experience 6. In 1998, the Census Bureau and Cornell Univer- sity entered into the first of a sequence of IPAs and other contracts under which I served contin- uously as Distinguished Senior Re search Fellow at the Census Bureau until I assumed my cur-rent position in 2016, und er a new IPA contract. Since March 29, 2020, I have been in the Associ-ate Director pos ition at the Census Bureau as a career Senior Executive Service employee. While I was a senior re -search fellow, I worked with numerous senior executives. This include s Directors (Martha Riche, Kenneth Prewitt, C. Louis Kincannon, Stephen Murdoch, Robert Groves, and John Thompson), Deputy Directors (Hermann Habermann, Thomas Mesenbourg, and Nancy Potok), Chief Scientists (Roderick Little and Thomas Louis), and numerous o ther associate directors, assistant directors, and divi-sion chiefs. I also worked with Chief Econo- mists John Haltiwanger, J. Bradford Jensen, 425 Daniel Weinberg, and Lucia Foster, and re- searchers in all program areas. 7. I was one of three senior researcher s who founded the Longitudinal Employer -Household Dynamics (LEHD) program at the Census Bu-reau. This program produces detailed public - use statistical data on the characteristics of workers and employers in local labor markets using large -scale linked admi nistrative, census and survey data from many different sources. The program is acknowledged as the Census Bu- reau 's first 21st Century data product: built to the specifications of local labor market special-ists without additional survey burden, and pub- lished using state -of-the-art confidentiality pro- tection. In addition to very substantial finan- cial support from the Census Bureau, this pro- ject was supported by a $4.1 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) on which I was the lead Principa l Investigator. 8. From 2004 through 2009, I was the lead Princi-pal Investigator on the $3.3 million NSF- supported collaborative project with the Census Bureau to mode rnize secure access to confiden- tial social science data. This project led to the first production implementation wo rldwide of differential privacy1 for OnTheMap \u2014a product of the LEHD program. It also produced proto- type confidential data access systems with pub-lic-use synthetic micro -data supported by direct analysis of the confidential data on validation servers. These projects were the precur sors to 426 the Census Bureau 's current program to imple- ment central differential privacy for all publica- tions from the 2020 Census of Population and Housing, which will be the first large- scale pro- ductio n implementation worldwide. 9. From 2011 until I assumed my position as Chief Scientist at the Census Bureau in 2016, I was the Principal Investigator of the Cornell University node of the NSF -Census Research Network (NCRN), one of eight such nodes that w orked collaborative ly with the Census Bureau and other federal statistical agencies to identify important theoretical and applied re -search projects of di- rect programmatic importance to the agencies. The Cornell node pro duced the fundamental sci- ence explaining the distinct roles of statistical policymakers and computer scientists in the de- sign and implementation of differe ntial privacy systems at statis tical agencies. 10. I have published more than 100 scholarly books, monographs, and articles in the disciplines of eco- nomics, econometrics, statistics, computer sci- ence, and information science. I have been the principal investigator or co -principal investiga- tor on 35 sponsored research projects. My full professional resume is attached to this report. Scope of work 11. I have been asked to provide expert opinion re- sponding to the expert report submitted in this case by Dr. Matthew H. Barreto. 427 Expert opinion 12. The most significant challenge to the quality of 2020 Census data is the COVID -19 pan demic. The effects of the pandemic and the multiple re-programs of the field operations of the 2020 Cen- sus make it nearly impossible to predict with any certainty whether any groups will be differen- tially disadvantaged in the final count. There are no natural or field experiments that speak to disruptions on this scale. 13. The Census Bureau 's randomized controlled trial of a census questionnaire with and without a cit- izenship question, in June 2019, showed no sta- tistically significant difference in the self - response rates with and without a citizenship ques- tion. With a sample of 480,000 housing units, capa- ble of detecting differences as small as 0.5 percent- age points (see -test-report.html), this test was large - scale and properly designed to measure the dif-ferential self -response rates using the 2020 Cen- sus contact and self -response protocols. The June 2019 Census Tes t did not inform the ques- tion of whether overall self -response might have been lower because of the possibility of receiving a question about citizenship (the macro environ- ment), nor did it inform the quality of the overall census procedures, including and especially non - response follow -up (NRFU). 14. An overview of the changes to the 2020 Census field an d post -processing operations be cause of 428 the COVID -19 pandemic and the shortened time window for the NRFU operation are detailed in the declaration of Alber t E. Fontenot, Jr., Asso- ciate Director of the Decennial Census Pro- grams for Census Bureau. 15. Pursuant to the President 's July 21, 2020 Mem- orandum on Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census (\"the PM \"), and based on i nformation currently available to it, the Census Bureau is in the pro-cess of deter mining the appropriate methodol o- gies and finalizing, to the extent possible, how it may exclude illegal aliens in keeping with the stated purpose of the PM to use the data fo r ap- portionment. At this time, the Census Bureau does not know exactly what numbers the Secre- tary may report to the President, and it is there- fore impossible to assess precisely the effects of the PM on apportionment. The Census Bureau is remaining consi stent with best practices for a federal statistical agency. Comments on Dr. Barreto's report 16. With regard to Dr. Barreto 's paragraph 14 (in which he concludes that the PM will reduce par-ticipation in the 2020 Census and reduce the ac- curacy of the 2020 census), paragraph 19 (in which he concludes that the PM erodes trust that many community -based organizations with experience serving immigrants built up over the past year), and paragraph 21 (in which he cites studies finding that Census participation dr ops in immigrant communities when fed eral immi-429 gration enforcement is perceived to be connec - ted with the Census): As stated above in para- graph 12, the most significant challenge to the quality of 2020 Census data is the COVID -19 pandemic. The effects of the pandemic and the coinciding multiple repro -grams of the field op- erations of the 2020 Census required to adapt to the circumstances of the COVID -19 pandemic make it nearly impossible to predict with any certainty whether any groups will be differen- tially disadvantaged in the final count. There are no natural or field experiments that speak to disruptions on this scale. Additionally, as dem on- strated in paragraph 13 above, a randomized trial of the actual prot ocol used would be the best evidence to proper ly draw any conclusions. 17. With regard to Dr. Baretto 's paragraph 68, in which he references 2018 survey research that he conducted in relation to the citizenship ques- tion on the 2020 decennial, and his conclu sions that participation in the Census would increase after removing any fear of immigration status being exposed: The best way to accurately de- velop such conclusions is to conduct a random-ized trial of the actual protocol being used in the 2020 Census, as referenced in para graph 13 above. His res earch failed to do this making his conclusions as set out in paragraph 68 less reliable. 18. With regard to Dr. Baretto 's paragraph 77, in which he concludes that administrative records are less useful than direct responses: More field visits by enumerators are still scheduled to 430 occur. After some number of visit attempts, the enumerator will only try to get a population count, which does not have any associated char- acteristics (like Hispanic ethnic origins). Such a populat ion count does not present the same in- centives to avoid responding nor to misrepresent the number of people in the household. As long as the NRFU reaches comparable levels of com-pleteness in getting population counts for ad- dress identifiers (MAFIDs), the differential ef- fects of administrative record linkage with r e- spect to apportionment are con trolled. 19. With respect to Dr. Baretto 's paragraph 79, his assertions that the count imputation process is biased by non -ignorable non -response are spec- ulative. In the presence of the pandemic, it is very difficult to predict which neighborhoods will have larger count imputation rates and which will have smaller ones. 20. With respect to Dr. Baretto 's paragraph 81, he misuses Rubin 's missing data definitions. MCAR means that no variables -measured or unmeas- ured c an predict which units are miss ing. Ig- norable missing data (the standard assumption used by statistical agencies) means that the ob- served responses can be reliably used to predict the unobserved ones. Since the ob served re- sponses are all the agency typically has (includ-ing data in the sampling frame), that is all the data it can use for imputation. Non -ignorable missing data means that some unobserved infor-mation on the non -respondents is required to ac- curately predict their missing responses. Such 431 information comes from extra -survey sources. The quote from my previous testimony was taken out of context. As I have previously explained, accuracy has at least two dimensions. These are commonly called bias\u2014the statistic 's tendency to systematically over -count or undercount its target \u2014and variance \u2014the statistic 's tendency to fluctuate around its target. Count imputa- tion is a statistical measure not based on sam- pling that has both of these accuracy comp o- nents. I was commenting on the variance of im- putations not the bias. The Census Bureau 's count imputation procedure is tested for unbi-asedness before use. /s/ JOHN M. ABOWD, Ph.D. JOHN M.

Fontenot, Jr., make the following Decla- ration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, and state that under penalty of perjury the following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief: 1. I am the Associate Director for Decennial Census Programs, in which capacity I serve as adviser to the di- rector and deputy director on decennial programs. In this role, I provide counsel as to the scope, quality, man-agement and methodology of the decennial programs; provide executive and professional leadership to the di-433 visions and central offices of the Decennial Census Pro- grams Directorate; and participate with other execu- tives in the formulation and implementation of broad policies, which govern the diverse programs of the Cen- sus Bureau. I have serve d in this capacity since No- vember 12, 2017. 2. The following statements are based on my personal knowledge or on information supplied to me in the course of my professional responsibilities. These statements are provided in support of the Defendants ' opposition to the Plaintiffs ' motion for partial summary judgment or in the alternative for a preliminary injunction. 3. Since March 2020, the Census Bureau has been re- quired to make a number of adjustments to its plans for field data collection for the decen nial census as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, and in order to comply with the statutory deadline of December 31, 2020 to deliver the apportionment count. 4. A statutory deadline under 13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141(b) re- quires that the tabulation of total population by States as required for the apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States shall be completed within nine months after the official start of the census and reported by the Secretary to the President of the United States. That date is December 31, 2020. 5. To meet that deadline in light of the delays caused by the Covid -19 pandemic, the Census Bureau, (as re- flected in the Census Bureau Director 's August 3, 2020 Statement), has updated its operations plan. Specifi- cally, the Census B ureau intends to improve the speed of the count without sacrificing completeness. As part 434 of its revised plan, the Census Bureau will conduct addi- tional training sessions to increase the number of enu- merators in the field Additionally we will be providing monetary awards to existing enumerators in recognition of those who maximize hours worked, as well as reten- tion bonuses for those enumerators who serve for mul- tiple weeks. The Census Bureau will also keep phone and tablet computer devices for enumeration in use for the maximum time possible. The Census Bureau will end field data collection by September 30, 2020. Self-response options will also close on that date to permit the commencement of data processing. Under the revised plan, the Census Bu- reau intends to meet a similar level of household responses as collected in prior censuses, including outreach to hard - to-count communities. Once the Census Bureau has the data from self -response and field data collection in our secure systems, the Bureau plans to review the data for completeness and accuracy, streamline processing of the data, and prioritize apportionme nt counts to meet the statutory deadline. 6. Between the time field operations are completed and the statutory deadline, the Census Bureau must en-gage in post -data collection processing in order to pro- duce the Census Unedited File (CUF), which will then be used to produce the apportionment numbers to be de- livered to the Secretary. 7. As of August 18, 2020, over 94 million households, 64 percent of all households in the Nation, have self re-sponded to the 2020 Census. The initial Non -Response Followup field work has begun and combined with the self response numbers approximately 71 percent of all the households in the nation have been enumerated. 435 Building on our successful and innovative internet re- sponse option, the dedicated women and men of the Cen- sus Bu reau, including our temporary workforce deploy- ing in communities across the country in recent and up-coming weeks, will work diligently to achieve an accu- rate count. 8. The Census Bureau has responded to the shortened calendar period for Non -Response Follow -Up (NRFU) operations by taking steps to increase and enhance the ability of its employees in the field to work as efficiently as possible, all in an effort to put in as many hours of work, spread across the total workforce, into field oper- ations as would have been done under the original time frame. We have aimed to improve the speed of our count by continuing to maintain an optimal number of active field enumerators by conducting additional train- ing sessions, providing awards to enumerators in recog- nitio n of those who maximize hours worked and reten- tion awards to those who continue on staff for successive weeks. Additionally, we are keeping phone and tablet computer devices for enumeration in use for the maxi-mum time possible. 9. As the Director stated o n August 3, 2020, under the revised plan discussed above, the Census Bureau intends to meet a similar level of household responses as col-lected in prior censuses, including outreach to hard -to- count communities. 10. The Census Bureau will continue to prote ct and keep confidential respondents ' private and personally - identifying information, as is required by law under Ti-tle 13. 436 11. The Census Bureau will continue to comply with the Census Bureau 's 2018 Residence Criteria, Final 2020 Census Residence Criteria and Residence Situations, 83 Fed. Reg. 5525 (February 8, 2018), which, as in past decennial censuses, requires each person to be counted in their usual place of residence, as defined in the Resi-dence Criteria. 12. The Presidential Memorandum issued on Jul y 21, 2020, Memorandum on Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census , has had no impact on the design of field operations for decennial census, or on the Census Bureau 's commit- ment to count each person in their usual pla ce of resi- dence, as defined in the Residence Criteria. /s/ ALBERT E.

I am the Executive Director of FIEL Houston, Inc. (\"FIEL\" ). I am over 18 years of age. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration. 2. This declaration supplements my declaration dated August 6, 2020 in this case. 447 3. Obtaining court relief to clarify that every person, including undocumented immigrants will count in the census to determine congressional apportionment will allow FIEL to do meaningful outreach to our constitu- ents. Every si ngle day available for FIEL to spread this message to the community will help to our outreach efforts. Specifica lly, a court order that stops the exclu- sion of undocu mented immigrants from the cens us would make FIEL 's efforts to encourage census participation easier by al lowing us to c larify the c urre nt confusion and help ease the fear caused by the Presiden tial Memoran- dum, and it would take FIEL les s time and fewer re- sources to convince members of the communities we serve to participate in the census. 4. As stated in my prior declarat ion, the Presidential Memorandum is deterring Census participation in the communities FIEL serves and burdening our outreach efforts. This is evident when we provide services to our community at our physical off ice. Since approximately mid\u00ad June of this ye ar FIEL started opening ou r physi- cal office to provide services by appointment three days a week, while taking extra h ealth and safety precau- tions. We had previously closed o ur physical office temporarily and operated remotely due to the ongoing pandemic in Houston. While providing our normal rang e of immigration legal services during client ap- pointments, we also inform our clients about other ser- vices and programs we offer to make our engagement with our clients more impactful, given the limited amount of time available. For exam ple, in the limited time we have per appointment, we also inform our clients about our census outreach and Get Out The Vote (GOTV) ef- forts. Recently, we have begun organizing people around COVID relief efforts, because the COV ID pandemic has 448 hit the communities we serve severely and dispropor- tionately. In addition to our advocacy for gr eater as- sistance from state and local authorities , we use the lim- ited time in our client appointments to also promote COVID -related safety pro tocols and provide free masks if needed and share information on rent assistance pro- grams during the pandemic. 5. Further, in the course of providing legal services , we inform our clients about other legal work we are in-volved in, including serving as pla intiffs in the present case. As noted above, during appointments we educate our clients ab out the census and encourage them to par- ticipate. As a result of the recent Memorand um, I have witnessed that about half of the individuals we serve ex- press apathy or fear about engaging in the census un- derstanding that the President wants to exclude undoc- umented immig rant. Some individuals simply ask, \"what 's the point? \" Other say they would rather not participate becau se they come from mixed -status fami- lies and fear that one or more family members could be subjected to negative consequences if the government determines their status. This complicates and extends the time we engage in cen sus education. 6. The fear and apathy we witness about participating in the census is not limited to clients to whom we provide direct services. On August 8, 2020, FIEL participated in a car parade in the Greenspoint community of north-ern Houston organized by local agents of the Cen us Bu- reau. Greenspoint is comprised of a large and growing Latino population with a significant African American population. More affordable rent in Greenspoint com- pared to other Houston communities has allowed for growing numbers of immigrant s to move into the area, 449 including many mixed -status families. The Census Bu- reau had reached out to FIEL last year to ask if we could be part of their community outreach efforts. We also had meetings about doing joint outreach efforts with the Census Bure au this year prior to the pandemic and they posted official Census Bureau signs at our of-fices. As part of that relationship, th e Census Bureau invited FIEL an d various grassroots organizati ons, in partnership with local pastors and community leaders, to participate in the car parade to encourage census par- ticipation in the midst of a pandemic. FIEL was the only Spanish -speaking organization participating in the parade. FIEL members, including myself, took part in the parade and drove through Greenspoint neighbor- hoods raising awareness about the censu s through vocal outreach to re sidents in Spanish and English. We talked to a gath ering of community members and vari- ous individuals from our vehicles. During the course of the hour and a half long parade I estimated based on my experience in organizing that FIEL members spoke to about 200 individuals, encouraging them to participate in the census and reach out to us for questions about the process. While some individuals were receptive to our messages, abo ut half of the people we engaged with were apathetic. Unfortunately, of all the individuals we personally engaged with, only one person said to us they already filled out census. By my estimation, about 85% of the individuals who expressed apathy about the census were Latino. Based on my knowle dge of and experience working with the Greenspoint commu- nity, many Latinos in Greenspoint come from mixed -sta- tus families who are afraid to engage in the census due to their perception that undocumented indi vidual s could be targeted by the government through the census. 450 7. If FIEL did not have to expend extra efforts to en- courage, reiterate or persuade people about the im- portance of census participation especially individuals who genuinely fear or have apathy abou t it due to their perception that undocumented individuals will not be counted and cou ld be targeted for immigration purposes by the census it would free up a significant amount of time and resources for FIEL. As n oted previously many of the individuals we serve as well as many of our members, come from m ixed -status families where one or more family members may be undocumented. Although it normally takes a few minutes to educate and inform each individual about census participation, the amount of time and personnel resources collectively used by our organization to overcome the confusion and fear caused by the Presidential Memor andum is signifi- cant for a nonprofit organi zation like FIE L. We could otherwise use that time to promote our other services , like our COVID relie f and GOTV efforts. For example , we would be able to provide other services and infor- mation to our clients d uring our time -limited appoint- ments at our physical office, or we would be able to serve more people during our office hours. We would be more productive in our mission. 8. Even with only a limited amount of time left before the end of the count, having a legal mandate to reassure people they will be counted for the purpose of determin- ing Texas ' congressional seats and electoral vote would help us encourage census responses among the commu-nity we serve through our public communications. Every additional d ay to engage in census outreach without hav- ing to fight the misinformation of the Presidential Mem- orandum would allow FIEL to engage in more efficient 451 and effective outreach, if not in person through our com- munication streams. FIEL would be able to employ con- ventional media, such as press releases, press confer- ences, and press statements, given our relationships with TV and radio media within both Spanish language and English language networks. We would also be able to employ our large social media networ k through plat- forms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. All of these avenues of communication would be available to us, even for last minute pushes to amplify our census outreach and encourage our community and constitu- ents to fill out the census.

As explained in my August 6, 2020 Declaration, I am the Deputy Director at Make the Road New York (\"MRNY \") and in my capacity as Deputy Director, I am responsible for overseeing our census work and our ser-vices teams, which include our legal, health, and adult education departments. I am also part of the Execu- tive Leadership Team of MRNY and am responsible for fundraising and shaping many of MRNY 's organizational 454 priorities. Throughout my tenure with MRNY, I have been in regular contact with MRNY members and I fre- quently meet with members in the communities in which they reside where I learn about their neighborhoods, their needs, and their concern s to inform communica- tions, organizing, and civic engagement programs for MRNY. During my 15 years at MRNY, I have also fa- miliarized myself with MRNY 's internal records and processes; our staff and their responsibilities; our pro- grams and program areas; a nd our members, and their needs. 2. As discussed in my August 6, 2020 Declaration, the Presidential Memorandum has required MRNY to make additional investments to achieve Census partici- pation rates comparable to what we what would have achieved absent the decision to exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment base. 3. Since executing my August 6 declaration, I have received further information from the staff conducting our outreach to the Spanish -speaking immigrant com- munity concerning the impa ct of the Presidential Mem- orandum on census response rates. One staff member reported that a Spanish -speaking community member asked her about the President 's memo and said that the announcement of a plan to exclude undocumented immi-grants from apportionm ent made them afraid to fill out the census. Another staff member reported that she had spoken to three Spanish -speaking people who said they were afraid to fill out the census because of the President 's announcement about excluding undocumented immigrants from apportionment. The same staff mem- ber reported that during her follow -up census outreach calls since early August, she had noticed an appreciable 455 decline in the number of Spanish -speaking individuals answering their phones, which she attri buted to a desire not to talk about the census. A third staff member re- ported that during census outreach, she encountered a Spanish -speaking family who told her that they were con- vinced by the President 's statements that undocumented people should not be included in the Census and there- fore decided not to participate in it. This staf f member tried to explain that undocumented people should still be counted in the Census; however, the call was upsetting for her and took up time that could have been spent en- couraging other households to fill out the census. 4. Overall, MRNY is continuing to divert resources to combat the misinformation, confusion, and feelings of exclusion that have resulted from the Presidential Mem- orandum. 5. If the court were to issue a n injunction against the policy in the Presidential Memorandum or to declare it unlawful, it would help MRNY conduct more efficient and effective census outreach to our members and the community we serve, and allow us to reach more people and to divert som e resources back to other mission crit- ical priorities during the pandemic, including ensuring that there is adequate employment, education, housing and health support for our members and their families I, Theo Oshiro, declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my know - ledge and recollection.

I am the Legal Service Director for Plaintiff Ahri for Justice ( \"Ahri \"). I am a founding member of Ahri and have been on staff since December 2019. I am over 18 years of age. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration. 2. This declaration supplements my declaration date d August 5, 2020 in this case. 458 3. Ahri provides legal services, has a hotline to address community concerns, and conducts civic engagement work, includin g census -related outreach. As part of our census outreach, we have a goal to contact at least 10,000 individual households to encourage them to fill out the census. We also provide information about the census to our legal services clients and to individ uals who call our hotline. After news of the July 21, 2020, Presidential Memorandum to the Secretary of Com-merce ( \"Presidential Memorandum\" ), we began to hear concerns from the community concerning the impact of the Presidential Memorandum on the census. House- holds that already responded to the census are con-cerned that they improperly responded, while house- holds that have not yet responded to the census are hes- itant to respond because they either believe they are not permitted to respond, or because they fear identifying their household to the federal government. 4. Although our team has continued to encourage households to respond to the census by highlighting its importance to funding and redistricting, the Presiden- tial Memorandum makes messaging diffic ult. We have informed our clients and constituents that we are now involved in a lawsuit to challenge the Presidential Mem- orandum, but the fact remains that the Memorandum is still in effect. For this reason, we are spending a longer amount of time tryin g to convince households to respond to the census, time that could be spent contacting addi- tional households and on our other program areas. With the September 30 deadline quickly approaching, a court order invalidating the Presidential Memorandum would m ake our census outreach efforts more efficient and effective. Our messaging to our community would change from \" we are trying to stop the Presidential 459 Memorandum but are not there yet, \" to \"a federal court has halted the Presidential Memorandum. \" Every s in- gle day that we can tell our constituents that they will count for apportionment purposes and that the federal government is not permitted to identify the immigration status of individuals or households to exclude them from apportionment is valuable and will help with outreach. 5. We know this kind of messaging works. We often get questions like, \" Do I have to reveal my status on the census? \" We immediately quell this concern by point- ing to the citizenship question injunctions. We believe that similar messaging that the Court has enjoined the Presidential Memorandum will help to immediately quell community concerns about the Memorandum, making conversations shorter to allow Ahri to reach a larger num- ber of households. 6. Getting relief from the Presidential Memorandum as soon as possible is also key to ensuring that census door knockers have success. With relief from the Memo - randum, we can publicize the Court 's order to encourage our community to open their doors to cens us outreach workers, rather than hiding out of confusion or fear and avoiding the census completely. 7. Ahri is already preparing to shift our messaging as soon as the Court grants relief. Since our communica- tions team first learned that Plaintiffs had fi led a motion for a preliminary injunction, they have continued to follow - up for updates so that so we can start doing outreach. If the Court issues an order granting Plaintiffs relief, we plan to immediately contact Korean news media, issue press releases, and do social media to let our community know about the order and encourage the community to respond to the census. 460 I, Jenny Seon, declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my know - ledge and recollection.

I submitted a declaration in this case on August 7, 2020 ( \"Declaration \"). I have read the expert disclo- sures by Dr. John M. Abowd, dated August 19, 2020 (\"Abowd Decl. \") and Albert E. Fontenot, Jr., dated Au- gust 19, 2020 ( \"Fontenot Decl. \") as well as the Memo- randum of Law in Support of Defendants ' Motion to Dis- miss and in Opposition to Plaintiffs ' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment or Preliminary Injunction, dated 463 August 19, 2020 ( \"Defendants ' Brief\") and am prepared to offer rebuttal poin ts on behalf of the Plaintiffs. 2. Below, I address comments directed at, or re- lated to my report from the Abowd Decl., Fontenot Decl., and Defendants ' Brief. Where there is overlap, I have made clear which document I am referring to and attempted to use paragraph and page numbers where appropriate. II. Abowd Declaration 3. Dr. Abowd begins his expert opinion in para- graph 12 by not ing that the 2020 Census data collection has been hampered by COVID -19. There is no doubt that COVID -19 has presented many challenges to American life and for 2020 Census outreach. However, these challenges are completely distinct from the effect the Presidential Memorandum ( \"PM\") is having and will continue to have on efforts by the Census Bureau and its partners to encourage immigrant communities to respond to the 2020 Census. Indeed, while COVID -19 has con- tributed to a challenging environment for t he enumera- tion, the PM adds new, significant challenges to an ac- curate and high -quality count because it sends a signal of exclusion and threat to the immigrant community which discourages them from responding to the Census. The PM 's negative signal is an added and unnecessary one to send to the immigrant community while the Cen-sus Bureau is in a critical stage of the enumeration. 4. At any moment, a survey instrument such as the Census may face a variety of challenges to response rates; however, the existence of a greater or more broadly applicable threat to the response rate, such as COVID - 19, does not negate the independent effect that a more 464 targeted threat, such as the PM, may have a particular subgroup of respondents. Dr. Abowd does not account for t his distinction. The Decennial Census is a singu- larly large survey instrument and, according to Mr. Fontenot (Fontenot Decl. \u00b6 7), as of August 18, approx- imately 36% of U.S. households, amounting to over 50 million households, have yet to respond. The im pact that any specific threat may have on response rates re- mains significant. For example, a potential respondent, such as a grocery store employee or farmworker who has reported to work in -person every day of the pan- demic, may be undeterred from respondi ng to the Cen- sus due to COVID -19; however, they may be deterred by the PM 's signal of threat and exclusion based on their own immigration status or the status of other household members. Although COVID -19 may have significant negative effects on outreach efforts and response rates, response rates can still suffer additional reductions as a result of new threats against immigrant communities that create more fear and confusion over their partici- pation in the Census. 5. In paragraph 13 of his declaration, Dr . Abowd opines that the Census Bureau 's own pilot study of the citizenship question in June -August 2019 ( \"2019 Census Test \") did not return statistically significant evidence of reduced response rates due to the inclusion of a citizen- ship question on the q uestionnaire. However, this opin- ion is not entirely accurate. Dr. Abowd 's opinion focuses solely on the overall response rate and fails to mention that the Census Bureau's 2019 Census Test did show statistically significant decreases in response rates in areas with significant non- citizen, Hispanic, and Asian populations. In an article summarizing the results of the 2019 Census Test published on the Census Bureau 's 465 web site, Dr. Victoria A. Velkoff, the Census Bureau 's Associate Director for Demographic Programs, wrote \"there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of respondents who identified as Hispanic between the forms \" 1 with the form including a citizen- ship question reducing Hispanic participation. Thus, even in the preliminary analysis of the 2019 Census Test, the Census Bureau found that there were signifi- cantly disparate response rates by different communi- ties when the Census implicated citizenship status. The full report issued by Census Bureau in January 2020, revealed fur ther, and more significant differences. The Census Bureau wrote: \"in some areas and for some subgroups, there were statistically significant lower self-response rates for the test questionnaire with the citizenship question than for the test questionnair e without the citizenship question. \" 2 In particular, the 2019 Census Test report found lower response rates due to the citizenship questions in areas designated bilin- gual, high numbers of noncitizens, high density Hispanic and higher density Asian. Addit ionally, the Census study found statistically higher rates of disconnect, and discontinuing responses in the Internet sample for the version containing the citizenship question, noting that \"breakoffs occurred during the collection of person de- mographics at a higher rate for the treatment with the 1 Victoria A. Velkoff, 2019 Census Test Preliminary Results , U.S. Census Bureau, Oct. 31, 2019, https://www.ce nsus.gov/newsroom/ blogs/random -samplings/2019/10/2019_census_testpre.html . 2 Poehler, Elizabeth A., Dorothy A. Barth., Lindsay Longsine, Sa- rah K Heimel, 2019 Census Test Report , U.S. Census Bureau, at ix- x, Test Report ). 466 citizenship question. \" Thus, it is clear that the 2019 Census Test indicates that increasing threat over immi- gration status leads to withdrawal and declining partic- ipation for immigrant communities. 6. Further, the 2019 Census Test only examined self-response rate \u2014it did not investigate how inquiring into citizenship status affects the success of NRFU nor did the Test examine imputation. These are both items the Test could have studied if the Census Bureau wanted to fully understand the impact of linking the Census to citizenship issues, but it did not. As the 2019 Census Test report readily admits, the study was designed to understand staffing needs for the 2020 Census, not to scientifically evalua te the full and total response and non-response rates by race, ethnicity and immigration status. 7. The 2019 Census Test cited by Dr. Abowd cannot account for the more direct targeting of undocumented immigrants by the PM. The study Dr. Abowd cites cannot provide a complete picture of the immigrant re- sponse rate in the presence of an official Presidential policy statement targeting the removal of undocumented persons from the census count. While the citizenship status question would have been threatening (as re- flected in the reduced participation reported in the 2019 Census Test), the PM is more explicit in calling for \" ex- cluding these illegal aliens. \" To this point, the Census Bureau wrote that \"the environment in which [the 2019 Census Test] was conduct ed will differ from the 2020 Census environment in terms of advertising and media attention. \"3 Indeed, they are correct, there has been 3 2019 Census Test Report , at 12. 467 widespread media attention to the PM which will reduce participation in immigrant communities. 8. Finally, the 2019 Census Test was conducted to analyze participation during the self -response period of the census, not during the NRFU period. The PM was issued during the NRFU period of the 2020 Census, in which the deterrent effects of the PM are likely to be magnified compared to the self -response period. The result is that the conclusions about response rates dur- ing the initial self -response period that Dr. Abowd relies upon are less relevant in understanding the effect of the PM at this juncture of the enumeration du ring NRFU. The Census Bureau writes of its 2019 Census Test: \"The focus of this analysis is to understand how the cit- izenship question affects self -response rates prior to the NRFU operation. As such, the results of this test are limited to the self -response timeframe prior to the start of NRFU. The self -response rates discussed in this analysis do not try to mimic the final overall self -re- sponse of a census, which includes self -response re- ceived during NRFU and other field operations. \"4 9. However, the single most important takeaway from the 2019 Census Test is what Dr. Abowd neglected to mention, i.e., the 2019 Census Test found that the cit- izenship question did result in statistically lower re- sponse rates for Latinos, Asians, non -English speakers and noncitizens. The largest gap reported was in high - density Hispanic areas where the 2019 Census Test re- ported a drop -off of 1.1 percent which would reduce the Hispanic count by over 670,000 according to the Census Bureau 's data. 4 2019 Census Test Report , at 12. 468 10.

Original Table 8 from 2019 Census Test Report 13. Moreover, because the 2019 Census Test only examined self -response rate, it did not investigate the success of NRFU, nor d id it examine imputation.6 As the Census Bureau report readily admits, the pilot study was designed to understand staffing needs for the Cen- sus, not to scientifically evaluate the full and total re- sponse and non -response rate by race, ethnicity and im- migr ation status.7 14. The PM is potentially even more disruptive than a citizenship question because of its timing. When tak- ing a survey, the researcher generally wants to avoid in-troducing any unnecessary, extraneous conditions dur- ing the response period th at may bias respondents or harm response rates. The Census Bureau began its pro- motion of the 2020 Census in July 2019, inviting most U.S. households to respond to the Census starting on March 12, 2020 and, as of the date the PM was published on 6 According to the report, at p. x, \"Note that this test did not in- clude the Nonresponse Followup operation, so we are not able to measure the impact of a citizenship question for the completeness and accuracy of 2020 Census overall. \" 7 See 2019 Census Test Report, at x, 30- 31. 470 July 21, 2020, the Census Bureau planned to continue the response period until October 31. That means that the PM was introduced 131 days from the start of the count and 102 days from the end of the count\u2014 and only days before the start of critical Non- Response Fol low- Up ( \"NRFU \") operations. The PM remains in effect while Census enumerators are in the field, visiting house- holds for in -person interviews as well as ongoing NRFU. Given the PM 's explicit connection to the 2020 Census and its direct contradiction of th e core messaging of the outreach efforts conducted by the Census Bureau itself and the nongovernmental organizations, particularly in immigrant communities and communities of color, it would be anathema to sound survey research to publish such a document d uring the response period. Notwith- standing that the PM only purports to affect the count after the close of the enumeration period, the timing of the PM 's release will likely lead to significant declines in Census response rates because households in immi- grant communities will be deterred from responding now, and will not wait to find out whether they are actu- ally excluded from the apportionment count later on. 15. As I note in my Declaration at page 4, paragraph 15 \"there was widespread coverage, particul arly within Spanish -language news media, \" of the July 21 PM, which is to be expected given such a major ann ouncement by the President. 8 Despite extensive news coverage, the 8 Telemundo. \"Trump Ordena Al Censo Que No Incluya a El Que Determina El Reparto De no plans to change its field outreach to reas- sure immigrants of their participation. According to Mr. Fontenot, at paragraph 12 of his declaration, the PM has had \"no impact on the design of field operations for decennial census, or on the Census Bureau 's commit- ment to count each person in their usual place of resi- dence. \" 16. In paragraph 15 of his report, Dr. Abowd states that the Census Bureau was not currently prepared to assess how the PM would be implemented and coordi- nated with data teams at the Census Bureau. Dr. Abowd 's statement is consistent with testimony from the Director of the Census Bureau that he was entirely unaware of the PM prior to its release. 9 The failure to notify the Census Bureau or test the effect of the PM on Census response rates, notwithstanding the PM's rela- tionship to the 2020 Census, shows th at the announce- ment of the PM on July 21, 2020, in the heart of the enu- meration period, was not done in accordance with the Census Bureau 's practices and may have been timed to contravene those practices. Dr. Abowd opines that it is impossible to predict the effects of the PM on appor- tionment at this time; however, he does not dispute that 9 Tara Bahrampour, House Democrats grill Census director on Trump order to exclude undocumented immigrants from apportion- ment, Wash. Post, July told the House Oversight Commit- tee that he had no advance notice of President Trump' s memoran- dum, which directs the Commerce Department to exclude undocu- mented immigra nts from being counted next year when Congress reapportions a decade' s division of House seats. \"). 472 the PM will have a chilling -effect on Latino and immi- grant participation right now, during the response pe- riod and during NRFU. 17. With respect to whether media coverage related to the Census can impact response rates, the Census Bu- reau agrees that media coverage of Census news can and does impact the general public \u2014including coverage of court decisions related to the Census. The 2019 Cen- sus Test was conducted be tween June 13 and August 15. The U.S. Supreme Court decision concerning the valid- ity of the citizenship question was issued on June 27 and there was media coverage of the issue both before and after the decision. In the full report on the 2019 Cen- sus Test, the Census Bureau wrote that \" media cover- age related to the Supreme Court decision on whether or not to include a citizenship question on the 2020 Cen- sus questionnaire may have affected respondent behav- ior during this test . There was media coverage on the citizenship question both before and after the Supreme Court decision was made public on June 27, 2019. Pub- lic opinion on the topic may have influenced response behavior for this test . The degree to which public awareness and public opinion is differ ent between this test and the 2020 Census may influence how applicable the results of this test are to the 2020 Census. The im- pact of media coverage may have also affected the treat- ments differently. \" 10 18. In paragraph 16 of his declaration, Dr. Abowd reiterates his concerns about the impact of COVID -19. I have responded to this above, however, it bears reiter- 10 2019 Census Test Report , at 12 (emphasis added). 473 ating that there is no evidence that the significant chal- lenge of conducting the Census during the pandemic subsumes entirely the negative effect on response rates of the PM or any other phenomena. Dr. Abowd does not address decades of published research, including Census Bureau studies, that find reduced participation by immigrant communities in the face of new threats, which the PM represents. 19. In paragraph 17 of his declaration, Dr. Abowd opines that a randomized trial would be the best way to assess the effects of removing threats to immigration status on response rates. First, in our 2018 study \u2014for which Dr. Abowd does not dispute the subs tantive results \u2014we did rely on randomization and experimental survey research to as sess the effect of including or e x- cluding a citizenship question. 11 Survey respondents were randomized and one -half were given a condition in which they were told a citizen ship question would in fact be included on the census; while the second -half of re- spondents was randomly assigned to a condition in which they were told the citizenship question would not be in- cluded. This follows the exact same principle of ran- domized control trials that Dr. Abowd recommends. In that 2018 study, as described in paragraph 68 on page 11 of my Declaration, we observed a large and statisti-cally significant increase in response rate in the condi- tion without the citizenship question. In parti cular, Latino respondents who had previously indicated a de- sire to not respond, registered a 41.2 point increase in 11 Barreto, Matt 2018. \"Expert Report of Matthew A. Barreto, Ph.D \" in State of New York v. U.S. Dep' t of C ommerce (Sept. 7, 2018). 474 response rate once the citizenship question was re- moved. While the sample size of our 2018 study is not as large as the 2019 Census Test, t he results of our 2018 study are significant and the patterns are consistent with the Census Bureau 's own research from their 2019 pilot study. 20. Dr. Abowd has offered no such randomized trial study to demonstrate that the PM will not cause re- sponse rates to decline. Instead, the only randomized control trial that Dr. Abowd cites shows the opposite, i.e., A) media coverage of census citizenship issues can affect response rates; and B) the citizenship question significantly reduced immigrant and Latin o response rates. Indeed, in my August 7 Declaration, I cite doz- ens of published academic and Census Bureau studies on the topic of perceived threat and participation among immigrants which point to a chilling effect and with- drawal (Montoya 2019; Kissam 2019; Asad 2020). Without exception, every single research study finds that when a new threat emerges, immigrants, espec ially the most vulnerable, will withdraw and reduce civic participation. I am aware of no rigorous published social science research that finds increased threat has no debilitating effect. 21. In paragraph 18 of his declaration, Dr. Abowd explains that la ter in the NRFU process, enumerators 475 may seek to get a simple total person count of a house- hold, and not full characteristics of each household mem- ber, and suggests that during such interactions, house-holds do not have the same incentives to avoid respond- ing or misrepresenting the number of people in the household. However, Dr. Abowd 's opinion misses three key points. First, the PM provides household members in undocumented or mixed -status households with a re- duced incentive to give federal Census enumerators any information at all because the President has just de- clared that their numbers will be not counted for the core purpose of the Census \u2014apportionment. As a re- sult, they will be less likely to open the door in the first place to cooperate with any interview. While the enu- merator might only be looking for a population count, the household member does not know this. Instead, the only relevant recent information they may have is news about the PM attempting to exclude certain immi- grant communities from the Census count. This is con- sistent with decades of research including de la Puente, the Census 's own ethnographer, who has clear and con- sistent findings about how undocumented communities avoid the Census when they have conce rns about immi- gration status (de la Puente 1995, 2004). According to de la Puente (2004): \"individuals with an insecure im- migration status were much less likely to trust the gov-ernment and specifically less likely to fill out the Census questionnaire. U ndocumented immigrants have long been a concern for the Census Bureau. This research demonstrated that respondents with irregular immigra- tion statuses are unlikely to directly cooperate with the Census. \" 22. Second, research by Kissam (2019) is clear that immigrant households under -report non -immediate 476 family members who may not be documented. Even when a simple count is requested, the immigrant house- hold is far more likely to misreport household size when they believe the government is monitoring or chec king about immigration status. The PM reinforces this con- cern. Finally, Dr. Abowd predicates an opinion on the assumption that NRFU will be full and complete as orig- inally planned and not impacted by the PM; however, Dr. Abowd 's point is speculative, and based on no empir- ical evidence that NRFU will reach the required level of completeness. 23. In paragraphs 19 and 20 of his declaration, Dr. Abowd discusses imputation and opines that COVID -19 pandemic will make it very difficult to predict which neig hborh oods will need more, or less imputation. How- ever, the unpredictability reinforces the point about im-putation being prone to problems when there is a low or unequal response rate to the Census. Extensive pub- lished literature discusses the difficulty of ac curate im- putation when response rates are low and uneven. Again, while acknowledging the significant and widespread dif- ficulty that COVID -19 presents, the pandemic does not subsume and/or negate the impact of all other factors on the enumeration. The PM will make the enumeration even more difficult, with increasing nonresponse in spe- cific communities \u2014not at random\u2014 and the imputation models will not be able to see inside invisible households. It is clear that non- responding households are larger i n size and more likely to be immigrant (Kissam 2019). Thus, when imputation models \u2014which are based on re- sponding households \u2014are applied, they will under -count the number of people who live in non-responding house- holds. Research indicated the inclusion of a citizenship question was also likely to have a negative impact on the 477 accuracy of imputation, and the logical effect of the PM on imputation is the same. The new PM introduces a perceived threat in the immigrant community which leads to differential no n-response which greatly under- mines imputation. In effect, the PM serves to weaken the imputation model, because in the final phase of NRFU, households that may have responded pre -PM are not responding because of immigration concerns, and at differential rates than the general public. While the challenge of COVID -19 may affect Census participa- tion regardless of the race or immigration status of a household, it is Latino and immigrant households which face the new and additional challenge presented by the PM, which has targeted the immigrants from being ex-cluded from the Census apportionment. III. Fontenot Declaration 24. Albert E. Fontenot, Jr. is Associate Director for Decennial Census Programs and primarily offered in- formation about operations in his report. Mr. Fontenot did not directly respond to any of the claims or evidence in my Declaration. However, some of Mr. Fontenot 's points support the conclusion that the PM introduces a new variable into the equation whic h the Census Bureau is not taking into account. 25. In paragraph 5 of his declaration, Mr. Fontenot describes the current plans for the Census in the final critical weeks of field data collection. He states that the Census Bureau will send more enumerator s into the field during the remaining response period; however, in paragraph 12, he states that the PM \"has had no impact on the design of field operations for decennial census. \" Thus, Mr. Fontenot indicates that the Census Bureau will not be adding any n ew training related to discussing 478 concerns in the immigrant community related to the PM. In prior census research, Census Bureau ethnog- rapher de la Puente has explained that it is important to a successful enumeration to understand immigrant com- munity concerns about responding to the census, and to equip Census enumerators with information to reassure vulnerable populations that their participation is safe. In this case, the PM creates a new reason for concern in immigrant communities, yet Mr. Fontenot makes clear that the Census Bureau has made no changes to their out- reach to account for the PM and its effects. The deci- sion not to make any changes to field operations to ad- dress the PM is a major shortcoming, and not consis tent with best practices recommended by their own internal published research. 26. In paragraph 7 of his declaration, Mr. Fontenot states that the initial phase of the Census returned a 64 percent self -response rate. To date, the initial NRFU increased re sponse rate to 71 percent of all households. These data indicate that among the 36 percent of house-holds that did not respond, 7 percent did respond to NRFU (64+7=71) and that 29 percent of households have not responded to NRFU to date. These results in- dicate a very low response rate during initial NRFU of 19.4 percent (7 / 36 = 19.4). While COVID -19 is again cited as a difficulty, the introduction of the new PM adds even more difficulty, particularly in immigrant commu- nities. There is no indication in M r. Fontenot 's decla- ration that the Census Bureau is prepared to improve their outreach to vulnerable populations in response to the PM. 27. In paragraph 8 of his declaration, Mr. Fontenot states that the Census Bureau will increase the number 479 of employees and work hours to increase field opera- tions, in light of a shortened calendar period. How- ever, increasing the presence of federal Census enumer-ators into high density non -citizen communities actually runs the risk of further reducing participation in the face of fear and threat. In my Declaration, I outline clear findings from published social science research re- porting that increased perceptions of monitoring leads to reduced participation among immigrants (Berk and 2019; Asad 2020). The PM sends a clear signal of monitoring because it states it is using government administrative records to locate and identify where un- documented immigrants live, and to merge those rec- ords with Census data to excl ude undocumented immi- grants from the final count for purposes of apportion- ment. While increased enumerators might have helped in an environment without the PM, the new PM changes things by sending a new signal of threat to immigrant communities. 28. In pa ragraph 10 of his declaration, Mr. Fontenot states that the Census Bureau will keep personally - identifying information confidential. However, when immigrants have concerns over immigration enforce- ment, even providing those assurances does not help. Exten sive social science research documents that immi- grants will attempt to conceal their identity, even misi-dentify their race on government forms when they have concerns that it could be connected to immigration en- forcement (Rodriguez and Hagan 2004). What m atters is how immigrant communities perceive the threatening environment, not that Mr. Fontenot understands that the law requires the Census Bureau to keep respondent information confidential \u2014he is not the target of the PM. 480 The PM has deteriorated the tru st that Census workers and the Census Bureau 's partners \u2014the organizations relied upon to be trusted messengers to immigrant com- munities and communities of color \u2014have built up since the 2019 Supreme Court ruling which blocked the inclu- sion of a citizenship question from the 2020 Census ques- tionnaire. 29. In paragraph 35 of my Declaration, I identified reports from the non -governmental organizations who are working in partnership with the Census Bureau to act as trusted messengers for census outreach in the i m- migrant community which stated that the new PM changes the landscape for encouraging census response for the worse: 35. According to Arturo Vargas, the CEO of NALEO , one of the nation 's top civic engagement organiza- tions in the Latino and immigrant community, the new PM is a setback that creates fear in the immi- grant community. NALEO has been identified by the Census Bureau itself as one of the most important \"trusted voices \" to earn trust in the Latino commu- nity. Vargas stated on Twitter: \"With a success- ful #NALEOVirtual Conference done, time now to refocus on #Census2020\u2014 which just got even MORE DIFFICULT with @POTUS effort to ex- clude immigrants from the apportionment numbers and cutting short @uscensusbureau 's time to finish the count. Our comm unity is scared .\" Vargas went further to note that the new PM was undoing progress made after striking the citizenship ques- tion, \"#Census2020 is the most challenging to promote participation I have seen in my career. Af- ter @SCOTUS stopped a citizenship question, we 481 had a fighting chance. Now @POTUS has made it much harder by his July 21 memo and by cutting off @uscensusbureau 's field work early. @NALEO \" Given that NALEO has been aligned with the Census Bureau in terms of the importance of encouraging c en- sus response by immigrants and Latinos, Mr. Vargas ' comment indicates that the PM is actively undermining the Census Bureau 's collaborative outreach efforts with its trusted messengers. 30. However, Mr. Fontenot makes clear that the Cen- sus Bureau has made no attempt to change its approach and incorporate new training, or new outreach to allevi-ate fears in the immigrant community as a result of the PM. The overwhelming finding in the published re- search is that new threats result in new with drawal and the Census Bureau is not prepared for that. IV. Defendants' Brief 31. Finally, while the Defendants make reference to the points above by Dr. Abowd and Mr. Fontenot, there are additional criticisms they raise\u2014 unsupported by any evidence of the ir own \u2014which I will address in this section. 32. On pages 12 -13 of their brief, Defendants claim that the extensive evidence and published studies which I rely upon in part to conclude that the PM will create a chilling effect on census participation are not specific to the PM. Designing, testing, conducting and analyzing a randomized control field trial on the effect of the PM on census participation within a month of the PM 's pub- lication is an insurmountable task. However, the ex- pansive social science literature, much of which are my 482 own studies and published research, addresses condi- tions remarkably similar to the PM and is specific to new instances of perceived threat. Tellingly, while demand- ing an impossible type of new research, neither Defend- ants, nor Dr. Abowd, nor Mr. Fontenot, cite any studies indicating that the PM will not negatively impact partic- ipation. In instances such as this, when we are asked to assess the impact of a new policy without the time re- quired to conduct field research, the best practice in the social sciences is to A) closely examine the policy and place it within the context of other similar policies; and B) to review what happened when other similar policies were enacted. Based on the extensive research I have conducted, I am confident that the research reviewed in my Declaration, which all points to increased perceived threat and withdrawal or decline in participation in im-migrant communities, is applicable to the PM. 33. On page 13, Defendants state that I did not con- sider the results of the 2019 Census Test on the citizen- ship question. As I reviewed above in paragraphs 5 -13 above, findings concerning participation by subgroup in the 2019 Census Test show clear evidence of reduced participation in Latino and immigrant c ommunities. 34. On page 16, Defendants state that my analysis of media coverage of the PM is misguided because \"the me- dia, and the community activists they feature, are inde- pendent actors, \" and not part of the Census Bureau. However, the Census Bureau has made clear on several instances that A) they have a formal partnership with Spanish -language media and Latino community groups; and B) they need close cooperation and cooperation with Spanish -language media and Latino community groups 483 to implement an accu rate 2020 Census. Raul E. Cisne- ros, director of national partnerships for the U.S. Cen- sus Bureau wrote on a census.gov website12 that the Census was planning a \"massive effort, a collaboration between Univision and two Census Bureau programs, \" which included not only Spanish- language media, but also \"representatives from major advocacy groups, from the National Association of Latino Elected and Ap- pointed Officials to the League of United Latin Ameri- can Citizens, along with representatives from Univision affiliates in California .\" The Census has described Spanish -language media and Latino community groups as \"national partners during the 2020 Census. \" Defen - dants ' cognitive dissonance is astounding; stating on the one hand that Spanish -language media and community groups are the \" trusted voices \" whose cooperation is in- tegral to their field operations to encourage census par- ticipation, and then also claiming that those groups are independent actors with no connection to the Census who are simply fearmongering in their concerns about the PM. As recently as March 2020, the Census Bu- reau continued to partner with Spanish -language media to promote information about the Census. They are not \"independent actors \" as Defendants suggest. In fact, the Ce nsus Bureau continues to feature its partner- ship with Univision on its web site. 13 12 Raul E. Cisneros, Univision Hosts Meeting to Discuss Challenges, Solutions , U.S. Census Bureau, Oct. 16, -groups , https:// 2020census.gov/en/partners/partnerspotlight -archive/univision -tv. html. 484 35. Additionally, with respect to the organizations that Defendants derisively call \"community activists, \" the official field operations plan for the 2020 Census highlights the necessity of working with these \" trusted voices \" in order to gain trust in the community and im- prove the likelihood of an accurate count. In his depo- sition during N.Y. v. Department of Commerce , Dr. Abowd stated that part of the Census Bureau 's effort to communicate and convince the public to fill out the Cen-sus included \"recruiting partner organizations \" and later described community organizations as \" a source of advice and outreach to many of the populations that we \u2014that it 's important to have partnerships with when you collect the data. \" 14 Importantly, Dr. Abowd stated these trusted part- nerships are important during field operations (i.e., \"when you collect the data \"), and the Census is currently in field collecting data, which means now is the key time to shore up community partnerships with Latino organ-izations. In his own expert report submitted in the cit- izenship question case, Dr. Abowd explained on page 15 that trust can be a barrier in communities with low re- sponse rates and that having the so -called trusted voices is critical to getting an accurate final count. 15 In this very section of his September 2018 expert report, Dr. Abowd mentions the National Association of Latino Elected Officials (NALEO) as one of the \"major organi- zations \" they will need to work with as a trusted voice. The Census Bureau 's \"trusted voices \" in the Latino 14 Deposition of Dr. John Abowd in State of New York v.

U.S. Dep' t of Commerce, at 15 (Sept. 21, 2018). 485 community, including Spanish -language media and or- ganizations such as NALEO, state clearly that the PM will make data collection more difficult, as explained clearly in paragraph 23 above and paragraph 35 of my August 7 declaration. Indeed, this is consistent with ex- tensive research by Census ethnographer de la Puente (2004) who writes that: \"based o n this research it ap- pears that Immigrant centered community -based or- ganizations could be important conduits that attract dis- trustful and growing undocumented populations. \" 36.

TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS EXPERT REPLY DECLARATION OF MR. JOHN THOMPSON I. Introduction 1. On July 21, 2020, President Trump issued a Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce on Excluding Illegal Aliens from the Apportion-ment Base Following the 2020 Census (in the re- mainder of my statement, I will use the term \"Memorandum\" to refer to this document). 492 2. I prepared and executed a declaration for this case on August 6, 2020 ( \"Declaration \").1 In my Declaration, I stated: \"It is my opinion that the effects of the Memorandum on the current macro environment are likely to be as great if not greater than the addition of a citizenship question. Therefore, immigrants and the families of immi-grants will be reluctant to participate in the Nonresponse Followup ( \"NRFU \") and many will not be enumerated. It is also likely, in my opin- ion, that this reluctance to participate will ex-tend to other hard -to-count populations as well. The issuance of the Memorandum has signifi- cant ly increased the risk of larger total and dif- ferential undercounts, relative to previous cen- suses. \" 3. The Census Bureau conducted the 2019 Census Test, a nationally representative randomized ex- periment designed to study the potential impact on self -respon se of including a citizenship ques- tion on the 2020 Census questionnaire. 2 This was a well- designed randomized control test that compared the effects of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census questionnaire. I have carefully read the final report for this test, and the results are consistent with and, in fact, bolster the opinion that I expressed in my Dec- laration. 1 See State of New York, et al. v. Trump, et al. , 20- CV-5770 (JMF), and New York Immigration Coalition, et al. v. Trump, et al. , 20-CV-5781 (JMF), Doc. 57. 2 US Census Bur eau, 2019 Census Test, Final Report , December 30, 2019. 493 4. Because the test found that there was no statis- tically significant difference in overall self - response rates between households th at re- ceived a questionnaire with the citizenship ques- tion and those that received a questionnaire without the citizenship question, the Census Bu- reau concluded that the addition of a citizenship question would not have affected staffing needs for NRFU. However, the Census Bureau, by design, did not investigate what effect the inclu- sion of the citizenship question would have on in-creasing undercounts of immigrant and hard -to- count communities. Furthermore, as I will dis- cuss below, adequately staffing NRFU is not sufficient to obtain a complete and accurate enu- meration of the tradition ally hard -to-count pop- ulations. 3 5. Importantly, the 2019 Census Test contained ad- ditional findings that I believe are relevant to understanding the likelihood that the Memoran-dum will negatively impact response rates, and the potential for the Memorandum to signifi-cantly increase the risk of larger and total un- dercounts relative to previous censuses. 6. In particular, the 2019 Census Test found that in some areas and for some s ubgroups, there were statistically significant lower self -response rates for the test questionnaire with the citizenship question than for the test questionnaire without 3 It should be noted that if the Census Bureau fails to meet its hir- ing goals for NRFU, then undercounts would most likely follow. 494 the citizenship question. These differences were observed for the following: Mail respondents. Tracts designated to receive bilingual materials. Tracts with greater than 4.9 percent noncitizens. Tracts with greater than 49.1 percent Hispanic residents. Tracts with between 5.0 -20.0 percent Asian residents. Housing units within the Los Angeles Regional Census Center and New York Regional Census Center boundaries. 7. In addition, the proportion of those who identi- fied as Hispanic (and were listed as the first per- son on the questionnaire) was statistically signif-icantly lowe r for the treatment with the citizen- ship question. 8. These results indicate that the citizenship ques- tion would have seriously affected the propen- sity of many of the hard -to-count communities to self-respond to the 2020 Census. As I dis- cussed in my Decla ration, it would follow that they would also be less likely to participate in NRFU resulting in undercounts of immigrants and the families of immigrants, as well as all of the traditionally hard -to-count communities. Accordingly, there would be a signific ant risk that these undercounts would be larger than were observed in previous censuses. 495 9. In conclusion, the 2019 test further demon- strates that the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census questionnaire would lower self - response for popula tions at risk of being under- counted. This bolsters my opinion that the Mem- orandum will have a similar, if not greater, effect on the macro environment in which the 2020 Census is being conducted, particularly for NRFU. 10. The Census Bureau must do a lot more than simply hire enough enumerators to meet their staffing goals for NRFU in order to achieve a fair and accurate count of all populations and ar- eas. They and their partners 4 must create the kind of macro environment that convinces the traditionally hard- to-count populations to fully participate in the 2020 Census, and importantly to accurately respond in NRFU. 11. The Memorandum is a major barrier preventing the Census Bureau and its partners from creat- ing such a macro environment. Furthermore, it is my opinion, that a timely ruling from a court enjoining the Memorandum would greatly help the Census Bureau and its trusted partners in 4 In my original Declaration, I discussed the Census Bureau's part- nership program. These partners include advocacy organizations, local governments, religious leaders, and many other community or- ganizations. The Census Bureau recruits these partners to help de- liver messages to the communities that they work with about the im- portance of responding to the census and the confidentiality of these responses. A critical component of the message from trusted voices is that the Census Bureau does not share any identifiable infor- mation with any outside entities including law or immigration en- forcement. 496 their efforts to convince hard -to-count popula- tions, such as immigrant populations, that they can trust the Census Bur eau and should respond to the census. 12. As explained in my Declaration, the role of trusted partners was developed during my ten- ure at the Census Bureau before the 2000 Cen-sus, and used to great effect in both the 2000 and 2010 Censuses to help reach har d-to-count pop- ulations. The Memorandum is limiting what has previously proven to be a very effective pro-gram to help increase census responses because it undermines the message that the Census Bu-reau is trustworthy and is not seeking to single out immigra nts or individuals without legal sta- tus. 13. A court order enjoining the Memorandum would mitigate the damage because it would allow trusted partners to better explain during their outreach that all individuals will in fact be counted for apportionment, an d bolster the advocacy that these partners do within their communities about the trustworthiness of the Census Bureau \u2014supporting the point that the Census Bureau is not singling out immigrants and individuals who do not have legal status. Messaging refuting the proposal in the Memorandum would help im-prove the effectiveness of efforts by the Census Bureau and its trusted partners to convince in- dividuals to respond to the 2020 Census during NRFU. And it would help the Census Bureau better carry out i ts mission to conduct a fair and accurate enumeration in the 2020 Census. 497 Executed on Aug. 24, 2020 at Bend, Oregon.

DONALD J. TRUMP , IN HIS OFFICIAL CAP ACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , ET AL ., DEFENDANTS ORDER Before: RICHARD C. WESLEY , United States Circuit Judge, PETER W. HALL, United States Circuit Judge, JESSE M. FURMAN , United States District Judge At the oral argument scheduled for September 3, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. , the parties should be prepared to ad- dress the following topics and questions: Standing, specifically the components of trace- ability and redressability. The parties should be sure to differentiate between the two theo-ries of harm that Plaintiffs allege \u2014the \"appor- tionment harm\" and the \"Census count harm,\" see ECF No. 150, at 29\u2014 and whether or how each harm relates to, and would be redressable by, the requested relief. More specifically, assuming Plaintiffs are cor- rect that the Presidential Memorandum has a chilling effect on Census participation, whether and how would the requested relief redress that injury? How effective must a remedy be 499 to meet the redressability requirement? To the extent that the NGO Plaintiffs have diverted, or will divert, res ources to address the Presi- dential Memorandum, would the requested re- lief redress that harm? Additionally, to the extent that the NGO Plain- tiffs have diverted, or will divert, resources to address the Presidential Memorandum, in light of Clapper v. Amnes ty International USA , 568 U.S. 398 (2013), must those expenditures be made in response to injuries that are them- selves sufficiently imminent and impending to satisfy Article III to constitute cognizable in-jury? Ripeness, both constitutional and prudential, and particularly with respect to the apportion-ment harm. If the Court agrees with Plaintiffs on both the threshold issues of jurisdiction and justiciabil- ity and the merits of their statutory or consti- tutional claims, should it enter a preliminary injunction or grant summary judgment? Does Plaintiffs' showing of harm bear on that ques- tion and, if so, how? If the Court rules in Plaintiffs' favor, can it grant effective relief without granting relief against the President himself ? Each side should anticipate having 20 -30 minutes for its oral argument. Only one lawyer from each side will be permitted to speak on a given issue. 500 SO ORDERED. Dated: Aug. 31, 2020 New York, New York _______________/s/_________________ RICHARD C.
