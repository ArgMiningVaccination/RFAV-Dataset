Being the dominant dosha, any Vata disturbance makes the body-mind vulnerable to disease. A fall cleanse will both allow you to support your Vata, and clear out summer's accumulated heat and toxins, which are Pitta imbalances. Whether you are affected by these common symptoms or not, a fall cleanse will calm your nervous system, support your sleep, give your digestive system a reset, cleanse toxins, strengthen your immunity, and protect your health for the winter ahead. The benefits of a fall cleanse will last you for months and support a healthier and happier fall/winter season. Ayurveda Fall Cleanse is a 2-week gentle cleanse, fully supported and taught over 4 weekly virtual classes. Classes include training, Q&A, handouts, and recordings. * 2023 classes start on Thursday, Oct 5, 2023 and run for 4 weeks. The suggested dates for the actual cleanse are Oct 10-23, 2023, and these are the dates that I will be doing the cleanse along with you. These are the dates shown in the calendar. I will provide an editable copy of the cleanse calendar in case you want to schedule different dates. When you register for Ayurveda Fall Cleanse, you will receive everything you need to confidently complete your cleanse successfully at a time of your choosing, with access to the class recordings and a support community for 3 months. Each class includes training, Q&A, slides, and handouts. * Includes recordings and a Member's Area with community commenting feature for 24/7 access to Andrea and the community for support. We'll start with cleanse preparations, and get you ready to start the Pre-Cleanse Phase of clean eating and simple dietary and herbal protocols. This class is all about preparations for the Active Cleanse phase, which involves new protocols and non-fat cooking techniques. We will talk about the best way to flush the digestive system, and steps to take during your Post-Cleanse phase. The right reintegration strategy can greatly extend the benefits of your cleanse and ensure the best possible results from your efforts. Andrea believes in the innate power of individuals to reverse their pain and chronic disease naturally and joyfully. Through her courses, programs, and coaching, she compassionately empowers her community to resolve the root causes of their physical, mental, and emotional imbalances with individualized food and lifestyle habits that form the foundation for a healthy and flowing life.
