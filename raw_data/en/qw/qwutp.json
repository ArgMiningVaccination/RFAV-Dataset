The Foundation was given approval by the FDA to organize and conduct this meeting, which was an online-only event due to COVID-19, making it the first PFDD to be hosted exclusively in this format since the agency began holding PFDD meetings in 2012. Held on June 9, the four-hour meeting allowed health care providers, FDA officials and drug developers to hear directly from patients and caregivers, specifically regarding their experiences and perspectives on living with chronic hepatitis B, to better inform these and other key stakeholders about the patient perspective. By incorporating personal anecdotes and firsthand experiences, the FDA can enhance its decision-making in terms of drug development and clinical design with relation to hepatitis B. The PFDD meeting focused on two formal topics: 1) Living with chronic hepatitis B: symptoms and disease impacts, and 2) Perspectives on current and future approaches to treatment. A panel of four individuals for each topic shared their opinions and experiences to begin the dialogue. An FDA facilitator was responsible for leading each discussion. Audience members who were viewing the webcast also were able to participate in the discussion by sending in comments on the Foundation website or by calling in. Additionally, participants online who are living with hepatitis B, or family members of someone living with HBV, were encouraged to participate in live polling with a series of questions and to submit questions and comments. The June 9 meeting had over 650 attendees and the Foundation received over 300 email comments from around the globe. Chari Cohen, DrPH, MPH, the Foundation's senior vice president, organized and led the meeting. \"The discussions and comments helped to validate what we've long known to be true, that living with hepatitis B is difficult and often extremely so,\" Dr. Cohen said. \"Better understanding the lived experiences of hepatitis B patients is critical for industry and government leaders, who will be making decisions that may genuinely improve quality of life, and even save lives.\" Overall, the meeting documented the significant physical and emotional impact for people living with hepatitis B, which leads to reduced quality of life and affects family and social relationships, as well as education and careers for many people. Major themes discussed were fatigue, shame and isolation, stigma and discrimination and fear of dying prematurely from liver cancer. Participants discussed major challenges with current treatment including finding a knowledgeable clinician to manage their hepatitis B, cost of medication, and the burden of taking a daily pill for many years. PFDD participants stressed a strong desire for future treatments that will result in loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and reduced risk of liver cancer over a finite treatment period.

Commentary from hepatitis B expertsGOING GLOBAL with the B the Voice Story Bank Building on the great success of the Hepatitis B Foundation's #justB storytelling campaign, this summer we launched our new, international \"B the Voice\" Story Bank. By gathering the stories of people around the world affected by hepatitis B, this initiative will document and share the impact that hepatitis B has on individuals, families and communities. Doing so is essential, the Foundation believes, to continue the momentum toward finding a cure for hepatitis B and achieving the goal of eliminating hepatitis B worldwide by 2030. It is critical for people living with hepatitis B worldwide to share their experiences and become part of global elimination efforts. People living with hepatitis B have the opportunity to serve as educators and advocates, helping to raise the priority of hepatitis B as an urgent public health problem. Patient stories are valuable and can help improve awareness and change policy and practice at local and national levels. Patient advocates and storytellers can lead the way leading to decreasing stigma and discrimination, and increasing care and treatment, just by sharing their stories! \"Centering the voices of people living with hepatitis B is critical to raising awareness, combating stigma and discrimination, as well as encouraging more people to speak out or take action in other ways,\" Rhea Racho, MPAff, the Hepatitis B Foundation's public policy and program manager, said. \"That's true whether it means getting tested for hepatitis B, talking to a doctor, educating family or community members about prevention or advocating for resources and policies to support countrywide hepatitis B elimination.\" The goals of the campaign are to increase awareness and advocacy, decrease stigma and discrimination, and promote testing, vaccination, linkage to care and treatment to help save lives. The international B the Voice Story Bank is off to a fast start. To date, more than 16 people from at least 10 countries have submitted stories for the new program. Ultimately, we would like to have people sharing their hepatitis B stories in countries around the world. If you are living with hepatitis B and want to share your story, please fill out our story collection form online at www.surveymonkey.com/r/bthevoice. We already have 40 U.S.-based storytellers, who have been leading education and advocacy efforts since May 2017, when we launched our #justB campaign. The archive of the #justB campaign, which has nearly 40 first-person video segments, is hosted on the Hepatitis B Foundation's website, www.hepb.org. The Hepatitis B Foundation is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure and improving the quality of life for those affected by hepatitis B worldwide through research, education and patient advocacy.

Most participants stated that mild, limited side effects would be acceptable. There was strong interest in participating in future clinical trials that might lead to a functional cure, as long as trials would not be too disruptive of daily lives and participants had adequate safety information on experimental treatments. In addition to the PFDD, the Foundation collected patient experiences through an online survey and in-depth phone interviews. Almost 2,000 people from 99 countries responded to the survey, and 24 people participated in the phone interviews. The results coincide with what we learned from the PFDD meeting and also highlighted the different experiences and challenges faced by people living in different countries. For example, outside the U.S., more people documented experiencing stigma and discrimination, and had difficulty finding and affording care and treatment for their hepatitis B. The complete report from the June 9 PFDD is available now on the Hepatitis B Foundation website and the FDA also links to the report from their website. All of the experiences collected from the PFDD meeting, the survey and the interviews will be used by the Foundation to help advocate for the needs of people living with hepatitis B and ensure that drug and clinical trial development take the needs and concerns of patients into account. PATIENT-FOCUSED DRUG DEVELOPMENT MEETING New hepatitis delta treatment approved by European Commission Hepcludex (formerly Myrcludex B), a new drug for hepatitis delta virus (HDV), recently was approved by the European Commission for prescription in Europe and has been launched in Germany, France and Austria. Throughout the fall of 2020, MYR Pharmaceuticals of Germany, which now has the license for Hepcludex, will be working with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom to begin the process of seeking approval there. Toward the end of this year and into early 2021, the company will begin discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Hepcludex may help to control hepatitis delta better than interferon and it has been demonstrated in clinical trials to lower hepatitis delta virus levels and reduce liver inflammation. For decades, hepatitis delta, the dangerous coinfection of hepatitis B, was thought to only affect about 5-10% of the estimated 300 million people worldwide with chronic hepatitis B infections. With insufficient data and funding for research related to this complicated virus, until recent years there have been limits on accurate prevalence data, effective diagnostic tools and skilled physicians to manage hepatitis B and delta coinfection. Publications in 2019 by Miao, et al.; Chen, et al.; and Shen, et al., have helped to reveal a possibly more accurate picture of the burden of hepatitis B and hepatitis delta co-infection, providing meta-analyses that comprise data from hundreds of thousands of hepatitis B patients and the general population. While it was previously thought that 15-20 million coinfections existed globally, this new research suggests the number may be far greater, between 48-74 million.

The Foundation welcomes three new staffers Ed Tate came on board in spring 2020 as director of communications and marketing, leading these efforts for the Foundation, Blumberg Institute and Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center. Tate came to our organizations from a pharmaceutical and medical technology trade association. He previously was director of communications for Rutgers University's Office of Research and Economic Development, executive vice president of a Philadelphia-area public relations agency and media relations director for Educational Testing Service in Princeton. Evangeline Wang and Beatrice Zovich recently joined the Foundation as public health program coordinators. Wang will be working on Philadelphia programming and outreach, helping with the Hep B United and Hep B United Philadelphia newsletters, social media messaging and state and citywide projects to address hepatitis B. She graduated last spring from Arcadia University with a bachelor's in public health and had worked as an intern at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Zovich will be coordinating Hep Delta Connect as well as CHIPO, the Coalition Against Hepatitis for People of African Origin. She also will be working on other public health programs locally and nationally. She has an MPH from Temple University with a Global Health Certificate and has spent the last several years working in Philadelphia and New York City with marginalized communities, specifically those with people experiencing homelessness and living with serious mental health challenges.Ed Tate Beatrice Zovich Evangeline Wang Hepatitis B Foundation | B Informed | Fall 2020 | hepb.org 34 Hepatitis B Foundation | B Informed | Fall 2020 | hepb.orgFamily/Drug Name Mechanism Company Website USA Status Interferons Mimic naturally occurring infection-fighting immune substances produced in the body Intron A (Interferon alfa-2b) Immunomodulator Merck, USA merck.com Approved 1991 Genentech, USA gene.com Approved 2005 Nucleos(t)ide Analogues Interfere with the viral DNA polymerase enzyme used for hepatitis B virus reproduction Epivir (Lamivudine) *Inhibits Dipivoxil) *Inhibits Sciences, USA Approved 2002 Baraclude (Entecavir) *Inhibits viral DNA USA Tyzeka (Telbivudine) *Inhibits polymerase Novartis, Switzerland novartis.com Approved 2006 Viread (Tenofovir) Inhibits viral DNA polymerase Gilead Sciences, USA gilead.com Approved 2008 Vemlidy (TAF or Tenofovir Alafenamide) Prodrug Gilead Sciences, USA gilead.com Approved 2016 Levovir (Clevudine) Inhibits viral DNA polymerase Bukwang, S.

By Timothy Block, PhD, Chari Cohen, DrPH, MPH, & Maureen Kamischke; May 2020 JUST 10 YEARS AGO, interest in finding a cure for hepatitis B virus (HBV) spiked. Western interest in Asia, where HBV is an enormous health problem, and the growing prosperity in China, fueled global excitement and possibility. The success of curative therapies for hepatitis C virus further raised expectations that a cure for HBV was within reach, as well. Were those expectations unrealistic? Was there over-promising? Where are we now? A \"functional\" cure would be a drug that causes sustained loss of viral DNA and loss of surface antigen (HBsAg) in the blood. We all want an HBV cure that makes people living with HBV at no greater risk for liver disease, including liver cancer, than people without HBV. Since determining if a drug can actually achieve that kind of clinical benefit would take too long (perhaps a decade or more), a more practical definition of cure has emerged. This is the \"functional\" cure, which relies upon specific \"markers\" or \"surrogates\" of disease. It is hoped this surrogate provides a \"prediction\" of a clinical cure. So, is even a \"functional\" cure a realistic goal? It is now known that even the currently available medicines for HBV can achieve the sustained \"off drug, sustained virological responses\" embodied in the \"Functional Cure, \" in at least some individuals. However, this occurs in only a small number of people. We hasten to add that research is making it clearer who with HBV would be likely to experience this benefit from the currently available drugs. But more research and innovation are critical. Recent advances in the scientific understanding of new viral and immunological antiviral targets, and new experimental systems, are leading to innovations in drug discovery. We know of at least 48 drugs currently in development, of which 27 are already in clinical trials! This is a huge leap from 2010 (See Table 1). Moreover, the new drugs are not just \"me too\" drugs, repurposed from research in other disease areas. Many are \"First in class, \" hitting HBV therapeutic targets that have never been previously attempted. This shows just how far we have come, and how much more HBV research is being conducted today compared to 10 years ago. However, finding treatments and cures is a challenge and a long road \u2014 and we must be prepared for ups and downs. The likelihood that a specific drug for any disease or condition will be effective, let alone be a \"cure, \" is fairly low. Fewer than one in five drugs that make it to clinical trials are ever \"approved\" by the FDA for use. And we are likely going to need a combination of drugs that complement each other in order to have even a functional cure for HBV. So, we need many more than just one drug to survive the development process. Impressive progress toward an HBV cure has been made, but we are not there. Until very recently, commercial, philanthropic and government investment in HBV research has lagged.We have little doubt that important, effective new drugs that help with sustained virological responses, and greatly improve clinical outcome, are possible, and are being developed. However, as confident as we are about what is possible, we want to be honest about how difficult and expensive this process is, and the extent to which progress is constantly threatened. As new drugs fail in their clinical trials, which is inevitable, pharmaceutical and drug development companies may become frustrated. New, more \"business\" attractive diseases and pathogens may emerge. Business investment may lag. And each new health crisis will distract from HBV research and add additional temptations and priorities, that will distract from the cause of an HBV cure. The COVID-19 crisis is an example. HCV was a previous example. To keep the research going, we need other sources of funding support \u2014 this could include multi-country federal funding and support from corporations and nonprofit health-focused funds. Unfortunately, there continues to be little interest to prioritize hepatitis B \u2014 which is baffling for a disease the impacts almost 300 million people worldwide and kills almost 900,000 people each year. We suspect this has something to do with the lack of a global voice for hepatitis B. We need people who are impacted by hepatitis B around the globe to raise their voice and demand that hepatitis B be prioritized as a global health threat. This can help motivate country leaders and funders to put forth more resources and support towards finding a cure. In the past decade, impressive progress toward an HBV cure has been made, but we are not there, yet. Until recently, commercial, philanthropic and government investment has lagged \u2014 and there is still not enough prioritization or funding to eliminate hepatitis B. This is a call to action for us, at the Hepatitis B Foundation, and those around the world that we engage with. We cannot let up on our effort. It is critical that organizations such as the Hepatitis B Foundation, ICE-HBV, World Hepatitis Alliance and others \u2014 as well as individuals around the world \u2014 keep up the advocacy. Together, we remain steadfast in our efforts, and hope to keep filling the pipeline of innovations, as scientists work towards finding a cure for HBV.About the Authors Timothy Block is president and co-founder of the Hepatitis B Foundation and Baruch S. Blumberg Institute. Chari Cohen is senior vice president of the Hepatitis B Foundation and associate professor of the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute. Maureen Kamischke is director of international engagement of the Hepatitis B Foundation. Operations, research continue despite PANDEMIC DESPITE THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC, the Hepatitis B Foundation and its two sister organizations, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute and Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center (PABC), have continued operations with limited interruptions. The Blumberg Institute remains committed to hepatitis B and liver cancer translational research, and those affected should know that the Institute's researchers remain focused and passionate about fighting those diseases. But everyone also has been affected by the COVID-19 crisis, and some of the work that has been ongoing at the Institute can contribute to meeting the COVID-19 challenge. The Blumberg Institute's pandemic- related research is focused on repurposing existing drugs and methods for treatment of COVID-19. Timothy M. Block, Ph.D., president and co-founder of the Institute, Foundation and PABC, says a team is researching a drug candidate they developed years ago to determine if it could be effective against COVID-19. \"We have been working on antiviral drugs for two decades at Blumberg,\" Block said. \"Our focus has been hepatitis B, liver cancer and other cancers, but some of the drugs we have discovered appear to have activity against other viruses.\" Dr. Block recently received a grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to support that work. In fact, when the state announced 23 new grants in August, four of them, totaling more than $1.1 million, went to researchers at the PABC. Policy program expanded, manager named We have launched a new Hepatitis B Prevention Policy Program aimed at increasing adult hepatitis B vaccination rates in the United States. The program will build out and expand on our policy and advocacy initiatives while increasing engagement with federal and state public health agency partners to improve hepatitis B prevention and vaccination infrastructure and strategies. The new program manager is Michaela Jackson, who has been on the Hepatitis B Foundation's public health team since 2018.Top scientists lined up for Blumberg Institute online seminars DISTINGUISHED SPEAKER SEMINARS The Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, which is the Hepatitis B Foundation's research arm, has assembled a strong lineup of prominent researchers in hepatitis B and liver diseases for its online Distinguished Speaker Seminars, which are free-of-charge and open to anyone interested (pre-registration is required). Upcoming seminars are listed on page 8 in the Calendar of Events and on the Institute's website, www.blumberginstitute.org, where you also can watch recordings of previous Blumberg 2020 Research Seminars. 6 Hepatitis B Foundation | B Informed | Fall 2020 | hepb.orgTo commemorate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO) annually honors a group of Health Heroes, whom they identify as \"individuals who are committed to improving the health of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.\" Rhea Racho, MPAff, Hepatitis B Foundation Public Policy and Program Manager, is among this year's Health Heroes. Last year and in 2018 that honor was accorded to Foundation co-founder Joan Block, RN, BSN, and our Deputy Director of Public Health, Kate Moraras, MPH.Foundation staffer is a Health Hero Michaela JacksonExpanding our home and research facilities Construction has begun on a $19 million expansion of the non- profit Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center (PABC). Managed by the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, which is the Hepatitis B Foundation's research arm, the PABC is home to both the Blumberg Institute and the Foundation. Blumberg Institute researchers are focused on hepatitis B and liver cancer. The PABC, which is one of America's most successful life sciences incubators, will be expanded by 40%, providing new labs, office space and more. Work should be finished by Ocxtober 2021. You can follow the project on the Biotechnology Center's website and social media. For three decades, the Hepatitis B Foundation has worked to find a cure and improve the quality of life for those living with hepatitis B worldwide. In 2021, we will celebrate our 30th Anniversary. The Foundation's annual Crystal Ball Gala event, which is set for April 30, will serve as a focal point of our celebration, with a special event in December of 2021 to serve as the culmination. The theme for the 30th Anniversary is \"Celebrating 30 Years Together.\" Along with the events we are planning, the Foundation will continue to raise awareness and spread the word about this major milestone and, more importantly, the Foundation's many accomplishments. In January, we will launch a video series highlighting selected leaders, supporters, partners and professionals such as Joan and Tim Block, former Congressman Jim Greenwood, and Nobel-Prize Winner Dr. Baruch S. Blumberg. The Foundation also will convey the good news through social media and share anniversary messages and content in our newsletters. We are building a 30th Anniversary website to highlight the history of the Hepatitis B Foundation, including the establishment of our two partner organizations, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute and the Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center. The Foundation will apply the 30th Anniversary brand to all of our special events and regular communications to commemorate this exciting milestone. In 1991, Paul and Janine Witte with Timothy and Joan Block were deeply moved by the plight of a young family affected by hepatitis B. To the dismay of the Wittes and Blocks, they found there was no place for this family to turn for support, nor was any organization devoted to finding a cure for hepatitis B. With the personal support of Dr. Blumberg, who won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the hepatitis B virus, and the help of the Bucks County community, the Wittes and Blocks responded to this unmet need by working tirelessly to establish the Hepatitis B Foundation. Today, the Hepatitis B Foundation has since grown from a grassroots effort into a professional organization with a global reach. nn YES!
