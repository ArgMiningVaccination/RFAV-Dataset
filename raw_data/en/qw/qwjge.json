Sometimes people suffer from excessive feelings of dread or panic, even when they are not in immediate danger. In some cases, the complex cascade of emotional and physical sensations encompassed by [the term Anxiety](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9948) is so pervasive that it becomes a chronic mental health condition. [TCM and Acupuncture offer a natural, highly effective treatment option to reduce anxiety symptoms](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1755-5949.2011.00254.x). We are currently living in a particularly harsh reality in which human life is filled with setbacks and potential danger. There is always a chance that something bad might happen to you or someone close to you. In recent weeks, [the coronavirus pandemic](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) has understandably created a pervasive sense of worry amongst the population, and the numbers of people filling prescriptions for anxiety-related medications, antidepressants and sleep aids has [increased dramatically](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/anti-anxiety-medication-prescriptions-have-spiked-34-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-04-16). Anxiety is clinically defined as a persistent feeling of worry, accompanied by physical sensations such as heart palpitations, dizziness, and sweating. Sometimes people describe it as being similar to the sensations you feel when you've tripped and you're falling, except that the scary feeling persists for a long time; it doesn't go away even when nothing is happening. Anxiety disorder is a very common mental health condition experienced by people of all ages; every year about [20% of Americans](https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics) seek medical help for symptoms related to anxiety. If you are feeling heightened levels of distress that are affecting your ability to sleep, focus, or care for yourself or others, please be assured that help is available. Acupuncture and other [TCM treatment modalities offer a safe alternative](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/what-we-treat/) to pharmacological drugs that can cause side effects and potentially lead to dependency and withdrawal symptoms. A [qualified acupuncturist](https://myartofwellness.com/our-doctors/) will conduct an in-depth consultation and create a program designed to specifically address each patient's individual combination of symptoms and life situation. What Are the Symptoms of Anxiety? Doctors classify types of anxiety disorders into several sub-categories, including Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Social Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Phobia-related Disorders, and Separation Anxiety (anxiety in children). The most common symptoms of various types of Anxiety include: - Rapid or labored breathing - Rapid heartbeat or tachycardia - Feeling \"on edge\" or irritable - Sweating [Difficulty concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Memory loss](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Difficulty sleeping - Fatigue - Stomach upset - Anxiety headache Each person will present with a unique combination of symptoms and sensations, along with her own \"triggers\" or things that seem to cause the symptoms to manifest. Most people who seek medical care for their anxiety symptoms are either prescribed psychiatric tranquilizing medications such as Xanax or Atavan, referred for psychotherapy, or both. Some doctors use antidepressants such as Zoloft, Lexapro or Prozac to treat anxiety. These Selective Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) may help reduce symptoms in some cases, but all of these types of medications can cause side effects and lead to dependency. TCM and Acupuncture treatments not only address specific symptoms of anxiety, but address the root causes of the disorder. TCM Deals With All Types of Anxiety Disorders Anxiety, like [ depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and other mental health disorders, carries the disadvantage of being \"invisible.\" Other people, and even many medical professionals, simply can't see physical evidence of the problem, and can't empathize with the suffering involved. Well-meaning family members and friends might offer suggestions to \"calm down\" or reminders to stay positive, all with the implication that nothing is really wrong or that \"it's all in your head.\" Being plagued with constant self-doubt further amplifies the problem. Anxiety is a real health issue, and TCM offers effective modalities to address it. Modern medicine has only recently begun to make the [connection between emotional and physical](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18589562) maladies. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), on the other hand, has acknowledged for centuries that the mental, emotional and physical experiences of human beings are all inextricably linked. Sometimes a physical injury or traumatic experience can set the stage for a mental health problem. For example, a car accident that creates even minor injuries to the body might trigger future panic attacks, phobias, or P [ost Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Other times, a mental health condition like chronic [Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/generalized-anxiety-disorder-gad) can affect sleep, eating, and other behaviors to such an extent that a person becomes more susceptible to illness and disease. It would not be surprising to see an increase in cases of Agoraphobia (fear of leaving one's home) and [Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD,](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-ocd-2510663) which sometimes causes compulsive hand-washing and cleaning as well as hoarding behaviors) as a result of the current coronavirus pandemic. People who experience multiple [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) may be diagnosed with panic disorder. Anxiety disorders already tend to lead to feelings of isolation. Now that most people are spending far more time alone or sequestered with family members and roommates, already existing feelings of fear may be exacerbated. People who have never had to cope with anything beyond normal, mild anxiety may suddenly find themselves feeling real panic for the first time. Additionally, some might feel guilty or ashamed about reaching out for help for these problems when there are so many other people hurting for more apparent reasons. But there is real help for anxiety, and getting that help during this time of crisis makes sense. There is no need to suffer. [Find acupuncture near me](https://myartofwellness.com/) to address anxiety symptoms and the root causes before the problem becomes more severe and chronic. Acupuncture for Controlling Anxiety Conventional medicine generally attributes anxiety disorders to abnormal functioning of the brain and nervous system. The feelings associated with anxiety - the emotional sense of worry, the breathlessness and restlessness of the body, the behavioral instincts to freeze or to run - are all exaggerated responses to stress. [Stress is the body's natural reaction](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/stress/) to perceived dangers in the environment. When something threatens us, the sympathetic nervous system kicks into gear, and the adrenal glands pump out the hormones that flood the body with energy-what is often referred to as the \"fight or flight\" response. Normally, once the threat has passed, adrenaline will take some time to move through the body and then dissipate, and a feeling of relaxation is eventually restored. When a person has an anxiety disorder, this hormone release can be triggered by thoughts, and the fear of the physical response itself becomes a part of the vicious cycle. [Acupuncture treatment has been shown](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/integrative-mental-health-care/201810/acupuncture-anxiety) to act upon the nervous system, facilitating the release of serotonin, endorphins and noradrenaline, all of which contribute to relaxation and a sense of well-being. Stimulation of specific points have been clinically proven to reduce perceived feelings of anxiety as well as reducing the heart rate and blood pressure of patients. Auricular acupuncture, which specifically uses points on the ear, has been shown to be effective for anxiety. This method is particularly useful, as patients can be fitted with a tiny needle that can be stimulated with gentle pressure as needed to help alleviate symptoms as they appear. [Auricular acupuncture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2206232/) has been used for thousands of years, not only in China, but all over the world. [Modern critical analysis has demonstrated that auricular acupuncture](https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/Fulltext/2001/02000/Auricular_Acupuncture__A_Potential_Treatment_for.49.aspx) affects the parasympathetic nervous system in ways that help alleviate pain and reduce anxiety symptoms. Electro-stim acupuncture, or [electro-acupuncture,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29705474) is another effective modality used by TCM doctors. How Does Acupuncture Benefit Anxiety Relief of Panic Attacks? One of the great advantages of acupuncture treatment over conventional methods of talk therapy and pharmacological intervention is that it has an immediately discernible effect. Patients often leave an acupuncture session with a deep sense of calm and relaxation. Reports of improved sleep usually follow quickly. In addition, the long-term effects of regular acupuncture sessions are cumulative, and people [report a sustained decrease](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Blog/723-panicattacksshenmen) in episodes of anxiety and panic attacks. One controlled study compared groups of patients treated with a regimen of acupuncture with moxibustion to a group prescribed a type of benzodiazepine medication. The [results showed higher efficacy](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1952-acupuncture-outperforms-drug-for-anxiety) in reducing anxiety symptoms among the patients receiving acupuncture. TCM Doctors' Top 10 Suggestions on Self Care for Anxiety Here are some natural remedies for anxiety you can utilize at home. With consistent practice, these habits will help alleviate stress and reduce anxiety symptoms. - Meditation for anxiety- Those struggling with anxiety may well be tired of hearing well-meaning friends suggesting they \"Relax!\" or \"just breathe.\" But studies have shown that regular meditation practice can significantly reduce anxiety. There are many methods; it is important to find a method that works for you. [This study](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/9/6/751/1664700)suggested mindfulness meditation may be especially effective. - Waterfall Meditation - In this exercise, imagine yourself at the base of a waterfall. As you breathe in and out, picture the water gently raining down on you, trickling down each route until the tension inside you releases, relaxing parts of your body one section at a time. Allow your entire body to enter a peaceful and relaxed state. Let the image of the water wash away any stress or anxiety that burdens you. - Physical Exercise - By now it has been well documented that regular exercise is good for health in every way, lowering the risks of all types of chronic disease. Movement helps [reduce anxiety symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632802/)by reducing adrenal reactivity, increasing the output of endorphins and endogenous (naturally produced in the body) opioids, and even stimulating the growth of new brain cells. It is also suggested that exercise functions as a type of exposure therapy. When people become more used to the sensations of an increased heart rate, heavier breathing, and sweating due to cardiovascular activity, it increases their tolerance for these same symptoms when they appear as part of an episode of anxiety. If you are able to go for a walk or run while following social distancing guidelines, it is especially helpful to get some sun exposure, as well. Put on some music or a favorite workout video; rhythmic movement that engages the large muscle groups provides great benefits. - Tai Chi and Chi Gong -These ancient traditional forms are \"moving meditations\" that work upon the endocrine circulatory, and nervous systems to balance energies and strengthen Qi. - Good Eating Habits - Caffeine, sugar, processed and spicy foods can trigger anxiety. Complex carbohydrates like brown rice, barley, quinoa and oats are relaxing, as are nuts and chickpeas, which contain tryptophan. Now is a good time to become more intimately involved with preparing dishes at home, and this process can also be soothing: a mindfulness exercise that results in a healthy meal! Your TCM provider will provide more detailed instructions for a nutrition program for your specific situation. - Stress Reduction - [Reducing stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/)goes hand in hand with reducing anxiety. Especially now, carefully manage your daily activities so as not to become overwhelmed. Allot a short period of time for checking the latest news and catching up with friends; then consciously disengage from screens and virtual realities. Social media has already been called into question for its apparent increase of anxiety among teenagers, but it has a real impact on people of all ages. Comparing your situation and surroundings to the carefully curated content you see on sharing platforms can make you feel pressure, shame, a sense of inadequacy. Commit to being grounded in your immediate surroundings and grateful for the blessings that are in your life right now. Recognize that, while it is important to [educate yourself about the novel coronavirus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-and-prevent-covid-19-coronavius-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), many of the opinions being expressed online are not informed and are designed to provoke an emotional reaction. Avoid reading comments that you know might be triggering. - Sleep Better to Combat Sleep Anxiety - Repetitive, OCD intrusive thoughts and restless energy within the body can make sleeping difficult when you are experiencing sleep anxiety. Cortisol-another stress hormone-levels tend to rise in the evening, and many people register this sensation as anxiety at night. Eating simple carbohydrates like sweets or chips suppresses cortisol and offers a temporary feeling of relaxation. But consuming these foods or alcohol to artificially reduce stress leads to less restful sleep later. Dr. Tan and Dr. Cai can offer many suggestions for how to modify your habits to [achieve a better night's sleep](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Learn a Language - Distance learning has quickly become an integral part of our lives. Many people are using their time at home to learn new skills. Now is a great time to [learn a new language](https://speechling.com/blog/how-to-learn-a-language-staying-at-home-during-the-covid-19-global-pandemic/). Studying and practicing will help you focus your mind and instill a sense of accomplishment to help relieve anxiety. - Structure Your Days - Even though daily life has taken an unusual turn, maintaining a consistent schedule helps keep hormone and energy levels more consistent. Rise and retire at about the same time each day. Eat regular meals. Set aside hours for work and much-needed time for rest and relaxation. Creating a structure for your life helps you feel that you are controlling what you can. - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Exercise - Use this exercise when feeling anxious or suffering a panic attack. This helps you ground yourself in reality by actively using your five senses. Look for the things, and then name them out loud. - 5 - Count five things in your immediate environment that you can SEE. - 4 - Count four things near you that you can TOUCH. - 3 - Count three things near you that you can HEAR. - 2 - Count two things you can SMELL. - 1 - Count one thing you can TASTE. How to Use 3 Acupressure Points for Anxiety Relief Acupressure is a technique patients can use anytime for symptom relief. Apply gentle, firm pressure to these points. - Liver 3 is a grounding point that helps redirect rising energy downward. Located between the first and second toes, you will find a very tender spot. Try applying gentle pressure here to alleviate irritability, headaches, TMJ, and anxiety. - You have probably seen the bands people sometimes wear around their wrists to prevent nausea. These are designed to put pressure on Pericardium 6, which quells queasiness. The point is located between the two tendons on your wrist, two fingers up from the wrist crease. Pressing on it is immediately calming. It helps to open the chest, as well, so if you feel tightness in the chest or shallow breathing, use this point. - Shen Men, called the \"Spiritual gate\" point, releases heart fire, excitement, anger, irritation and anxiety.

[ How to Treat Stress with TCM and Acupuncture ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) by Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Nowadays, we hear pretty constantly that everyone is \"under a lot of stress.\" But what is stress? [Stress](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11874-stress) is a natural reaction in the body to any difficulties or changes that we face in life. Stress affects health at every level: physically, mentally, and emotionally. Stress can bring a lot of negative effects to your health and your career. [TCM and acupuncture offer a unique treatment to stress management](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/stress/) without any of the side effects that anti-depression drugs cause. [Acupuncture treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/stress/) often brings people immediate stress relief, as they leave the clinic feeling calm, relaxed, sometime even euphoric. But TCM and acupuncture can also provide meaningful reduction in the toxic effects of long-term stress over time. In this [article](https://myartofwellness.com/dont-let-stress-hijack-health/) we will discuss stressors, stress symptoms, and how to combat the negative effects of stress on your body, mind and spirit. What Are Stress Symptoms? \"But he was so young!\" \"But there wasn't anything wrong with her!\" Have you heard of someone you know-maybe a friend or a relative, maybe someone famous you admire-dying, suddenly? It's hard to take it in; we don't want to believe that these things can happen, especially when someone is only middle aged. It forces us to look at our own lives. Are we taking the time to take care of ourselves? Or are we rushing around from one crisis to another, always stressed out? Stress is the body's natural reaction to any difficulties that appear in our lives, physically or emotionally. It's a normal response to adverse conditions. It's actually healthy to experience some low-degree, short-term stress occasionally, because this lets the body practice protecting itself. Unfortunately, our modern lifestyle creates a lot of stressful situations for us to endure, and most people are not taught or encouraged to release the effects of stress from their bodies and minds. When stress builds up, it can lead to health problems. It may be that when you go to an M.D. who orders tests, nothing shows up in a scan or a blood test. But that does not mean you don't have a serious problem. Chronic stress can cause a variety of symptoms and illnesses and affect overall health and well-being. Many diseases, including [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037818/), can be linked to stress. Job changes, the illness or death of a family member, relationship issues, financial or business difficulties, caring for and educating children - we all face these stressors at one time or another. For some people, the problems begin in childhood. If a child experiences trauma-parents fighting, or bullying at school, for example-that kind of severe stress can develop into permanent health problems as he or she grows up. What Does Stress Do to Your Body? Stress can affect all systems in the body. It starts with the central nervous system and the endocrine system. When something unusual happens, the brain gets a signal: something needs to be done! The brain sends out a message, alerting the body to start producing hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline increases the heart rate, elevates the blood pressure and boosts energy supplies. Cortisone increases sugar in the bloodstream, enhances the brain's use of glucose and increases the body's ability to repair tissues. The body's initial reaction to stress is to protect itself. But if you are under this kind of stress constantly-think about it-your body will keep producing adrenaline, causing the heart to beat constantly at a high rate and keep the [blood pressure high](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/). Eventually, the body will become [exhausted](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), leading to [chronic fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3148561/), hypertension, diabetes, risk of stroke and heart attack. The lungs become vulnerable, which can trigger asthma, and allergic reactions such as [eczema](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-eczema-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or [hives rash](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hives-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). When the cortisone level is high, it causes a constant immune response. Eventually, the immune system becomes imbalanced. When stressful periods are prolonged, the body can lose the ability to shut off the alert that says something is wrong: what we call the \"fight or flight\" response. Say you send a soldier to a war zone. The soldier's job is to shoot the enemy. When the enemy approaches, the soldier starts to shoot. But if the soldier is there fighting for days, weeks, years, and his job is to keep shooting, at some point he stops recognizing who is an enemy or who is an ally. He will shoot anybody. Likewise, the body loses the ability to recognize what is good and what is not good. Stressful life events are often a main factor in the onset of [an autoimmune condition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568997215002621), like ALS, MS, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis. When a person has experienced shocking, perhaps life-threatening, events such as being attacked or surviving in a war zone, he or she may exhibit [PTSD symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). When a person is under chronic stress, the liver has to work much harder. We rely on the liver to clean the blood, but if it gets tired out, it can't do its job. So toxins don't always come from outside the body; they can come from stress, when the body becomes more acidic and toxic, increasing inflammation and risk of cancer. Liver Qi problems are a major factor in women's health problems, including [PMS and PMDD](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). When we're upset, the appetite changes, causing us to eat too much or too little, affecting our nutrition. Many digestive problems are related to long term stress: heartburn and reflux, ulcers, cramping, nausea, vomiting, obesity, constipation, bloat, IBS, diarrhea. Sometimes stress shows itself externally, on the [surface of the skin](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-aging-skin-with-cosmetic-acupuncture/), as with eczema or psoriasis. Stress causes the muscles to become tight and makes the nerves more sensitive. This causes more pain and inflammation. The reproductive system and the sex drive are, naturally, affected by hormone imbalances. For women, this can cause PMS, fertility issues related to ovarian function, blocked tubes, or unstable uterine lining, and more severe menopausal symptoms. For men, long term stress can cause the testosterone level to drop, the prostate and the urethra to become inflamed and prone to infection. With all of this, it is no wonder that libido and sexual function [(erectile dysfunction)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) take a dive, too. Stress Management by TCM and Acupuncture TCM is based on the philosophy that the body, mind, and spirit are inextricably linked. It is only in recent years that Western science has begun to acknowledge the connection between the emotions and our physical health. In TCM, we always look at the whole person. If the emotions are out of balance, the body's functions will be, too. Keep in mind that without a spirit, the body is nothing more than a container: a box. Likewise, if the body is not healthy, the spirit doesn't have a good home to live in. That is why we treat stress, emotional fluctuations, and balance the body's organ systems all at the same time [with acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/). Acupuncture is one great way to help you manage your stress and protect you from permanent health damage. Even though you may not be able to avoid stress, you do have the power to manage stress better so that it can't build up, hurt you internally, and turn into serious health issues. Top 7 Habits for Stress Relief Every day, we encounter people and situations that cause frustration. Sometimes several minor incidents over the course of a day can build up until we feel we are at the end of our ability to cope. Other times, we are hit with a big problem that we have no choice but to face. These stressors are unavoidable. What we can do is pay attention to our responses, and train ourselves to respond more calmly when situations arise. Here are some things you can do in your daily life to manage stress. - Change the way you view problems. It is human nature to protect ourselves from danger by recognizing the negative energies coming at us. But we can become too accustomed to looking for the \"dark side.\"A lot of time we needlessly take things negatively. Say you wake up to the sounds of a bird, chattering in a tree. You can think, \"Ah, the beautiful music of nature!\" Or you can get annoyed. Same situation, different response. Learn how to think positively. Often I ask a patient to \"show me your hand.\" They show me the palm side, but don't think to look at the back of the hand. In the world, nothing can exist that has one side only. This is the concept of Yin and Yang; nothing is only good or only bad. There is good and bad in everything. Learn to pay attention to both, but \"accentuate the positive.\" - Connect yourself to nature; consciously choose to make yourself one with the Universe. Connect to energy outside of yourself by going to the mountains or the beach, walking barefoot on the sand and listening to the waves. Sit by a river and feel the flow of the water. When you feel anger inside, go out and face something - a mountain, or the woods - breathe out, remove that negative energy from your body, absorb positive energy; make that exchange. By doing this, you gain the perspective of playing a small, yet integral part within the greatness of the universe. This will release stress and give you new strength. - Learn some techniques: Tai Chi, yoga, meditation, Qi Gong. Tai Chi, for example, trains you physically and emotionally at the same time, cultivating your internal Qi. Deep breathing will make your body more balanced and calm; exhale negative energy and inhale fresh air and energy. - Engage in regular physical activity, especially cardiovascular varieties. Walk, jog, bike, swim. Going outdoors, getting fresh air and sunshine, is even more beneficial than going to the gym. - Encourage yourself to engage in some social activity. Stress can cause sadness and depression. People tend to close themselves off. So, you must push yourself to go out, keep up your activities. Talking with friends will release the stagnation from your body and mind. Sign up to volunteer; helping other people will reduce your stress. - Take time for a hobby. Whatever you enjoy: walking, swimming, reading, listening to music, going to dance class, fishing, golfing. Do it regularly. But it should be something active for your body or mind. Inactive pastimes- like watching television or playing video games, surfing the internet-may seem relaxing, but they can actually increase stress long term. Keep time spent on those passive activities to a minimum. - Work on your sense of humor! When you laugh, you are happier and so are others around you. Be generous with your positive energy and others will be there to help you when you need it. Managing stress will pay off, not only by making you happier, but probably also allowing you to enjoy a longer and healthier life. Practicing stress management will help you to recover from existing conditions and prevent other issues from becoming serious in the future.

[ What is Multiple Sclerosis and How to Manage MS with TCM & Acupuncture ](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-multiple-sclerosis-and-how-to-manage/) Multiples Sclerosis is autoimmune disease, Traditional Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture are very helpful to improve these condition. Dr.Tan's Case and Testimony Mr. M- a healthy 50-year old Caucasian gentleman\u2014first visited my office Art of Wellness Acupuncture a few years ago. As an attorney, he had been working very hard to support his two daughters, who were both in college. About four months ago, the onset of serve lower back pain along with tingling in his left leg changed his life completely. He saw several doctors, had a number of x-rays and an MRI which revealed a moderate bulging disk on L4-L5. He tried different pain pills, NSAIDs, and underwent three months of physical therapy, none of which had helped. Recently, he had been experiencing numbness and weakness in his left leg, and was suffering from depression due to his inability to carry on with daily work and regular activities. When he talked to me, I noticed that he constantly rubbed his eyes. I asked if he felt any abnormalities in his vision. He answered yes, and that he had periodic occurrences of blurred vision. When I suggested that he showed me how he walks, I noticed his poor balance. He tended to fall on his left side because his left leg did not seem to follow his motion. Then I checked his knee and ankle reflex and found that they were excessively active. I was almost certain that the condition that made him suffer so much in the last few months was not a simple bulging disk or sciatica; it was a disorder of the central nervous system-Multiple Sclerosis. Immediately, referred him to a neurologist and suggested that he have a brain and cervical MRI. Two weeks later, he came back to my office with a confirmed diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. Mr. M. is just one of 200 patients who are diagnosed with MS every week in the United States. There are about 400,000 people in the U.S. and 2.5 million patients who are suffering from this disease in the world. Cause of MS [MS is an autoimmune disease](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS) in which infections or environmental changes can confuse the body's defense system. Sometimes a foreign antigen mimics a group of the body's own proteins. When the immune system response by mounting an attack against these foreign invaders, it inadvertently destroys the foreign antigen along with any similar antigens, including the body's own tissues. A recent study shows that a virus called adenovirus type 2 looks remarkably similar to the composition of the protective covering around the spinal cord and parts of the brain\u2014the myelin sheath cells. The attacks of the immune system of this virus along with the mistaken attack on the myelin sheath is believed to be the ultimate cause of multiple sclerosis [Common symptoms](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269) of MS - numbness or tingling, usually in the leg or arm - muscle weakness - dizziness - spasticity - pain (moderate to severe) - Ataxia - Tremor - Slurred speech - Blurry, double vision or blindness - bladder malfunction - bowel dysfunction - sexual dysfunction - depression - euphoria - cognitive abnormalities - fatigue Most commonly, MS first manifests itself in a series of attacks followed by complete or partial remission as symptoms mysteriously lessen. These symptoms, however, will return later after a period of stability. This is called relapsing-remitting (RR) MS. Treatment of MS Unfortunately, there is no cure for MS yet. In Western Medicine, the treatment focuses mainly on decreasing the rate and severity of relapse. Beta interferons, anti-cancer drugs (to weaken the immune system), and steroids are commonly used for the treatment of MS. These medicines can reduce the number of MS lesions, delay the progression of the disease, and provide symptomatic relief for the patient. In TCM, a condition called \"Wei Syndrome\" with symptoms similar to MS, was documented 2000 years ago in a classic Traditional Chinese Medicine book called Emperor Classic Medicine. Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine has been involved in the treatment ever since. MS patients who have tried [acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/) report improvement in pain, spasticity, numbness and tingling, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and bowl, bladder function. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important for the MS patient. This includes: - Getting enough time to sleep and rest. Go to bed early - Exercise regularly. Tai Chi and Yoga are very good to help patient relax, balance and with muscle strength - Balanced diet, a lot of vegetables and enough protein from white meat - Stress management - Daily meditation and positive thinking - Staying connected with friends and joining a support group [How to reduce and prevent inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) Patient Story- Gilly I was diagnosed with Relapsing Remitting MS in 1991 and I had no idea what a crazy, unpredictable journey I was about to embark on. I woke up one morning, tried to get out of bed but my legs were like jello, I had no balance and had double vision. I was given a spinal tap and MRI and lesions were detected on my brain & cervical spine. When first diagnosed, my neurologist put me on one of the few FDA approved medicines for MS which don't cure the disease, but delay the progression. For that I inject myself daily and have done so for 17 years For the first 7 years after being diagnosed, I experienced relapses (flare up of symptoms) on average twice a year. The treatment for relapses was a 5 day course of steroids administered through IV, followed by 12 days of oral steroids. The relapses affected my motor skills the most, especially walking but after a treatment of steroids, I was almost as good as new. My friends suggested I try acupuncture. I was recommended to Dr Tan because he had studied MS in China. * Dr Tan has been monumental in my life. He has given me treatments for a multitude of injuries I've suffered over the years due to frequent falls and is an expert in pain relief. He treats me for stress relief which contributes my general wellbeing. Dr Tan is very knowledgeable about Western medicine and MS treatments so I always ask his opinion. I've been diagnosed with MS for 21 years and feel fortunate that Dr Tan has been treating me for a large part of that time. Although I partake in Western medicine, I know that Western medicine only treats the symptoms but Eastern medicine treats the cause of the symptoms. My MS has progressed to the stage that I now use a wheelchair full time. I go to acupuncture for preventative care. My immune system needs extra help especially during cold & flu season. I am very aware that MS is a 'designer' disease, and no two people have the exact same symptoms. I would encourage anyone with MS to avoid stress, keep up a healthy immune system and try to stay positive and happy, because your emotional state affects your physical being. [ How to Sleep Better with Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. Do you suffer from [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/) or do you have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep? [Acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/) and [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-traditional-chinese-medicine/) offers many solutions on how to sleep better without sleeping aids. TCM stresses the importance of getting a good night sleep. Chinese medicine has tools such as; exercise, Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, and meditation all which can help you get a good sleep so you can function at the highest potential throughout the day. Below you will read about TCM and the history it provides in regards to sleep and the many tips that can help you get the best sleep tonight. History of Sleep with TCM Sleep is a part of the interplay of yin and yang: yang energy is dominant when we are awake and active, and yin energy rules sleep. Night is yin; daylight is yang. This is all in keeping with the holistic, universal nature of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) theory. Our bodies are designed to work with the movements of the earth, sun, and moon. When a person experiences insomnia, either hard to fall asleep or wake up often then difficult to fall back to sleep, there is a lack of balance. The body is out of sync with its environment. The yang energy is taking over, or not interplaying with yin appropriately. In TCM terminology, \"Shen\" is the spirit, the energy which controls our mental activities and thought. During sleep, Shen \"hides\" in the organs - predominantly the Heart and the Liver - resting, so that it can function with sharpness during our waking hours. Insomnia, in TCM, is often viewed, then, as a problem of the Heart system, or the Liver system. If one of these major organs is unable to \"house\" the Shen, then the Shen will wander restlessly, causing sleeplessness. Protective Qi cycles through the body continuously, but it follows different paths along the meridians at different times of the day and night. During the day, protective Qi, which fights off pathogens, moves through the yang meridians, and during the night, it flows through the yin meridians. If you find yourself waking up at a particular hour in the middle of the night every night - or feeling sluggish at one particular time every day - it is probably related to some deficiency of Qi in that area. Between the hours between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m. the liver meridian is actively supplying Qi to the liver system so that it can clean toxins from the blood. Then, between 3:00 and 5:00 a.m., the freshly cleaned blood and energy is being delivered to the organ systems. It is especially important to be sleeping soundly during that time. The liver does all the heavy lifting of cleaning and detoxifying the blood and therefore, the whole body. If the liver is stinted of its full rest and rejuvenation, night after night, we can be left feeling truly sick and tired. Sleeplessness may be the central problem for some people; for others, it's just a part of the big picture. Many people have gone so long without restful sleep that they have become used to it and just consider it their new \"normal.\" When you come in to [Art of Wellness](https://www.myartofwellness.com) for a visit, our doctors will ask many questions to get a sense of what kind of sleep problems you're having, including other symptoms that may be related to the same root issue. - Having trouble falling asleep may be related to an excess condition of the liver and/or gall bladder. - Waking easily and then having trouble falling back to sleep may point to a deficiency of the Heart Yin or too much internal heat. - Nightmares may indicate a gall bladder meridian problem, while repetitive, literal dreams (about work, for example) might indicate a heart/spleen problem. Sleep problems can be related to other conditions, such as depression, menopause in women, fibromyalgia, [chronic fatigue syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and cardiovascular disease. How to Make Winter A Time of Rest and Renewal Getting a good night sleep is always important, but in the Wintertime. Nature and our bodies are really asking us to rest more, and more deeply, than we do during other times of the year. This is a time for the body to store energy. If we go at a frantic pace, and behave the same way we do in the middle of summer, we will become depleted. Unfortunately, our current culture does not necessarily support this idea. It seems we are asked to do more and be more than ever during the rush of the winter holiday season. It really is vital to prioritize \"doing less\" in order to preserve good health.

Visit the link and read some TCM tips for sleep. Top 20 Tips For Creating Calm so That You Can Get A Good Sleep - Choose carefully how many social commitments you make. You don't have to attend every gathering - only the ones that are meaningful to you. If it feels more like an obligation than fun, make a plan to stop in, extend your greetings, and then leave early. This way, you won't overeat, drink too much, and you can still get to bed a reasonable hour - Don't [exercise](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/17-tips-to-sleep-better)too vigorously close to bedtime. An evening walk, or gentle program of Tai Qi or yoga will help you work out excess energy with stimulating you further - Deep breaking techniques: using you lower abdomen, inhale deeply. Hold it for about 5 seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat ten times. Deep breathing exercises not only relax your mind, but they help to dispel negative Qi from the body before bed - Create an oasis of calm in your bedroom, with good ventilation, restful colors and no devices. Set a time, half an hour to hour before going to bed, when you will discontinue watching TV or looking at your computer and phone. The light stimulus from the screen is not helpful for falling asleep. Reading a book, writing in a journal, coloring in a coloring book, are all activities that help you wind down for the night. - Change your [eating habits](http://choosemyplate.gov): many people wake up around 3 AM and find it difficult to fall back asleep. This may be cause by low blood sugar level due to the over activity for the adrenal gland. For a better sleep, try to balance your blood sugar level daily by eating small portions of food about every 3 hours and drinking a glass of warm, low fat milk or eating a handful of nuts\u2014such as raw walnuts or almonds, before bedtime. It helps to balance your blood sugar. Waking up in the middle of the night can be caused by fluctuating insulin levels - the result of too much sugar or alcohol in the evening. - Keep your feet warm by soaking them in hot water for 15-20 minutes before bedtime. Also, massaging the bottom of the feet can help to stimulate key kidney points. Give a good, fast rub to the center of your soles for a few minutes to warm them while getting into bed. - Stimulating acupressure points just before bedtime can be helpful. Use your thumb or fingertip to apply moderate pressure and rotate clockwise for 2-3 minutes. - Shen Men, called the \"Spiritual gate\" point, releases heart fire, excitement, anger, irritation and anxiety. - Tai Chong, a liver point can help alleviate insomnia due to excessive heat or stagnation in the liver, which can cause feelings of depression, stress, sadness. - Take off any constricting clothing (underwear), and wear loose, comfortable pajamas for bedtime. - There is an old saying: \"sleep like the crescent moon.\" Sleeping in a fetal position on your right side puts your heart above your liver, which helps drain blood, giving the heart some relief and extra nourishment to the liver. It also helps food move through your digestive system properly. - Keep away from interruptions: Turn off your phone after dinner or keep a note book by your bed. If you keep thinking about sometime important to do, write it down. - Listen to calm and relaxing music - Sleep and wake at the same time every day, yes that includes weekends. Do not stay in bed for too long even when you do not have to go to work. Your body needs to have a regular sleep-wake cycle in order to function at its maximum - Reduce the water temperature for baths and showers: when the water temperature is well about body temperature, your body heat increases. Then when you get out of the water, your body heat decreases. Try to avoid such fluctuation of the body temperature. - Keep your bedroom simple and clean: limit the number of electronic devices such as TV's, computers from your bed room - Do not play video games at night - Obey the 20-minute rule: if you do not successfully fall asleep in twenty minutes, get up and do something else until you feel tired and ready to sleep again. - Waterfall Meditation. In this exercise, imagine yourself at the base of a waterfall. As you breathe in and out, picture the water gently raining down on you, trickling down each route until the tension inside you releases, allowing your entire body to enter a peaceful and relaxed state. - Oneness Meditation. Just as in the Waterfall exercise, picture yourself standing beneath a waterfall. This time, however, instead of relaxing parts of your body one section at a time, allow your entire body to relax simultaneously. Let the image of the water wash away any stress or anxiety that burdens you. If you have tried all of these things are still not sleeping well, please come see us to find the underlying problem.
