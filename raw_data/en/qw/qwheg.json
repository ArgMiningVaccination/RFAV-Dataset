Two of the most come models of health and healing are Western Medicine and Eastern Medicine. These two approaches are vastly The principles of yang and yin are one of the oldest and most fundamental concepts in the Chinese philosophy that date back to the 3rd century BCE or earlier. According to this principle, each and every substance in the world has an inseparable and contradictory opposite like old-young, female-male, dark-light etc. The two opposites are said to attract and complement each other and that the core of each substance contains the element of the opposite. Chinese culture was greatly affected because during the invasions by the nomadic tribes, philosophy gave hope to the people. The three philosophies are Confucianism, Daoism, and Legalism. Confucianism was started by Confucius, who wrote The Analects, around 551 BCE. Daoism was started by Laozi who lived around the same time period as Confucius. And Legalism was started by Hanfeizi during the Zhou Dynasty. The United States can be easily defined as one of the world's biggest power house, with technological and medical advances like no other. However, America is anything but perfect, as demonstrated in The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, a tragic journey written by Anne Fadiman about Lia Lee, an epileptic girl who unfortunately surrenders to brain-death due to cultural dissimilarities and misunderstandings. After the getaway from the communist forces in Laos, the Hmong, including the Lees, became United States refugees. Although the Hmong escaped the dangers of their homeland, an overwhelming task of adapting to the American society consumes them. Fadiman presents the assimilation as an essential yet difficult part of a Hmong refugee through Locura is a culture bound syndrome that affects Latin Americans and Hispanics, regardless of where they are born, in the United States or South America (Jilek 2001:5,9). Locura has also been documented in immigrants from the Caribbean Islands (Razzouk 2011:517). In Columbia, Locura is also known as \"ataques de locura\" madness attacks, it is attributed to a spell known as \"maleficio\". Locura is commonly associated with other culture bound syndromes thru out Central and South America, such as ataques de nervious (nervios) and possession syndromes (Pi\u00f1eros 1998:1425). How does Smith view the relationship between Confucianism and Taoism? Provide one or more example of how he sees them as complementary. The Daodejing, similar to the Analects, was written during the Warring State period, a time when the Zhou kingdom disintegrated into a series of feudal states fighting for power\u2014a time of fragmentation and chaos. The Daodejing was written for Daoist, educated men, and people interested in Daoist teachings. The Daodejing was written to inform people, therefore, it was written as if speaking to a student. Laozi, the author of the Daodejing, although has no proof of existence, is believed to be a keeper of archives in the royal court and a teacher who travelled around China. The purpose of the Daodejing is to articulate Laozi's ideas on Daosim and inform people about his philosophy. In the real world, love is a very fragile force. Love can be easily broken and manipulated by multiple other outside forces. In A Midsummer Night's Dream, the two most basic themes are the chaos and order that are the causes of all the actions that take place. Chaos versus order in A Midsummer Night's Dream also is a representation of Yin and Yang. Yin, represents the bad or darkness in the world, this is the chaos in the play. Yang represents the good or light in the world, this is order. When Yin and Yang, death and life, bad and good, work together, this creates a balance, a peace. In the play, chaos and order together make the love balanced, or even peaceful. Without chaos, order would separate the love, and without order, chaos would tear the love apart. Both of these forces work together in the forest to keep the love between the characters in peace. Asians began immigrating to the United States in 1849. The immigrants from Asia and America of Asian descent have been writing in America since the 19th century. But, Asian American literature as a branch of writing came into being only in the early 1970s. Since then, the field of Asian American literature and of Asian American literary criticism has grown rapidly. The Chinese immigrated to America in order to escape the turmoil of war fought against Japan. The Chinese Americans contribute to a major population among the emigrant settlers in America. Taoism is an indigenous chinese religion and a philosophy which has roots from ancient shamanism. It has lived through centuries in China as a religion aside Confucianism and Buddhism and as a philosophy aside Confucianism. As a philosophy it is mainly the opposite of Confucianism, because Confucianism praised laws and order but Taoism is more about people having minimal restrictions in order to live happily. The Taoist religion was created from the Taoist philosophy and as a philosophy and religion it has had a huge influence in China and in eastern Asia. Although, as a religion it would outline all the seven dimensions it is debatable if it is more of a philosophy. Taoism's open-mindedness has kept it almost original and unchanged The Chinese practice and exercise of Falun Gong has a short history. But it plays an important role in China for political reasons. The history of Falun Gong is only ten years old. But the ideas and practices is based on a tradition throughout the entire history of the Chinese civilization. The practice is a different form of qigong. The cultivation of qi or the energy that flows throughout the human body and the universe, has been a theory in many different practices of Chinese culture. Even the traditional Chinese medicine is partially based on the theory of qi. During the ten years history, Falun Gong has developed millions of participants and followers. It also got a lot of attention from many others including the Chinese government. However Chinese women suffer from the unfair notion for thousands of years. The basic requirements of being virtuous women are \"Three Obediences and Four Virtues ()\". The \"Three Obediences\" were \"obey your father before marriage (); obey your husband when married (); and obey your sons in widowhood ()\". And the \"Four Virtues\" were \"Female virtues ()\", \"Female words ()\", \"Female appearances ()\" and \"Female work ()\". (Sun, 2015). The three obediences and four virtues occurred in ancient China society. It is a set of basic moral principle for women in Confucian. These instructions first appeared in the \"Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial\" and in the \"Rites of Zhou.\" (Kelleher, 2005) to describe traditional ceremonial and behavior. Today, the medical world recognizes two tips of medicine, the conventional medicine known as Western and the Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). Although, they are by logic completely opposites in practice the have some similarities. The first one, is accepted in most of the advance countries. Though, the second one is having a lot of attention not just from de common people but from the biomedical system as part of their usual treatments. That is why the differences and similarities between Chiropractic as part of the CAM world and the Biomedical Model are getting smaller and closer together. Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) consider all forms of therapies outside the field of medical practice. CAM is attracting more attention within the context of health care provision and health sector reform.Use of CAM remains common in developing countries and is increasing knowledge and concern in developed countries.Cultural beliefs and practices often lead self-care, home remedies or consultation with traditional healers particularly in far as in rural and Bedouin communities. (16) In a cold winter day, have you ever observed white smoke come out from your mouth when you exhale? Have you ever thoroughly felt the force pressing on your skin when wind blows? These are some of the states that \"qi\" appears in our daily lives. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TMC), qi plays as a fundamental component from time to time explaining its ideas. Theories of both Chinese and Western medicine exist for helping people maintain good health and away from deceases. Western medicine relies more on scientific proof \"Western medicine places strong emphasis on the physical structures of the body, which are made up of different organic and inorganic substances, proteins, tissues and cells.\" (Shen Lung Ltd, 2002) Unlike western medicine, TMC originates and relies very much on Chinese philosophical theories. And the theory of qi is one of them. This essay will be explaining what qi is in Chinese medicine, including its general concept, movement and flow in human body, functions, what would be "}
