In a sub-study of the phase 2/3 the COV002 trial 74 (NCT04400838), 54 HIV positive male participants on antiretroviral therapy 75 (undetectable viral loads, CD4+ T cells >350 cells/ul) received two doses of ChAdOx1 76 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) 4-6 weeks apart and were followed for 6 months. Responses to 77 vaccination were determined by serology (IgG ELISA and MesoScale interferon ELISpot, activation-79 induced marker (AIM) assay and T cell proliferation. We show that 6 months after 80 vaccination the majority of measurable immune responses were greater than pre-81 vaccination baseline, but with evidence of a decline in both humoral and cell mediated 82 immunity. There was, however, no significant difference compared to a cohort of HIV-83 uninfected individuals vaccinated with the same regimen. Responses to the variants 84 of concern were detectable, although were lower than wild type. Pre-existing cross-85 reactive T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike were associated with greater post-86 vaccine immunity and correlated with prior exposure to beta coronaviruses. These 87 data support the on-going policy to vaccinate PWH against SARS-CoV-2, and 88 underpin the need for long-term monitoring of responses after vaccination. 89 90 4 Introduction 91 The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 200 million cases and 4.2 million 92 deaths [1]. Vaccines which have been licensed against SARS-CoV-2 include the 93 AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (AZD1222) adenoviral vectored vaccine, of which 94 over 1 billion doses have been made available worldwide. People living with HIV 95 (PWH) represent a high-risk group for adverse clinical outcomes from viral infections 96 such as influenza and COVID-19, with some evidence for higher hospitalisation and 97 mortality rates [2-6]. This can in part be attributed to a state of immune cell depletion 98 and chronic immunopathology including immune activation and exhaustion which is 99 only partially restored by antiretroviral therapy (ART)[7, 8]. Studies on influenza and 100 tetanus toxin vaccination in PWH have shown that antibody levels post-vaccination 101 were dependent on CD4 T cell count and activated T follicular helper (Tfh) cell 102 frequencies, which can vary widely in PWH [9, 10], resulting in broader concerns over 103 reduced responses to vaccines [11] and specific vaccination guidelines for PWH [12]. 104 Some studies also report that vaccination of PWH may induce immune activation and 105 reactivate the HIV reservoir [13, 14]. 106 107 ChAdOx1 nCov-19 containing SARS-CoV-2 full length spike has been shown to 108 induce potent humoral and cellular immune response in vaccine recipients [15-18]. 109 We recently reported the safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 110 vaccine in PWH up to 2 months post initial vaccination [16] and the durability of T and 111 B cell responses following natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 [19]. There are, 112 however, few studies evaluating the durability of immunity following vaccination 113 against COVID-19 [20, 21]. A recent open label phase I trial showed durable SARS-114 CoV-2 T and B cell immune response up to 6 months following vaccination in adults 115 5 without HIV using a low dose of mRNA vaccine mRNA-1273 [21], with similar results 116 in another study using standard mRNA-1273 dosing [22]. There have been no studies 117 to date reporting the durability of immune responses in PWH. 118 119 Since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, divergent mutations in the viral sequence in 120 the original SARS-CoV-2 strain have given rise to the alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), 121 gamma (P.1), and more recently delta (B.1.617.2) variants of concern (VOCs). 122 Infections with VOCs have become dominant in several countries [23]. Studies of 123 symptomatic disease in fully vaccinated individuals report variable effectiveness 124 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 - alpha (74%), delta (67%) and BNT162b2 - alpha (93.7%), delta 125 (88%)), but with evidence for sustained protection from severe disease [24-26]. 126 Nonetheless, breakthrough infections have been recorded and a significant proportion 127 of the world's population remains unvaccinated [27]. Understanding the ability of 128 immune responses generated in PWH to recognise VOCs is key to informing 129 vaccination strategies, especially in vulnerable populations. 130 131 Pre-existing cross-reactive T and B cell responses in individuals na\u00efve to SARS-CoV-132 2 infection and vaccination to the circulating common cold coronaviruses (CCC) 133 HKU1, OC43, 299E and NL63 have been identified [28-34], however the impact of this 134 cross-reactivity is unclear. While some reports point to a beneficial role in mitigating 135 disease severity and the induction of neutralising antibodies in both vaccination and 136 natural infection [32, 35, 36], others report no biological function [37, 38] or a potential 137 pathological role [39]. 138 139 6 In this open-label, non-randomised sub-study of male participants with HIV on ART 140 (CD4+ T cell count >350 cells/ul) receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, we investigate the 141 immunological landscape six months after vaccination. We evaluate the durability of 142 the cellular and humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs and assess the 143 potential role of cross-reactive CCC immune responses in the modulation of post-144 vaccine responses, presenting evidence for an interaction with the beta coronaviruses, 145 HKU1 and OC43. 146 147 Results 148 Participants 149 PWH (N=54; all male) were recruited as part of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 COV002 150 clinical trial (NCT04400838) in November 2020. Participants had undetectable VL 151 (<50 HIV RNA copies/ml) and a count of 694 cells/\u00b5l (IQR 573.5 - 859.5) 152 at the time of recruitment. Most participants were of white ethnicity (81.5%). Other 153 reported ethnicities were Asian (3.7%), mixed (7.4%) and other (Black; Other; Missing 154 data 7.4%). HIV seronegative controls were provided from the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 155 COV002 clinical trial. All participants received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 4-6 weeks apart 156 and were followed for 6 months (Figure 1a, Table 1). 157 158 Persistent immune activation in PWH before and after vaccination 159 T cell immune activation and exhaustion were assayed at day 0 baseline, day 42 and 160 day 182 after first ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (Figure 1b-g). There were 161 significantly higher frequencies of CD38+ HLA-DR+ expressing CD4+ and CD8+ cells 162 in PWH compared to HIV negative controls, consistent across all timepoints (Figure 163 1b and e, gating strategy in supplementary figure 1a). There was a transient 164 7 increase in the frequency of CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD4 and CD8+ T cells 14 days after 165 vaccination in PWH which returned to pre-vaccination levels by 6 months 166 (Supplementary figure 1c, f). Expression of the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-1 167 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was not significantly different between PWH and HIV 168 negative controls with no statistically significant changes after vaccination (Figure 1c 169 and f). The frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ PD-1 expressing cells fluctuated early after 170 vaccination in PWH but was restored to pre-vaccination levels at 6 months 171 (supplementary figure 1d, g, j and m). The frequency of phenotypically exhausted 172 Tbet (lo) Eomesodermin (Eomes) (hi) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was higher in PWH 173 compared to HIV-negative individuals both before and after vaccination. (Figure 1d 174 and g, supplementary figure 1e, h, k and n). 175 176 Humoral immunity against ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in PWH persists for 6 months. 177 We previously reported detectable antibody levels up to 56 days following ChAdOx1 178 nCoV-19 vaccination in PWH [16]. To determine the further persistence of antibody 179 responses, total IgG for spike (S), receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid 180 (N), as well as neutralising antibody levels were measured at days 0 and day 182. 181 Two independent ELISA technologies were used for binding IgG assays: a 182 standardised in-house total IgG Scale Discovery (MSD) 183 binding assays measuring S, RBD and N antibody levels. Levels of anti-spike IgG 184 measured using the two assays were positively correlated (Supplementary figure 2a 185 and b, r=0.7, p<0.0001 and r = 0.9, p<0.0001 at Days 0 and 182, respectively; 186 Spearman). At day 182 post-vaccination, antibodies to S and RBD but not N were 187 significantly higher than at baseline (S: day 0 = 3/43 [6.9%], day 182 = 35/42 [83.3%]; 188 8 RBD: day 0 = 0/43 [0%] and day 182 = 27/42 [64.2%]) (Figure 2a - c), consistent with 189 observed responses being driven by vaccination rather than infection. 190 191 Importantly, there was no difference in total anti-spike antibody titres in HIV+ and HIV- 192 matched participants measured at 182 days after first vaccination, although with some 193 waning of responses in both groups after Day 56 (Figure 2d; Supplementary Figure 194 2d,e). Pre-vaccine baseline antibody titres correlated positively with early post-195 vaccination timepoints at day 14, and 28 but not 42, 56 and 182 (Supplementary 196 figure 2f, Supplementary table 1). 197 198 We next assessed the ability of antibodies from plasma collected 6 months after 199 vaccination to compete with SARS-CoV-2 for binding to ACE-2 using an ACE-2 200 inhibition assay and to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 using virus focus reduction 201 neutralisation assay (FRNT). FRNT was performed in a randomly selected subset of 202 the cohort for whom we have previously reported neutralisation antibody levels up to 203 day 56 [16]. At day 182 post-ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime, antibodies capable of blocking 204 the SARS-CoV-2 ACE-2 interaction were present at significantly higher levels than at 205 pre-vaccination baseline (Figure 2e) and correlated strongly with anti-RBD antibodies 206 (Supplementary figure 2c). However, at the same time point antibody neutralisation 207 measured by FRNT live virus assay revealed titres below the assay detection limit in 208 nearly all participants (13/14; 92%) (Figure 2f). 209 210 Durable SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses are induced following ChAdOx1 211 nCoV-19 vaccination 212 9 Durability of vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity at 6 months was 213 assessed by IFN ELISpot and T cell proliferation assays. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific 214 ELISpot responses were maintained for 6 months in PWH following vaccination and 215 were equivalent to the HIV negative control group (Figure 3a and b; Supplementary 216 figure 4a). 217 218 For further resolution of the durability of T cell immunity, we used a T cell proliferation 219 assay which also allows distinction of different CD4 and CD8 T cell lineage responses. 220 The spike peptide pool was separated into S1 and S2. Gating strategy is shown in 221 Supplementary Figure 3a. The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific proliferative 222 CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in PWH following vaccination were maintained at 223 levels significantly higher than at baseline for 6 months (Figure 3c - f). Longitudinal 224 responses to FECT controls remained unchanged while PHA responses were back to 225 baseline by day 182 (Supplementary figure 3b and c). There was no difference in 226 the magnitude of the vaccine-specific T cell proliferative responses between the HIV+ 227 and the HIV- cohorts (Supplementary Figure 4f - l). Although T cell responses in 228 PWH measured by IFN ELISpot peaked at day 14 and were then maintained to day 229 182, proliferative responses peaked later at day 42 and then contracted, such that day 230 182 responses were significantly lower than those measured at day 56 (Figure 3c-f). 231 These kinetics are similar to those observed with the anti-S antibody response 232 (Supplementary figure 2d and e). 233 234 Vaccine-reactive T cells are not differentially biased to a specific CD4+ subset. 235 helper (Tfh) cells, we interrogated the phenotype of circulating T cells 237 10 following vaccination (gating strategy in Supplementary Figure 1a). At 6 months post 238 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, we found redistributions in the phenotype of the CD4+ 239 T cells in HIV+ volunteers with increases in (CXCR3+ CCR6-) and Th2 Tfh (CXCR5+ CD4+) 241 (Figure d). None of these populations correlated with anti-spike antibody 242 levels 6 months after infection. Although the hierarchy in cellular composition of the 243 CD4+ T cell subsets was similar in the HIV+ and HIV- cohorts, we found circulating 244 frequencies of Th2 subsets to be reduced while Th1 and Tfh subsets were significantly 245 increased 6 months after vaccination in PWH (Figure 4e, Supplementary Figure 5a 246 - for HIV- control data). 247 248 The activation induced marker (AIM) assay was used to determine the phenotype of 249 vaccine-specific CD4+ T cells 6 months after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (gating 250 strategy in Supplementary figure 5b). Vaccine responses were compared with 251 concurrent HIV Gag and CMV responses (Figure 4f and g). Although AIM+ cells for 252 all antigens tested showed a Th17 bias (Supplementary Figure 5c), similar to HIV-253 Gag or CMVpp65-specific T cells there was no preferential skewing of the SARS-CoV-254 2-specific T responses to any CD4 T helper subset 6 months after vaccination (Figure 255 4h - k). 256 257 Responses to variants of concerns (VOCs) are preserved 6 months after 258 vaccination 259 Humoral and cellular immune responses to the major VOCs were measured 6 months 260 after vaccination. Inhibition of ACE-2 binding for alpha, beta and gamma variants was 261 increased compared to pre-vaccination baseline (Figure 5a), however there was 262 11 statistically significant reduction in ACE-2 inhibition for all three VOCs compared to 263 the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, which was more apparent in the beta and gamma 264 variants (Figure 5b). T cell proliferative responses to VOCs were comparable to the 265 SARS-CoV-2 original strain, except for SARS-CoV-2 CD4 responses to S2 which were 266 moderately reduced across all VOCs tested (Figure 5c - f). HIV+ and HIV- 267 participants had similar magnitudes of T cell responses to S1 and S2 spike proteins of 268 all VOCs tested, with the exception of the CD8+ SARS-CoV-2 T cell proliferative 269 response targeting the S2 protein of the delta variant which showed a modest 270 reduction in HIV+ participants compared to HIV- controls (Figure 5g - j). 271 272 Modulation of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 post vaccination responses by pre-existing 273 cross-reactive immunity 274 SARS-CoV-2 reactive T and B cells exist in unvaccinated COVID-19 na\u00efve individuals 275 (Figure 3a - e, Supplementary figure 2d and e). To determine whether these pre-276 vaccine responses might reflect cross-reactivity to endemic circulating coronaviruses 277 of the alpha (NL63 and 299E) or beta (HKU1, OC43) genera, we also measured 278 responses to these viruses at baseline. 279 280 Based on the T cell proliferation assay, participants were divided according to those 281 with pre-vaccine baseline SARS-CoV-2 immune responses ('baseline responders', 282 (BR)) and those without pre-existing immunity ('baseline non-responders', (B-NR)). 283 Regardless of any pre-existing immunity, all donors mounted an immune response 284 following vaccination, however BR consistently showed higher magnitude CD4+ 285 (Figure 6a and b) and CD8+ T cell (Supplementary Figure 6a and b) responses to 286 SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 most post-vaccination timepoints. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 12 CD4+ S2 (and to a lesser extent S1) T cell proliferation was positively correlated with 288 subsequent post-vaccine proliferative responses targeting the same regions 289 (Supplementary Figure 7b and c, supplementary table 2a - d), which is of potential 290 interest as S2 is associated with regions of homology to other coronaviruses. 291 T cell and IgG responses to the endemic CCCs (HKU1 (clade 1 and 2), OC43, 299E 292 and NL63) in HIV-infected participants remained mostly unchanged by vaccination 293 with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 indicating that vaccination did not boost these responses 294 (Figure 7c, Supplementary Figure 8 and 9) however, IgG responses to SARS-CoV-295 1 and MERS-CoV in PWH were higher at 6 months (Figure 7a,b). 296 297 Focusing on baseline pre-existing responses - and dividing the cohort of PWH into 298 the SARS-CoV-2 BR and B-NR groups as before - participants with baseline 299 proliferative T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike, also had T cell responses 300 targeting the S2 spike regions of CCCs, especially for the beta coronaviruses 301 and OC43 and alpha coronavirus 299E (Figure 6c and d, Supplementary Figure 6c 302 and d, Supplementary table 3). This was supported by humoral responses taken at 303 the same pre-vaccination timepoint, which showed strong correlations between 304 SARS-Cov-2 levels and those of SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV-1 and HKU1 305 (Figure 7d-f; Supplementary Figure 9, supplementary table 4). Phylogenetic 306 analysis of spike sequences shows OC43 and HKU1 are the mostly closely related 307 CCCs to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 7g). These data suggest that prior exposure to beta 308 coronaviruses and responses to the S2 homologous region may potentially be 309 associated with larger and more persistent T cell responses following SARS-CoV-2 310 vaccination. 311 13 Discussion 312 Long-lasting immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 will be necessary to confer 313 protection from severe COVID-19. Although clinical management and effective 314 antiretroviral therapy (ART) have improved long-term outcomes for PWH - especially 315 in resource-rich countries - immunopathology in HIV infected subjects, evidenced by 316 increased immune activation and exhaustion remains significantly high compared to 317 the levels found in HIV uninfected counterparts [7, 40-42], raising concerns whether 318 effective immune responses will persist after vaccination. We show here for the first 319 time in PWH that vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2 persists for at least 6 320 months by most assays, but with evidence that responses are starting to wane. There 321 were no significant differences in responses by PWH and HIV- controls, extending the 322 data from short-term responses reported previously [16, 43]. Study participants were 323 predominantly white males with well-controlled HIV on ART, and therefore one should 324 be cautious extrapolating these data to other populations. However recent data from 325 the USA, Chile and Peru show no significant impact of gender or ethnicity on efficacy 326 of the AZD1222 vaccine [44]. 327 328 We confirm the persistent immune activation - and, to a lesser degree, phenotypic 329 exhaustion - in T cells in PWH on ART, but show that this does not impact the robust 330 humoral and cellular immune responses to ChAdOx nCoV-19 that persist for 6 months. 331 Reports on reactivation of the HIV reservoir and increased immune activation after 332 vaccination in PWH are conflicting [13, 14, 45], and although we found a transient 333 increase in the frequencies of T cells co-expressing CD38 and HLA-DR, this was 334 restored to baseline by six months. Further studies will be needed to determine any 335 impact on the HIV reservoir. 336 14 337 Vaccine design and regimen can skew the quality of the T cell response by the 338 preferential induction of one CD4+ T helper subset over another [46-51]. ChAdOx-1 339 nCoV-19 responses show a qualitative skew towards Th1 phenotype, with 340 increased IFN, IL-2 and TNF-producing T cells shortly after vaccination [18]. Other 341 studies in convalescent cohorts have linked a CCR6+ Th17 cTfh phenotype with 342 reduced disease severity [52]. to others [47, 53], we found antigen-specific 343 CD4+T cells following vaccination were mostly a CCR6+ CXCR3- Th17 phenotype. 344 We did not find SARS-CoV-2 CD4+ T cells biased towards any 345 chemokine-expressing sub-population 6 months after vaccination, possibly reflecting 346 the longer duration between vaccination and analysis than in other studies. Similar to 347 other studies [47, 53], we defined these circulating Th subsets using CXCR3 and 348 CCR6 chemokine receptors. The resulting population based on these 2 markers alone 349 may not be homogenous for one Th subset. Inclusion of other chemokine receptors 350 such as CCR3, CCR4 and CCR8 [54-57] to further delineate Th subsets can provide 351 deeper resolution of the Th bias in total and antigen-specific Th subsets following 352 ChAdOx nCoV-19 vaccination. 353 354 Understanding durability of both humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 - both 355 likely key components of an effective response [52, 58, 59] - is key to understanding 356 long-term protection. When we assessed the longevity of the humoral and cellular 357 immunity in PWH 6 months after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, we found that 358 vaccine-mediated antibodies to spike or RBD remained elevated above baseline and 359 no different to HIV- controls. Similarly, T cell responses to spike were maintained at 360 magnitudes above baseline and demonstrated similar kinetics to HIV- participants. 361 15 Antibody function measured by ACE-2 binding inhibition was sustained at levels above 362 pre-vaccination, however live neutralisation assays did not detect antibodies in the 363 majority of the participants assayed at 6 months. Both assays identified the same 364 participants as low (n = 13) and high (n = 1) responders, and the ACE-2 binding 365 inhibition and SARS-CoV-2 RBD titres showed a strong positive correlation. We 366 speculate that although differences in positive responses between the two functional 367 assays could be as a result of function (neutralisation) versus antigenicity (ACE-2 368 binding inhibition), it could also in part, be due to assay sensitivity and differing 369 dynamic ranges between assays. 370 371 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma has been shown to have effective FC-mediated 372 antibody functions such as antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), 373 antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement dependent 374 cytotoxicity (CDC) [60-62], which are more durable than neutralisation [61]. Non-375 neutralising functions were not evaluated in this study, and therefore we cannot 376 exclude that these are preserved in this cohort of PWH. Total spike IgG antibody and 377 T cell proliferative responses in PWH were significantly lower at 6 months after 378 vaccination compared to day 56. These results suggest detectable but waning T and 379 B cell responses at 6 months. Similar findings were reported for the mRNA-1273 380 COVID-19 vaccine, and found to be age-dependent, pointing to immune aging as a 381 contributing factor [20, 21]. This comprehensive analysis of humoral and cellular 382 immunity is consistent with studies of COVID-19 in healthy adults and PWH showing 383 durable immune responses up to 7 months post infection [19, 59, 63, 64]. Further 384 follow up at 12 months and beyond will be important to determine the longer-term 385 persistence of responses, especially when considering the value of booster doses. 386 16 Furthermore, our study used a short interval between initial and booster dose of 4-6 387 weeks. Current government policy for the United Kingdom and many other countries 388 advise ~8-12 weeks between doses [65], future studies addressing the impact of 389 longer dosing interval on durability of the immune response would be important. 390 391 The emergence of VOCs poses a potential roadblock to ending the pandemic. We 392 found humoral immunity to VOCs at 6 months to be at titres lower than those targeting 393 the original wild type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 strain, albeit still significantly higher than pre-394 vaccination levels. The magnitude of the T cell responses to VOCs were similar to 395 those targeting the WT SARS-CoV-2 strain for most VOCs tested apart from the CD4+ 396 S2 responses. For most of the VOCs, T cell responses in PWH did not differ from HIV- 397 controls. Similar observations regarding humoral immunity have been made with the 398 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 although as most of these studies were done within 2 399 months of vaccination, information on durability of the response is lacking [66-68]. One 400 study assessing T cell responses between 21 - 28 days after full BNT162b2 401 vaccination found no differences between WT and VOC CD4 responses [66]. This 402 study utilised a pool of peptide pools not parsed into its S1 and S2 regions, and 403 only a limited panel of VOCs were analysed. Importantly, emerging data from real 404 world effectiveness studies suggest that vaccination protects against death and 405 severe disease, even following infection with VOCs [24, 26] 406 407 Cross-reactivity from previous CCC infection may impact the measured SARS-CoV-2 408 immune response after vaccination and natural infection [31, 32, 69]. We identified 409 measurable pre-vaccine antibody titres for SARS-CoV-2 S, RBD and N proteins in 410 PWH. Pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 S antibody levels strongly correlated with those 17 of contemporaneous beta coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and HKU1 (of 412 which only the latter is likely to have been experienced by these UK study participants), 413 supporting the hypothesis that these titres result from previous infection with a similar 414 coronavirus and some cross-reactivity across coronaviruses. Supporting the antibody 415 data, the presence of cross-reactive T cells pre-vaccination (based on proliferative 416 potential following antigen challenge) was associated with higher magnitude post-417 vaccination T cell responses. 418 419 There is much debate over the significance of cross-reactive responses. Studies have 420 reported reduced disease severity in patients with CCC humoral responses and 421 regions of high homology to CCC capable of trans-priming SARS-CoV-2 T and B cell 422 responses [31, 32, 35]. Pre-existing immunity was also shown to boost post vaccine 423 responses in low dose mRNA-1273 vaccine [21] although an explanatory mechanism 424 was not reported. Further investigations in large studies would be needed to fully 425 elucidate the impact of baseline pre-existing immunity in post-vaccination response, 426 but we find clear evidence of higher magnitude immune responses in those with cross-427 reactivity. Although our data suggest that responses to CCC may help augment 428 subsequent vaccine responses against SARS-CoV-2, we have no evidence that on 429 their own they are potent enough to impact susceptibility to COVID-19. 430 431 In summary, we present a comprehensive immunological assessment of ChAdOx1 432 nCoV-19 in PWH 6 months after vaccination. We show that despite persistent immune 433 activation in PWH, PWH on ART and HIV-uninfected participants make equivalent T 434 and B cell responses following vaccination. However, both responses showed signs 435 of decline after 6 months. It is unknown what level of immunity is required to prevent 436 18 hospitalisation and mortality, but real-world data suggest vaccination is successful in 437 preventing severe disease and death even in the presence of transmissible and 438 virulent VOC [24, 26]. A booster dose may become necessary in the future to maintain 439 long-term immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 and the VOCs, especially for 440 susceptible cohorts and we must continue to carefully monitor this going forward. 441 Finally, we demonstrate that pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive immune 442 responses to the beta coronaviruses HKU1 and to a lesser extent OC43 are 443 associated with higher magnitude T cell responses following vaccination in PWH. 444 Together these data continue to reinforce the policy of ensuring all PWH are offered 445 vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. 446 19 Methods 447 Study design and cohort 448 The cohort studied in this analysis has been described previously [16]. Briefly, the 449 study comprised people living with HIV in an open-label non-randomised group within 450 the larger multicentre phase 2/3 COV002 trial. The participants in this single-arm group 451 comprised individuals with HIV who were stable on ART under routine follow-up at two 452 London UK National Health Service (NHS) clinics and received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 453 vaccination according to the schedule of attendance. Recruitment was done in HIV 454 clinics at two centres in the UK (Imperial College NHS Trust and Guy's and St Thomas' 455 NHS Foundation Trust). Inclusion criteria were age 18-55 years, a diagnosis of HIV 456 infection, virological suppression on ART at enrolment (plasma HIV viral load <50 457 copies per mL), and a CD4 count of more than 350 cells/L. The inclusion criteria for 458 the COV002 trial have been published in full elsewhere [15]. 459 The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was produced as previously described [17]. 460 Participants received two standard intramuscular doses 4-6 weeks apart. For some 461 assays and where sample availability allowed, comparison was made with age- and 462 sex-matched participants who were HIV negative, aged 18-55 years, enrolled into the 463 main COV002 phase 2/3 randomised clinical trial, and randomly assigned (5:1) to 464 receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or MenACWY by intramuscular vaccination. The 465 dose of vaccine administered was the same across both groups. Only participants 466 receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine were used for comparison. Full details of the 467 COV002 HIV-negative cohort have been published previously [15]. 468 A screening visit where a full medical history, examination of all participants and blood 469 tests to exclude biochemical or haematological abnormalities (full blood count; kidney 470 20 and liver function tests) was done prior to enrolment. Participants with a history of 471 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by anti-N protein IgG immunoassay 472 (Abbott Architect, Abbott Park, IL, USA) at screening were excluded. For this study, 473 visits on day 0 (vaccine prime) and 182 were the main study timepoints used for 474 immunological analysis however for some assays other study visits - 14, 28 (vaccine 475 boost), 42, and 56 - are presented where available. As some participants did not attend 476 for their day 182 visit (n=6), there is a maximum of n=48 at this timepoint. 477 478 Mesoscale Discovery 479 to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV immunoassay. The 481 COVID-19 (cat. no. K15399U) from Meso Scale 482 Diagnostics, Rockville, MD USA. A MULTI-SPOT\u00ae 96-well, 10 spot plate was coated 483 with three SARS CoV-2 antigens (S, RBD, N), SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV spike 484 well human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63, 3). Multiplex MSD assays 487 were performed as per the instructions of the manufacturer. To measure IgG 488 antibodies, 96-well plates were blocked with MSD Blocker A for 30 minutes. Following 489 washing with washing buffer, samples diluted 1:1,000-10,000 in diluent buffer, or MSD 490 standard or undiluted internal MSD controls, were added to the wells. After 2-hour 491 incubation and a washing step, detection antibody (MSD SULFO-TAG Anti-Human 492 IgG Antibody, 1/200) was added. Following washing, MSD GOLD Read Buffer B 493 was added and plates were read using a MESO\u00ae SECTOR S 600 Reader. The 494 standard curve was established by fitting the signals from the standard using a 4-495 21 parameter logistic model. Concentrations of samples were determined from the 496 electrochemiluminescence signals by back-fitting to the standard curve and multiplied 497 by the dilution factor. Concentrations are expressed in Arbitrary Units/ml (AU/ml). Cut-498 offs were determined for each SARS-CoV-2 antigen (S, RBD and N) based on the 499 concentrations measured in 103 pre-pandemic sera + 3 Standard Deviations. ELISA 503 Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a 504 standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS CoV-2 spike protein as described 505 previously21. In brief, ELISA plates were coated with 2 g/mL of full-length trimerised 506 SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and stored at 4\u00b0C overnight for at least 16 hours. After 507 coating, plates were washed 6 times with PBS/0.05%Tween and blocked with casein 508 for 1h at room temperature (RT). Thawed samples were treated with 10% Triton X-509 100 for 1h at RT and subsequently diluted in casein and plated in triplicate for 510 incubation for 2h at RT alongside two internal positive controls (controls 1 and 2) to 511 measure plate to plate variation. Control 1 was a dilution of convalescent plasma 512 sample and control 2 was a research reagent for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ab (code 20/130 513 supplied by National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC)). The 514 standard pool was used in a two-fold serial dilution to produce ten standard points that 515 were assigned arbitrary ELISA units (EUs). Goat anti-human IgG (-chain specific) 516 conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was used as secondary antibody and plates were 517 developed by adding 4-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine substrate buffer. An 518 ELx808 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) was used to provide optical density 519 measurement of the plates at 405mm. Standardised EUs were determined from a 520 22 single dilution of each sample against the standard curve which was plotted using the 521 4-Parameter logistic model (Gen5 v3.09, BioTek). Each assay plate consisted of 522 samples and controls plated in triplicate, with ten standard points in duplicate and four 523 blank wells. The assay LLOQ (representing the lowest IgG titres that can be reliably 524 and precisely quantified within a coefficient of variation of 25%) was determined 525 mathematically. This was based on the 4-PL function of the standard curve data from 526 250 independent experiments and represents the EU value corresponding to the 527 upper 95% confidence interval of the minimum asymptote of the 4-PL curve fit used 528 for modelling the assay standard curves. The value of 13 EU was calculated as the 529 assay LLOQ and this corresponds to an OD value of 0.2 for which the assay was 530 demonstrated to show linearity. 531 532 Focus reduction neutralization assay (FRNT) 533 Antibody neutralization was measured in a randomly selected subset of participants 534 using a Focus Reduction Neutralization Test (FRNT), as described previously [70] 535 where the reduction in the number of the infected foci is compared to a 'no antibody' 536 negative control well. Briefly, serially diluted Ab or plasma was mixed with SARS-CoV-537 2 strain Victoria and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. The mixtures were then transferred 538 to in duplicate and incubated for further 2 hours, followed by the addition of 540 1.5% semi-solid carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) overlay medium to each well to limit 541 virus diffusion. A focus forming assay was then performed by staining Vero cells with 542 human anti-NP goat anti-human 543 IgG (A0170; Sigma). Finally, the foci (infected cells) approximately 100 per well in the 544 absence of antibodies, were visualized by adding TrueBlue Peroxidase Substrate. 545 23 Virus-infected cell foci were counted on the classic AID ELISpot reader using AID 546 ELISpot software. The percentage of focus reduction was calculated and IC50 547 (reported as FRNT50) was determined using the probit program from the SPSS 548 package. used to measure the 552 ability of human sera to inhibit ACE2 binding P.1). A MULTI-SPOT\u00ae 96-well, 10 Spot Plate (Plate 7) was 554 coated with eight SARS-CoV-2 spike and manufacturer's instructions. 556 To measure ACE2 inhibition, 96-well plates were blocked with MSD blocker for 30 557 minutes. Plates were then washed in MSD washing buffer, and samples were 558 diluted 1:10 and 1:100 in diluent buffer. Importantly, an ACE2 calibration curve 559 which consists of a monoclonal antibody with equivalent activity against spike 560 variants was used to interpolate results as arbitrary units. Furthermore, internal 561 controls and the WHO international standard were added to each plate. After 1-562 hour incubation recombinant human ACE2-SULFO-TAG was added to all wells. 563 After a further 1-hour plates were washed and MSD GOLD Read Buffer B was 564 added, plates were then immediately read using a MESO\u00ae SECTOR S 600 565 Reader. 566 567 Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from whole blood 568 PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep (Stem Cell 569 Technologies, Cambridge, UK). Buffy coats containing PBMCs were collected and 570 24 washed twice with pre-warmed R10 medium: Roswell Park Memorial Institute (also 571 known as RPMI) 1640 medium (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) supplemented 572 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma), 1 mM penicillin-streptomycin 573 solution (Sigma), and 2 mM L-glutamine solution (Sigma). After the second 574 centrifugation, cells were resuspended in R10 and counted using the Guava ViaCount 575 assay (Guava Technologies Hayward, CA, USA) on 576 Cooperation). T-cell enzyme-linked immunospot PBMCs, and CellTrace Violet (CTV; ThermoFisher Scientific, CA, 578 USA) T cell proliferation assay was done on cryopreserved samples. 579 580 Ex vivo ELISpot to enumerate antigen-specific T cells. 581 ELISpot assays were performed as described previously [17] using a validated 582 protocol with freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to 583 determine responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccine antigen at days 0 (before 584 vaccination), 14, 28 (boost), 42 and 56. Assays were performed using Multiscreen IP 585 ELISpot plates (Merck Millipore, Watford, UK) coated with 10 g/mL human anti-IFN 586 antibody and developed using SA-ALP antibody conjugate kits (Mabtech, Stockholm, 587 Sweden) and BCIP NBT-plus chromogenic substrate (Moss Inc., Pasadena, MA, 588 USA). PBMC were separated from whole blood with lithium heparin by density 589 centrifugation within four hours of venepuncture. Cells were incubated for 18-20 hours 590 in RPMI (Sigma) containing reactivity 592 (Labtech International, East Sussex, UK) with a final concentration of 10\u00b5g/ml of each 593 peptide. A total of 253 synthetic peptides (15mers overlapping by 10 amino acids) 594 spanning the entire vaccine insert, including the tPA leader sequence were used to 595 25 stimulate PBMC (ProImmune, Oxford UK). Peptides were pooled into 12 pools for the 596 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein containing 18 to 24 peptides, plus a single pool of 5 597 peptides for the tPA leader. Peptides were tested in triplicate, with 2.5 \u00d7 105 PBMC 598 added to each well of the ELISpot plate in a final volume of 100L. Results are 599 expressed as spot forming cells (SFC) per million PBMCs, calculated by subtracting 600 the mean negative control response from the mean of each peptide pool response and 601 then summing the response for the 12 peptide pools spanning S1 and S2. 602 Staphylococcal g/mL) and phytohaemagglutinin-L (10 g/ mL) 603 were pooled and used as a positive control. Plates were counted using an AID 604 automated ELISpot counter (AID Diagnostika GmbH, algorithm C, Strassberg, 605 Germany) using identical settings for all plates, and counts were adjusted only to 606 remove artefacts. A lower limit of detection of 48 SFC/million PBMCs was determined 607 based on the minimum number of spots that could be detected. 608 609 T cell proliferation assay 610 T cell proliferation assay was done using cryopreserved PBMCs. Briefly, PBMCs were 611 thawed and washed twice with 1mL of PBS followed by labelling with CTV at a final 612 concentration of 2\u00b75 M for 10 min at room temperature. CTV, a free amine binding 613 dye, enables the measurement of the decrease in dye concentration following each 614 cell division in proliferating cells in response to antigenic stimulation as described 615 previously [33]. The labelling reaction was quenched with 4mL of fetal bovine serum 616 (FBS) at 4\u00b0C and cells were resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% 617 human blood group type AB serum (Sigma), 1 mM penicillin-streptomycin solution, 618 and 2 mM L-glutamine solution, and subsequently plated in a 96-well round bottom 619 plate at a plating density of 0\u00b725\u00d7106 cells per well in duplicate wells (total of 620 26 0\u00b75\u00d7106 cells per condition). Cells were stimulated with peptide pools (15nmers 621 overlapping and S2), SARS-CoV-2 variants 622 of concern (beta, gamma and delta) and HCoVs (HKU-1 - 2 consensus clades, OC43, 623 NL63 and 299E) at a final concentration of 1 g/mL per peptide. For antigenic control, 624 class 1 and 2 optimal peptides for FEC-T (flu, EBV, CMV, and tetanus) were pooled 625 at a final concentration of 1 g/mL per peptide. Media, containing 0\u00b71% dimethyl 626 sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma) representing DMSO content in peptide pools, was used as 627 a negative control and 2 g/mL phytohaemagglutinin L (Sigma) was used as positive 628 control. Cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C, with 5% carbon dioxide and 95% humidity 629 for 7 days, with a change of media on day 4. At the end of the incubation period, cells 630 were stained using anti-human CD3, CD4, CD8, and a near Infra-red, Life Technologies; ThermoFisher Scientific, CA, USA) as in 632 supplementary table 5. All samples were acquired using a BD Fortessa X20 (BD Bergisch 634 Gladbach, Germany). Responses above 1% were considered true positive based 635 mean of DMSO controls + 3x SD. Specificity of the assay has been previous reported 636 in [33]. All datapoints presented represent a single participant and are presented as 637 background subtracted data. 638 639 AIM Assay 640 Cryopreserved PBMCs from 25 HIV infected subjects were used for activation induced 641 marker (AIM) assay. Briefly, PBMCs were thawed in 1% 642 Pen/strep and 1% L-glutamine. Cells were washed, counted, and rested for 6 hours in 643 IMDM-10 (Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium - 645 27 (70746-3, Following rest, cells were plated at 1-2 x106 cells/well in a 96 well 646 round bottom plate. Cells were then incubated for 24 hours at 37\u00baC and 5% CO2. After 647 stimulation cells were stained with the anti-human antibodies contained in 648 supplementary table 6. Stained cells were fixed in 4% PFA and acquired on a BD 649 LSR II flow cytometer. The data was analysed using FlowJo version 10 and Prism 650 version 9. Antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were gated using the Boolean OR 651 gating strategy described by Nielsen and Ogbe et al, 2020 [47] and shown in 652 supplementary figure 5 (for CD4 T cells: all considered AIM+). Chemokine 655 receptors CCR6 and CXCR3 were used as an unbiased way of analysing T cell 656 skewness independent of cytokine kinetics. 657 L-glutamine (R10). Cells were counted and rested for an 661 hour at a cell density of 2 x 106 per ml of R10 in the presence of benzonase 662 endonucleases (70746-3, Merck). Following rest, 2-3 million cells were used for each 663 of the panels. Cells were washed in staining buffer (420201, Biolegend). This was 664 followed by blocking FC receptors (422302, Biolegend) for 10 minutes at room 665 temperature (RT) and live cell staining using L/D aqua (L34966, Life Technologies). All 666 cells were then washed in preparation for antibody staining. For ex vivo 667 immune activation panel, antibodies for assessing immune activation (as listed 668 in supplementary table 7 with manufacturer names, catalogue numbers and 669 dilution) was used as a cocktail and added to the cell pellet. Cells 670 28 were subsequently incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes which was followed by 671 a wash and fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 minutes at RT. PFA was 672 washed off and cells resuspended in PBS for acquisition on flow cytometer. For 673 immune exhaustion panel, antibodies for surface markers were prepared in a cocktail 674 which was added to cells and incubated for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C (supplementary table 675 8). Cells were then prepared for intranuclear stain using FOXP3 676 fixation/permeabilisation kit (Life technologies). Briefly, 100ul of fixation buffer was 677 added to cells and incubated at RT for 30 minutes. This was followed by cellular 678 permeabilisation using the permeabilisation buffer contained in the aforementioned kit. 679 Antibody cocktails were prepared in permeabilisation buffer, added to cells and 680 allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at RT. Following staining, cells were washed and 681 resuspended in PBS for acquisition. All data was acquired on a BD LSR II flow 682 cytometer and fluorescent minus one (FMO) gates were used to set gates for markers 683 of interest. Gating strategies are as shown in supplementary figure 1a and b 684 685 Phylogenetic analysis 686 We used protein BLAST to download all human coronavirus S protein sequences from 687 NCBI database. We then randomly chose 3 sequences for each of the human 688 coronavirus species. HKU1 was consisted of two clades and we chose three isolates 689 for each clade (c1 and c2). We used MAFFT to align all chosen human corona viruses, 690 SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequences. We then calculated 691 the pairwise distances between the sequences and built a neighbour joining tree using 692 MATLAB. 693 694 Statistical analysis 695 29 This study was not powered to a specific endpoint and the sample size was based on 696 practical recruitment considerations in line with other subgroups of the COV002 study. 697 We analysed all outcomes in all participants who received both doses of the 698 vaccination schedule and with available samples, unless otherwise specified. We log-699 transformed serological, FRNT50, and ELISpot data for analysis. FRNT50 titres less 700 than 20 were given the value 10 for statistical analysis. We present medians and IQRs 701 for immunological endpoints. We used for 702 two For comparison of two non-703 parametrically distributed unpaired variables, we used the Wilcoxon rank sum (Mann 704 Whitney U) test. For comparison of two non-parametrically distributed paired datasets, 705 we used the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. We used the 2 test for 706 comparison of ELISpot responses. Missing data were not inputed. We did all analyses 707 using R (version 3.6.1 or later), and Prism 9 (GraphPad Software) and a P value <0.05 708 was considered statistically significant. 709 710 Study Approval 711 Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation, and 712 the trial was done in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and 713 Good Clinical Practice. Study approval in the UK was done by the Medicines and 714 Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (reference 21584/0424/001-0001) and the 715 South Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (reference 20/SC/0145).
