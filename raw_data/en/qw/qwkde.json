The choice of vaccine formulation depends upon several factors, including age, comorbidities, and risk of adverse reaction. CDC does not preferentially recommend any particular licensed age-appropriate vaccine formulation. RECOMMENDATIONS: - For ages 6 months and older, inactivated injectable formulations are available and dosed based on age. For ages 2 years to 49 years, the attenuated FluMist Quadrivalent intranasal vaccine is an alternative. (Quadrivalent means having four ingredients.) - Healthy, nonpregnant adults between 18 and 49 years of age can take an inactivated vaccine or the live attenuated influenza vaccine. - Women in any stage of pregnancy are encouraged to take an inactivated injectable influenza vaccine, which can protect a woman from flu during and after pregnancy, and also protect her baby from flu for several months after birth. - For individuals between 50 and 64 years of age, inactivated influenza vaccines are available. - Individuals ages 65 years or older can take the high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent) when available.
