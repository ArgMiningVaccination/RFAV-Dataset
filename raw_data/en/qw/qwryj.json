Time and time again \u2014 both at the bedside and beyond our walls \u2014 we reaffirmed the promise of our MGH founders: \"When in distress, every man becomes our neighbor.\" We witnessed extraordinary acts of what internationally recognized nurse historian and author Louise C. Selanders describes as \"Healing, Leadership and Global Action.\" Where we could ease pain and suffering we stepped forward, both individually and in teams. When an acutely ill father was in our care on his daughter's wedding day, we helped him get into his tuxedo for a family photo \u2014 a powerful healing moment. When natural disasters devastated coastal regions \u2014 not once, but on two separate occasions \u2014 the MGH community came together to provide relief. Members of Patient Care Services led the way. PCS also witnessed many significant events: We celebrated the 100th anniversary of the founding of medical Social Services, which began right here at the MGH. We read with pride as The Boston Globe's four-part series focusing on our New Graduate Critical Care Nursing Program appeared on the paper's front page for four consecutive days. We mourned the death of our widely admired friend, colleague and trailblazer, Jean Nardini, RN, a leader in the MGH community for more than 30 years. Behind the scenes, we advanced our practice through a variety of innovations: giving thousands of families and friends of patients peace of mind by helping them keep in touch with one another via a new Web-based patient information service, introducing an online electronic dashboard to ensure that MGH meets or exceeds the needs of patients while keeping them as safe as possible, and being among the first in the nation to post our nursing staffing data publicly on the Internet. We have plenty to be proud of \u2014 more than we can recount \u2014 and to all of my colleagues in Patient Care Services, I say \"thank you\" for all you do to make MGH the world-class institution that it is today. I hope you enjoy a quick glimpse of the year that was ... 2005. With gratitude, Jeanette Ives Erickson, RN, MS Senior Vice President for Patient Care Chief Nurse Patient Care Services represents 11 clinical disciplines, 18 programs, and 4,600 professional and support staff. We are many in number. But what truly defines Patient Care Services is our unity of purpose \u2014 providing the best care possible for the patients and families whose lives we touch. This is our common vision, one we can achieve day in and day out because we are blessed with the most valuable of resources \u2014 one another.Healing \u00b7 Leadership \u00b7 Global Action\u0018 Patient Care Services \u00b7 Annual Report \u0018005 HealingA Family of Caregivers Throughout 2005, more than 45,000 patients were hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital and another 1,395,890 were cared for in our ambulatory and health center settings. Caring for each of these individuals means doing all we can to address their physical, spiritual and emotional needs. The story of a patient we will call \"Angela\" provides one example of the care offered throughout the MGH. Angela had moved to the US from Cape Verde and, as her illness progressed, she ended up living in a local shelter. By the time she came to MGH, she was confused, extremely ill with an array of symptoms ... and very much alone. Following a battery of tests, Angela was diagnosed with a rare and incurable neurodegenerative disease. Although there was no known medical treatment, as her condition continued to deteriorate she continued to receive the best available care. Nurses, physicians, patient care assistants, unit service associates, operations associates, social workers, physical therapists, speech, language and swallowing specialists, chaplains, and so many more formed a community of caring around the young patient. They provided support as her symptoms worsened and worked to manage her pain. They brought her flowers and visited when the workday was over. MGH staff from Cape Verde attended to her personal needs, dropping off small gifts and talking to her in her native language. It was clear Angela would never recover from her illness. Eventually, it would take her life, but her caregivers never let it rob their patient of her dignity or her humanity. Angela's story may seem unusual. Yet every day throughout the hospital we witness the extraordinary in everyday acts of caring and kindness. These continue to define MGH patient care. We are a community of healing and of humanity that knows no bounds.We are a community of healing and of humanity that knows no bounds. Pictured above and on the opposing page are several of the team members on White 12 who cared for \"Angela.\" 2005 highlights Healing \u00b7 Leadership \u00b7 Global Action \u0018 Patient Care Services \u00b7 Annual Report \u0018005 African American Pinning Ceremony \"Uniquely African American\" provided the theme for this year's annual Pinning event, focusing on the issue of maintaining self-identity in a world that does not look like you. Massachusetts State Representative Byron Rushing gave an engaging keynote speech on Black history, racism in America and the evolution of Black History Month. As always, MGH honorees received a traditional Black Heritage pin and an African shawl. Project HOPE honored at the White House At a formal ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, President George W. Bush honored the Project HOPE disaster relief team, which included nearly 100 MGH clinical volunteers \u2014 all of whom assisted in post-tsunami relief efforts.Colleague helping colleague As MGH physical therapist Alison Squadrito planned her upcoming wedding, she became focused on how to involve her grandmother, who had developed advanced Alzheimer's disease. She had always pictured her grandmother taking part in the celebration, and it was hard to imagine anything less. Squadrito's professional training allowed her insights into many issues \u2014 particularly the physical challenges of her grandmother's strength, endurance, her ability to get in or out of a car and climb stairs, and the handicapped accessibility of her home and the church \u2014 but there was also the need for expert advice regarding the management of the emotional and cognitive issues associated with Alzheimer's disease. Squadrito turned to colleague Barbara Guire, RN, a psychiatric clinical nurse specialist within the hospital's Networking to Improve the Care of Health System Elders (NICHE) initiative, a multidisciplinary team of providers focused on issues facing older adults. Together, they were able to map out a plan that both ensured her grandmother's safety and comfort, and allowed her to share in the joy of Squadrito's big day.MGH Quit Smoking Service joins PCS For some people, a hospital stay offers a golden opportunity to quit smoking. This year, the MGH formally moved its Quit Smoking Service into Patient Care Services to better position smoking counselors and frontline providers to work more closely together. By the end of the year, patient referrals to smoking counselors more than doubled. COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE: The Nursing Practice Committee made new practice recommendations, reviewed and approved new products, and articulated practice changes throughout PCS, including the approval of new transfusion procedures and a Universal Protocol Checklist. PCS introduces CarePages CarePages allows patients and families to stay in touch 24 hours a day, seven days a week via the Internet. Through a private, customized patient Web page, those in the circle of friends and family can post up- to-date information, well wishes and even photos. Families can update one another in 30 seconds versus 30 phone calls. Learning online In collaboration with Northeastern University and St. Joseph's College of Maine, the MGH Department of Nursing introduced on-site, online baccalaureate programs for MGH nurses interested in returning to school.A record 46 percent \u2014 1,322 clinicians \u2014 completed the Staff Perceptions of the Professional Practice Environment Survey, with 90 percent \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the MGH practice environment. Alison Squadrito and her grandmother Nursing Spectrum honored Eileen Flaherty, RN, nurse manager, Bigelow 11 Medicine Unit, with its annual Nursing Excellence Award for \"Leadership.\" COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE: The Ethics and Patient Education committees helped heighten awareness and understanding among MGH clinicians regarding key ethical topics and issues. This year, they cosponsored an Advance Directives Booth in which nearly 1,000 packets of information were distributed throughout the MGH community. Respiratory therapists Respiratory therapists worked with a multidisciplinary team in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) to develop highly successful ventilator discontinuation protocols, implemented by respiratory therapists and nurses. These have proven to safely decrease the amount of time patients need to remain on a ventilator and in the ICU itself. MGH is now collaborating with academic medical centers throughout the country to establish these as universally accepted, best-practice protocols for all mechanically ventilated patients. Recruiting the next generation The National Youth Leadership Forum on Nursing program is designed to provide high school students with a formal introduction to nursing. This year, 210 staff nurses \u2014 from nearly every nursing specialty \u2014 volunteered to share their knowledge and experience with more than 200 visiting students.MGH bids farewell to \"Nurse of Distinction\" Jean M. Nardini, RN, nurse manager of the Hemodialysis Unit and member of the MGH community for more than 30 years, died in May following a long illness. Nardini is remembered by colleagues throughout the hospital and throughout the country as a strong and caring leader, committed patient advocate, compassionate caregiver, teacher, role model and friend. Shortly before Nardini's death, MGH chief nurse Jeanette Ives Erickson, RN, presented her friend and colleague with the first Jean M. Nardini, RN, Nurse of Distinction Award. The hospital also approved a recommendation to rename Nardini's patient care unit the Jean M. Nardini, RN, Hemodialysis Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. Both are well-deserved honors \u2014 ensuring that Nardini's legacy endures. For times of trouble During times of crisis, we often come together to reflect \u2014 to find strength and comfort amid confusion. Through the generosity of the MGH Ladies Visiting Committee, the MGH Chaplaincy created a booklet entitled Prayers, Songs, Poems and Readings for Times of Trouble. The collection represents a variety of religious traditions and secular resources and is distributed to the MGH community during times of crisis. Jean M. Nardini, RNOne fish, two fish ... This year, the food chain joined the communication chain in the Same Day Surgical Unit (SDSU). A newly introduced school of \"beeper fish\" allows families to move throughout the hospital while their child is in surgery, receive regular progress reports and stay immediately available. The design is a perfect complement to the underwater motif featured throughout Pediatric services. COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE: The Research Committee helped translate evidence-based practice into reality through its Nursing Research Day scientific presentations, the Yvonne L. Munn annual lecture and nursing research awards, its \"Did You Know?\" research utilization posters, and its Journal Club. MGH Physical Therapy MGH Physical Therapy (PT) celebrated PT Month with the theme \"Your health, our hands.\" Festivities included a series of both on- and off-site presentations, demonstrations, educational forums and the 23rd annual Marjorie K. Ionta PT Lecture. Along with their colleagues in Occupational Therapy, the department led a charge to raise funds for the MGH Social Services Discretionary Fund and relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina.

Healthcare social workers throughout the US regard this as the beginning of this social work specialty. To mark the historic occasion, the MGH Department of Social Services organized a two-day symposium and gala dinner at Boston's Hynes Convention Center. Colleagues from throughout the Partners HealthCare System and across New England who attended \"Innovation at 100\" enjoyed an opportunity to learn about advances in social services and celebrate the milestone. Keynote speeches, presentations, breakout sessions and a dedicated poster session highlighted a variety of innovative tools, techniques and programs relevant to the profession. The event planning was led by retiring Social Services director Evelyn Bonander. A gala dinner provided just the right setting to celebrate this important century mark. Amid the festivities, Ann Daniels, PhD, executive director of MGH Social Services, reminded those assembled that her department has held true to its founding principles of providing patient- centered care, identifying and interpreting the psychosocial aspects of illness, placing the patient within the context of his family and life, and teamwork. MGH Social Services appears well positioned to meet the challenges of the next hundred years.MGH Social Services has remained true to its founding principles of providing patient-centered care, identifying and interpreting the psychosocial aspects of illness, placing the patient within the context of his family and life, and teamwork. 2005 highlights Healing \u00b7 Leadership \u00b7 Global Action \u0018 Patient Care Services \u00b7 Annual Report \u0018005Throughout 2005, MGH volunteers contributed 182,483 hours \u2014 the equivalent of a $3,291,993 gift to the hospital. The Office of Patient Advocacy The Office of Patient Advocacy hosted a statewide Patient Advocacy Conference \u2014 \"Chicken Soup for the Patient Advocate's Soul\" \u2014 designed to share best practices among colleagues. \"Promise of Nursing\" for Massachusetts This year's bi-annual Johnson & Johnson \"Campaign for Nursing's Future\" fundraising event proved to be the country's single largest such effort, raising more than $710,000 for student scholarships, faculty fellowships, and nursing school grants. The evening provided an opportunity for nurses throughout the state to come together to celebrate their passion for nursing and its future. PCS Management Systems With the launch of an online electronic dashboard, the PCS Management Systems team did its part to ensure that MGH meets or exceeds the needs of its patients while keeping them safe. At the touch of a button, nurse managers throughout the department can access unit-specific data and compare key quality measures with benchmark scores and target ranges. The information provides a powerful tool for maintaining quality performance and identifying best practice on an ongoing basis. PCS Information Systems MGH cares for some of the most acutely ill patients from throughout the region and the world. Matching the right level of care with the often rapidly changing health status of patients is critical. In recognition of its leadership role in this area, in 2005 MGH was presented the Richard C. Jelinek Vision Award. This honor recognizes hospitals for their innovative and creative use of QuadraMed Patient Focused Solutions (PFS) \u2014 an automated productivity measurement system \u2014 to manage daily and ongoing operations more efficiently and effectively, and to improve, protect and promote the highest-quality patient care delivery. COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE: The Diversity Committee helps to enhance the awareness and understanding of the various aspects of diversity (i.e., culture, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual preference, age) that can often influence the delivery of care. To better assist those with language barriers, this year, the group launched a \"May I Help You\" ID badge initiative in 19 different languages. The Department of Homeland Security honored the Boston-based International Medical Surgical Response Team (IMSuRT) with its Under Secretary Award for outstanding work in emergency management. The prior year the team was deployed to Bam, Iran, to assist earthquake victims with medical relief. The team \u2014 which included many MGH and PCS clinicians \u2014 represented the first official US delegation to set foot in Iran in nearly 25 years. Pictured (left to right) Marianne Ditomassi, RN, MSN, MBA, executive director, PCS Operations and event coordinator; Curt Selquist, com - pany group chairman for J&J; Jeanette Ives Erickson, RN, MS, senior vice president, Patient Care and chief nurse, and event chairJoey Buizon became the hospital's first summer intern to be sponsored by the MGH Council on Disabilities Awareness (CDA) and the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind. Buizon, who is visually impaired, earned his bachelor of science degree in social work with a minor in psychology from Bridgewater State College. Buizon is now a fixture at MGH, working as speech-language pathology associate. COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE: The Patient Education Committee conducted a comprehensive practice survey designed to measure learning needs regarding assessment, resource knowledge and use, teaching methodologies, and documentation of patient education, in order to chart the group's future work. Knight Visiting Professor Program Norman Knight is a dear friend and supporter of MGH Nursing. Thanks to his continued generosity, this year Betty Ferrell, PhD, FAAN, research scientist at the City of Hope National Medical Center in California, became the department's first Knight Visiting Professor. The annual program will support MGH Nursing's commitment to achieving clinical excellence and providing an environment with opportunity for professional growth by bringing nationally recognized nurse scientists/scholars to MGH to present and discuss their programs of research. A special day for Mr. J. and his family In Annette Kavanagh's narrative about her 50-something- year-old patient, Mr. J., we learned he had suffered a stroke, leaving him with left-sided paralysis and at risk for another stroke if he left the hospital without being anticoagulated. On one particular morning Kavanagh recognized the sadness and disappointment in his eyes and in his flat, one-word responses. It was his daughter's wedding day, and she would be visiting that afternoon with a photographer \u2014 at change of shift. Mr. J. wanted to wear a tuxedo for this special photo opportunity, and Kavanagh pledged to do whatever it took. She attended to his clinical needs, scheduled an MGH stylist for a shave and haircut, and later worked with colleagues to get Mr. J. into his tux. The team transferred him to a cardiac chair, moved him to the more aesthetically pleasing solarium, and connected 30-foot IV tubing to ensure that no medical equipment would appear in the family photo. Staff scheduled to go off duty put their plans on hold and stayed to enjoy the celebration with Mr. J. When his family arrived, the emotions flowed. The family's surprise and joy at seeing Mr. J. in the hospital in his tux will likely be a treasured memory for all involved.MGH Nursing in the news Throughout the year, a Boston Globe reporter and photographer were in and out of MGH working on a long-term project about nursing. They spent their time in the Surgical ICU shadowing two nurses, Michelle \"MJ\" Pender, RN, and Julia Zelixon, RN. The two were participating in the MGH New Graduate Critical Care Nursing Program \u2014 Pender as a preceptor, and Zelixon as her new graduate preceptee. As Pender mentored Zelixon throughout the six-month program, the Globe staffers were able to observe, listen and learn about their practice firsthand and unfiltered. The result was a four-part, front-page series entitled \"Critical Care: The making of an ICU nurse\" \u2014 unprecedented coverage for this vital profession. Interpreter Services added American Sign Language to its repertoire. Norman Knight 10 Patient Care Services \u00b7 Annual Report \u0018005 TSUNAMI RELIEF EFFORT Each day, Black Hawk helicopters transported patients to the ship to receive care and brought clinicians to the mainland \u2014 eight at a time \u2014 to areas where their help was desperately needed.Global Action Huma nitarian Relie f 2005 began in dramatic fashion just after a devastating tsunami hit the coast of Indonesia. Tens of thousands of people perished, and countless more were left injured and suffering in the wake of the tragedy. The US pledged its help to these victims, and more than 75 MGH clinicians answered the call \u2014 both overseas and back at home. As staff stepped forward to travel to the disaster-torn region, their colleagues at home provided a solid foundation for the initiative. Throughout the hospital, countless staff teamed up to provide whatever coverage was needed for the duration of the relief effort. Shortly after the new year began, the first wave of MGHers stepped aboard the recommissioned US Naval Ship Mercy as part of a relief effort organized by Project HOPE. For many weeks the ship was their home and base of work, anchored two miles off the coast of Banda Aceh. Each day, Black Hawk helicopters transported patients to the ship to receive care and brought clinicians to the mainland \u2014 eight at a time \u2014 to areas where their help was desperately needed. This was the first time in history that the US government had allowed civilian healthcare providers to work alongside their military colleagues. The pilot program proved a huge success and, just months later, was replicated closer to home. It seemed inconceivable when in the fall \u2014 for the second time in less than a year \u2014 a catastrophic natural disaster struck an entire coastal region, causing widespread devastation and an outpouring of relief efforts. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita left more than a million people along the US Gulf Coast homeless and/or displaced. Again, the MGH community answered a call from Project HOPE to provide aid to area victims. Many other MGH staff went to the Gulf Coast with the US Public Health Service and the Massachusetts Disaster Medical Assistance Team. Dozens and dozens of MGH volunteers stepped forward to help, and countless clinicians lined up to provide the coverage needed during their colleagues' absence. Karen Holland, RN, a staff nurse in the Emergency Department and prior volunteer on the USNS Mercy, served as chief nursing officer aboard the USNS Comfort, where she oversaw all Project HOPE nursing volunteers aboard the ship. Aftermath of the Gulf Coast hurricanes 2005 highlights Healing \u00b7 Leadership \u00b7 Global Action 1\u0018 Patient Care Services \u00b7 Annual Report \u0018005 COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE: The Quality Committee evaluates the MGH's various programs, systems, policies and procedures through a quality and safety lens to identify opportunities to enhance patient care and ensure that care delivery remains as safe as pos - sible. Among its more significant contributions to this cause in 2005, the group organized a full-day conference entitled \"The Different Faces of Performance Improvement: Creating an Environment of Quality and Safety.\" PCS strategic planning retreat Senior leadership in Patient Care Services dedicated considerable time and effort to its strategic planning initiatives, culminating in a two-day planning retreat. The session offered a springboard for new ideas, new programs and new ways of thinking about the work of Patient Care Services. Overall, the strategic planning efforts marked the beginning of a process of sorting out priorities and establishing a long-range plan for the Brenda Miller, RN, nurse manager of the MGH Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and Pediatric Ambulatory Care, and other volunteers provided humanitarian aid to more than 300 patients in schools and villages in underserved areas of the Dominican Republic.A new name for the Department of Speech, Language & Swallowing Disorders was designated to better reflect practice. Colorful ceiling tiles appear over patient beds in the Medical ICU. Sukaina Matter, RN, chief nurse at Basrah Children's Hospital Basrah Children's Hospital Children under the age of five account for 56 percent of Iraq's cancer patients. This year, the US made a commitment to help improve that country's healthcare system, and one of the largest initiatives centers focuses on constructing and opening Basrah Children's Hospital (BCH) in southern Iraq. In partnership with Project HOPE, MGH has taken a lead role in educating the BCH's new nursing staff and in mentoring the chief nurse. This fall the hospital's first chief nurse spent several weeks at MGH, where she was able to observe staff and leadership in a variety of disciplines, identify best practices, and meet those who will serve as role models and resources as she looks to the future. MGH chief nurse Jeanette Ives Erickson, RN, continues to support her new Iraqi colleague and the training program for the hospital's 300 new nurses. Healing environments Kelly Perfetti, RN, a staff nurse in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), set out more than a year ago to help create a soothing and healing environment for MICU patients and their family members. An ad she placed in the Museum of Fine Arts newsletter touched artist Caleb Neelon and four of his friends. Together, they created an array of colorful ceiling tiles, each in their own distinct and recognizable style. The tiles are now on display over MICU patients' beds, giving them something uplifting to focus on while in the hospital.Pictured at the Reading Gala (left to right): Eileen Faggiano, event chair; Karen Lincoln, visual coordinator Long's co-anchor; and Phyllis Meisel, director of MGH Reading Disabilities, at the 2005 Reading Disabilities Gala.\"A registered nurse will be responsible for your nursing care at all times.\" Pledge appearing on the MGH Nursing Quality and Safety Web site MGH occupational therapist Joanna Akladiss, OTR/L, brought critically needed care to underserved populations in Honduras, specifically for patients with upper extremity injuries. She provided wound care, fabricated splints and assisted in establishing the therapeutic plan of care and functional treatment ideas with resident OTs and physicians. Patients lined up outside a local clinic in hopes of receiving care \u2014 some after walking for an entire day. PCS officially launched its efforts targeting health disparities with the Nurse Recognition Week presentation, \"Health disparities: Nursing's voice in practice.\"future. The work continues in bimonthly PCS Executive Committee meetings and smaller workgroups focusing on quality and safety, improved communications, and enhancing the PCS diversity program, to name only a few priority areas. Reading Gala This year marked the first \"Opening Doors to Literacy\" gala event and benefit auction for the PCS Reading Disabilities program. Held at Long's Jewelers in Boston, the event helped to promote awareness about dyslexia and supported the theme \"Help Us Bring Reading to Children.\" The monies raised by the enthusiastic planning team helped MGH reach out to scores of children who otherwise could not have afforded these important services.COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE: The Staff Nurse Advisory Committee remained a key forum to address issues impacting practice and quality of work-life at MGH. Issues impacting nursing throughout 2005 included examining nurses' work hours, creating a culture of safety, and following and supporting the Patients First legislation, the first statewide posting of nursing safety data. Quality and Safety The MGH Department of Nursing became the first hospital in the state to begin to make key nursing quality indicators publicly available via the Internet. In 2005, the department launched a user-friendly Quality and Patient Safety Web site. The site contains general information about MGH nursing, professional achievements, links to relevant articles in the news and a number of safety pledges. The site is regularly updated and can be viewed at www.massgeneral.org/nursing_quality PCS Director of Diversity Deborah Washington, RN, MS Ann Daniels, PhD, LICSW, was named executive director for Social Services and Chaplaincy. 2005 development Healing \u00b7 Leadership \u00b7 Global Action 1\u0018 Patient Care Services \u00b7 Annual Report \u0018005Founded in 1869, the LVC is one of the oldest hospital auxiliaries in the United States. Its volunteer members oversee the LVC retail shops, which include the MGH General Store and Flower Shop, the MGH General Hair Care Center, the Images Boutique, and the General Store at the hospital's Yawkey Center. Proceeds from their enterprises support a variety of much-needed programs and services \u2014 too many to mention. But when MGH began organizing a team of providers to travel to the Gulf Coast following hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the LVC stepped in to cover some related costs. They supported MGH's efforts to create a more comfortable environment for patients and their visitors. Their generosity helped the hospital purchase new furniture for the hospital's many visitor lounges. The LVC consistently supports the Social Services Ancillary Fund, which provides financial assistance to needy patients. Needs range from the very small and simple \u2014 buying a hearing aid battery for patient \u2014 to helping a patient who no longer can afford the rent because he or she is out of work due to illness. The LVC's support continues to make a noticeable and real difference in the lives of patients and their providers every day.The Ladies Visiting Committee Since the earliest days of the MGH, the sick and the needy have found care and comfort within our walls. Even so, patients with limited means often have small or even temporary needs that stand in the way of true healing. The MGH Ladies Visiting Committee (LVC) consistently steps in to fill these gaps that life sometimes can leave. Each year, countless donors provide ongoing support for the various programs within Patient Care Services at MGH, and 2005 was no exception. Without this support, many of our more innovative and rewarding patient care programs might not exist. Although there are too many acts of generosity to list, the following provides a glimpse of what has been made possible through the ongoing commitment of the extended MGH community ... thank you. Post-hurricane New OrleansOncology Nursing Fellowship Carol Ghiloni, RN, MSN, OCN, served the MGH community as a nurse, mentor and leader in the field of oncology nursing for more than four decades. Her commitment to explore the limits and potential for cancer care resulted in the establishment and growth of the oncology specialty practice within the MGH Department of Nursing and the hospital's Cancer Center. The Johnson & Johnson \"Campaign for Nursing's Future\" has for several years provided ongoing support of the Carol A. Ghiloni Oncology Nursing Fellowship Fund at MGH. The fellowship provides a precepted clinical experience designed for nursing students and baccalaureate nursing faculty, with the goal of enhancing their knowledge of oncology practices, various nursing roles and specialty content. On a larger scale, the fellowship supports MGH in its efforts to recruit the nurses of tomorrow into cancer care while providing faculty with a valuable opportunity to enhance their clinical skills. Johnson & Johnson has honored a nursing visionary with a fitting tribute, while advancing oncology nursing practice for generations to come. Honoring an extraordinary patient Brian McEachern was a quiet hero who went out of his way to help others. He grew up in Charlestown, MA, and served on the Boston Fire Department for 31 years. His colleagues describe him as an ordinary man who performed extraordinary deeds. McEachern never expected any accolades. When he was diagnosed with lung cancer, he sought treatment at MGH. Throughout his long illness, McEachern's family recalls that he met an array of caregivers and employees, many of whom were remarkable for their expertise, caring and concern. Despite the compassionate care he received, ultimately McEachern lost his arduous battle with this disease. Today, his indomitable spirit, compassion and giving nature live on through the Brian M. McEachern Extraordinary Care Award. Sisters Geraldine McEachern and Diane Leason established The Brian M. McEachern Extraordinary Care Award to honor their beloved brother. Each year the McEachern Award recognizes clinicians whose practice is characterized by extraordinary acts of compassion, advocacy and empowerment.

Clearly, the demand for clinical and support staff and their expertise has never been greater. After a decade of steady increases, patient acuity remained relatively stable at 1.84, as compared to 1.85 for 2004, while length of stay rose slightly to 5.88 days. At the same time, Patient Care Services staff satisfaction with the practice environment remains very strong. We conduct surveys of our clinicians every 18 months to assess a variety of organizational characteristics that are important to professional practice: autonomy and control of a practice, strong clinician-physician relationships, communication and teamwork, conflict-management skills, and motivation and cultural sensitivity. Feedback from these surveys helps to inform and shape the strategic plan for clinical and professional development for the coming years. The most recent survey had a response rate of 46 percent among PCS clinicians. Fully 90 percent of respondents reported that they are either satisfied or very satisfied with their professional practice environment. PCS staff feel supported in their practice within this dynamic, academic medical setting, and, because of the supportive professional practice environment, 746 clinicians and support staff joined the Patient Care Services team in 2005. The PCS vacancy and turnover rates remain significantly lower than national rates for nurses and therapists. *Excludes Obstetrical UnitsMGH Facts and Figures Inpatient beds 899 Admissions 45,359 Surgical procedures 34,952 Average length of stay 5.88 days Admits to observe 5,994 Occupancy 81.31% Outpatient visits 1,395,890 MGPO visits (approx.) 544,318 Clinic visits, hospital 462,413 and some group Total health center visits 312,994 ED visits 76,165100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 03.5 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 Organizational Characteristics: Patient Care Services 1,050 900 750 600 450 300 150 0Cultural Sensitivity Motivation Conflict Management Teamwork Communication Control over Practice Clinician/MD Relationship AutonomyYear | Number Responded 2002 | 849 2003 | 915 2004-05 | 1,322 Satisfaction with Professional Practice Environment Percentage of Professional Staff by Department Number of Responses Very Satisfied / Satisfied Dissatisfied / 79% 21% 89% 11% 87% 13% 90% 10%24 18 16 12 8 4 0 Patient Care Services Turnover Statistics Calendar Year 2005Nursing Chaplaincy Occupational Therapy Orthotics and Prosthetics Physical Therapy Reading Disabilities Respiratory Care Social Services Speech, Language & Swallowing Disorders Percentage Percentage Professional ***High scores indicate a high amount of characteristic Score: Range 1-4*** Nursing** Chaplaincy Occupational Therapy Orthotics and Prosthetics Physical Therapy Reading Disabilities Respiratory Care Social Services Speech, Language & Swallowing Disorders 0% 2004-05 2003 2002 2001 **Direct CarePatient Care Services Immacula RN, Pediatrics African American Pinning Honoree Virginia Capasso, APRN, PhD, BC, CNS, The Knight Nursing Center for Clinical & Professional Development Mary Larkin, RN, BSN, CDE, Diabetes Center The Yvonne Munn Nursing Research Award Mandi Coakley, RN, PhD, Department of Nursing Yvonne L.

Strategic Goals \u00b7 We lead the industry in providing patient- and family-centered care. \u00b7 We partner with the community to better understand the healthcare needs of the diverse population of patients we serve, and to establish a shared vision of care and services. \u00b7 We are the healthcare industry leader for quality and safety. \u00b7 We develop and advance systems, technology and programs to promote individualized patient care and support those who provide care. \u00b7 We are the \"employer of choice\" for all professions and support staff, and we value diversity in our workforce. \u00b7 We work to promote and support the institution in realizing sound financial growth. \u00b7 We position nurses, therapists, social workers, medical interpreters, chaplains and support staff within the hospital to have a strong voice in issues impacting patient care. \u00b7 We continuously create throughput systems and processes that drive delivery of safe, efficient, timely and patient-centered care. \u00b7 We provide excellent leadership, and we foster leadership growth opportunities.PCS Vision and Values As nurses, health professionals and Patient Care Services support staff, our every action is guided by knowledge, enabled by skill and motivated by compassion. Patients are our primary focus, and the way we deliver care reflects that focus every day. We believe in creating a practice environment that has no barriers, is built on a spirit of inquiry and reflects a culturally competent workforce, supportive of the patient-centered values of this institution. It is through our professional prac - tice model that we make our vision a demonstrable truth every day by letting our thoughts, decisions and actions be guided by our values. As clinicians, we ensure that our practice is caring, inno - vative, scientific and empowering, and is based on a foundation of leadership and entrepreneurial teamwork.Jennifer Repper-DeLisi, RN, CS Susan Kilroy, RN, MS We Need to Meet Journal of Clinical Ethics Ellen Robinson, RN, PhD Marguerite Hamel-Nardozzi, MSW, LICSW Stories of the Silent: Advocating for a Disabled Woman at End of Life Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation Lynda A.
