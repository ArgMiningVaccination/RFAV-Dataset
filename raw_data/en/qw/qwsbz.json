When stress does not let up, however, it could lead to Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome (AFS). Even worse, symptoms of [adrenal fatigue](/adrenal-fatigue/) will continue to persist and worsen over time unless you do something to relieve them. Fortunately, using natural remedies for adrenal fatigue may help address the symptoms associated with the condition as well as address the root causes. While conventional medicine does not acknowledge adrenal fatigue as a health issue, alternative medicine does. Conventional medicine practitioners tend to only address the symptoms associated with adrenal fatigue, while alternative medicine looks at the root cause of the condition. Many people suffering from adrenal fatigue find the condition impacts their daily lives. This results from the vast variety of possible symptoms. Adrenal fatigue is a condition characterized by a group of symptoms that may seem unrelated. Yet all have one thing in common - overworked adrenal glands. This results from a constant need to increase cortisol production to combat stress. This stress, first identified in the brain, causes the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis to send chemical messengers to various parts of the body, thereby activating the body's NeuroEndoMetabolic (NEM) stress response. An activated NEM will see an increase in stress hormone production, typically cortisol production, in the adrenals. This leads to major changes in different bodily functions. Body functions needed for imminent survival may increase their activity, while those deemed unnecessary see a decline in activity. Your heart rate may increase, for example, while the production of sex hormones may decline. This can further exacerbate the fatigue experienced as testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone are protective against stress. [1] While the change in different body activities usually returns to normal once a stressful period stops, this is not the case when stress persists. As a result, your body functions may continuously operate as they would in a state of heightened stress. This could have serious repercussions that manifest as symptoms that seem unrelated. Furthermore, the longer the situation persists, the more symptoms may manifest. Existing symptoms may also worsen. Your adrenal glands may finally reach a state of exhaustion, as one often sees in the latter stages of adrenal fatigue. The main cause of adrenal fatigue is stress. But we tend to think of stress as something that affects us on an emotional level only. This is not the case. Injuries and health issues also cause the body to go into a state of stress. Examples of stressors include: The symptoms of adrenal fatigue differ from one person to another. They also differ depending on the stage of adrenal fatigue as does their intensity. Common symptoms associated with the condition include: These symptoms may seem unrelated, but they all can be caused by the stress response and adrenal fatigue. Alternative medicine acknowledges adrenal fatigue as the root cause of many health issues experienced today. As such, it tends to promote an integrated approach that provides adrenal support while attending to the symptoms at the same time. It does this by making use of natural remedies for adrenal fatigue. Natural remedies for adrenal fatigue include Ayurvedic medicine remedies, traditional Chinese medicine, and more modern naturopathic remedies along with healthy eating habits. Practitioners of Chinese medicine work at restoring your body's energy flow [2]. They do this using various means. We will look at the use of acupuncture and tai chi. In ancient Chinese practice, [acupuncture](/adrenal-fatigue/recovery/benefits-of-acupuncture/) is a form of therapy that manipulates the flow of energy or qi inside a person. This is done through the insertion of needles along certain vital points located on the body. Doing so activates the internal energy in the body. This energy then travels to the extracellular matrix network to locate the pathological areas of the dysfunction. Once located, the energy would then initiates self-healing. Moreover, acupuncture has also been found to help lower stress levels [3]. In traditional Chinese medicine, tai chi is a practice that can help generate internal energy, serenity, and mindfulness. Its primary purpose is cultivating the qi from within the body and allowing it to flow powerfully and smoothly. Hence, this practice can be vital in restoring proper qi to the kidneys to combat adrenal fatigue. Moreover, tai chi has proven effective in reducing stress levels. This gentle form of exercise is also ideal for someone dealing with adrenal fatigue. It helps strengthen core strength and muscles without causing the stress associated with a strenuous workout. People with adrenal fatigue should not engage in any strenuous exercise. If tai chi is not something you wish to participate in, you could try yoga, qigong, or Pilates. All provide benefits similar to tai chi. Many people with adrenal fatigue lack certain nutrients in their diets. To combat this, they may resort to [using supplements](/adrenal-fatigue/recovery/the-complete-guide-to-adrenal-fatigue-supplements/) as natural remedies for adrenal fatigue. But while supplements have their place, you should try to get all the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients your body needs from your diet. When using food as a natural remedy for adrenal fatigue, you should cut certain foods out of your diet while incorporating more of others. Foods to avoid include sugary foods, high-fat foods, and processed foods. They can increase your adrenal load. Foods to incorporate in your diet include, amongst others, organic fruits and vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables, healthy proteins like organic chicken, turkey, and lean beef, and oily fish like mackerel, sardines, salmon, and tuna. With regards to carbohydrates, whole grains are best. These include quinoa, brown rice, barley, and cracked wheat. You should also limit your caffeine intake, as this stimulant can cause an energy spike followed by a low. This is not healthy for those with adrenal fatigue. Many supplements can help address the symptoms of adrenal fatigue while providing adrenal support. In particular, adaptogenic herbs can help restore balance while helping your body to manage stress. People with adrenal fatigue usually have a shortage of certain vitamins and minerals. Deciding on the correct remedies, supplements, and dosage can prove challenging. Because of this, we have developed a range of products specifically designed to our specifications that can help you make informed decisions about your care. Please note, however, that you should not take any supplements without the advice of your healthcare practitioner. Many supplements can interact with medications you currently use or are not suitable for use at a certain stage of adrenal fatigue. Furthermore, they are best able to advise you on dosage. Adrenal fatigue, especially in the latter stages, together with its wide variety of possible symptoms, can have a debilitating effect on your health. Yet you can reverse adrenal fatigue by enlisting a set of protocols and using the correct supplements or supplement combinations. Please, however, only use the supplements with the advice of your healthcare provider.
