However, earlier studies have indicated that homoeopathic physicians do not recommend or apply vaccinations as frequently as their allopathic colleagues. Few studieshave been undertaken to clarify this question and most of these have not distinguished between medically and non-medicallyqualied homoeopathic practitioners. Therefore, misunderstandings have arisen concerning this question. In the study presentedonly medically qualied colleagues were included. In the course of this study, 219 medically qualied homoeopathic and 281non-homoeopathic physicians in Germany (response rate 30.4%) returned a questionnaire about the application and recommenda-tion of 17 different vaccinations in their practices. The answers show that the responding homoeopathic physicians do notgenerally refuse vaccines but rather view them with a specic hierarchy. The 'classical' vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria andpoliomyelitis are applied to nearly the same degree as by non-homoeopathic colleagues. Vaccines against childhood diseases, riskgroup vaccinations and vaccinations judged as ineffective are applied and accepted with more restraint by homoeopathicphysicians. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Introduction Although vaccinations are recommended widely and accepted as one of the most effective preventive proce-dures in modern medicine certain groups of physiciansare not using and recommending them accordingly[1-3]. This applies especially to homoeopathic physi-cians. According to the literature, homoeopathic physi-cians are reluctant to recommend and administervaccinations [4]. Results from a survey in Englandconrm these ndings: The reason given most fre-quently by parents for not having their children vacci-nated was 'homoeopathy' with 21% of the answers [5].However, homoeopathic tions appropriately according to the allopathic standard[7-9]. In addition to these contradictory ndings, all previ- ous studies have concentrated only on homoeopaths'general attitudes and opinions towards vaccinations.No attempt has been made to study the application andattitudes towards different vaccinations in detail. Theaim of the present study is to assess homoeopathicphysicians' attitudes and policies concerning vaccina-tions in Germany. 2. Material and method It should be noted that in Germany as well as in other countries homoeopathy can also be practised bynon-medically qualied practitioners. This group hasno regulated mandatory training. However, the applica-tion of vaccinations is restricted to medically qualied matter \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. PI I : S0264-410X(01)00180-3P.Lehrke et al ./Vaccine 19 (2001) 4859 -4864 4860 physicians. Therefore our study includes only the latter group. We used a newly developed semi-standardised ques- tionnaire concerning socio-demographic data as well asstructural data on the use of homoeopathy, applicationand acceptance of vaccinations and recognised side-effects. The questions concerning the problem of vaccina- tions were the same as used in the course of a studyperformed in Freiburg and Black Forest county in1991/1992 ( n=155) [18]. A pre-test was done among a small group of physicians. Because every physician in Germany is permitted to practise homoeopathy, we restrict our study on thosehomoeopathic physicians who have been trained andawarded the title 'Homoeopathie 'which is granted by the General Medical Council in Germany [10]. Addresses of homoeopathic physicians were provided by the 'Deutscher Zentralverein Homoeopathischer Aerzte ', the Society of Homoeopathic Physicians of Germany. In order to obtain a control group, datafrom a non-homoeopathic group of physicians werealso gathered; the 'Aerztekammer ', the General Medi- cal Council in Germany, provided the addresses. Inthree regions of Germany, all homoeopathic generalpractitioners registered at the Society of HomoeopathicPhysicians of Germany were addressed. Homoeopathicpaediatricians were addressed in the whole of Germanyas their number is low. All non-homoeopathic generalpractitioners and paediatricians registered at the'Aerztekammer 'were addressed in two cities with their surrounding areas. The questionnaire was sent to atotal of 1673 general practitioners and paediatricians inGermany, comprising 627 and 1046 non-homeopathic physicians as controls. The survey wasconducted in August 1996 [11]. A reminder was postedto the whole sample after 1 month. Statistical methodsapplied were: uni- and bivariate techniques, factor anal-ysis, analysis of variance and regression analysis toinvestigate associations between variables. 3. Results 3.1.Socio -demographic and structural data Two hundred and nineteen of the homoeopathic and 281 of the non-homoeopathic physicians returned thequestionnaire and thus we met our aim of achieving asample size of n=500 answers (response rate 30.4%). Both groups were asked if they practised homoeopathy.Twelve (2.8%) of the allopathic physicians had noofcial title as a 'homoeopath 'but applied homoeopa- thy in more than 50% of their time in their practice.They were included in the homoeopathic group. Acomparison of age, gender, year of medical registration,years in practice and number of patients in a period of three months (according to specialisation, i.e. generalpractitioners and paediatricians) did not indicate signi - cant differences between homoeopaths and controls.Table 1 shows that the distribution of age groups in thecontrol group of this study represents a good matchwith the age groups of physicians in Germany. Further-more, a comparison of gender of the control group andof physicians in Germany did not reveal signi cant differences. In this respect, the study is representative[12]. In general, no data on age distribution and genderwas attainable for homoeopathic physicians. Furthercontrol of a possible selection bias in the sample wasnot possible as no data were available. The homoeopathic group has a higher proportion of private practices (35.1%) than the control group (4.4%).Also, the distribution of the medical specialisation (gen-eral practitioners vs. paediatricians) is different: ho-moeopaths have a higher proportion of generalpractitioners (68 vs. 55% in controls) and a lowerproportion of paediatricians (26 vs. 40% in controls).The proportion of physicians without any specialisationis 6% in both groups. In the homoeopathic group awider heterogeneity among patients is found: ho-moeopathic general practitioners have a higher propor-tion of children ( /p6616 years) in their practices (24.8 vs. 12.2% in controls) whereas homoeopathic paediatri-cians work with a higher percentage of adults (14.7 vs.7.5% in controls). 3.2.Application of /p54accinations We asked in the questionnaire about the application of 17 different single and combination vaccines (except'travel vaccines ') in the physician 's practice. Immunisa- tions against tetanus, diphtheria, poliomyelitis (0 -17 years of age), measles (0 -17 years of age), mumps (0-17 years of age), German measles (0 -17 years of age), pertussis (0 -17 years of age), hepatitis B (0 -17 years of age) and Hib are offered universally in Ger-many. Immunisations against tuberculosis (till 1998), Table 1 Age of physicians in the study (homoeopaths and controls) and ofphysicians in Germany [12] % of physicians in age group Study group Age (years) Germany Controls Homoeopaths (n=112 660) ./Vaccine (2001) -4864 4861 Fig. 1. Application of vaccinations by homoeopaths and by controls (general practitioners and paediatricians) ( n=479 max., missing cases n=21 max). hepatitis years), poliomyelitis ( /p9217 years), and chicken pox are provided selectively for risk groups. In Fig. 1 the per-centages of homoeopaths administering these vaccina-tions are compared to the control group. No signi cant difference in the acceptance of tetanus vaccination isfound whereas active immunisations against all otherinfectious diseases are at a lower percentage for ho-moeopathic physicians. All these differences are highlysigni cant ( P/p660.001). But, an evaluation of this sig- nicant effect for the parameters 'type of practice 'and 'specialisation 'leads to the following results: (1) Physicians in private practices do generally vacci- nate less than physicians in panel practices independentof their specialisation. As the percentage of privatepractices is clearly higher in the homoeopathic group,the relation seen between homoeopathy and the accep-tance of vaccination is biased. When statistically con-trolling for the type of practice these differences clearlydiminish. (2) The evaluation of the parameter 'type vaccinate more than any other group ofphysicians. As the rate of paediatricians in the ho-moeopathic group is lower, the impression that ho-moeopaths vaccinate less, is biased. Both of these biaseslead to an overestimation of the difference between thetwo groups of physicians.In Fig. 2 the values are corrected for these biases: The differences are clearly smaller when comparinggroups with identical parameters for these two marks,for instance the subgroups of paediatricians with panelpractices in homoeopathic physicians and in controls. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the factors 'type of practice ','type of specialisation 'and 'group of physicians 'on the application of vaccines reveals a genuine reducing effect of the factor 'homoeopath 'on the following vaccinations: DTP, MMR, and varicella vaccinations. All these differ-ences are signi cant with a value of at least P/p660.05. Differences concerning other vaccinations disappear inthe multivariate model. 3.3.Refusal of /p54accines Both groups were asked which vaccines they thought were unnecessary, either for children and /or adults in general, or for risk groups (Fig. 3). Refusal rates rangebetween 0 and 65 %. Not all vaccines are equallyaccepted. Vaccinations against tetanus, diphtheria andpoliomyelitis are well accepted by almost all ho-moeopathic and non-homoeopathic physicians whereasthe vaccination against varicella is partly refused byboth groups. All other vaccines are less accepted byhomoeopaths (average of refusal about 40%), all differ-ences being signi cant with at least P/p660.01. Factor analysis of these answers reveals that the vaccines we enquired about can be divided into fourP.Lehrke et al ./Vaccine 19 (2001) 4859 -4864 4862 '(measles, mumps, German measles, pertussis, chicken pox), (2) vaccinations which are orwere originally meant for risk groups (Hib, hepatitis Aa n dB ,i n fluenza, tick-borne encephalitis), (3) ineffective vaccinations (BCG), (4) active immunisations but often fatal diseases, i.e. tetanus, diphtheria andpoliomyelitis. Vaccinations in the last group are mostlyaccepted by both groups of physicians whereas vaccina-tions of the other three groups are used with morerestraint among homoeopathic physicians. 4. Discussion To date, only few studies have evaluated the attitude of homoeopathic practitioners towards vaccinations.These previous studies focused on the question whetherhomoeopaths in general (i.e. medically and non-medi-cally quali ed homoeopathic practitioners) do vaccinate and whether vaccinations are recommended by ho-moeopathic medical councils. Three studies have evaluated the attitudes of ho- moeopaths concerning vaccination. One small study inAustralia included 29 homoeopaths listed in the tele-phone directory in Sydney. Six homoeopaths returnedthe questionnaire but only two of them were medicallyquali ed practitioners. Vaccination practices varied widely. Reasons were seen in the individual approachof homoeopathic medicine and the absence of a statu-tory body regulating them. Only the medically quali edhomoeopaths recommended conventional vaccination [13]. The second study from UK ( n=23) seems to conrm the assumption that homoeopaths feel sceptical towards vaccinations: ed homoeopathic physicians ( n=3/10) did so [14]. The third study from Austria points out that only 23% ( n=27/117) of ho- moeopathic physicians support vaccinations as a pre-ventive measure [15]. It must be noted that the aim ofthe latter survey was to evaluate their homoeopathicprocedures and their structure of practices, i.e. not toevaluate on attitudes towards vaccination speci cally. We designed our study to avoid the shortcomings of these studies where no distinction between medicallyand non-medically quali ed practitioners was made which led to inconsistent results [16,17]. As the samplesize and response rate of previous studies was low, weaimed to achieve a higher number of respondents and ahigher response rate. The response rate of 30.4% iscomparable to an earlier investigation about immunisa-tions in the same areas of Germany [18]. Analysisperformed to control for possible selection biases in-cluding the parameters age, gender, year of medicalregistration and years in practice revealed no systematicselection effects in the sample. As the response rate islow we cannot exclude that other factors have in flu- enced the willingness to participate in the study. Attitudes towards vaccinations should not be investi- gated on a broad basis but be focused on speci c immunisations. Our study evaluated the attitudes to- Fig. 2.

Refusal of vaccinations by homoeopaths and by controls. Percentage answering: not necessary for any group (adults, children, risk groups) (n=500). wards 17 different vaccinations. We considered as criti- cal not only to obtain the opinion of the physicians 'on vaccinations but also to determine which vaccinationsare actually administered in daily practice. Moreover,our aim was not to nd out the physicians 'accordance to the national immunisation schedule but to investi-gate if a certain pattern of acceptance of differentvaccinations is prevalent. The practices of homoeopathic and non-ho- moeopathic physicians differ in their structure. Thedifferences in application of vaccinations presented inFig. 1 re flect the 'crude 'differences as found in our sample concerning almost all of the vaccinations. Afteradjusting for the structural differences it becomes clearthat differences become smaller and that homoeopathicphysicians refuse only certain vaccinations: they prac-tice a speci c hierarchy of vaccines and do not object to vaccinations in general. There are few of cial statements has made no of cial statement on vaccina- tion policy, yet. Only the Society of Homoeopaths, theorganisation of non-medically quali ed practitioners in England, has made a critical statement with concernsabout the long-term safety of vaccines [3]. In 1991, D.S.Spence, President of the Faculty of Homoeopathy inEngland recommended the use of conventional vaccina-tions as long as there were no medical contraindica- tions. Like many other medically quali ed homoeopaths he compared vaccinations with the ho-moeopathic principle, i.e. 'the giving of like for like ' [19]. Hahnemann (1755 -1843), the founder of ho- moeopathy, viewed smallpox vaccination as a cleardemonstration of the law of similars [7]. Hahnemannsaid in 1842: 'this seems to be the reason for this bene cial remarkable fact namely that since the general distribution of Jenner 's Cow Pox vaccination, human smallpox never again appeared as epidemically or viru-lently as 40 -50 years before when one city visited lost at least one-half and often three-quarters of its childrenby death of this miserable pestilence '[20]. In order to avoid future misunderstandings in regard to the attitudes and views of homoeopathic physicianstowards vaccination we think that an of cial statement concerning this matter should be considered by theGerman Society of Homoeopathic Physicians. Thiswould impose the need to be open-minded about vacci-nations knowing from this study that a different accep-tance and application of vaccinations is prevalent inhomoeopathic physicians.
