One of the core issues librarians face is that many students do not necessarily know what a librarian does, nor how they can help them. To remedy this problem, a group of librarians at an R1 institution collaborated with students from a PR class to devise marketing strategies so as to better reach undergraduates and promote the libraries' subject specialists. Following this collaboration, the group implemented some of the recommended marketing strategies, and assessed whether these methods would resonate with students and/or change their perceptions of librarians. For the purpose of breadth and depth of understanding and corroboration, the researchers used a mixed methods approach, believing that combining elements of qualitative and quantitative research approaches through distributed surveys and focus groups, would help them to better understand the effectiveness of library marketing and PR strategies to promote subject specialists. - Metadata: [xml](https://hcommons.org/deposits/download/hc:32045/descMetadata/xml/) - Status: - Published - Last Updated: - 3 years ago - License: [Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) - an Academic Library's Marketing Strategies to Promote Subject Specialists: A Mixed Methods Approach "}
