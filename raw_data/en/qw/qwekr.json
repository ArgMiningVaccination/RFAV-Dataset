Dunnill, The Plato of Praed Street: The Life And Times of Almroth Wright (Royal Society of Medicine: London, 2001); Zachary Almroth Wright: Provocative Doctor and Thinker (William Heineman: London, 1954). 4. Almroth Wright was a publicly acclaimed anti-suffragist, and he never allowed womeninto his laboratory. There were no women scientists under his tutelage to invite to join 5. Almroth E.

The adoption of Wright's anti-typhoidinoculation technique made England the only country to have troops resistant to typhoid at the onset of the First World War. Wright was knighted in 1906 for recognition of his research and successes in preventive inoculation against the enteric group of infections, notably typhoid fever. Martin J. Synnott Image provided by The American Association of Immunologists Collection, Center for Biological Sciences Archives, University of Maryland, Baltimore CountyO n the unusually warm evening of June 19, 1913, far from the national spotlight or any mention on the front pages of newspapers, a small group of physicians met on the campus of the University of Minnesota to form a society for a new medical specialty. This new society would help define immunology as bona fide area of specialization and would eventually becomethe preeminent professional association for immunologists in the world. These physicians had been attending the annual meeting of the American Medical Association 2 and were meeting at the invitation of Martin J. Synnott, a private practice physician from Montclair, New Jersey, who had made previous, failed attempts to organize a society of North American disciples of Sir Almroth Wright 3. On this day, however, he was finally successful, andThe American Associationof Immunologists (AAI) was founded. The new society quickly organized around a definitive name, a set of objectives, andleadership that would build the foundation for lasting success. In just a few years, the new society would lead in legitimizing a new scientific discipline as the group established its ownannual meeting and created what was to become the most highly acclaimed peer-reviewed scientific journal in its fieldThe Journal of Immunology (The JI). The idea to form a new professional organization had firs occurred to Synnott (AAI 1913, secretary 1913-1918) in early 1912. As a former student of Sir Almroth Wright (AAI Honorary 1914), Synnott wanted to bring together the men 4 in the United States and Canada who had trained with Wright and shared his vision of the emerging promise of vaccine therapy. In 1912, Synnott wrote to 49 former students of Wright's and received 40 favorable responses to his proposal for forming \"The Societyof Vaccine Therapists.\" These 40 physicians were in practicelocated across the continent, isolated from other colleagues schooled in Wright's premise that \"the physician of the future would be a vaccine therapist.\" 5 Wright's \"disciples\" were not sufficiently organized in any fashion to promote awareness othe promise held by vaccine therapies.Wright was the founder and director of the Inoculation Department at St. Mary's Hospital in London and the Praed Street Laboratories. His laboratories were focused on the concept that \"recovery from all infective diseases must be largely determined by the development of 'antibodies' in the patient's blood and that this process could be probably stimulated by inoculation of the appropriate vaccine.\" Wright advocated for more than mere vaccination, promoting a technique of vaccine therapy that he had developed. Thetherapy was based upon the premise that a sick patient could be injected with appropriate levels of a vaccine to \"exploit the uninfected tissue in favor of the infected.\" His initial success in the early 1900s with an effective anti-typhoid inoculationtechnique had made the Praed Street Laboratories a magnet for new students. This inoculation technique was adopted bythe British War Department in 1914 as standard procedure. Its success had earlier led to Wright's being inducted into knighthood. 6 Despite the British military's adoption of his inoculation technique and his 1906 induction into knighthood, Wright's vaccine therapy research in 1912 was not appreciated or widely employed outside of England. Synnott's efforts to form thenew Society of Vaccine Therapists were intended to promoteawareness of the field's promise. Despite the 40 positiveresponses Synnott had received for the concept of the new society in 1912, too few of his colleagues were available for 2 AAI History Compendium (2021)Gerald B.

AAI Archives.through Animal Experimentation,\" Gay asserted that \"[t]he science of immunity, or immunology, would explain the mechanism by which the animal body is enabled to resist disease.\" 12 In 1913, Webb was well aware of Wright's 1909 proclamation that \"the physician of the future will be an immunisator,\" and, as his biographer makes clear, Webb preferred Gay's broad definition of \"immunology\" tothe narrow denotation of Wright's \"immunisator,\" referring very specifically to an immunizer, inoculator, or vaccine therapist 13 Nearly 65 years later, the wisdom of Webb's preference was praised for its importance to the recognition of immunology as a scientific discipline when David Talmage (AAI 1954,president 1978-1979) stated, \"I believe we can properly attribute [immunology's] prominence in our vocabulary, if not its invention, to Dr. Webb.\" 14 Beyond naming the new society at the founding meeting, the members also created a mission statement in the form of three objectives. The first two reflected the inclusiveness sforth with the use of \"immunology\" in the name. \"To unite the physicians of the United States and Canada who are engaged in the scientific study of immunology and bacterial therapy.To study the problems of immunology, and to promote by its concerted efforts scientific research in this department.\" The third objective clearly stemmed from Synnott's intention to promote awareness of Wright's teachings: \"To spread a correct knowledge of vaccine therapy and immunology among general practitioners.\" The dues of the association, to be fixed annuallby the Council, were \"not to exceed Five Dollars ($5.00).\" 15the proposed organizational meeting. He soon made another attempt, calling for a meeting on the evening of May 5, 1913, at the Hotel Raleigh, Washington, DC, during the annual meeting of the Association of American Physicians. Still, there were too few participants. Undeterred, Synnott scheduled the successful Minneapolis organizational meeting from which the new professional society emerged that summer. In Synnott's view, it was a society of vaccine therapists. The scope and membership of the new society formed at the meeting, however, departed significantly from Synnott's initial concept, encompassing a broader view of the science and clinical practice. This difference was reflected in the name the new society: The American Association of Immunologists The name is attributed to Gerald B. Webb, a nationally renowned tuberculosis physician and researcher who would become the first president of the society. Although he had trained with Wright and was a devoted disciple, he was concerned that Synnott's proposed Society of Vaccine Therapists would impose restrictions on future growth of the new organization.7 For Webb, linking a society exclusively with vaccine therapy posed two major problems. First, he was aware that Wright's theories and methods were viewed with skepticism in England and Europe, and he sought to avoid this tarnish.8 Second, restricting a society to a single process would limit its interest. If the new society was perceived as anchored only in vaccine therapy, Webb feared it would not attract clinicians and researchers in other related, growing fields, such as experimental pathology. To make the society more inclusive and flexible, the founders expanded the list of eligible members to include physicians and researchers who had trained with \u00c9lie Metchnikoff9 Paul Ehrlich, August von Wassermann, as well as in \"other famous laboratories in Europe.\"10 They also sought a name for the organization that would connote a broader mission and position the society for growth with scientific and medical advances. They settle upon using a new term, \"immunology,\" in the name. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \"immunology\" had entered the English language through its use by two future AAI members and presidents shortly before the founding of AAI. In 1909 Ludvig Hektoen (AAI president 1926) was the first to use the word. He did so in his article, \"Opsonins and Other Antibodies,\" in Science.11 Hektoen used the term only once - and only in passing - when referring to the law of opsonin production: \"In the language of immunology any substance capable of giving rise to antibodies in suitable animals is called an antigen.\" Then, a mere three months before AAI was formed, Frederick P. Gay (AAI 1918, president 1921) defined immunology as a distinct scientifi discipline in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In his article, \"Immunology: A Medical Science Developed www.aai.org 316.\"Medical News,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 61, no. 23 (1913): 2079. 17.Minutes of the First Annual Meeting of The American Association of Immunologists, 22 June 1914. AAI Archives. 18.When the AAI Constitution and By-Laws document was adopted in April 1917, the only membership category was \"Active.\" Honorary and Corresponding memberships were eliminated. The majority of the Honorary Members were transferred to Activemembership and the Corresponding Members were all removed from the AAI membership rolls. The Honorary membership returned in 1935 but was then verysimilar to the current AAI Emeritus Member classification 19. S. R. Douglas, F.R.S. (1871-1936) was a bacteriologist and captain in the R.A.M.C. In 1902, Douglas became an assistant to Wright, was the initial assistant director of the inoculation department at St. Mary's Hospital, and in 1914, became the deputy director of the National Institute for Medical Research (UK). In 1903, Wright and Douglas published a paper on the role of the body fluids in phagocytosis, which helpedstimulate work on vaccines and vaccine therapy. 20. Alexander Fleming (1881-1955), a student and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Wright's, is best known for his discovery of penicillin in 1928 for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945. John Freeman, D.M. (1877-1962) was one of Wright's first disciples, who spent his entire professional career at St. Mary's Hospital. Primarilya bacteriologist, Freeman also carried out research in allergy and asthma. 21. The founders classified those who joined AAI before 1915 as Charter Member 22.\"Roll of Charter Members,\" c. 1914. AAI Archives. c.1914. AAI Archives. [emphasis added]Requirements for election to the membership were established. A candidate had to be nominated by one member, be endorsed by two additional members, have provided the AAI secretary with \"papers\" that indicated the character of his or her contributions to immunology, and have \"at least one published contribution to the science of immunology.\" Thecandidate had to be a \"graduate of medicine,\" although no specific degree requirements were mentioned The officers elected during the 1913 meeting were We (president), Synnott (secretary), George W. Ross (vice-president), Willard J. Stone (treasurer), , and five councillors,including A. Parker Hitchens (chairman of the council), Oscar Berghausen, Campbell Laidlaw, Henry L. Ulrich, and J.E. Robinson. The officers set a date and location for their nemeeting, the first AAI annual meeting: June 1, 1914, in AtlanticCity, New Jersey. 16 Although the date was eventually moved to later in the month, 18 of 52 initial AAI members did, in fact, convene for the first annual meeting of the society on June 22, 1914, at theHotel Chelsea in Atlantic City. According to the minutes of the first annual meeting, \"the work of developing the societyhad progressed slowly but effectively\" since Minneapolis 17 Membership in AAI had increased from its 52 initial members to 59 with the election of seven new scientists at the meeting. The leadership was kept in place as ll of the officers wer re-elected, and a draft of the constitution and by-laws was proposed to provide organizational stability. The impetusfor future growth, however, was provided by the interesting science presented at this first annual meeting and the founders'creativity in plans for membership development. Attendees at this meeting discussed a range of diverse topics during the one-day conference. Presented at the meeting were a few papers on techniques or hypotheses that would not be borne out by later experimentation and that would not be considered \"immunology\" by today's standards, but several of the speakers presented studies and technical innovations that did presage the ultimate focus of the field (See Science at the First AAI Annual Meeting, p. 7.) The members at this first meeting may have had littl experience in membership development, but they did not lack imagination for novel ways to enhance the prestige of membership in the society. They established two discretionary membership classes defined vaguely enough to conveymember status on a group of prestigious British physicians focused on vaccine therapy at St. Mary's Hospital. 18 The firs of these special membership classes created was the Honorary Member category, to which they elected Almroth Wright and Captain S. R. Douglas. 19 The second category was that of Corresponding Member, to which they elected Alexander Fleming and John Freeman. 20 Of the 59 Charter Members, the majority were clinicians or professors, and, in keeping with the trend prior to the Second World War, there were very few, if any, Ph.D.s.; 21 most, if not all of the Charter Members, were M.D.s. The association had abroad geographical reach and included members from as far north as Toronto, Canada, and as far south as Temple, Texas; from as far east as Boston, Massachusetts, and as far west as Honolulu, Hawaii. The Philadelphia region boasted the mostearly members (12), followed by New York City region (11), and Ohio (7). The Charter Members also included a constituencythat would have been anathema to the vehemently anti-suffrage Wright: two women 22 Growth of the new society was robust enough that, by the time of that first annual meeting in Atlantic City, evenSynnott seems to have accepted the utility of Webb's preferred term of \"immunologist\" over \"immunisator.\" When asked to offer attendees an account of the founding of the society,Synnott took liberties in paraphrasing Wright's famous assertion, stating that \"the physician of the future would be an immunologist,\" and that the new society \"would in a few years be one of the most important medical organizations on this continent.\" 23 Though Webb is often cast as the most important founding member, two less heralded Charter Members were equally important to the continued success of the new society: A. Parker Hitchens (AAI 1913, Council president 1913-1917) and Richard Weil (AAI 1914, president 1916-1917). As the president of the Council, Hitchens drafted the first AAI Constitution and By-laws, which established howthe organization was to be governed. He was also almost solely responsible for making sure that AAI was a co-founder of The Journal of Immunology with the New York Society for Serology and Hematology (see AAI Newsletter, Dec. 2011). Weil had an equal, if less obvious, impact on the association during his abbreviated membership. He was a Charter Member 4 AAI History Compendium (2021)and served as AAI president from 1916 to 1917, but his most enduring contributions to the society were in his recruitment of members and his early assistance to The JI. Shortly before his retirement, Arthur Coca (AAI 1916, secretary-treasurer 1918- 1945, editor-in-chief 1920-1948) singled out Weil, praising him for having \"used his considerable influence to induceoutstanding immunologists to join [AAI].\" 24 Coca also recalled Weil's \"more optimistic\" view of the new journal, which led him to contribute four papers for the first issue. Weil's papers,in Coca's estimation, \"helped materially\" to start the journal. 25 Further, Coca credited Weil for his role in selecting the initial editorial board for The JI. Thefounders of AAI were enjoying great momentum, but all of their good efforts were soon tobe abruptly interrupted. On April 6, 1917, while AAI members were in New York City for their fourth annual meeting, they learned that the United States Congress had declared war on Germany. The\"war to end all wars,\" which had been raging in Europe for almost three years, had now become a reality for America, and her citizens quickly mobilized for war. As in all other areas of American life, the war had an immediate and lasting impact on the nascent society. On the same day that they learned the United States had entered the First World War, members of the AAI Council passed the following resolution of shared sacrifice Whereas the Government of the United States may soon need the services of trained bacteriologists and immunologists and the facilities of their respective laboratories, Be it Resolved, that the American Association of Immunologists in meeting on April 6 th and 7th, 1917, as a body and as individuals, offer their services and the facilitiesof their laboratories to the Federal and respective State governments; and, Be it further Resolved, that the secretary of the American Association of Immunologists send a copy of this resolution to the Secretary of War.was among them. A number of members stayed in their laboratories to carry out wartime research, while others enlisted in the U.S. Army Medical Reserve Corps and were sent to bases around the country. The focus of the laboratories in wartime shifted to meet the needs of the military, conducting research into the pandemic influenza 26 trench diseases, and wound-related infections. Wartime mobilization also directly affected the society'sleadership. Willard Stone had to relinquish his duties as AAI treasurer when he was stationed at the base hospital at Fort Riley, Kansas, in 1917. 27 And Weil was assigned first to Fort Benjamin Harrison near Lawrence, Indiana, and then to Camp Wheeler, outside of Macon, Georgia, as chief of medical service to help quell an outbreak of measles and pneumonia at the camp. Tragically, Weil died of complications from pneumonia on November 19, 1917, only a few months after arriving at the camp. 28 He was the only AAI member to die during the war, but Richard Weil Image provided by The American Association of Immunologists Collection, Center for Biological Sciences Archives, UMBCWeil Resolution Image provided by AAI 24.

However, there were an additional 56 eligible SSH members who were provided the opportunity to join, and some of them did, including Elise L'Esperance and future AAI President Lemuel W. Famulener. No official documentation survives for the exact total or dates of electioto AAI of the 56 eligible SSH members. 32.

The total membership numbers are the most conservative based on the existingdocuments in the AAI Archive. Membership in AAI was counted only where election results are verifiable. The most problematic years in reconstructing total AAmembership are 1919 and 1920. The AAI council records, which include elections andresignations, from 1919 are completely missing and the records for SSH members joining AAI in 1920 are incomplete. 35. The Ransdell Act (1930) reorganized, expanded, and renamed the Hygienic Laboratory(created in 1887) as the National Institutes of Health. Joseph J. Kinyoun founded and was the first director of the Hygienic Laboratory, serving from 1887 to 1899 his death dealt AAI a profound loss. At its fifth annual meeting in 1918, AAI passed a resolution honoring his legacy.29 The year 1920 marked another important year in the history of AAI. It was in that year that the New York Society for Serology and Hematology (SSH) and AAI were merged. SSH had \"omitted its monthly meeting for over a year and, since the function of the societies had been in a measure superseded by the American Association of Immunologists, it was deemed advisable to consolidate the societies.\" 30 Its members were provided the option of AAI membership. This event addedsignificantly to the size of the organization by adding a numberof SSH members to the AAI rolls. 31 The absorption of SSH by AAI eliminated the only other organization in the United States \"having interest in immunological matters.\" 32 Additionally, The JI became the \"property and official organ\" of AA33 By the close of 1920, AAI boasted a membership of 152 physicians and scientists from 22 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada, including 16 women members. 34 The membership included the preeminent American scientists and physicians Simon Flexner, Theobald Smith, Oswald Avery,Hans Zinsser, Rufus Cole, Victor Vaughn, William H. Park, Anna Williams, Elise L'Esperance, and George McCoy (the firstdirector of the National Institutes of Health 35). Within the next ten years, the membership was to include Karl Landsteiner, Hideyo Noguchi, Karl F. Meyer, Paul DeKruif, and AAI was now fulfilling Webb's and other founders' earliest vision for the society. The membership was inclusive andflexible, with clinicians, researchers, and public healthscientists. With the successful founding of AAI and the preeminence of The JI, the standing of immunology as a distinct discipline of science was broadly recognized by the 1920s. Today, AAI is the largest, most prestigious professional association for immunologists worldwide, with approximately 7,500 members in 60 countries. The society fulfills its foundersideals in today's mission to \"promote by its concerted effortsscientific research\" in immunology through a dedicationto advancing the knowledge of immunology and its related disciplines, fostering the interchange of ideas and information among investigators, and addressing the potential integration of immunologic principles into clinical practice. Since the society's founding 99 years ago, 19 AAI members have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 45 have received Lasker Awards, and two have been awarded the Kyoto Prize. The Journal of Immunology has maintained a level of noted prominence in the field\u2014if not all of bioscience\u2014for almostone century. As the largest journal in the field, it has beendedicated to consistently featuring important and innovative research across a breadth of topics. With over 150 editors and 4,000 volunteer reviewers, The JI provides full peer review for the more than 3,500 manuscripts submitted annually. The AAI annual meeting has evolved from 60 earnest scientists meeting for one day in Atlantic City to over 3,500 scientists meeting for 5 days in selected major cities around the United States. In 2011, 1,768 scientific abstracts were presented;160 speakers were featured in symposia and other sessions; 130 scientific companies occupied the exhibit floor; and galasreceptions, and parties were held almost every evening. Every year, hundreds of AAI members work on behalf of their colleagues as members of the Editorial Board of The JI, session chairs at the annual meeting, speakers and course instructors, and members or chairs of committees. The association is overseen by the AAI Council, eight of the most prestigious members, elected to their positions by the membership. The AAI is professionally managed by a hiredstaff with diverse expertise including scientists who are AAImembers. Each year, AAI gives approximately 500 grants and awards to talented early- and mid-career scientists to cultivate the next generation of leaders and investigators, and AAI recognizes the most senior and accomplished members with a variety of career awards. Through the annual meeting, The Journal of Immunology, courses, and the work of its many committees, AAI continues to push forward the boundaries of knowledge in the field and improve the quality of professionallife for its members. AAI provides a strong central voice for immunologists, bringing members' science and issues to the attention of policymakers, funding agencies, and the public. Not even Synnott could possibly have imagined what that first meeting on a hot summer day in Minneapolis would bring 6 AAI History Compendium (2021)Held in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on June 22, 1914, the small contingent of 18 scientists was a mere handful compared with attendance today, yet the scientific basis of later AAI annual meetings was already evident at this first meeting. The attendees discussed a diverse range of topics that would help define the new field of immunology. As most of the early AAI members were clinicians, and communicable diseases, which today are easily curable, were still a public health menace, many of the presentations at the meeting focused on public health issues of the time\u2014and, not surprisingly, the topics (and terminology) examined in these early years were rather different from those today. Presentations included examinations of \"specific ferments\" produced by cells against bacteria, a comparison of available diagnostic tests for syphilis, a study of complement fixation tests to determine the causative bacterium in infective arthritis deformans, and an examination of the intraspinal treatment of syphilis with salvarsan, an organoarsenic and anti-syphilitic compound then in use. The early science was not without its missteps. The meeting began with several presentations on the Aberhalden Test, a test based on \"defensive,\" specific proteases formed by exposure of cells to a foreign protein and thought to be diagnostic of pregnancy, infection, and cancer. Although the theory of defensive proteases was not supported by later work, and the pregnancy test developed by Aberhalden was ultimately found to be unreliable, William Whitridge Williams and Clarence B. Ingraham, both of Denver, Colorado, concluded in their presentation on the Aberhalden Pregnancy Test that the test \"might be considered a definite and reliable reaction.\" However, there was some disagreement among the attending scientists about the nature of the \"ferments\" produced by cells upon contact with a foreign organism or protein and whether they were in fact protease- or antibody-based.Other science presented at the meeting perhaps provided a firmer foundation for future work and discoveries in the field. Several scientists, including F. M. Pottenger of Monrovia, California, and Jacob Bronfenbrenner of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, gave presentations on the merits of tuberculin therapy\u2014the treatment of tuberculosis with extracts of its bacterial cultures. Although the therapy had not been curative, they debated whether the poor efficacy was a result of differences in animal models vs. human patients or the strain from which the tuberculin was isolated. Although this therapy never became the standard of care, due to inconsistent application and considerable side effects, its deficiencies did inform later immunotherapies for tuberculosis. Of course, as remains true today, several talks at the meeting dealt with technical innovations, such as a technique for preparing bacterial vaccines pure of extraneous proteins from culture media or a method for culturing infected tissue from arthritis patients. The scientists at the first AAI annual meeting presented their findings, secure in the knowledge that these studies were of critical import to the future of human health. Gerald B. Webb asserted the importance of the organization and the field in the first AAI Presidential Address when he \"agreed with [Sir Almroth E.] Wright that the physician of the future would be an immunologist.\" Science at the First AAI Annual Meeting Hotel Chelsea, Atlantic City, N.J., location of the first AAI annual meeting Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Detroit Publishing Company CollectionImage provided by the AAI Archive www.aai.org 7On a pleasantly warm Monday, June 22, 1914, 40 attendees arrived at the Hotel Chelsea in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for the first annual meeting of The American Association of Immunologists (AAI).1 This May, 102 years later, the association will hold its 100th annual meeting in Seattle, Washington, with attendance expected to exceed 3,000. The scientific program for the 100th AAI annual meeting, IMMUNOLOGY 2016, is to span four full days, with presentations by nearly 100 plenary session lecturers and panelists in major symposia, plus the panelists in 16 guest society symposia, NIH symposia, and career development sessions. Approximately 2,000 scientists at every career stage will present their work in 82 block symposia and poster presentations on 22 abstract topics. I n addition to sessions on leading-edge research in established fields, the meeting will feature sessions on emerging fields of immunology and technology. Almost 150 exhibitors will be present to showcase the newest tools and resources available to researchers in the field. At IMMUNOLOGY 2016, The Journal of Immunology (The JI) will celebrate its own centennial with special exhibits and events and will host its own booth in the Skybridge portion of the AAI Exhibit Hall. Why is the 2016 meeting in Seattle the 100th annual meeting if the first was in 1914? A historical hiccup caused by the Second World War is the reason that the AAI annual meeting is currently in sync with the age of The JI and not AAI itself. In 1943, 1944, and 1945, wartime travel restrictions in the United States forced the cancelation of national annual meetings for scientific societies large and small, including AAI and all members of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). The AAI meeting in 1943, scheduled to be held in Cleveland, was to be the first annual meeting of AAI as a member society of FASEB, but the meeting was canceled less than one month out. The 1944 and 1945 meetings were also scheduled for Cleveland, but each had to be canceled as well. Since the end of the war, however, all scheduled AAI annual meetings have occurred as planned. The location of the first annual meeting was determined by the location of the American Medical Association (AMA) meeting, as was the case for the AAI founders' meeting in Minneapolis the previous year.2 In that most AAI members were physicians and also members of the AMA, the first AAI Council resolved to hold the smaller AAI meeting one day before the AMA meeting began with its anticipated 4,000 attendees.3 Among the 40 AAI attendees was a particularly engaged Victor C. Vaughan (AAI '15), thenAAI LOOKS BACK 1. \"Today's Sun and Tide Table,\" New York Times, June 23, 1914.

Others in attendance included future AAI Presidents William H. Park and Jacque J. Bronfenbrenner.4 A one-hour-long AAI Council meeting preceded the 10:00 AM formal opening of the inaugural annual meeting. The \" Address of Welcome\" by AAI President Gerald B. Webb was followed by a roll call, an election of officers and members, and the adoption of a constitution and bylaws. Martin J. Synnott, AAI secretary, reported on how the association had been founded and presciently predicted that the AAI would soon be \"one of the most important medical organizations on this continent.\"5 The first scientific session began with George H.Smith of H. K. Mulford Company, Glenolden, Pennsylvania, delivering his paper, \"The Production, through Immunization, of Specific Ferments against Bacteria: as Detected by the Abderhalden Test.\" The meeting lasted one full day, consisting of three sessions and a total of 19 basic and clinical research talks, including the pr esident's address.6 Each presentation was followed by an open discussion led by an invited scientist.7 (To learn more about the science at the meeting, see \"Science at the First AAI Meeting,\" AAI Newsletter, May/June 2012.) At the meeting, the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association requested a report of the proceedings for publication in the journal.8 During the next four decades the AAI meeting was held as a stand-alone meeting or concurrently with other societies, including multiple times with the American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists (now American Society for Investigative Pathology). Following the acceptance of membership in FASEB and the resumption of meetings after the Second World War, the AAI annual meeting took place as part of the FASEB annual meeting (now Experimental Biology) from 1946 through 2005 with the exception of eight meetings that were joint meetings with other societies or stand-alone meetings. Since 2005, AAI has held stand-alone meetings, with the exception of its co-location with Experimental Biology in 2008. Geographically, the AAI annual meetings remained exclusively in the East and Midwest for four decades, with A tlantic City; Philadelphia; New York City; Chicago; Washington, DC; and Toronto each hosting multiple times. In 1955 the first meeting west of the Mississippi River took place in San Francisco. The first meeting in the Pacific Northwest did not occur until IMMUNOLOGY 2000 in Seattle, but with IMMUNOLOGY 2016, AAI will have met a third time in Seattle since 2000. The 100 annual meetings have included stops in 27 different cities in 18 states; the District of Columbia; and Ontario, Canada. More information on the early years of AAI will be featured in the updated AAI Centennial Timeline to be displayed in the Skybridge portion of the Exhibit Hall at the 2016 AAI annual meeting. Attendees will also be able to view a special exhibit on the first AAI annual meeting as well as the leading immunology scientists and institutions in Seattle. The History Exhibit will be located on the 6th floor of the Washington State Convention Center. n Author: John S. Emrich, Ph.D., AAI Historian History InternEditor: Mary I.

Beach and boardwalk, Atlantic City, N.J., c. 1908 Detroit Publishing Company Photograph Collection, Library of Congress www.aai.org 9The American Association of Immunologists (AAI) benefits now, as at its founding, from the participation and contributions of researchers in academia, government, and industry. Although AAI members throughout the association's 102-year history have been based largely in academia, a smaller, but significant, portion of members has worked in government and industry. All three member segments have provided leadership and vision shaping the association of today. In this article, AAI reflects upon the vital contributions of industry members in the organization's first three decades\u20141913-1943. These early members were scientists from for-profit, commercial institutions with research laboratories. Some worked in establishments for the medical treatment of people convalescing from a chronic illness and others were employed by pharmaceutical companies. Of the original 52 AAI charter members in 1913, nine were employed b y sanatoria or pharmaceutical companies, including Cragmor Sanatorium, H. K. Mulford Company, and Parke-Davis and Company. By 1943, at least 21 of the then 310 active members had spent at least some of their careers in industry at such companies as Lederle Laboratories, E. R. Squibb & Sons, and Eli Lilly & Company, to name a few.1 Sanatorium Movement and AAI In the nineteenth century, tuberculosis remained a leading cause of death in industrialized countries. The disease was, in fact, the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one out of every five deaths in the country from 1800-1870. The disease afflicted young and old, men and women, urban and rural, and rich and poor.2 The German response to this centuries old scourge was to establish sanatoria predicated upon the importance of \"fresh air, rest, good food, and regulated exercise.\"3 The first was a private facility was opened by Hermann Brehmer in 1854 in the mountains of Silesia. Because some patients enjoyed dramatic improvement in this setting, the German government funded a number of public sanatoria (Volksheilst\u00e4tten) in the 1870s.4 The ranks of public sanatoria quickly swelled as disability insurance funds became available to fund treatment for most tuberculosis.5 The emerging U.S. public health movement, coupled with the growing progressive reform movements of the late nineteenth century made the United States fertile ground for sanatoria.6 Following New York physician Edward L. Trudeau's opening of his Saranac Lake facility in 1884, a number of U.S. sanatoria were established, albeit with little consensus on effective therapies.7 The AAI LOOKS BACK 1. When the AAI Constitution and Bylaws was adopted in 1917, the only membership category was \" Active.\" In 1935, an Honorary membership category was created. It was very similar to the current AAI Emeritus member classification. 2. Sheila M.

The terms \"sanitarium\" and \"sanatorium\" were used nearly interchangeably in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The small distinction between the two terms is that sanitaria were generally considered more health retreats/resorts, whereas sanatoria carried more of a hospital connotation. We are using \"sanatorium\" except when the proper names of an institution dictate the use of sanitarium. 7. Kraut, Hives of Sickness, 77.Industry Representation in Early AAI Tuberculosis camp in Ottawa, Illinois, ca. 1908 Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division Sanatorium in Lysin, Switzerland, ca. 1890 Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division 10 AAI History Compendium (2021)Industry Representation in Early AAIU.S. sanatoria evolved as three types based on three different funding models: public facilities owned and operated by local or state municipalities; privately funded, non-profit facilities with costs of patient care supported by charitable organizations such as workers' unions or immigrant groups; and private, for-profit institutions to serve the wealthy who could afford to finance their own cutting-edge care.8 These sanatoria for the wealthy were among the first to have laboratories, although by the 1910s, most public sanatoria, Catawba Sanatorium in Virginia, for example, included at least a basic laboratory for research. Two eminent tuberculosis researchers were among the early AAI members associated with private, for-profit tuberculosis sanatoria: the first president of AAI, Gerald B. Webb (AAI '13, president 1913- 1915), and K arl von Ruck (AAI '13). Webb lent his national renown as a tuberculosis physician and researcher to the emergence of Colorado Springs as a center for tuberculosis research and sanatoria.9 Having also helped craft the initial scope and membership of the association during the founding meetings, Webb became its first president.10 Karl von Ruck was founder of the Winyah Sanatorium (1888) and the von Ruck Research Laboratory for Tuberculosis (1895) in Asheville, North Carolina. With both of these institutions playing important roles in establishing that city as a haven for convalescence, the laboratory became a magnet for early-career researchers. Among others there, Jules Freund (AAI '24, president 1955-56) and Louis Dienes (AAI '24), became AAI members soon after their arrival at the von Ruck Laboratory. Both published their clinical and laboratory tuberculosis research in The Journal of Immunology (The JI). Other sanatoria-based researchers among early AAI members included Amelia L. Gates (AAI '13), Gates Sanitarium Sr. (AAI '13), Pottenger Sanatorium for Diseases of the Lungs and Throat in Monrovia, California; G. Burton Gilbert (AAI '13), Laboratory of North Carolina.11 Although Webb, as AAI president, held the highest office on the AAI masthead, many sanatoria scientists actively participated in annual meetings, nominated potential new members, and published much of their research in The Journal of Immunology, making The JI one of the leading repositories of literature on the understanding and treatment of tuberculosis, until the introduction of streptomycin and isonicotinic hydrazide brought the disease under control following the Second World War.12 Biologics in Early Pharma In the early twentieth century, the pharmaceutical industry was undergoing a phase of rapid expansion that coincided with the growth in biologics\u2014and with the founding of AAI. Growth of the largest drug industry trade association provides a useful index to the growth in pharma. That group, the American Drug Manufacturers' Association, was founded in 1912 with 29 companies, but within 10 years, the membership had expanded to 54 companies.13 8. Ibid., 77-78.

The Gates Sanitarium, founded by Amelia G ates and her husband Howard, was in operation from 1898 through the early twentieth century. The Pottenger Sanatorium for Diseases of the Lungs and Throat, founded by Francis M. Pottenger, Sr. (1869-1961), was in operation from 1903 to 1955. Cragmor Sanatorium, today part of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, was founded by Edwin Solly and in operation from 1905 to 1962. 12. Kraut, Hives of Sickness, 77. 13.

AAI members in major cities, such as Philadelphia and New York, that had lar ge and small pharmaceutical companies were not included unless they supplied a known street address for a commercial institution. For this reason, all industry member counts are conservative, as we only counted members whom we could conclusively determine worked for a commercial institution. 16. For more information on the founding of The JI, see \"The Founding of The Journal of Immunology,\" AAI Newsletter (December 2011), 17-18.of chemical assays in laboratory testing enabled companies to verify their claims of drug purity.14 Third, Emil von Behring's discovery of a successful diphtheria antitoxin in 1890 triggered drug manufacturers to enter biologics. Doing so required companies to construct commercial biological laboratories, prompting them either to hire highly trained researchers or associate with a trusted academic or medical institution to guarantee the quality of their products. As is the practice today, biomedical researchers moved frequently between academia and the pharmaceutical industry. Scientists commonly split their time equally between positions in industry and academia. Because little data exist on early AAI members' institutional affiliations, it is difficult to determine the length of time an AAI member spent in a particular company. We do, however, know that AAI members who enjoyed some affiliation with the pharmaceutical industry during their careers made contributions, large and small, to shape the association during its formative years.15 For example, E. C. L. Miller (AAI '13) served on the first nominating committee and recruited three of his former colleagues from Parke-Davis, and John F . Anderson (AAI '18), former director of the Hygienic Laboratory of the United States Public Service (redesignated the National Institutes of Health in 1930), director of the Research and Biological Laboratories, and vice president of E. R. Squibb & Sons, served on the Board of Editors of The JI (1916-1935). Two early members, Arthur F .Coca (AAI '16) and A. Parker Hitchens (AAI '13), both served as directors at two pharmaceutical companies and left an enduring legacy on the association.Arthur Coca was the driving force behind the founding of The JI and serv ed as its first and long-time editor-in-chief (1916-1948), serving also on the Board of Editors (1916-1919) and as an assistant editor (1948-1952). It was Coca, who, as president of the New York Society of Serology and Hematology (SSH), laid the groundwork for a \"Journal of Immunity\" and in the spring of 1915, requested the cooperation of AAI in founding a journal for the burgeoning field of immunology. In the fall of 1915, delegations from AAI and SSH reached an agreement to jointly publish the new journal, The Journal of Immunology, and unanimously elected Coca as editor-in-chief.16 As editor-in-chief, Coca guided the journal through the tumultuous editorial and financial problems of its first few decades, establishing the processes and policies that have made The JI the pre-eminent peer-reviewed journal in the field. He also served the organization as a councillor (1916-1918), secretary-treasurer (1918-1946), secretary (1946-1948), and, uniquely, honorary president of AAI (1949-1960). During his 43 years of service to AAI, Coca continuously served on ad hoc committees and recruited new AAI members. Although he began his professional career in academia, Coca is best known for the 18 years (1931-1949) he served as the medical director at Lederle Laboratories. At the time of his arrival to that company, Lederle was producing antitoxins, vaccines, and other biologics. During his tenure there, Lederle developed new biologics, including pituitary and thyroid extracts and sulfa drugs; manufactured penicillin during the Second World War; and isolated and produced the revolutionary antibiotics Aureomycin and Achromycin. Although not as well known as Coca, A. Parker Hitchens left an equally profound impact on AAI. He served in multiple leadership positions in the nascent years of the Bottle of diphtheria antitoxin, 1895 Images from the History of Medicine, National Library of MedicineAt the time AAI was founded, the expansion of pharmaceuticals was driven by three major currents from the late nineteenth century: the invention of the tableting machine, standardization of dr ugs by chemical assay, and the first successful use of diphtheria antitoxin and subsequent growth of biologics. Tableting machines ushered in mass production of medications. The use Arthur F .

Meanwhile, Hitchens assumed other leadership roles. At the second AAI annual meeting (1915), he was appointed by AAI President Webb to a committee to \"influence physicians whose qualifications entitled them to membership in the Association.\"19 After membership issues were discussed, Hitchens reported that SSH, led by Arthur Coca, was considering the cr eation of a Journal of Immunity and recommended that AAI help with its founding. In quick order, Hitchens was elected to \"represent the society in negotiations with Dr. Coca, with authority to render all possible aid, looking to the publication of the journal.\"20 17. Council chair was an ad hoc position created in 1913 when AAI was founded. The chair was responsible for the operation of the five-member council\u2014the president, vice- president, and secretary wer e initially ex officio members of the council. Initially, the council was responsible for considering member nominations, selecting a date and site of the annual meeting, and other general policies, such as determining the amount of the annual dues. When the first constitution and bylaws were enacted in 1917, the position of council chairman was discontinued. 18.

Parker Hitchens The American Association of Immunologists Collection, Center for Biological Sciences Archive, UMBCDiphtheria antitoxin and the growth of biologicals: Mulford and Lederle Laboratories In 1890, Emil von Berhing announced that he had created a successful diphtheria antitoxin. News quickly made the trans-Atlantic journey and came as a relief to many citizens of U.S. cities, especially New York City. In 1887, one of the largest diphtheria epidemics in the history of the city was responsible for 4,509 deaths.1 Pharmaceutical companies saw antitoxin as a new opportunity for expansion of their businesses into biologics. H. K. Mulford Company and Lederle Laboratories became large producers of effective diphtheria antitoxins. The two companies, however, achieved their leading market positions by different means. H. K. Mulford Company Incorporated in Philadelphia in 1891, H. K. Mulford Company initially mass-produced some 800 different medical products. Their largest seller was a water-soluble pill made possible by their patented tableting machine.2 With von Behring's diphtheria antitoxin discovery, however, the owners recognized the potential for a lucrative new venture in biologics. The change in the business model towards biologics required new hires. In 1894 Joseph McFarland, a noted bacteriologist and pathologist at the University of Pennsylvania, became the first major hire for this new endeavor, and a year later Mulford produced the first commercial diphtheria antitoxin in the country.3 The antitoxin was an immediate commercial success and the company quickly began expanding the business to other biologicals. This expansion included constructing new laboratories for biological, vaccine, and veterinar y research, hiring trained scientists\u2014including physicians, pharmacists, chemists, veterinarians, and botanists\u2014and relocating to a larger property. In 1896 the company moved to a 200-acre farm in Glenolden, Pennsylvania, eight miles outside the city limits, and by 1920 the new site had nearly 1,000 employees and 52 buildings, including stables and barns for the hundreds of horses, cows, and smaller animals.4 During the 1920s Mulford specialized in human and veterinary serums, antitoxins, and vaccines, and in 1929 they merged with Sharpe & Dohme, Inc. of Baltimore.

Not only was he a strong advocate for AAI to help found a journal for the field, but also, his involvement in the founding of two other journals, The Journal of Bacteriology and Abstracts of Bacteriology, gave him insight and experience in the business and editorial management of a new journal. Throughout his professional life, Hitchens continued his service to AAI by helping to organize annual meetings, serving on ad hoc committees, and nominating many future members. At the time of his involvement in the founding of AAI, Hitchens was biological director of the H. K. Mulford Company. Having joined the company in 1901, as it was expanding research staff to develop antitoxins and vaccines, Hitchens presided over his lab's efforts to develop more effective smallpox and rabies vaccines and production of bacterins and serobacterins and their increases in purity and yield of their diphtheria antitoxin. Hitchens left Mulford in 1918 to enter the U.S. Army Medical Reserve Corps during the First World War and remained in the army as a researcher and teacher for the remainder of his career.21 The number of AAI members from industry increased following the Second World War. In 1946, seven of the 37 new members were from the pharmaceutical manufacturers, including American Cyanamid Company, Package of dried antitetanic serum (ca. 1907) and vial of tetanus antitoxin (ca. 1970) Images from the History of Medicine, National Library of Medicine 21.

Lederle, a trained chemist, had a strong interest in chemical and bacterial testing as it applied to public health and in 36 years at the New York City Department of Health rose in the ranks from milk inspector (1866) to health commissioner (1902). Three years after von Berhing's discovery, Lederle was influential in the creation of the NYC Department of Health bacteriology laboratory under the direction of William Hallock Park (AAI '16, president 1918-1919). The lab focused on methods to identify, control, and prevent communicable diseases.5 In 1894, Park and Anna Wessel Williams (AAI '18) isolated the Park-Williams No. 8 strain of diphtheria and used it to create a highly effective antitoxin that was made available to the public the following year.6 The antitoxin was produced by the Health Department and provided at no cost to physicians in the city and sold at a nominal cost to health departments in other cities. In 1903, however, with the higher standards of commercial antitoxins available and pressure from drug manufacturers to cease their anti-free market production, a Health Department directive forced Park's lab to cease production and distribution of the antitoxin. The following year, 1904, Lederle stepped down as health commissioner after city elections intensified the challenges of the health department's lab, bringing back into power the longtime political machine. Lederle saw opportunity in customers' continuing to request the Park antitoxin following the 1903 interruption in production and resolved to answer the demand. Over the next three years, Lederle recruited scientists and past board colleagues, and, in 1906, founded Lederle Antitoxin Laboratories to produce the diphtheria antitoxin. The new company quickly began taking large orders from across the country. The small and \"highly skilled\" scientific staff made sure the antitoxin maintained the high standards that Park had produced.7 Large sales volumes required an expansion of the laboratories and a relocation from New York City to a 99- acre farm in Pearl River, New York. In those pre-Depression growth years, Lederle Laboratories touted its highly trained scientists working in their modern laboratories to produce bacteriologically sophisticated products.8 In the decades that followed, Lederle Laboratories became one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the United States. Today, after multiple acquisitions, the company is part of Pfizer, Inc. 5. Jonathan M.

Throughout the years, the growth and evolution of the pharmaceutical and biotech industry have been reflected in AAI members and leaders. Some, such as Roger M. Perlmutter (AAI '83, president 1999-2000),22 have moved from academia to industry; others, such as Lewis L. Lanier (AAI '80, president 2006-2007),23 have moved from academia to industry and back again to academia. Today, AAI members in industry participate actively as speakers at the annual meeting, lecturers at the courses, reviewers and editors for The JI, and members of various committees. They also serve as mentors to early-career scientists on industry-focused panels and roundtable events at the annual meeting\u2014 important resources through which scientists-in-training can explore the variety of opportunities for scientists within industry.Just how many members AAI may have had from industry is difficult to say. Few AAI members before 1946 provided institutional affiliations, and most changes in institutions were either never recorded or have been lost. There can be little doubt, however, about how AAI has benefited from the participation and leadership of industry members since its founding. n John S.

THE SCIENTISTS BEHIND THE SCIENCE AAI Oral History Project Available Online To provide contemporary investigators and the public a rare view into the lives and times of influential immunologists, AAI arranged for the award-winning Oral Histor ian Brien Williams, Ph.D., to interview past AAI presidents, beginning in the spring of 2012. Interviewees were asked about their family backgrounds, early interest in science, reasons for studying immunology , career and research highlights, challenges faced, balancing professional and private life, hobbies outside of the laboratory, major changes in immunology over the course of their careers, and the future of immunology and science in the U nited States. The sessions, typically one and one-half to two hours in length, were professionally recorded and edited in high-definition video. \"Scientific contributions live on as researchers continue to build upon the work of the past, yet pr esent-day investigators often know little about the scientists responsible for them, \" said AAI Historian John Emrich, Ph.D ., who first conceived of the Oral History Project in 2011. \"The ' Pillars of Immunology' series in The Journal of Immunology makes the connections between past and present science more explicit than they otherwise would be, but investigators rarely have the opportunity to hear about their predecessors' motivations, their hardships suffered and overcome, their lives outside of the laboratory, or even their candid thoughts on the state of the field.\" To date, 25 past presidents have been interviewed. Their presidential terms span five decades, from that of Herman Eisen (AAI '51, president 1968-69, now deceased) to Leslie B erg (AAI '94, president 2011-12). Included in this group were two past presidents in their 90s, Eisen and David Talmage (AAI '54, president 1978-79, now deceased); six in their 80s; and four in their 70s. The memories and reflections contained in these interviews constitute an important facet of the history of immunology that would likely be lost to future generations if not preserved in the AAI Oral History Project. As AAI continues to conduct interviews with additional presidents and other influential immunologists, members and the general public are invited to view the oral histories already recorded. Video clips and the full-length interviews, which have been optimized for playback on TVs, computers, and mobile devices, are available at www.aai.org/ohp. Oral History Interviews Currently sketch Karl von Ruck (AAI '13) was one of the early pioneers of the sanatorium movement in the U.S. Although the movement took many forms, von Ruck was one of the first to build an influential research laboratory alongside his sanatorium to enhance the understanding and treatment of tuberculosis. Born in Istanbul in 1849 to a German diplomat, Karl von Ruck studied under Felix von Niemeyer and graduated with a degree of doctor of medicine from the University of Tubingen in 1877, and, after immigrating to the United States, earned an M.D. from the University of Michigan in 1879. Von Ruck returned to Europe for his post graduate studies, where he conducted research in the laboratories of Rudolf Virchow and Robert K och\u2014and was present when Koch presented his discovery of the tubercle bacillus on March 14, 1882 at the meeting of the Berlin Physiological Society.1 After returning to the States, von Ruck spent a few years in private practice in Ohio before focusing exclusively on tuberculosis research. Seeking a more favorable location to conduct research, he decided on Asheville, North Carolina,2 in the Blue Ridge Mountains. In 1888 he established Winyah Sanitarium, one of the first private tuberculosis treatment institutions in the United States.3 At Winyah, which was closely modeled on German sanitaria, von Ruck believed he could develop a biological means for controlling the disease, including possible immunization. In order to conduct more labor atory research, he established the von Ruck Research Laboratory for Tuberculosis in 1895 on the grounds of Winyah and, in 1910, promoted his son, Silvio von Ruck (AAI '13), to medical director of the hospital thereby freeing his days to focus on research. It was in his laboratory that Karl von Ruck and his colleagues advanced tuberculosis treatment by introducing \"the watery extract of tubercle bacilli, a modification of Koch's fist tuberculin,\" and developing a serum \"consisting of a protein and lipoid extractions of tubercle bacilli which was used in treatment and with which he hoped to immunize children.\"4 Patients came from across the country for treatment, including U.S. Senator John W. Kern (D-IN). In addition to creating a pioneering research laboratory, von Ruck founded and co-edited The Journal of Tuberculosis with Silvio and helped establish Asheville as a national center for the treatment of tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases.5 Karl von Ruck died in Asheville on November 5, 1922, of complications from chronic nephritis and hypertension.6 Both Winyah and the von Ruck Laboratory continued to operate for a number of years after his death,7 contributing to his influence in the rapid growth of sanatoria in North Carolina and elsewhere in the South. 1.

Though long \"the jewel in the crown\" for AAI, The JI did not receive its genesis from within the AAI membership or Council. The request for creation of the journal, in fact, arose from within another society. Thanks to the foresight and organizational skills of A. Parker Hitchens, a founding member and the first chair of the AAI Council, the journal received its association with AAI. 1 When AAI, in 1915, was presented the opportunity to help found a journal, leaders of the burgeoning professional society were still focused on developing the membership and drafting bylaws. No mention of founding a journal dedicated to immunology appears in the minutes from either their organizational meeting in 1913 at the American Medical Association meeting in Minneapolis, Minnesota, or the first annual meeting in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1914. As was the case for many other small societies, the publishing activities of AAI were limited to publishing reports of its meetings in the journal of a larger society. (AAI published its first five annual meeting proceedings in the New England Journal of Medicine and Journal of the American Medical Association. 2) The focus of the AAI Council changed quickly, however, in the spring of 1915 with a request from Arthur F . Coca, president of the New York Society for Serology and Hematology (SSH).Coca, instructor in pathology and bacteriology at Cornell University Medical College, was spearheading a movement to establish a \"Journal of Immunity\" modeled on the German journal Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Immunit\u00e4tsforschung und experimentelle Therapie. 3 Recognizing a potential synergy with the goals of the AAI, Coca reached out to the members of the AAI Council to determine if the society would consider cooperating in founding the journal. It was not wholly surprising that the two societies should cooperate, as they shared many members, and Coca was himself nominated for membership in AAI in 1915. In his communications with Coca, Hitchens became convinced that a journal \"devoted to the branch of medical science represented 1. Before the adoption of the Bylaws and Constitution in 1917, authored by A. Parker Hitchens, the American Association of Immunologists was governed by the president and the Council. The early Council included the position of chair, responsible for making sure the Council carried out its proposals and those of the president. The early C ouncil did not have a line of succession to the presidency, as it would after 1917. 2. \"Minutes of First Annual Meeting of the American Association of Immunologists,\" June 22, 1914, AAI Archive, B ethesda, MD [hereafter, AAI Archive-Bethesda].

Coca, M.D. (1875-1959), elected to AAI in 1916, was the founder of The Journal of Immunology and served as its Editor-in-Chief from 1916 to 1948. In 1949, Coca was named honorary president of AAI, a title that has remained uniquely his through the years. Coca was a faculty member at Cornell University Medical College from 1910 to 1931, attaining the position of full professor in 1924. In 1931, Coca accepted positions as professor of medicine at the New York Postgraduate Medical School at Columbia University (1931-1935) and as the medical director at Lederle Laboratories. He remained at Lederle Laboratories until his retirement in 1949. Arthur F . Coca The American Association of Immunologists, Center for Biological Sciences Archive, UMBC www.aai.org 17The Journal of Immunology, Volume 1, No. 1 The American Association of Immunologists Archive by this Association was about to be established\" with or without any involvement of AAI. It was also clear to Hitchens that Coca's work on establishing the new journal had progressed far enough that the inaugural issue would be published before the AAI Council could act on any potential arrangement. Furthermore, if such a journal was published without the cooperation of AAI, it would render \"superfluous the future publication of an official organ of this Association, and, in this event, our Society would have been seriously handicapped in its future development.\" 4 Hitchens formally presented the idea of the \"Journal of Immunity\" to Council when it convened in early May at the annual meeting. Most councillors were receptive to the new journal and \"thought it a good thing and that the society should cooperate with Dr. Coca in the matter.\" 5 Although Council could not be expected to take decisive action immediately on a matter of such consequence, the Council members empowered Hitchens \"to represent the society in the negotiation with Dr. Coca\" 6 and act for the Council in any negotiations.7 In Hitchens, the Council could not have made a more apt selection. He was the secretary of the Society of American Bacteriology (SAB, now the American Society for Microbiology) and would soon be the first managing editor of the newly founded Journal of Bacteriology (JB) as well as the first and only editor of Abstracts of Bacteriology. 8 Furthermore, he negotiated the JB contract on behalf of SAB with the publisher Williams & Wilkins Company of Baltimore. 9 Despite these crucial early decisions by Hitchens and the AAI Council, it was not a certainty that The JI would be the official publication of the association. The full AAI leadership was not completely convinced of the need for a new journal specializing in immunology. In August, new AAI President James W. Jobling, M.D., professor of pathology at Vanderbilt University, wrote to his past colleague Simon Flexner, director of the prestigious Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research (RIMR), expressing his reservations about the prospects of a new journal. 10 Flexner was an understandable choice, as the renowned William H. Welch had recently transferred ownership and publication of the 4.

The proposed Constitution and Bylaws w ere unanimously adopted at the first annual meeting of the American Association of Immunologists, June, 22 1914; Hitchens, \"Report upon The Journal of 1916, Journal of Experimental Medicine to RIMR, with Flexner serving as editor, a role he was to fulfill from 1905 to 1946.11 Though the proposed immunology journal would be \"international in character,\" Jobling had his doubts that \"it would receive sufficient support to justify its existence.\" Furthermore, he was \"of the opinion that there are enough journals now.\" Despite the compelling reasons stated by proponents, Jobling was demonstrably opposed to \"any idea leading to the financial responsibility\" on the part of the nascent association for fear that initial costs might place serious strain on the finances of the young society. 12 Jobling, however, chose not to make the long train trip from Nashville, Tennessee, to attend a joint meeting of the councils of AAI and SSH at the new Yale Club in New York City on October 7, 1915. The meeting was scheduled for leaders of the societies to explore production requirements and consider a working relationship for the proposed new journal, now dubbed the \"Journal of Immunology.\" The AAI Council was represented by Council Chair Hitchens, Vice President George P . Sanborn, Councillor John A. Kolmer, and Secretary Martin J. Synnott. In addition to President Jobling, three councillors and the treasurer elected to miss the meeting. 13 To ascertain the costs associated with the proposed journal, Coca invited representatives from the publishing services company, Williams & Wilkins. The meeting resulted in a positive prospect for the publication of the journal: Coca was unanimously elected managing editor; 14 a committee to select the board of editors was created; and the advisory board began taking shape. 15 Despite these positive developments, a large, unresolved issue still loomed over the AAI delegation: how was the society to finance its portion of the publishing costs? Resources were scarce. AAI Treasurer Willard J. Stone, in a December 28, 1915, letter to Martin Synnott, estimated the association's portion of the publishing expenses for the first year at $240, an amount exceeding available funds in the treasury by $75. 16 With just 58 members, AAI would have to assess each member $4.00 in addition to their $5.00 annual dues assessment to cover costs. In addition to imposing such a high fee on member subscribers, the two societies would be required by Williams & Wilkins to cover the deficit guarantee in case sufficient subscription revenues were not reached. The two-and-one-half year-old AAI was in no position at the time either to offset the high subscription fee for members or cover the deficit guarantee required by Williams & Wilkins. AAI was also constrained from raising dues to expand its financial reserves. The just-drafted bylaws stated, \"The dues of the Association shall be fixed annually by the Council and they shall not exceed five dollars.\" 17 Although Council soon realized that this cap could not be maintained indefinitely, the $5.00 maximum James W. Jobling, M.D. (1876-1961), elected to AAI in 1914, served the association as its second president (1915-1916) and as a member of The Journal of Immunology board of editors from 1916 to 1935. Before his election to AAI, Jobling had worked as a pathologist at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago from 1909 until moving in 1913 to join the faculty of Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S) as an assistant professor. In 1914, Jobling left P&S to accept a post as full professor of pathology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. In 1918, he returned to P&S as professor of pathology, a position he held until his retirement in 1945. James W.

By providing the official journal of the society to members within their dues, as was typical of learned societies, only $1.00 of income per member would remain for maintenance of AAI activities. Council members knew that was an insufficient amount \"for the maintenance of the Society's affairs,\" 18 notably the annual meeting, which cost the association nearly $200 in 1915. 19 Hitchens, however, was able to address both financial challenges without putting the association in financial straits. He proposed making journal subscriptions optional for AAI members and providing members a 20 percent discount on their subscriptions, charging members $4.00 annually, compared to the $5.00 assessed non-members in the United States to subscribe. 20 To address the deficit guarantee, he sent out personal letters to \"several of the more interested members, offering them the privilege of guaranteeing individually a fraction\" of the fund. He quickly received enough positive responses to \"assure the publishers of adequate financial support to proceed with the Journal.\" 21 There is no record of the AAI Council holding an official vote approving publication of The JI, but President Jobling, during the annual meeting May 11-12, 1916, sent a letter to all AAI members urging them to subscribe to the new journal \"devoted to the problems of Immunology.\" In the letter, Jobling described the policy of the journal as \"to welcome all studies bearing on the general problems of Immunology as well as to publish the proceedings of our association.\" 22 The inaugural issue of The JI was published in February 1916 as a cooperative effort between AAI and the New York Society of Serology and Hematology. The bimonthly journal would serve as the official organ for both organizations. It would also provide demarcation of immunology as a separate field in the medical community and create a locus for immunological research from \"the best equipped laboratories in this country and England.\" 23 The first issue of the new journal contained articles on mechanisms of anaphylaxis and immunity and viral and bacterial infections, as well as the scientific proceedings of the December 3, 1915, meeting of SSH. The first article was \"Studies in Anaphylaxis: On the Relation between Precipitin and Sensitizin,\" by Richard Weil, chair of the Department of Experimental Medicine at Cornell Medical College. In the article, Weil, a founding member Subscription Terms for The Journal of Immunology, 1916 The American Association of Immunologists Archive Richard Weil, M.D. (1876-1917), elected to AAI in 1914, served the association as its third president (1916-1917), councillor (1917), and member of The Journal of Immunology (The JI)Board of Editors (1916-1917). A faculty member at Cornell University Medical College from 1911 until his premature death in 1917, Weil wrote the first article published in The JI, the 14 th part in his 17-part \"Studies in Anaphylaxis\" series. Weil proceeded to publish parts 16 and 17 of this series in The JI. Commissioned into the U.S. Army Medical Corp when the United States entered the First World War in 1917, Weil was appointed chief of medical staff at Camp Wheeler near Macon, Georgia. While attending hospitalized troops there, Weil contracted pneumonia and died on November 19, 1917.

Thirteen months later, Charles Thomas, circulation manager of Williams & Wilkins, sent the AAI Council a promising status update on the new journal. The subscription list of The JI had grown to 439 with subscriptions \"received from practically every foreign country,\" except those of the Central Powers countries of the First World War. 24 The average number of new subscribers each month had increased to 20 since November 1916, and Thomas predicted that subscriptions should reach 550-600 by the end of the year. His final assessment of the new journal was that it \"has a fine future and that it will establish itself on a substantial basis, taking care of its own expenses.\" 25 On March 31, 1920, the AAI Council and SSH Executive Committee met at the home of AAI and SSH President Hans Zinsser in New York City. 26 As SSH \"had omitted its monthly meetings for over a year and since the functions of the society had been in a measure superceded by the American Association of Immunologists,\" the society wished to merge with AAI. An agreement was reached between the two organizations, and the proposal was put before the SSH membership that summer. On July 27, 1920, a quorum of SSH members voted in the affirmative that all members in good standing were to be notified that they would become members of AAI unless they had \"definite objections.\" By the end of the year, SSH had ceased operations, and all but a handful of their members had joined AAI. With the cessation of SSH, AAI became the sole publisher of The JI. 27 Over the years, The Journal of Immunology has published many influential articles that have moved the field of immunology forward. In the process, it has fulfilled, if not surpassed, Hitchens's expressed wishes for the role to be played by the journal: \"I believe that my interest in this direction is engendered by my desire to see the Association of Immunologists on a good, sound and influential basis. As I see it, the position I am anxious to have the Association take can scarcely be gained unless the Association has an official organ.\" 28 Author: John S.

A. Parker Hitchens to Martin J. Synnott, February 9, 1916, AAI Archive-Bethesda. www.aai.org 21In February 1916, The American Association of Immunologist s and the New York Society for Serology and Hematology jointly published the first issue of The Journal of Immunology. (See \"The Founding of The Journal of Immunology\", page 17 of this newsletter) The goal for the new journal was to advance the field of immunology, already recognized to be vital to understanding and treating disease, by publishing the newest research in \"immunity, serology, and bacterial therapy\" and discussing the \"problems of immunology.\"1 With these aims in mind, the editors chose for the first article a study on a major immunological debate of the day, the mechanism of anaphylaxis. The article was \"XIV. Studies in Anaphylaxis: On the Relation between Precipitin and Sensitizin\" by Dr. Richard Weil, chair of Department of Experimental Medicine, Cornell Medical College.2 The article is of interest for more than just its scientific content as it also demonstrates the scientific milieu and conventions of the time. Weil was well placed to publish his paper, for he was a founding member and future president of The American Association of Immunologists and also a member of the New York Society for Serology and Hematology. Unlike most modern research papers, his article had only a single author, lacked defined Abstract, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections, and was written in an almost conversational style. Further, the article was the 14th in a series, with the first 13 published in the Journal of Medical Research \u2014 the 15th, 16th, and 17th (the final) in the series were published simultaneously with the 14th in The JI. In this first JI article, and throughout his larger series of articles, Weil persuasively argued for a cellular mechanism of anaphylaxis. Although the phenomenon of anaphylaxis had been described earlier, the seminal experiments were reported by Richet and Portier in 1902. In attempting to vaccinate experimental animals including pigeons and dogs against the toxin of the Portuguese man-of-war or, later, sea anemones, they were shocked to note the opposite effect. The animals injected with a second vaccinating dose became violently ill and died. Richet and Portier created a new term for this observed hypersensitivity: \"anaphylaxis,\" which literally means \"against protection.\" Following previous demonstrations of na tural and artificially induced immunity to infection, the description of anaphylaxis was the first comprehensive demonstration of harmful effects caused by the immune system. This discovery changed the conception of immunology and earned Richet the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1913. By the time of the publication of Weil's article in The JI, scientists were divided in their views on whether the cause of anaphylaxis was humoral or cellular \u2014 a divide firmly entrenched in early immunology itself. While both sides agreed that interaction between antigen and antibody caused anaphylaxis, proponents of the humoral theory asserted that antigen and antibody combined in the blood to form a chemical toxin. In his Nobel address, Richet touched upon this idea as a simple explanation for the 'toxin' produced by in vitro incubation of immune serum and antigen. He explained that \"there exists in anaphylactized blood a substance harmless in itself but which releases a strong poison when mixed with the antigen.\"3 Weil was unconvinced that events in a test tube emulated the situation in vivo and was one of the first The First Article in The Journal of Immunology \"Studies in Anaphylaxis\" supporters of the cellular theory. This theory hypothesized that antibodies became bound to cells and that antigen-antibody binding induced the cell to produce the anaphylactic reaction. In a talk in January 1916, just prior to publication of his article in The JI, he stated that the difference between these two theories was not \"merely scholastic,\" but that the \"entire philosophy of immunity is involved in the choice between them.\"4 In Weil's article, he described how, through a series of injections of immune rabbit serum and horse serum into guinea pigs, he concluded that \"precipitating antibody\" and \"sensitizing antibody\" (i.e., antibody responsible for anaphylaxis) were identical. (Interestingly, by studying the guinea pig as a model, he primarily would have been describing IgG1 , rather than the classic IgE.) He further stated that the precipitating function of the antibody could be destroyed (by heat or chemical treatment) without affecting the sensitizing value, presuming this to be due to the retained antigen-binding capacity of the antibody. In his concluding statements, Weil firmly asserted his belief regarding the mechanism of anaphylaxis: \"Anaphylaxis therefore consists simply in the cellular reaction due to the fixation of antigen by cellular antibody.\" Of course, we know today that Weil would ultimately be proven correct in his cellular theory of anaphylaxis. The discovery of IgE in the 1960s spurred impressive progress in the field. It is now well established that antigen crosslinking of IgE on mast cells and/or basophils triggers their degranulation to induce anaphylaxis and that prompt treatment with epinephrine reverses the life-threatening effects. Nevertheless, the frequency of anaphylaxis seems to be increasing, and patients look toward current researchers for new solutions. A century following the experiments of Richet and Weil, investigators continue to shed light on signaling events which occur during anaphylaxis, identifying potential new therapeutic targets. From its launch in February 1916, The JI was intended to advance the field of immunology as a whole. But the editors of the journal and, by extension, the members of AAI also wanted to represent the contributions of preeminent scientists in the U.S. and England in particular. Given their attempt to define themselves as a group, their choice of the first article was perhaps not so surprising. The publication of Weil's article placed The JI on one side of a hotly debated issue, ensuring the relevance of the journal to the field and positioning the young society as an emerging forum for discussion and dissemination of discoveries advancing immunology. 1 Announcement.

In addition to his research, Bass's renown stems from his eventful 18 years as dean of Tulane University School of Medicine. During his tenure at Tulane, Bass modernized the medical school, doing so despite resistance from the then extremely powerful populist Louisiana Governor Huey Long. The Country Doctor Bass was born January 29, 1875, on the family farm in Carley, Marion County, Mississippi.1 After high school, Bass spent two years working on the farm before entering (1896) and graduating (1899) from Tulane University School of Medicine. Bass then returned to Marion County as a family physician. As the youngest of three physicians in Columbia, Mississippi, Bass had an unremarkable start to his medical career. During his first four years of practice, he was a typical country doctor, operating a small practice out of his home and regularly making house calls on horseback.2 His career, however, changed dramatically when he attended a 1903 American Medical Association meeting in New Orleans.At the meeting, Bass heard a number of lectures on hookworms. The majority of the speakers agreed on two things: a parasite was responsible for hookworm disease (also known as uncinariasis), and the disease was new to the United States. One talk in particular caught Bass's attention when the speaker argued that hookworm infections rarely, if ever, occurred in this country. Bass knew empirically that this statement was wrong. He had seen many of his own patients, especially children, suffering from the exact symptoms described by the speaker.3 Shortly after the meeting, he purchased a microscope and, over the next seven to eight months, began testing the children of Marion County for hookworm.4 By the end of his study, he had identified and treated 75-80 cases of hookworm.5 Bass became so engrossed in laboratory research that in 1904, he enrolled in a one-year-long course in clinical laboratory diagnosis at AAI LOOKS BACK 1.

Bass, M.D. (1875-1975) by John Emrichthe Johns Hopkins University. At Johns Hopkins, he studied microscopy under Charles E. Simon and the proper techniques for blood counts under William S. Thayer.6 Following his training at Johns Hopkins, Bass chose not to return to his family practice in Columbia. Instead, he relocated with his family to New Orleans, where he started a new practice. He saw patients in a conventional medical office building but constructed his own personal laboratory at home. Research Pioneer Bass's home research did not go unnoticed by his alma mater, Tulane. In 1905, he was appointed to a non-salaried position as an instructor in the Department of Medicine, and in 1907, he was hired as a salaried instructor of clinical microscopy and medicine in the Tulane laboratories of clinical medicine. Interested in opsonic index and autogenous vaccines , Bass traveled to England in 1908 to train with Sir Almroth Wright (AAI '14), an early authority on inoculation techniques and vaccine therapy, at St. Mary's Hospital.7 The work he undertook in England helped to form his later research, and the relationships he built there with the future founders of AAI led to his nomination and election to the association in 1916. Back in the States, Bass was soon promoted to director of the Tulane laboratories and, in 1912, to professor of experimental medicine. While in the laboratories of clinical medicine, Bass immersed himself in uncinariasis and defined the etiology, pathology, and more effective treatment for the disease.8 His pioneering work in this area was based on a small study of 90 students at Tulane. He discovered that, whereas 20 percent of all participants were suffering from uncinariasis, 42 percent of the rural students carried the parasite.9 In 1910, he published findings from a large study conducted with George Dock, in which they were the first to assert that the high rate of infection in the rural South was attributable to sandy soil, the poor access of privies, and the \"habit among children...of going barefoot.\"10 While completing his research on hookworm infections, Bass began studying another parasitic disease afflicting the South: malaria.11 In 1911, he successfully cultivated the three most common malarial plasmodia (vivax, malariae, and falciparum) in vitro using human blood and published a seminal paper, entitled \" A New Conception of Immunity: Its Application to the Cultivation of Protozoa and Bacteria from the Blood and to Therapeutic Measures.\"12 This breakthrough in hematic 6.

William Sydney Thayer (1864-1932) was a long-time faculty member of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (from 1896 to 1921), which included terms as head of the hospital medical clinic and director of the Department of Medicine. At the medical school, Thayer was responsible for organizing the first course in clinical microscopy. 7. Matas, Dr . Charles C. Bass, 10. Wright was an honorary member of AAI (1914-1920). 8.

Gorgas at Ancon Hospital in the Panama Canal Zone, where the high incidence of the disease threatened the Canal project.14 While a principal investigator at Tulane, B ass pursued increasingly expansive research interests, including the diseases caused by vitamin deficiency (beriberi and pellagra), diphtheria, dysentery, typhoid fever,15 and periodontal disease. In mid-1914, Bass somehow became aware of a paper delivered at a Pennsylvania State Dental Society meeting, tentatively concluding that amoebas found in the gums of patients with periodontitis may be responsible for the disease. Bass seized on these early findings and collaborated with a colleague at Tulane, Foster M. Johns, on a series of periodontitis studies, producing two journal articles and a book within one and one-half years. Bass and Johns tentatively concluded that Endameba buccalis was responsible for periodontitis. In their findings, they issued what proved to be an apt caveat: they w ere unable to re-isolate E. buccalis to satisfy Koch's postulates. Despite this limitation, they proposed a treatment using a hypodermic injection of emetin to kill the amoeba and cure periodontitis.16 The dental community initially had a positive reaction to Bass's research and treatments, but the positive reception did not last. The science that supported their conclusions was soon refuted in dental literature and at meetings, and within one year, the central role of amoebas in periodontitis and the emetin treatment were completely rejected by the scientific community. Bass must have been chastened by this setback, for he put aside dental research for nearly one quarter century. He would, however, return to it energetically after his retirement from Tulane.17 Cunning Administrator In 1922, Bass was elected dean of the Tulane University School of Medicine, which remained the only accredited medical school in the state. Although he maintained his professorship, his energy was focused almost exclusively on the administration of the school. During his 18 years as dean, Bass oversaw the expansion and relocation of the medical school from its cramped Canal Street facility to the Hutchinson Memorial Building that houses the medical school and research facilities still today. One initiative, in particular, drew strong resistance from populist Governor Huey Long. At issue was a new Tulane clinical facility that almost doubled the school's presence and influence at Charity Hospital, a nearly 200-year-old public institution in New Orleans. Long, who was intent on founding a public medical school in Louisiana, opposed the elite private medical school's expanded clinical facility and authority at the state's hospital. With appointments to the board of directors for Charity Hospital being within the governor's purview, the board had become highly politicized under Long. In 1930 and 1931, the Long- appointed superintendent rescinded and denied Bass's appointments to the hospital on political grounds. As the dispute grew public, Long used the conflict to advance the construction of the Louisiana State University School of Medicine in New Orleans. Bass, however, did not back down on his appointments. By 1932, 13. Matas, Dr . Charles C. Bass, 8. 14.

Bass discovered a new method for diagnosing typhoid fever and presented his findings at the American Congress of Internal Medicine in Chicago in 1920.

Although technically retired, he continued his research for the next 35 years. With the zeal of a crusader, he returned to the field of dental research. These were productive years for Bass, during which his research and successful clinical methodology ultimately earned him the moniker, \"father of preventative dentistry.\"19 In his seminal article, \"The Cause and Prevention of the Loss of Teeth,\" published in 1940, Bass asserted an \"urgent need for an awaking of the situation\" that tooth decay and loss should not be \"considered to be necessary and unavoidable burdens of life.\"20 Rather, his research, using standard microbiological techniques, demonstrated that cavities and gum disease are caused by bacterial infections. Furthermore, he argued, these infections are preventable through proper dental hygiene. Between the ages of 71 and 94, Bass published 32 journal articles, 26 of which were about dental hygiene. Many of these publications further elaborated on his \"Right Kind\" method for proper brushing and flossing techniques, including proper oral-care techniques for children and the elderly.21 He eventually designed a toothbrush and floss to work with his method that were so precise that their requirements included the exact thickness and shape of the bristle tips and number of turns per inch of a particular unwaxed nylon yarn.22 Bass's articles also noted deficiencies in preventative dentistry in the military and in dental education. These articles fueled antipathies with the Public Health Service, American Dental Association, and the rest of organized dentistry and seldom appeared in dental journals.23 Over a long scientific career, Charles C.Bass advanced public health. In his first chapter of scientific life, he pioneered hookworm disease etiology, pathology, and treatment. He also solved a confounding technical problem in malaria research by discovering how to cultivate the parasitic protozoa in vitro. In the second chapter of his career, as an administrator, he finessed the powerful Louisiana governor to expand the influence of the state's only accredited medical school at the largest public hospital in New Orleans. In his final chapter, at a time when many of his colleagues had completely retired from the lab, he spearheaded public and professional awareness of the benefits of preventative dentistry, this time successfully defending his theory that \"a clean tooth does not decay.\"24 In doing so, Bass secured rights to the epitaph he once suggested for himself: \"He designed and promoted an effective method of personal hygiene.\"25 n John S.

For her ground-breaking work in cancer prevention, L 'Esperance shared the 1951 Lasker Clinical Medical Research A ward with cancer researcher Catherine Macfarlane. L 'Esperance and Macfarlane were the first women to be awarded a Lasker for medical research. Born in 1878, Elise was the youngest of three daughters of Albert Strang, a Yorktown, New York, physician, and Kate Depew Strang, sister of Chauncey Depe w, a U.S. senator, lawyer to Cornelius Vanderbilt, and railroad president. Encouraged by her father to pursue a career in medicine, Elise enrolled in the Wome n's Medical College of the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children (hereafter referred to as New York Infirmary),4 taking advantage of opportunities created by women 's medical education pioneer Elizabeth Blackwell.5 While a student, Elise married David A. L'Esperance, a New York attorne y, and received her medical degree as Elise L 'Esperance, graduating in the college 's final class in 1899.6 L'Esperance began her medical career as a clinician by interning at Babies Hospital in New York and then entering private practice as a pediatrician, first in Detroit and then in New York City. Frustrated that medicine was unable to spare her patients the ravages of diseases having no known cure, Elise sought to switch her emphasis to medical research. In 1908, she was appointed to the New York Tuberculosis Commission under the esteemed William H. Park, AAI 1916.7 As a result of her work with the commission, she became Elise Strang L 'Esperance: Pioneer in Cancer Prevention and Recipient of Lasker Award increasingly interested in the research opportunities afforded by a career in pathology. In 1910, she joined the staff of James Ewing, a cancer specialist in the Department of Pathology, Cornell University Medical College, becoming his first female research assistant. Elise showed much promise and was promoted to instructor in 1912, awarded a research fellowship to study in Munich, Germany, in 1914, and, in 1920, was promoted to assistant professor \u2014 becoming the first woman to attain a professorial rank at the medical school. During this same period, she also served as the director of laboratories of the New York Infirmary. 8 After obtaining the rank of assistant professor , L 'Esperance remained at Cornell for another 12 years of productive research and at the New York Infirmary for an additional 26. 9 Photo Credit: New York Weill Cornell Medical Center ArchivesAAI Loo KS BACK For nearly 100 years, AAI members have been at the forefront of advancements in immunology and related disciplines.

In the early years of The JI, ar ticles were often written by a single author. When an article was co-authored, the designated first author had directed the research, and the second author was a contributor. Ruth L.

The New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children was founded by Elizabeth Blackwell in 1857 to serve the poor of New York City and provide positions for women physicians and a training facility for female nursing students. Blackwell opened Women's Medical College in 1868 to teach and train female physicians. L 'Esperance followed Blackwell's spirit at the New York Infirmary in creating clinics that were staffed entirely by women. The New York Infirmary merged with Beekman Downtown Hospital in 1981, and today is the New York Downtown Hospital. 5. Elizabeth Blackwell (1821-1910) earned a medical degr ee in 1849, becoming the first female to do so in the United States. 6.

Having died a bachelor, Depew left a large family inheritance to his cousins, who had already inherited large sums of money from their mother.10 In honor of their mother, L'Esperance and a sister used funds now available to them to create the Kate Depew Strang Clinic for Cancer and Allied Diseases at the New York Infirmar y. With new equipment and its own staff endowed by the sisters for the first two years, the clinic was established as a separate department of the hospital. L 'Esperance served as its first director, stating that the clinic 's mission was to bring the use of modern techniques to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in women. At its dedication, Ewing declared that the clinic represented \"a pioneer step...devoted to the greatest problem in medicine and probably the greatest hazard in human life \u2014 cancer.\"11 On its first anniversary celebration, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt praised the sisters' \"unselfish generosit y.\"12 Shortly after founding the clinic, L 'Esperance became convinced that the best way to prevent cancer from developing into malignant tumors lay in its early detection through use of the most modern techniques for physical examinations. The causes of cancer, after all, remained unknown. She would endeavor to enact her \"tentative plan to prove whether prevention and early diagnosis\" of cancer were effective. If so, she maintained that her approach \"could become a practical part of a medical health service.\"13 Fortunatel y, L 'Esperance had the education, training, and financial resources to act upon her convictions and do something that ultimately proved revolutionar y. In May of 1937, she founded the Kate Depew Strang Cancer Prevention Clinic at the New York Infirmar y.

The Women's Field Army was responsible for major cancer education campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s.The physical examination at the clinic typically included mouth, nose, throat, pelvic, and rectal examinations, urinalyses, blood tests, and a full-plate x-ray of the chest. L 'Esperance remained vigilant in the addition of new techniques as they became available for early detection of the disease. These included a test for diabetes as well as a technique devised by George Papanicolaou to detect cervical cancer (today known as the Pap smear). The latter led to the enduring use of the Pap smear as part of a regular gynecological exam. The mission of the Cancer Prevention Clinic included educating patients about the importance of routine physical examinations to identify cancer early. The clinic was also committed to alerting patients to what were deemed \"predisposing factors\" for cancer. Among these factors, L 'Esperance included the \"excessive use of tobacco and other chronic irritants.\"16 The preventative clinic model L 'Esperance created proved so successful in identifying early-stage cancers and pre-cancerous cells that Ewing asked her to create a similar institution at Cornell-affiliated Memorial Hospital. The first clinic opened to women in 1940 and was followed by a clinic for men in 1944. By 1947, when the newly constructed building of the Kate Depew Strang Cancer Prevention Clinic at Memorial Hospital Center was dedicated, cancer was the second-leading cause of death in the United States, as the death rate had continued increasing unabated since the turn of the century.17 The idea of a cancer prevention clinic was revolutionary in 1932, but, by 1947, it was hailed as \"the most powerful tool thus far devised\" for the early detection of cancer. 18 The preventative clinic model was copied quickly across the United States. Clinics opened in Philadelphia (1938) and Chicago (1943). By 1947, 181 clinics had opened in 30 states and in almost every major city across the country. 19 In addition to the Lasker Award, L 'Esperance received the Clement Cleveland Medal of the New York City Cancer Committee in 1942, becoming the first woman to do so. She also served as the first editor of the Journal of the American Medical Women' s Association, as well as an associate commander of the Women's Field Army of the American Society for the Control of Cancer. 20 G24520AAI.indd 23 2/6/12 9:23:38 AM www.aai.org 29Beyond its untold cost in human suffering, the First World War profoundly affected scientific and biomedical research both in Europe and the United States. Researchers on both sides of the Atlantic necessarily refocused their intellectual energies to work in support of their nations' war efforts. As armies clashed, communications among scientists in warring nations ceased, as did opportunities for U.S. medical students to study in Europe. However huge its impact on individual M.D.s' lives and on worldwide biomedical research, the war also served to hasten dramatic changes already underway in American medical education and scientific research. Transatlantic ties Advancements in American science and medicine in the late nineteenth century owed a great deal to Europe. Until at least the turn of the century, U.S. medical schools and research institutes were considered inferior to their European counterparts, especially those in Germany. Men and women of science were, therefore, expected to complete their education by studying at European universities or laboratories before returning to the United States. German universities alone attracted approximately 18,000 American students from 1870 to 1900. 1 This transatlantic migration began to decline in the first 15 years of the twentieth century as a full-scale university system began to develop in the United States. For university administrators, the new system was able to tap the cadre of scientists and physicians who had studied in Immunologists during the First World War: One Soldier-Scientist's Experience Stanhope (AAI 1917, President 1930-31) 1 Hugh Hawkins, \"Transatlantic Discipleship: Two American Biologists and Their German Mentor,\" Isis 71, no. 2 (1980): 197-98. 2 Abraham Flexner, Medical Education in the United State and Canada: A Report to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Bulletin Number F our (New York: Carnegie Foundation, 1910); John M. Barry, The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History (New York: Penguin, 2005), 82-87. The Flexner Report brought national attention and scrutiny to the fact that few standards for admission and graduation existed for American medical schools. Shortly after the release of the report, medical schools were forced to raise their standards. Graduates of those schools that failed to conform to the new American Medical Association rating system motivated by the Flexner Report were denied medical licenses. 3 Daniel J. Kevles, \"George Ellery Hale, the First World War, and the Advancement of Science in America,\" Isis 59, no. 4 (1968): 427-28.Germany. And university medical schools were compelled to standardize basic educational and clinical requirements after the Flexner Report of 1910 criticized the schools for their failure to produce graduates of consistent quality and abilities. 2 As higher education in the United States evolved, the transatlantic migration slowed significantly. At the outset of the war, it ceased almost entirely. Along with educational improvements came advancements in scientific and medical research. New scholarly societies formed, including AAI, founded in 1913, around newly defined disciplines and began publishing peer-reviewed journals, such as The Journal of Immunology, first published in 1916. Funding of science and medicine also changed dramatically. The federal government strengthened its commitment to scientific innovation, increasing the budget for research agencies, such as the National Bureau of Standards and the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service, and opening the Walter Reed Hospital (1909), where patient care, teaching, and research were integrated. University science and medical departments also increased their financial support for research. And, perhaps most significant, American businesses and leading philanthropists invested in science and medicine. The years 1900-1915 saw the establishment of the General Electric Research Laboratory (1900), the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research (1901), the Carnegie Institution of Washington (1902), and the Rockefeller Foundation (1913). 3AAI Looks B Ack G31067_AAII.indd 16 12/3/12 10:31 PM 30 AAI History Compendium (2021)16 AAI Newsletter December 2012 One soldier-scientist's story At the war's outset in Europe in August 1914, more than two and a half years before the U.S. Congress declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, just 776 of the approximately 140,000 practicing physicians and M.D.s entering the new research facilities in the United States were serving in the military.4 By the end of February 1918, more than 15,000 doctors were serving, and, by the time of the armistice, nine months later, that number had grown to 38,000.5 During this period of rapid mobilization, the professional trajectories of thousands of American physicians were altered. Entering medicine at a time that the emergence of research laboratories in the United States widened the range of career choices, this generation of American M.D.s faced a new set of choices for service in wartime: they could serve as combat physicians, work in U.S. Army laboratories, or remain in their laboratories carrying out research necessary for the war effort. One young M.D., who put his prestigious position in immunology research on hold and volunteered in May 1917 for early deployment as a combat physician, was Stanhope Bayne-Jones, a future AAI president. Walter Reed General Hospital, ca. 1915 Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Harris & Ewing Collection Stanhope Bayne-Jones The 17th President of AAI A Biographical Sketch Born in New Orleans on November 6, 1888, Stanhope Bayne-Jones was orphaned when his father committed suicide in 1894, one year after his mother had passed away due to complications arising from the birth of his younger brother. Bayne-Jones lived with his grandfather, Joseph Jones, a practicing physician and a professor of medicine and chemistry at Tulane University, for two years, until Joseph's death in 1896. After a childhood filled with boarding schools and moves from one relative's home to another's, Bayne-Jones entered Yale, where he received his A.B. in 1910. Determined to follow in his grandfather's footsteps, he began his medical studies at Tulane University before transferring to the Johns Hopkins University in 1911. He received his M.D. in 1914 and remained at the Johns Hopkins Hospital as house officer (1914-15) and assistant resident pathologist (1915-16). After he was appointed head of the new Laboratory of Bacteriology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins in early 1916, Bayne-Jones studied bacteriology and immunology under Hans Zinsser (AAI 1917, president 1919-20) at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York for six months before the laboratory opened. Bayne-Jones joined the U.S. Army Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) in 1915. He was commissioned at the rank of first lieutenant and promoted to captain the following year. In May 1917, he volunteered to be integrated into the British Expeditionary Force. He was reassigned to the American Expeditionary Forces upon their arrival in March 1918. After the armistice, he was promoted to major and remained in Germany until he was relieved of active duty in May 1919. Bayne-Jones returned to Johns Hopkins in the summer of 1919 and became assistant professor of bacteriology the following year. In 1923, he accepted a position as a professor of bacteriology at the recently opened University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. He left Rochester in 1932 and became a professor of bacteriology at Yale University School of Medicine, where he was appointed dean three years later. From 1932 to 1938, he was also Master of Trumbull College at Yale. When the Second World War began in 1939, Bayne-Jones was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the MRC and, two years later, headed the Commission on Epidemiological Survey of the Board for the Investigation and Control of Influenza and other Epidemic Diseases in the Army. From 1942 to 1946, Bayne-Jones was once again an active-duty officer, serving multiple positions within the Office of the Surgeon General. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming colonel in 1942 and brigadier general in 1944. He was relieved from active duty in 1946 and, the following year, accepted an appointment as president of the Joint Administrative Board of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, a position he held until 1953. After serving as the technical director of research and development for the Office of the Surgeon General (1953-56), Bayne-Jones was appointed by the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1957 to chair an advisory committee charged with establishing guidelines for National Institutes of Health research following that year's dramatic increase in the NIH budget. His many military and civilian honors include a British Military Cross (1917), a French Cruix de Guerre (1918), election to the American Philosophical Society (1944), the U.S. Typhus Commission Medal (1945), the Chapin Medal of the Rhode Island State Medical Society (1947), the Bruce Medal of the American College of Physicians (1949), the Passano Foundation Award (1959), and a Decoration for Outstanding Civilian Service from the U.S. Army (1965). In addition to serving AAI as president (1930-31), Bayne-Jones was an associate editor of The Journal of Immunology (1936-49). Bayne-Jones died at his home in Washington, DC, on February 20, 1970, at the age of 81.

All would face such dilemmas as when and where to volunteer their services, how to cope with the trauma of war, and how to readjust to the laboratory after the war. Stanhope Bayne-Jones earned his M.D. at the Johns Hopkins University in 1914 under William Welch, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. 6 Founded in 1893 and based on the German system, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine was praised in the Flexner Report as \"the first medical school in America of genuine university type.\" 7 After graduating with high honors, Bayne-Jones remained at Johns Hopkins, where he rose from House Officer in Medicine to Assistant Resident Pathologist within one year. I n early 1916, he was offered and accepted the opportunity to head the new Laboratory of Bacteriology and Immunology in the Department of Pathology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Despite research opportunities emerging in the rapidly changing American medical and scientific landscape, the U.S. declaration of war in April meant that recent graduates, by May 1917, were considering how they could best contribute to the war effort. Enlisting qualified army physicians in the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) The number of army physicians rose dramatically with the rapid growth of the standing U.S. Army following the 1917 draft. The ranks of the army had expanded from fewer than 200 thousand troops in March 1917 to over one million within a matter of months. Many of the most prominent men in medicine volunteered their services, including Welch, Victor Vaughan 8 (AAI 1915), and Simon Flexner9 (AAI 1920). Already, at the outset of hostilities in Europe, U.S. Surgeon General William C. Gorgas was concerned with enlisting enough qualified physicians in the Army MRC to ensure military preparedness. One of the first physicians he solicited was his grandnephew Stanhope Bayne-Jones. When \"Uncle Willie\" 10 wrote his nephew in the summer of 1915, Bayne- Jones was just beginning his career at Johns Hopkins.11 6 William Welch (1850-1934), physician, scientist, and administrator, served as dean of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and was the first director of the School of Hygiene and Public Health as well as the Institute of the History of Medicine. Although never an AAI member, Welch served on the Advisory Board of The Journal of Immunology (1916-34). In 1896, Welch founded The Journal of Experimental Medicine. For more information on the relationship between Bayne-Jones and Welch, see Albert E. Cowdrey, War and Healing: Stanhope Bayne-Jones and the Maturing of American Medicine (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1992), especially chapters 2 and 3. 7 Flexner, Medical Education, 12. 8 Victor Vaughan (1851-1929), biochemist, hygienist, public health authority, medical educator, and dean of the University of Michigan Medical School (1891-1920), served on the Advisory Board of The Journal of Immunology (1916-1929). 9 Simon Flexner (1863-1943), scientist and first director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (1901-1935), was an Active (1920-1936) and Honorary (1936-\u00ac1943) member of AAI and served on the Advisory Board of The Journal of I mmunology (1916-1935). 10 Gorgas's mother was the great aunt of Bayne-Jones. 11 William Gorgas to Stanhope Bayne-Jones (SBJ), June 17, 1915, Stanhope Bayne-Jones Papers, Box 7, Folder 16, \"Medical Reserve Corps, 1915-1916,\" National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD [hereafter \"SBJP-NLM\"]. 12 William Gorgas to SBJ, June 29, 1915, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, Folder 16, \"Medical Reserve Corps, 1915-1916.\" 13 Memo from the Adjutant General of the Army to SBJ, August 18, 1915, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, Folder 16, \"Medical Reserve Corps, 1915-1916.\"Gorgas described the role that the MRC would play if the United States were to enter the war and the duties of corps volunteers as follows: Under the law you could never be called into service, except with your own consent; nor is it compulsory to have any military training. In case of war, if you should desire field service, military training that you had received before would be a very great advantage to you, but the large bulk of the Reserve Corps would not go into the field in case of war . Unless you desire field service you would be placed on duty, in case of war, at some general hospital where your duties would be purely professional. In the time of war we would have general hospitals located in most of our large cities. The great object of the Reserve Corps is to get a registered list of medical men who could be called upon for such duties, always with their own consent. 12 Bayne-Jones needed little encouragement. He enlisted almost immediately and was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army MRC on August 18, 1915. 13 G31067_AAII.indd 18 12/3/12 10:31 PM 32 AAI History Compendium (2021)18 AAI Newsletter December 2012On April 6, 1917, the same day that the U.S. Congress issued its formal declaration of war, the AAI Council interrupted its proceedings to pass a resolution offering \"the services of trained bacteriologists and immunologists and the facilities of their respective laboratories\" to federal and state governments. 14 Many members remained in their laboratories during the war, pursuing research for the war effort. The majority of this research, typified by the work of Anna Wessel Williams (AAI 1918) and William H. Park (AAI 1919, president, 1918-19), was focused on the influenza pandemic (see AAI Newsletter , March/April 2012). Convinced that scientists at the Rockefeller Institute could better support the war effort if they remained together than if they were dispersed, Simon Flexner arranged with Gorgas to keep the R ockefeller laboratories intact as one army unit.15 Other AAI members serving in the MRC were sent to U.S. Army training camps or military hospitals and laboratories in Europe. Among the volunteers were Richard Weil (AAI 1914, president 1916-17), who served as chief of medical service at Camp Wheeler, Georgia, until November 1917, when he died of complications from pneumonia; Martin J. Synnott (AAI 1913, secretary 1913-18), who studied the pandemic influenza at Camp Dix, New Jersey; 16 Rufus Cole (AAI 1917, president 1920- 21), who chaired the Pneumonia Commission in charge of researching outbreaks of the disease at Army training camps; 17 and Hans Zinsser (AAI 1917, president 1919-20), a good friend of Bayne-Jones, who was stationed in France as an Army sanitary inspector and assistant director of the Division of Laboratories and Infectious Diseases.18 Preparing for the front The vast majority of American troops spent 1917 training in the United States and did not arrive in Europe until spring 1918. Bayne-Jones, however, was one of a relatively small number of American soldiers who volunteered to be integrated into the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) nearly one year before the American Expeditionary Forces arrived en masse. Assured that his position at Johns Hopkins would be waiting for him upon his return, Bayne-Jones set sail for London on the S.S. Orduna in May 1917 and joined the 69th F ield Ambulance of the BEF by the end of the month.19 Shortly after arriving in France with the 69th Field Ambulance, he explained his decision to volunteer in a letter home to his sister Marian: \"With these big things going on I could not stay still in Baltimore with the prospects of remaining repressed as a Teacher of Bacteriology or of being assigned to the prosaic medical duties of a Training Camp. No doubt both of these activities would be as useful and safer than what I can do over here; but this has the interest: It is like living in the Sunday pictorial of the New York Times.\" 20 Stationed at a hospital behind the lines in May and early June, B ayne-Jones heard \"wonder-tales\" from the wounded British troops about an \"earthquake battle,\" which made him long to get to the front lines. By the end of the month, he had received orders sending him to the Belgian front. After receiving mandatory training on the proper use of his gas mask, he boarded a train on June Bayne-Jones MRC commission, ca. 1915 National Library of Medicine, Stanhope Bayne-Jones Papers 14 \"Minutes of the Fourth Annual Meeting\u20141917,\" April 6-7, 1917, AAI Archives. 15 Barry, The Great Influenza, 140. 16 Martin J.

As the nearly 24-hour train ride to the front came to an end, he recorded his initial impressions of the war: \"We not only hear the guns, but sometimes see the effects of their shells, which are still far enough away to be 'interesting.'\" 21 The work that Bayne-Jones did in the 69th was a far cry from the research he left in Baltimore. He served in many capacities as a part of the field ambulance, the most basic unit of medical care in the BEF . Every division had three field ambulance units, each with two companies of stretcher bearers and orderlies. When soldiers were injured, they were taken from the front by stretcher to an assembly point on the line in the rear, where they were triaged. If their wounds were serious enough, they were sent further behind the lines to a central station, then to a divisional collection point, and, finally, to an advanced dressing station. At each point, the wounded soldier was assessed, and if he was deemed to be in too poor a condition, he was treated on the spot rather than sent to the next station. 22 In the trenches Bayne-Jones slowly worked his way to the front lines. Under mortar fire for the first time in early July, he reported that he was not as \"scared as I thought I would be.\" 23 By month's end, however, the reality of the war began to set in after a night of shelling and gas attacks by the Germans.American soldiers in the trenches, ca. 1918 National Library of Medicine, Stanhope Box \"Correspondence.\" 22 Cowdrey, War and Healing, 55. 23 SBJ to Tante E., July 4, 1917, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 24 SBJ to Marian Jones, July 21, 1917, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 25 SBJ to Tante E., August 5, 1917, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 26 SBJ to Marian Jones, August 12, 1917, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 27 SBJ to Tante E., October 27, 1917, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\"Bayne-Jones (front row, center) on the front, ca. 1918 National Library of Medicine, Stanhope Bayne-Jones Papers Nearly every night [the German army] sends thousands of shells of poison gas which complicate life very much.

I believe I'd rather get bumped by a shell than spend nights down in one of those narrow saps, which have been inhabited by men and populated by vermin the last three years. 24 Despite his first taste of the horrors of war, Bayne-Jones was steadfast in his desire to remain in the field hospital. He found that the \"work to be done here was as useful as any that I could accomplish by sticking at the Base. . . . [I]t certainly is more rewarding to take care of the men when they are in the most trouble. Even without that, the sights and thrilling parts we sometimes share make the seats on the stage worth the price of the risk.\" 25 Reflecting on his initial encounter with trench warfare, Bayne-Jones wrote that it was \"my first dash of real life.\" He confessed, however, that the \"medical experience is nil.\" \"I've seen a lot of ghastly wounds and blood of course,\" he explained, \"but we handle cases only to get them back to the hospital, and hence cannot follow them for study. Besides I seem to have lost interest in medicine and bugs\u2014temporarily.\" He still intended to \"settle down as a 'professor' somewhere\" after the war. 26 But, as he admitted three months later in a letter home, he was forgetting \"everything I ever knew of Bacteriology and medicine.\" Yet he had no regrets: \"I'll be pretty ignorant of what I was trained to follow when this war is over, but I have seen some things!

The welcomed contents included \"shaving soap, fine glycerin soap, some poison soap for the 'totos' as the poilus 29 call lice, cold cream, Vaseline, and a big lot of Hershey's Chocolate.\" 30 Lice and threadbare uniforms had been recurring themes of his stories home. The Americans arrive When the American Expeditionary Forces arrived in Europe in spring 1918, Bayne-Jones knew that he would soon be reassigned to an American unit, and he acknowledged that there were times he wished he \"were back with the interests of the Laboratory.\"31 In March, he was relieved from duty with the English battalion and ordered to report to a U.S. Army research laboratory in Paris, far removed from the \"show\" at the front. 32 Although he \"couldn't have asked for better opportunities than were offered\" at the laboratory, Bayne-Jones \"felt that I couldn't stick at a desk back there, while there was a war going on up front.\" 33 A position as a battalion doctor was \"by far and away the best for me as a human being, even if I am forgetting all the technical training I ever had, and which I believe is the best my efforts can do for the men over here.\"34 His request for a transfer from the laboratory was granted, and he soon returned to the front in eastern France as the battalion surgeon to the 26th Division, 3rd Battalion, 101st Infantry. 35 As many of the newly won trenches on the French front were similar to his first experience with the British\u2014knee deep in mud and infested with rats and lice\u2014Bayne-Jones taught elementary sanitation to the new troops. 28 SBJ to Alma Denegre, October 18, 1917, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 29 Poilus was a warm, informal term for a French infantryman during the First World War, meaning, literally, hairy one. 30 SBJ to Tante E., January 7, 1918, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 31 SBJ to Tante E., December 12, 1917, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 32 SBJ to George Denegre, December 23, 1917, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 33 SBJ to Tante E., [emphasis Denegre, June 20, 1918, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 35 For additional information on the U.S. Army ambulance service in the First World War, see Cowdrey , War and Healing, 62-63; Richard V .

All of them look like the lovely pictures in those old French song books we used to have and are appealing bright little people. It is very pleasant to be able to do anything for them.\" 36 The 101st saw constant action throughout the majority of the spring of 1918, and a certain mix of weariness and wonderment had replaced Bayne-Jones's initial excitement in his letters home. My luck has been with me this time\u2014I have just gotten out of places before shelling began, or come into a sector just after the shelling has ended. Last night, however, a German aeroplane stopped over us in the twilight and gave us quite a scare with his machine gun. When you realize that the bullets are going beyond you, the exhibition seems lovely. The bullets sound like picking the three top strings of a harp, and the tracer-bullets on fire look like fireflies in the evening. 37 A newfound concern for his own mortality also began to appear in his letters. \"You never know when the noise and iron are going to drive your spirits out to the quiet fields above the balloons and aeroplanes,\" he wrote in May.38 Bayne-Jones admitted that the shells were getting on \"my nerve now as they never did before\"\u2014the war was simply \"going on too long.\" 39 His letters also revealed a mounting homesickness. He described a \"quiet moment\" after going \"over the top\" on a successful raid, during which he \"howled for the unattainable like a dog howling for the moon.\" 40 G31067_AAII.indd 21 12/3/12 10:31 PM www.aai.org 35Pandemic influenza In July, Bayne-Jones was promoted to regimental surgeon of the 103rd Infantry and given his first leave from the front after many months of tough fighting. He spent the majority of his time in Paris, where he contracted the pandemic influenza that was infecting and killing millions around the world. He described his bout with the \"grippe\" as taking \"away interest in life\" and explained that \"the days have been so monotonous that I hardly noticed how many passed.\" 41 Aware that \"influenza and pneumonia [have] hit some places\" in America \"pretty hard,\" he worried about family at home \"catching the 'flu.'\" 42 His illness and convalescence kept Bayne-Jones from the front lines until September 1918. Armistice and after His return to the front coincided with the 47-day Meuse- Argonne Offensive,43 part of the final offensive of the Allied forces. The conditions where the 103rd was located were \"wet and cold,\" and the men \"slept in an oozing hole in the hillside.\" 44 Beyond the physical effects of the war, Bayne- Jones was noticing mental changes in himself and his men. \"Like most unpleasant things, the war is in danger of being forgotten by us here at any moment\u2014'submerged into the unconscious processes,' as the psychologists say.\" 45 During the offensive, Kaiser Wilhelm II began making overtures that Germany would accept a peace treaty. And, at the stroke of 11:00 in the morning on November 11, 1918, \"suddenly all the guns behind us stopped barking and rolling, the last 'Freight car' rattled over our heads, and all the machine guns suddenly stopped, though they had been rioting away up to the very last minute.\" The quiet was \"mysterious, queer, unbelievable,\" but no one \"shouted or threw his hat in the air.\" Although the war was over, the soldiers of neither side found the armistice \"exciting\" at first. As the day turned into night, however, the front began to look to Bayne-Jones like \"a Fourth of July celebration,\" as unused flares and signal rockets from both armies illuminated the sky with their many colors well into the night. 46 On November 14, Bayne-Jones was promoted to the rank of major and became the sanitation inspector in Koblenz, Germany, as part of the army of occupation. Longing for home, he quickly turned to the same connections that got him to the front in the summer of 1917. 47 William Gorgas and William Welch were successful in their lobbying efforts, and Bayne-Jones was back on American soil on May 28, 1919. Two days later, he was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army. 48 Returning to the laboratory Bayne-Jones soon returned to his academic position at Johns Hopkins to resume his research, but he found the transition back to life in the laboratory difficult. \"Everybody here is either played out from having had to Flu ward, ca. 1918 Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division 41 SBJ to George Denegre, September 2, 1918, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, 42 SBJ Tante E., November 26, 1918, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 43 Also called the Battle of the Argonne Forest. 44 SBJ to Susan Jones, September 27, 1918, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 45 SBJ to Susan Jones, September 27, 1918, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 46 SBJ to Marian Jones, November 11, 1918, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, \"Correspondence.\" 47 SBJ to Marian Jones, January 16, 1919, SBJP-NLM, Box 7, Folder 11, \"Bayne-Jones, Stanhope.\"While the shells shriek overhead and burst with a deafening roar, throwing up clods of earth and chunks of the flotsam and jetsam of the battlefields, while the sizzling shrapnel rattles on the tin hats of the stalwart Yanks, crowding the muddy shell holes, while the machine gun bullets chirp overhead and spurt against the elephant iron, while all these horrors are taking place I am neither deafened nor afraid because I am in a hole 30 feet underground in a [German] dug-out.

In an early July 1919 letter to Bayne-Jones, he wrote, \"It was difficult for me to readjust and the enthusiasm for the old problems is only now returning.\" 50 Although the transition to civilian life may have been Hans Zinsser initially difficult for many National Library of Medicine, History immunologists, a number of Medicine Division of them began making significant advancements in clinical and basic research. The leadership skills that this generation of investigators had acquired during war- time service appear to have served them well in their rise through the ranks of academia and scientific and medical organizations, including AAI. Not only did Bayne-Jones and Zinsser become AAI presidents, so too did other veterans: Francis Blake (1921, president 1934-35), Thomas Rivers (1921, president 1933-34), and Eugene Opie (1923, president 1928-29). For researchers in Europe, the war 's impact on their home institutions was more immediate and often longer lasting. Nobel laureate Jules Bordet (AAI 1960) was unable to continue his experimental research in occupied Belgium, although he did use the war years to write a classic book on immunity and infectious disease, Trait\u00e9 de l'Immunit\u00e9 the chief pathologist at the Wilhelmina Hospital in Vienna, felt the war 's effects long after its conclusion. The shortage of resources in post-war Vienna forced him to leave his homeland for the Netherlands before permanently relocating to New York and joining the Rockefeller Institute in 1923.52 Nevertheless, some of the war 's dislocations helped advance scientific research.

Yankee Division in France, ca. 1919 National Library of Medicine, Stanhope Bayne-Jones 10:31 PM www.aai.org 37The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic generated an impressive body of immunological research into the cause and prevention of the disease, and that urgency is reflected in the many articles on influenza published in The Journal of Immunology from 1919 to 1921. Because bacteria had been shown to be causative of other infectious diseases, including typhoid fever and diphtheria, and viruses were not yet understood as more than filter-passing agents, most scientists of the time believed the cause of influenza to be bacterial. German physician Richard Pfeiffer had isolated bacteria from influenza patients during the previous pandemic of 1892 and believed that these bacteria were the cause of influenza; the bacteria had come to be known as Pfeiffer 's bacillus or Bacillus influenzae or B. influenzae (now Haemophilus influenzae). By the time of the 1918 pandemic, many scientists had embraced Pfeiffer 's hypothesis, and researchers were attempting to establish the etiological significance of B. i nfluenzae to the disease by examining cases from the unfolding influenza pandemic. Immunologists cultured and isolated bacteria from patient samples, including throat swabs, sputum samples, pleural effusions, and lung exudates, with mixed results. In 1919, C . Roos from the Mulford Biological Laboratories in Glenolden, Pa., reported that a collective review of all influenza samples analyzed by the laboratory beginning with the epidemic of 1915-1916 identified B. i nfluenzae in \"50 to 90 per cent of the cases.\"1 In September and October of 1918, Roos specifically examined 33 specimens from cases of clinical influenza characterized by a sharp onset and isolated B. influenzae from 27 (82 percent), although streptococci and pneumococci were also commonly present, being found in 25 (76 percent) and 20 (61 percent) of the specimens, respectivel y. Although B. influenzae could not be reproducibly isolated from all cases of influenza examined, Roos and others placed little significance on the negative findings, ascribing them to improper specimen collection or culture technique. 2 Nevertheless, the inconsistent presence of B. influenzae in patient samples, its presence in healthy individuals, and the isolation of other types of bacteria from influenza patients cast doubt on the theory that Pfeiffer's bacillus was the cause of influenza. William H. Par k (AAI 1916, president 1918), laboratory director, New York City Board of Health, Division of Pathology, Bacteriology, and Disinfection, contended that, to establish etiological significance, it was not sufficient merely to establish the presence of Pfeiffer's bacillus in all (or nearly all) cases of the influenza but that it was also necessary to show that the same strain or type was present in all cases. Under the direction of Park, Eugenia Valentine (AAI 1920) and Georgia M. Cooper (AAI 1920) injected rabbits with cultures of B. influenzae and tested each antiserum against the same (homologous) culture and against other cultures of B. influenzae isolated from the lung, larynx, or trachea of influenza patients. 3 They were surprised to find a multiplicity of strains and could conclude only that \" B. influenzae is not the primary etiological agent in epidemic influenza.\" The lack of a \"hypothetical pandemic strain\" was later confirmed by similar methods by other investigators, including Arthur F .Coca (AAI 1916, secretary-treasurer 1918-1945, editor- in-chief 1920-1948) and Margaret Kelley of New York Hospital and Cornell University.4 Other papers, however, presented contradictory findings. In one such paper, F . M.Huntoon (AAI 1918) and S. Hannum demonstrated that antiserum protected mice from heterologous strains of B. influenzae.5 So it was that, long after the pandemic subsided, uncertainty remained about whether this microorganism was the primary cause of influenza or whether it was a secondary opportunistic invader.AAI L OOKS BACK The 1918 -1919 Influenza Pandemic as Covered in The Journal of Immunology from 1919 to 1921 Demonstration at the Red Cross Emergency Ambulance Station in Washington, D.C., during the influenza pandemic of 1918, c. 1918, Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division AAINews_Jul_Aug_2012.indd 12 7/10/12 7:01:57 AM 38 AAI History Compendium (2021)12 AAI Newsletter July/August 2012Despite the uncertainty surrounding the cause of influenza, the lethality of the 1918 outbreak lent particular urgency to the question of prevention, and a number of investigators worked to develop a vaccine against the disease. During the height of an influenza epidemic occurring in New Orleans in the fall of 1918, Charles W.Duval and William H. Harris of Tulane University vaccinated approximately five thousand individuals with a chloroform-killed B. influenzae pr eparation.6 They reported that only 3.3 percent of those vaccinated developed influenza, compared with 41 percent of the unvaccinated control group. Duval and Harris concluded that, although the number of vaccinated persons was few, the results were \"interesting and significant from the standpoint of prophylaxis.\" In New York City, Park, in collaboration with other members of an influenza commission and the workers of the New York City Department of Health, undertook a comprehensive study of acute respiratory infections\u2014 1 C.

The first issue of The Journal of Immunology from 1921 (vol. 6, no. 1) was dedicated exclusively to this topic and the resulting series of papers. 7 As part of this series, Park and his colleagues tested combined vaccines made from B. influenzae and strains of streptococcus, pneumococcus, and staphylococcus on 1,536 employees of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. 8 Their results were somewhat less striking than the findings of Duval and Harris, as they found no difference in respiratory disease overall (including influenza) between the inoculated and control groups. However, it was noted that the vaccinated group showed the \"beneficial influence\" of a lower incidence of pneumonia. The cause of influenza would not be definitively resolved until the 1930s, with the isolation of swine influenza virus by Shope 9 and the subsequent isolation of human influenza virus by Smith, Andrewes, and Laidlaw.10 Whereas Pfeiffer's hypothesis regarding the bacterial cause of influenza was ultimately proven incorrect, it was generally agreed then, as now, that most of the deaths from the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic were due to secondary bacterial infections 11\u2014and that some of the early vaccines could have, in fact, prevented the rate of bacterial pneumonia and death from the disease.12 Modern influenza research continues to be presented in The Journal of Immunology nearly one century after these early papers appeared in the wake of the 1918 pandemic. Topics of research include the role of innate immune defenses in protection, the specificity of the T cell memory response, and mechanisms for improving vaccination, among others. Contemporary papers examine the immune response to recent strains, including swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus, the cause of the 2009 pandemic, and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses, speculated to be the possible source of a new pandemic. Much research remains to be done to fully staunch infection and death from seasonal outbreaks and future pandemics of the disease, but, if recent r esearch is a fair indicator of future initiatives, immunology as a field will yield key findings for understanding influenza and limiting the menace it poses to public health.

In 1894, after her return to New York City, she volunteered at the recently opened diagnostic laboratory of the New York City Department of Health, where she would work for the next 39 years. 3 At the time she entered the laboratory, diphtheria had reached near-epidemic levels in the city and was especially high among children from poor families. In her first year at the lab, she began a collaborative research project with the director, William H. Park, AAI 1916 (AAI president, 1918), to eradicate the disease. Their objective was to create a higher-yield antitoxin than was currently available. They would seek to build upon the work of Emil von Behring, who, in 1890, had developed the first successful serum therapy to treat diphtheria.4 Though the antitoxins that he created were successful\u2014earning him the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901\u2014their low yield meant that many patients were still denied access to the therapy. While still a volunteer, Williams experienced a breakthrough in the search for a higher-yield antitioxin. Working alone in the lab, with Park away on vacation, she isolated and identified a new strain Women have always figured prominently in immunology and in the American Association of Immunologists (AAI). In fact, two of the 54 charter members of AAI were women. During the first 30 years of the association's existence, a total of 55 women were elected to AAI membership. 1 While women remained a minority within AAI, their numbers rose steadily until, by 1940, they comprised 44 of the society's 350 active members. Among these early women members, Anna Wessels Williams, AAI 1918, like Elise L 'Esperance profiled in the January-February issue of the AAI Newsletter, is one of a number who stand out for their enduring contribution to immunology and to the foundation of AAI. Her legacy in the burgeoning field of immunology includes breakthroughs in the treatment of diphtheria and the diagnosis of rabies. And texts that she co-authored helped to define how generations of researchers and clinicians would conduct research, as well as assist the general public in understanding infectious diseases. We pr ofile her below. Watch for AAI profiles of other pioneering women immunologists to appear in print and online at aai.org/about/history. 2 Anna Wessels Williams (1863-1954) was already a highly regarded medical and public health researcher at the laboratory of the New York City Department of Health, when she was elected to AAI membership in 1918. Born in Hackensack, New Jersey, into the family of a private-school teacher, Williams is said to have become fascinated by science when she first peered into a school microscope at age 12. After graduating from a local public high school, she enrolled in the New Jersey State Normal School and seemed destined for a career as a school teacher. For the two years following her graduation in 1883, she did, in fact, teach school. In 1887, however, Williams's life was to change course. In that year, her sister Millie narrowly escaped death, giving birth to a stillborn child. Struck by the ineffectiveness of the medical treatment received by Millie, Williams became intensely focused on a career in medicine. She resigned from her teaching position to enroll in the Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary later that year. Williams received her M.D. in 1891 from the Woman's Medical College and interned at the New York Infirmary, where she remained as an instructor in pathology and hygiene. Although the exact dates cannot be confirmed, Williams is known to have traveled to Europe 1. AAI memberships comprised just two categories in these early years\u2014Active and Honorary. Both were elected. All members were practicing or retired researchers and clinicians. The majority of the members had either an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. The Trainee membership category was first formally offered in 1983. 2. All membership statistics are taken from election information on AAI Council reports. As no election records exist for 1919, the above statistics are inclusive for 1913-1918 and 1920-1942. AAI Archives. 3. The New York City Department of Health's laboratory was or iginally opened in 1892 as a temporary emergency laboratory for a cholera outbreak in the city. Laboratory operations were continued and expanded the following year, and it officially became the first municipal laboratory in the United States. 4. In 1884, Friedrich Loeffler discovered the causative organism (Corynebacterium diphtheriae).\"Her legacy in the burgeoning field of immunology includes breakthroughs in the treatment of diphtheria and the diagnosis of rabies.

The strain, later to be named Park-Williams No. 8 (commonly called Park 8), proved crucial to the development of effective high-yield antitoxin. 5 Within just one year, the antitoxin was in mass production and public health departments were distributing it free of charge to physicians in the United States and Great Britain. Although it was Park who was given the recognition for the discovery of the Park-Williams No. 8 strain, Williams stated that she had no regrets about the presumed credit going to her mentor and collaborator, as she was \"happy to have the honor of having my name thus associated with Dr. Park.\" 6 In 1895, Williams was hired as a staff member of the laboratory and, in 1896, was able to take a sabbatical to carry out research on an antitoxin for scarlet fever at the Pasteur Institute. In Paris, her work on scarlet fever yielded no dramatic results, but the trip was fruitful in another area of research. Having spent some of her time at the Pasteur involved in its rabies research, she returned to New York intent upon improving rabies prevention and diagnostics. By 1898, she was able to create an effective vaccine that could be mass produced in the United States. This was a major step in the prevention of rabies, but many patients were still succumbing to the disease because of the lengthy, 10-day-or-longer diagnostic period. Williams turned her attention to a search for some means of detecting the disease much earlier in its occurrence and began studying the brains of infected animals. Her work led to a rabies diagnostic breakthrough within the decade resulting from her discovery of abnormal brain cells in rabid animals. She was not, however, to be generally recognized for this important stride forward, as she was not the first to publish a journal article about the brain cell abnormalities. At the same time that she was performing her research in New York, Adelchi Negri, an Italian pathologist, was studying the same phenomenon in his lab at the University of Pavia. Although it is held that Williams was the first to recognize this distinct brain-cell structure in rabid animals, she is 5. For a modern study of Park-Williams 8 strain see Lesley M.

Williams continued her rabies research, focusing on the use of brain tissue stains in diagnostics. In 1905, she developed a diagnostic test that yielded results in minutes rather than days. 9 Williams's test quickly became the standard rabies test and remained so for the next 30 years. It was not to be improved upon until the late 1930s. In 1905, Williams was promoted to the position of first assistant director of the diagnostic laboratory. In her position, she directed research on a range of urgent public health issues, including influenza, venereal diseases, polio, and trachoma.

Trachoma is an eye infection characterized by a telltale roughening of the inner surface of the eyelid, and, if left untreated, causes blindness. In turn of the century America, trachoma was designated a \"dangerous and contagious disease\" by the surgeon general. As such, beginning in 1905, all immigrants were screened for it upon entering the country, and those who had it were sent back to their country of origin. As it was highly communicable, trachoma was also a growing problem in the poor and immigrant communities, especially among children.

The women researchers were largely limited to lab work, analyzing specimens forwarded b y male scientists from military bases. Williams, however, was the exception. With Park, she was summoned to Camp Upton on Long Island in September 1918 to investigate the disease on the front lines of a new outbreak. 10 On another front, her research on trachoma resulted in a more accurate diagnostic test and opportunity to spare the eyesight of many schoolchildren infected by the disease. As with diphtheria, her work on trachoma proved greatly beneficial for the urban poor. 11 Outside of the laboratory, Williams lived a life far removed from the cautious calibrations and sometimes mundane routine of the laboratory. She seems to have invited risks, as she was known to lov e being a passenger in pre-First World War airplanes, especially with stunt fliers. And she appeared determined to replicate the excitement felt for a scientific discovery in the thrill of speeding in her car through the streets of New York City\u2014or so the many documented speeding tickets would suggest. 12By 1939, 11 editions of the text had been published. (At last, one of her contributions to science would bear her own name.) Their second text, Who's Who among the Microbes, was one of the first biomedical reference books written for the general public. Throughout her long career, Williams served in leadership roles and received numerous honors and awards. Among them were her posts as president of the Woman's Medical Association (1915) and as the first female chair of the American Public Health Association's Laboratory Section (1932). Through her position at the diagnostic laboratory, Williams made seminal discoveries that advanced the medical understanding of diphtheria and rabies and, in doing so, saved countless lives. With her election to AAI in 1918, she not only was accorded recognition by her peers, but she also lent honor to the young organization. Although she may have never received the renown granted a male researcher for the same discoveries, Williams's research and publications informed the work of generations of scientists, male and female. And her distinction in her career inspired confidence for the growing number of female researchers and clinicians entering the field. Upon her retirement, New Y ork City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia accurately summed up Anna Wessels Williams's career: She was \"a scientist of international repute.\" 14 \"Although she may have never received the renown granted a male researcher for the same discoveries, Williams's research and publications informed the work of generations of scientists, male and female.\" Anna Wessels Williams (Photo: the Library of Congress) \"outside the laboratory, Williams lived a life far removed from the cautious calibrations and sometimes mundane routine of the la boratory.

At 71, she had exceeded the established mandatory retirement age of 70 for city employees.13 Beyond her achievements in the laborator y, Williams co- authored two books with Park that helped define the way contagious diseases were to be understood: Pathogenic Micro-organisms Including Bacteria and Protozoa: A Practical Manual for Students, Physicians and Health Officers (1905) and Who's Who among the Microbes (1929). The former was so widely referenced that it was known among researchers and clinicians alike simply as \"Park and Williams.\" 42 AAI History Compendium (2021)\"Hawaii,\" for most AAI members, including those who attended IMMUNOL OGY 2013, conjures up images of vast white sand beaches and palm trees swaying in gentle sea breezes. These Edenic images, however, belie the islands' history as a setting for pioneering immunological research and their longstanding connection to AAI. In fact, one Hawaiian physician, Archibald N. Sinclair, was among the 52 charter members of AAI in 1913. Sinclair, an established authority on tuberculosis, pioneered an immunological-based method for its treatment. Another early AAI member in Hawaii, Nils P . Larsen, spearheaded massive reforms to improve public health on the islands as early as the 1920s. We profile below the lives and careers of these two distinguished early AAI members. Archibald Neil Sinclair, M.B.C.M., AAI '13 Career Overview Archibald N. Sinclair was born in New York City on January 20, 1871, just two years after his parents emigrated from Scotland to the United States. Before he was 10 years old, the family moved to Hawaii, when his father, a building contractor, was hired to help build 'Iolani Palace, the residence commissioned by King Kal\u00af akaua, the last Hawaiian king. The family remained in Honolulu after construction of the palace was completed in 1882, and Sinclair attended Oahu College (now known as the Punahou School), a college preparatory school that includes President Barack Obama among its alumni. After graduating from high school in 1889, Sinclair moved to his parents' homeland and studied medicine at the University of Glasgo w.

He began a private practice in Waianae, Oahu, in 1897, but by 1901, he had fully dedicated himself to public health. That year, he was named city physician of Honolulu, a position he held until 1908, and was appointed the first medical superintendent of the Leahi Home, the recently opened tuberculosis sanitarium in Honolulu, where he was to spend the rest of his career. He served concurrently as acting assistant surgeon for the U.S. Public Health Service from 1900 to 1919 and as physician in charge of the tuberculosis bureau and the bacteriological department of the Territorial Board of Health from 1911 to 1916. Resuming his private practice in 1916 while retaining his position at the Leahi Home, Sinclair continued to specialize in the treatment of tuberculosis and other pulmonary ailments until his death on October 21, 1930. 1 Well-respected among Hawaiian physicians, Sinclair was twice elected president of the Hawaiian Territorial Medical Society, first from 1907 to 1908 and again from 1926 to 1927. Making the Case for Tuberculin A remarkable clinician whose case studies were reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association, 2 Sinclair garnered a national reputation for his success in treating tuberculosis with tuberculin. He first presented his \"Case for Tuberculin\" before the Hawaiian Territorial Medical Society in 1914.3 The use of tuberculin to treat pulmonary tuberculosis was one of the most controversial immunological issues of the day and had been among the topics debated at the first AAI annual meeting held AAI Looks B Ack 'Iolani Palace, 1898 Hawaii State Archives, Digital Collections, Photograph Collection100 Years of AAI: A Look Back at Two Early Immunologists in Hawaii On the occasion of its centennial meeting in Honolulu, AAI reflects on the association's long ties to Hawaii. 4318 AAI Newsletter May/June Atlantic City, New Jersey, the same year that Sinclair reported his positive findings.4 The reason for the controversy was that prior attempts to use tuberculin as a treatment, notably those by Robert Koch in the 1890s, had low success rates and often produced unexpected, negative outcomes, even death. Sinclair conceded that tuberculin treatment was a very complicated, precise process that was ineffective if not administered properly and \"in inexperienced hands, even dangerous.\" 5 He cited two schools of thought on administering tuberculin. He dubbed one method the \"rules on the bottle method\" for treating each patient with a fixed, and often too intense, recommended dosage. He referred to the other method as the \"immunizing\" method, which he attributed to Sir Almroth Wright (AAI '14).6 Sinclair, having spent four months at St. Mary's Hospital in London observing Wright prepare and administer tuberculin in 1911, had further refined the process at Leahi Home. 7 Sinclair's therapeutic immunizing method involved administering small, regulated tuberculin doses over a long interval and varying those doses based on Wright's \"opsonic index,\" which measured the opsonin content in patients' blood. There was no single dosage that was suitable for all patients nor could tuberculin be expected to cure all patients. Such promises, Sinclair asserted, were \"what makes the patent medicine man his living\" and were not made by responsible medical practitioners. 8 Nevertheless, he was convinced that when meticulously administered, tuberculin produced incomparable results. He reported that 67.6 per cent of patients who had received tuberculin treatments were able to leave Leahi and return to work, a dramatic increase from the 27.2 percent able to do so before he began administering tuberculin. 9 Sinclair encountered harsh opposition from a Hawaiian colleague who declared that Wright's opsonic index was \"not accepted in this country,\" 10 but he remained sanguine about the prospects for tuberculin treatment and, in May 1916, traveled to Washington, D.C., to report his findings at the third AAI annual meeting. 11 Despite Sinclair's efforts and optimism, his method of treating tuberculosis was never widely adopted. Most clinicians were concerned that the potential was too great for negative side effects from improper administration.12 According to Arthur Silverstein (AAI '63), although 4. the First AAI Newsletter, May/June 2012, 30. 5.

Reflecting on the progress that had been made in the treatment of tuberculosis in the first decade of the twentieth century alone, he noted, \"One familiar with the [Leahi] Home and its conditions during the past few years cannot but be struck by the change\u2014a few years ago people looked upon it as the last resort of the hopeless\u2014a walk through its war ds encountered almost bed-ridden patients entirely; now it is coming to be looked upon as the hope and salvation of the afflicted, and a walk through its wards will frequently show not a single patient in bed\u2014or at the worst of times but an extremely small percentage of bedridden patients.\" 14 Archibald N.

Larsen did not call Hawaii home until well into adulthood, his impact on Hawaiian medicine and public health was no less significant than Sinclair's. Born in Stockholm, Sweden, on June 15, 1890, Larsen was the sixth of seven children born to a tailor struggling to support his growing family. Overpopulation and successive crop failures were impoverishing life in Sweden, impelling approximately 330,000 Swedes to immigrate to the United States during the 1880s. When Nils was only three years old, the Larsen family joined the ranks of those who hoped to find a better life in the New World. After settling briefly in Peeksville, New York, Nils's father, a devout man, relocated the family to Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he helped start a church for the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant, a Lutheran denomination founded in Chicago in 1885. While attending public school in Bridgeport, Larsen held part-time jobs to help support his family, including work in a steel mill during the summers of his high school years. 15 Larsen attended the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts, Amherst), where he intended to study forestry. Although he began to abandon the formal religious dogmas embraced by his pious father, Larsen remained committed to the Christian ideal of helping others that lay at the heart of the Social Gospel movement of the era. He became actively involved in student religious groups on campus, including the YMCA and the College Christian Association. While attending one religious conference, at which missionaries relayed accounts of their travels, Larsen learned that there was only one doctor for every one million people in China. He decided then that he wanted to become a physician, not out of any special yearning to solve scientific problems but out of his deep-seated commitment to social justice and community service. 16Early Career, War, and Marriage After graduating from Massachusetts Agricultural College in 1913, Larsen attended Cornell Medical School in New York City, earning his M.D. in 1916. He then interned in the pathology department at New York Hospital and took additional courses in biological chemistry at Columbia University. When the United S tates entered the First World War in April 1917, Larsen was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army and was deployed to Belgium the following May. While in Belgium, he received news that his younger sister had died of tuberculosis. Absorbing this loss during the influenza pandemic that ravaged families across the globe likely motivated his later work to combat tuberculosis. In the spring of 1919, Larsen was promoted to major, awarded the Silver Star for his valor during combat, and released from active duty. That summer, he made his first trip to Hawaii, where he visited his older brother David, a plant pathologist, who was now a manager of a sugar plantation. Following his vacation, he r eturned to New York to teach at Cornell Medical School and serve as assistant visiting physician in pediatrics at Bellevue Hospital. These years in New York, from 1919 to 1922, proved to be some of Larsen's most productive for clinical research and writing. He published case studies on allergic reactions, asthma, and pneumonia in the Journal of the American Medical Association and The Journal of Immunology. 17 In September 1921, Larsen married Sara \"Sally\" Lucas, whom he had met two years earlier during his Hawaiian vacation. Although the two had not kept in touch following Larsen's return to New York, Sally was apparently impressed by Larsen during his visit to Hawaii and contacted him upon her arrival in New York fr om Honolulu to start a confectionary. The extent to which the confectionary materialized is unclear, but, within months, the couple wed. Sally's mother appears to have been equally decisive and proactive as her daughter. Upon learning of an opening for a pathologist at Queen's Hospital in Honolulu, she mentioned Larsen to the administrators. If she was seizing upon a possible means of bringing her daughter back to Hawaii, she succeeded. Larsen was offered the position in July of 1922 and promptly accepted it. 18 Nils P .

Powers, \"Worlds (1890-1964)\" (Ph.D. diss., University of www.aai.org 4520 AAI Newsletter May/June Queen's Hospital Larsen immediately impressed the administrators of Queen's Hospital. In 1924, he was appointed the hospital's medical director, a position he held until 1942. Named for Queen Emma, its most enthusiastic champion, Queen's Hospital was founded in 1859 to provide medical care to a rapidly dwindling Hawaiian population. Occupying a major port of call on trade routes across the Pacific, the Hawaiian population was, at that time, besieged by diseases borne by foreigners, most recently a smallpox epidemic that swept across the islands in 1853. 19 At the time of Larsen's appointment more than 60 years later, the hospital had failed to keep pace with the medical advances on the mainland. Larsen immediately set out to modernize Queen's Hospital. His first reform was to arr ange weekly clinics in which medical practitioners from all over the island came together to share and discuss their cases, including the week's deaths. Often, Larsen recruited notable visiting physicians to lecture and consult with the local doctors, and word of the effectiveness of his clinics began to spread nationally, earning Larsen praise in the pages of the New York Times. 20 He also significantly improved living conditions for the nurses\u2014usually women who were recruited from plantations\u2014raising $125,000 for the construction of new nurses' quarters in 1931. 21 Reforming Hawaiian Public Health Larsen's reforms extended well beyond the walls of Queen's Hospital. He made several significant contributions to improving public health in Hawaii. Shocked by the high infant-mortality rate on the islands, Larsen spearheaded a clean-milk campaign in November 1922. His investigations into the Hawaiian milk industry uncovered widespread unsanitary conditions and resulted in new laws regulating milk production. The successful campaign became a national story when it was reported years later in Reader's Digest. 22 In the late 1920s, he also called for \"preventoriums,\" camps where pre-tubercular children would receive medical care and be provided with a proper diet. With the support of Archibald Sinclair and others at Leahi Home, the first preventorium in Hawaii opened its doors in 1930. 23Perhaps Larsen's greatest reforms came in his work with the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association. In 1928, he criticized the planters for allowing their workers to live in substandar d conditions. Improvements in living conditions and diets could prevent the suffering and even death caused by diseases such as beriberi and gastroenteritis, argued Larsen. He soon convinced planters that these reforms were not only a moral obligation but also a sound economic investment. New meal plans were implemented, and health centers were established on plantations where workers could receive treatment and consultation on nutrition, hygiene, and even birth control. 24 A Change of Direction In 1939, Larsen contracted typhus and was hospitalized for 20 days. Shortly after his recovery, he wrote to Hans Zinnser (AAI '17, president 1919-1920) at Columbia University, an authority on typhus and author of Rats, Lice and History. The playfully familiar tone of his letter suggests that Larsen knew Zinsser from his time in New York: \"I had occasion recently to meet your good friend with whom you have been so intimately associated . . . throughout your professional life\u2014namely typhus fever.\" 25 The typhus left Larsen with angina, for which he decided to seek treatment in Boston. The decision was a fortunate one, for he and his wife departed Hawaii on December 5, 1941, just two days before Pearl Harbor was attacked. When he returned in 1942, he stepped down from his position as medical director of Queen's Hospital and began a private practice. Larsen continued his research and began pursuing new topics, including the effects of diet on aging.26 He also became interested in native Hawaiian medicine, pointing out that the traditional remedies of the kahuna lapa'au, Hawaiian medicine men, were often more scientific than those of the nineteenth-century Western doctors who so easily dismissed them as primitive. Larsen even developed a supplement made of taro, a plant Queen Emma, ca. 1880 Photo by A. A. Montano; Hawaii State Archives, Digital Collections, Photograph Collection 19. Richard A.

Even immunologists who were far removed from the islands geographically have long benefited from the presence of AAI members there, as when Arthur F .Coca (AAI '16) and Ella F . Grove (AAI '24) obtained tropical pollen samples from Larsen for their \"Studies in Hypersensitiveness\" in 1924.31 Hawaii may be at once an island paradise and, in the words of Larsen, \"the best biological test tube in the world.\"32common in the traditional Hawaiian diet that he believed promoted dental health. 27 Perhaps it was his eagerness to synthesize Eastern and Western traditions that made him popular with Hawaiians and won him election to the 1950 Constitutional Convention charged with preparing for Hawaiian statehood. 28 Although he officially retired in 1955, Larsen continued to treat patients until his death of a heart attack, at the age of 73, on March 19, 1964. 29 Queen's Hospital, ca. 1925 Courtesy of Queen's Heritage Collection, Queen's Medical Center 27.

Her identification of streptococcal types proved essential to revealing the complexities of the immune response to the bacteria and elucidating streptococci as the primary infectious agent for many diseases\u2014understandings that enabled improved methods for identifying and controlling streptococcal infections. Recognized broadly for her outstanding scientific achievements, Lancefield, in 1961, was elected by her peers to serve as president of AAI, becoming the first woman elected to this office. Lancefield's distinguished career path was all the more remarkable for having been an indirect one. A number of changes in her life could have diverted her progr ess, but, at each juncture, she turned perceived interruptions into opportunities. Early education Rebecca Craighill was born in Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, New York, on January 5, 1895, one of six daughters of Colonel William Craighill, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. A West Point graduate, William married the sister of one of his classmates, Mary Byram Craighill. Mary, an early proponent of female education, encouraged her daughters to devote themselves to their schooling\u2014and with good results. 1 In addition to Rebecca's successful research career, one of Rebecca's sisters became an accomplished physician.In the fall of 1912, Rebecca entered Wellesley College with the intention of studying French and English literature. S he soon became fascinated by her roommate's freshman zoology course, however, and changed her major to zoology. She attacked the subject zealously, taking as many additional courses in biology, including bacteriology, and chemistry as she could while meeting the requirements for graduation. 2 By the time of her college graduation in 1916, her father had died, and the family was in financial straits. To help support her mother and younger sisters, she spent her first year out of college teaching mathematics and basic science at a girls' boarding school in Burlington, Vermont. Even as she sent money home, Rebecca managed to put aside a bit toward tuition for further studies. 3 Rebecca Craighill, ca. 1914 Image courtesy of Rockefeller Archive Center 1 Judith N.

The scholarship was to help her attend Teachers College, Columbia University, preparing for the conventional occupation of the time for educated, unmarried women. The scholarship, however, did not specify that Rebecca must take her classes at Teachers College, only that she should matriculate there, and so, she took the liberty of enrolling in courses in the Department of Bacteriology at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S). 4 Although she was entering the field obliquely, she was beginning her graduate studies in a rarified environment. At the P&S, she entered the department of prominent immunologist and bacteriologist Hans Zinsser (AAI '17, president 1919-20), although, at the time of her arrival, he was stationed in France as part of the U.S. Army Medical Corps. Aware that students in Zinsser's lab were expected \"to spend all of their waking hours in class or in the laboratory,\" 5 Rebecca spent much time in the laboratory at Presbyterian Hospital, typing strains of pneumococci from patients. In addition to her classes, she was encouraged to attend other lectures by distinguished New York scientists. Rebecca was particularly impressed by a lecture given by Oswald Avery (AAI '20, president 1929-30) on the lag phase of pneumococcal cultures. 6 Upon reading Avery's 1917 articles on the specific soluble substance of pneumococcus, 7 she decided to look for an analogue in staphylococcus. She now had the topic for her thesis, which she succeeded in completing that same year. 8 In the spring of 1918, she graduated from Columbia with an M.A., married Donald Lancefield, a zoology graduate student in the laboratory of eminent geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia, and applied for a position at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (RIMR). With her degree in hand, she interviewed with the director, Simon Flexner (AAI '20), who hired her as a technician for Martha Wollstein (AAI '18), who had previously worked closely with Flexner on early experimental polio research and Pfeiffer's bacillus. But Wollstein soon left RIMR to carry out research on the influenza pandemic, 9 and Flexner suggested that Alphonse R. Dochez (AAI '20, president 1931-32) may have use for Lancefield in his ongoing research under a U.S. Army grant to study streptococcal infections at military bases. She interviewed with Dochez and with Avery, a collaborator on the project, and was quickly taken on as their laboratory technician. 10 Oswald Avery and the techniques of classification Lancefield's arrival at RIMR in the summer of 1918 occurred just as two transformative events began to change the direction of research for many scientists, including Avery and Dochez. The United States had begun sending troops to the European front for the First World War, and the1918 influenza pandemic was sweeping the nation. The previous winter, Avery and Dochez had been asked by U.S. Surgeon General William C. Gorgas to put their studies of pneumococcus on hold to consult on a serious outbreak of measles and streptococcal infections at military camps in Texas. It was this shift in focus for Avery and Dochez that led Lancefield to the study of streptococcus, the organism that would command her attention throughout her career. Avery and Dochez collected samples of streptococci from the camps in Texas for further study in their New York laboratory. At that time, streptococci had not been classified and were widely Oswald Avery, ca. 1929 Image courtesy of the Center for Biological Sciences Archives, UMBCAlphonse R.

Lancefield.\" 9 It is unclear where Wollstein went to carry out her research in the summer of 1918. As an authority on Pfeiffer's bacillus (now known as Haemophilus influenza), she was involved in research and clinical projects throughout the 1918 influenza pandemic. Until 1933, Pfeiffer's bacillus was considered the causative agent of the 1918 influenza pandemic. See John M. Barry, The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History (New York: Penguin, 2005), 411-12. 10 Chase, \"Rebecca C. Lancefield.\"Streptococcus Image courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention G33041Special_Issue.indd 20 3/12/13 1:23 AM www.aai.org 49believed to be the causative agent of secondary infections, such as pneumonia, puerperal fever, rheumatic fever, and wound infections, which typically followed measles and influenza. Avery and Dochez had been enlisted precisely because of their success in classifying four types of pneumococci, 11 as well as for their clinical understanding of the disease. The researchers sought to determine whether streptococci, like pneumococci and some other bacteria, were comprised of only one or several distinct types. Shortly before Lancefield joined their laboratory, Dochez and Avery described their frustration with typing their samples from Texas at an early June 1918 Rockefeller conference on hemolytic streptococci. They indicated that they still did not know whether they were dealing with distinct strains, citing problems with both agglutination and mouse pr otection. Dochez explained to those in attendance that, \"[u]p to now...we have been unable to obtain immune serum which affords any considerable degree of protection for white mice against experimental infection. We are still working along this line and it is possible that the proper combination of immune serum and test animal may be obtained.\" 12 Lancefield assisted Avery and Dochez in the laboratory with their typing problem. Within one year, the lab had classified 70 percent of the 125 samples they had collected in Texas into four distinct serological types of streptococcus. Lancefield's role in this process was, no doubt, significant. Avery and Dochez cited her as a co- author in the resulting article,\"Studies on the Biology of Str eptococcus: I. Antigenic Relationships Between Strains of Streptococcus hemolyticus.\"13A slight diversion Shortly after their results were published, funding for the Army-supported streptococcal project ceased with the war's end, and Dochez and Avery gladly returned to their pneumococcal research. Dochez accepted a position at Johns Hopkins University, and Lancefield, no longer funded at RIMR, accompanied her husband and the Columbia zoology group to their annual summer trip to the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. 14 While there, Lancefield met Morgan and was hired to work as a technician in his lab at Columbia University. 15 She worked there for two years on a Drosophila genetics study under Charles W. Metz. Taking adv antage of the access her employment at C olumbia provided her, she took Morgan's genetic course as well as the pioneering cytology course taught by notable cell biologist Edmund B. Wilson. 16 When, in 1921, her husband, Donald, was offered the opportunity to teach zoology at the University of Oregon, both Lancefields made the move. For Donald, it was a homecoming to a state that his mother had entered aboard a covered wagon at the age of ten. Rebecca was also able to secure an appointment teaching bacteriology. The homecoming was short-lived, though, for, at the end of the school year, Donald accepted an offer to join Morgan's Department of Zoology at Columbia University. The Lancefields returned to New Y ork where Rebecca seized the oppor tunity to begin her doctoral training in bacteriology under Zinsser at Columbia.17 Return to streptococcus Lancefield returned to working on streptococcus, not only at Columbia but also at RIMR. Zinsser was not fond of women in the laboratory and was quick to recommend that Rebecca find laboratory space at RIMR with Homer Swift (AAI '20), who was beginning a new study of rheumatic fever. 18 Lancefield obtained a position under Swift, an arrangement that she later recalled required her to Rebecca and Donald Lancefield, c. 1928 Image courtesy of Rockefeller Archive Center 11 Dochez established a biological classification of pneumococci into specific types in 1913, and, as part of an ongoing study of the immunological classification of pneumococci, he worked with Avery through 1917 in identifying the four distinct types by identifying the specific soluble substance that confers type specificity upon the pneumococci. 12 McCarty, \"Rebecca Craighill Lancefield,\" 229. 13 A.

Hans Zinsser, ca. 1919 Image courtesy of the Center for Biological Compendium (2021)carry \"my racks of test tubes back and forth between the two labs\" during these years. 19 At the time, the causative agent of rheumatic fever was unknown, and Swift and Lancefield's first study attempted to isolate the \"specific soluble substance\"\u2014polysaccharides, such as those being identified on pneumococcus, or other antigens\u2014species specific for streptococci. 20 When this study proved inconclusive, Swift next suspected that the -hemolytic class of streptococcus (also called \"green\" or viridans streptococci) was the causative agent. 21 Lancefield's doctoral research consisted of testing this hypothesis. After two years of painstaking laboratory work, she had proved conclusively that the -hemolytic streptococci were not responsible for rheumatic fever, and she had earned her Ph.D. 22 After completing her doctorate in bacteriology in 1925, Lancefield returned to her research on hemolytic streptococci at RIMR by returning to a more basic approach to understanding which classes of streptococci caused diseases in humans. Although Dochez, Avery, and she had identified four distinct serological types in 1919, there had been little research on understanding the determining chemical and biological properties of the antigens on the surface of the bacteria that were responsible for the virulence and pathogenesis of many of the now-known streptococcal infections, such as strep throat, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, and mastitis. 23Developing a classification system Having been immersed in Avery's methodology, Lancefield adopted many of the typing techniques she had used for typing pneumococci. She began her research by resurr ecting the 125 dried streptococcal cultures collected by Dochez and Avery in Texas. 24 She soon began to make progress in classifying -hemolytic streptococci through her laborious and detailed serological grouping and typing. But, the classification system that she was beginning to develop was not her ultimate objective. Instead, it was a means to her goal of identifying the antigens and determining their role in the pathogenic capability of the bacteria. 25 In a series of articles in 1923, Avery and Michael Heidelberger (AAI '35, president 1946-47, 1948-49) pneumococcus were composed of polysaccharides. Their conclusions were verified subsequently by other r esearchers, who also identified similar capsular polysaccharides on pathogenic bacteria determining type specificity. In the mid-1930s, Lancefield isolated two soluble surface antigens from streptococci. The first was type-specific for the various strains of the 1918 epidemic, and the second was species-specific, present in all of the strains taken from infected humans. Lancefield, working just down the hall from Avery, expected to find that the type-specific antigens of streptococci were also composed of complex carbohydrates. In further experimentation, she was surprised to discover that the type-specific antigen was a protein. She identified the protein and later called it the M-protein, in reference to the growth of a matt colony when the bacteria sample is exposed to the antigen on an agar medium. She further concluded that this protein was responsible for the virulence factor of streptococci. The species-specific antigen, however, was comprised of carbohydrates, which she called the C-carbohydrate.

This differentiation in group provided the basis for her classification system and the study of streptococcal diseases. Lancefield did not publish her results as the M-protein and C-carbohydrate discoveries were made. She did, however, author a series of five articles in 1928 reporting these discoveries.26 She soon began to differentiate and classify her samples, separating them into groups and specific serotypes within each group based on variations in the M-protein and C-carbohydrate. Initially, she designated group A for highly virulent streptococcal infections in humans and group B largely for bovine streptococcal infections.27 By 1940, Lancefield and other researchers were refining the classification system to the extent that Lancefield had defined, or been consulted about, groups A through H and K (later dropped), L, and M.28 Research after classification Through her careful studies of group A streptococci, she classified over 50 types and revealed that the M-protein played a central role in streptococcal infections by inhibiting the phagocytosis of white blood cells. She also discovered that a single serotype could cause a variety of streptococcal diseases and that the M-protein varied across serotypes, a conclusion revealing that immunity from one type of streptococcal infection does not prevent infection by streptococcus of another serotype. This latter discovery explained why streptococcal infections, such as strep throat and r heumatic fever, are so often recurring. She also identified two new surface proteins on group A streptococci: T-antigen in 1940, 29 which she later determined, in 1957, meant that the new antigen did not contribute to virulence, and R-antigen.30 Lancefield later turned her attention to group B streptococci\u2014bacteria once thought to infect only bovine but soon discovered to be responsible for neonatal pneumonia and meningitis. Lancefield found that streptococci of this group did not contain the M-protein; instead, she found that their virulence was determined by surface polysaccharides. Her research was an important first step in preventing the life-threatening diseases in newborns caused by group B streptococci. 31 Career at Rockefeller For nearly six decades, Mrs. L., as she became affectionately known to her colleagues, left her mark on RIMR and on immunology. During the Second World War, she served on the Commission on Streptococcal and Staphylococcal Diseases of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board, and her willingness to answer queries and type streptococcal samples from around the country, and later from around the world, earned her laboratory at RIMR the nickname, \"the Scotland Yard of streptococcal mysteries.\" 32 After the war, in 1946, she was promoted to an associate member at RIMR and became a full member and professor in 1958. Lancefield's years at Rockefeller not only allowed her to work under such early luminaries in the field as Avery, Dochez, and Swift, but they also afforded her the Streptococcus pneumonia Image courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ Dr .

She died on March 3, 1981, at the age of 86. 35 Legacy Toward the end of her career, Lancefield received numerous honors and awards thought by many to be long overdue. 36 She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences (1970), which, by that time, had elected only ten women, and was awarded the T. Duckett Jones Memorial Award of the Whitney Foundation (1960), the American Heart Association Achievement Award (1964), the New York Academy of Medicine Medal (1973), and a Doctor of Science (honoris causa; 1973), the highest recognition from Rockefeller. 37 Perhaps the most significant honor bestowed upon her was the decision of both the national and international organizations devoted to the study of streptococcus to adopt the name, \"The Lancefield Society,\" in 1972 and 1977, respectively. 38 Lancefield was an internationally renowned research scientist, but she was also a devoted wife and mother. (She and Donald had one daughter, Jane.) Her success in balancing career and family was rare among female immunologists in the first half of the twentieth century, but she seems not to have wanted emphasis to fall on her role as a pioneering woman in science. According to a colleague, she did not relish \"honors that recognized her as the 'first woman' to do this or that and preferred those that came without reference to her sex.\" 39 Far more satisfying for her, one imagines, would be Maclyn McCarty's tribute, crediting her as \"the scientist most responsible for the well-organized state of our present knowledge of streptococci.\" 40Rebecca Lancefield accepting the T.

Unfortunately, those records shed far less light on the inner workings of The JI. Details concerning such important issues as the responsibilities of the editorial staff, the manuscript submission procedure, and the peer-review process remain less than clear. What is known is that when The JI was founded in 1916, AAI Council elected an editorial staff consisting of an editor, a board of editors, and an advisory board. The editorial process was overseen by Editor Arthur F . Coca (AAI '16), who managed the journal single-handedly from its founding until 1925 when a second editor, John C. Torrey (AAI '20), was named to help alleviate the strain of a growing workload. The members of the board of editors\u2014usually around 30 immunologists from the United States and the United Kingdom\u2014were responsible for reviewing and editing manuscripts. The advisory board was primarily of older, prominent scientists who had little to no editorial function but served to advise and lend prestige to the nascent journal.What's old is new again: Early editors of The JI act to address perennial challenges in the peer-review and editing process G39908AAINews.indd 8 2/6/14 5:22 PM 54 AAI History Compendium (2021)8AAI Newsletter January/February 2014 The structure of the editorial staff remained unchanged for almost two decades, even though its workload nearly doubled in that span of time. In its first five years, The JI was published every two months, averaging approximately 37 scientific articles and 525 pages per year. Between 1929 and 1934, however, the journal was published monthly and averaged approximately 79 scientific articles and 1,035 pages per year. Not only did the number of submissions rise steeply, they also became increasingly specialized and diversified, reflecting the growth of the burgeoning field of immunology. The editorial staff, as initially established in 1916, was no longer able to review and edit the influx of new submissions efficiently and effectively. On F riday, December 27, 1935, a special meeting of the AAI Council convened in New York City to discuss the restructuring of the editorial staff and peer-review process of The JI. A select committee, comprised of Drs. Thomas Coca presented a \"plan of reorganization.\" Continued on next page Historical documents courtesy of The American Association of Immunologists Archive, Bethesda, MD From time to time, the AAI Office of History and Archives will publish an archival document related to the history of the association. Each document will be accompanied by a brief introductory note providing some historical context.

G39908AAINews.indd 9 2/6/14 5:22 PM www.aai.org 55AAI LOOKS BACK The committee proposed restructuring the editorial staff to more efficiently review and edit the greater volume and breadth of manuscripts submitted to The JI. Under the new plan, the journal would be managed by an editorial staff consisting of \"an Editor in Chief and at least three Associate Editors, with the advice of a Board of Editors,\" whose members would now be required to reside in North America. The proposal also specified a new process for handling, evaluating, and editing manuscripts. The following is the language used to specify what was to become the first official peer-review process approved by the Council: 1. All papers to be sent to the Editor in Chief. 2.Editor in Chief to send each paper to a specialist on the Editorial Board, or elsewhere if necessary, for acceptance or rejection. If accepted, the specialist should comment on changes necessary. 3.Paper is then sent back to the Editor in Chief. 4.From the Editor in Chief, the paper goes to the proper Associate Editor for careful editing and approval. 5.The paper is returned to the Editor in Chief. 6.The Editor in Chief returns the paper to the author with all the changes made or suggested by the Associate Editor. 7.Paper comes back from the author to the Editor in Chief for final approval, who then sends it to the publisher and handles the proof, etc.* The Council approved the reorganization and peer- review process at this special December 1935 meeting, voting also to limit papers to 20 printed pages; authors would be required to pay for any pages in excess of the limit. After accepting the reorganization plan, the Council sent letters of thanks to the 25 outgoing members of the board of editors and to the advisory board for their service. The new \"editorial board\"\u2014 the term adopted by Council to refer to the entire editorial staff\u2014would consist of Coca as the editor-in- chief, three associate editors, and a 21-member board of editors. The new staff began its work in January 1936. Of the 25 editorial staff members, 17 had been or would become president of AAI.The chief topic of discussion was the same as that at the first meeting. Dr. Coca reported that the editors, especially the associates, have been unnecessarily burdened with the labor of correcting\u2014 often practically rewriting\u2014papers which had been carelessly composed and apparently not given any revision in the institutions in which they had originated. Examples of corrected manuscripts were passed around. The first meeting of the new editorial board occurred on March 24, 1937, during the twenty-fourth annual meeting of AAI in Chicago, Illinois. Discussions at the meeting focused on the challenges in handling rejected manuscripts and determining the amount of revising and editing necessary to prepare papers for publication. Unable to resolve these concerns at a single meeting, the board met for a second time on December 28, 1937, in New York City specifically to address the burden of \"correcting\u2014often practically rewriting\u2014papers.\" Evidently, these problems were too big to resolve in 1937, as they continue to cause sleepless nights for editors and authors alike.

G39908AAINews.indd 10 2/6/14 5:22 PM 56 AAI History Compendium (2021)Although federal spending was on the rise in the decades immediately following the Second World War, it was also the height of the Second Red Scare associated with Senator Joseph McCarthy (R-WI), and scientists faced the possibility of having their individual funding withheld on the basis of mere rumor or innuendo about their past political associations. In this political climate, scientists increasingly turned to their professional societies to defend their interests before policy makers. The leadership of the American Association of Immunologists (AAI) chose to address the crisis. Rather than limit themselves to defending individual members, AAI leaders spoke out for all victims of the unjust policy, plunging headlong into the complicated waters of public affairs for the first time. N ot only did they dr aft a resolution protesting the policy of discriminating against researchers based on personal politics, but they also worked with representatives of other scientific organizations to ensure that scientists' concerns were heard by policy makers. The organized protest proved effective, and the government policies regarding unclassified research grants were changed. This first overt engagement in public policy by AAI demonstrated the importance of collective political action and laid the groundwork for the next 60 years of advocacy on behalf of immunologists. A Call to Political Action Following sessions on poliomyelitis and complement, attendees at the 1954 AAI annual meeting turned their attention from science to politics as they convened 1.

Resolution and mail ballot attached to the minutes of the AAI Business Meeting, A pril 13, 1954, AAI Archive, Bethesda, MD [hereafter AAI-Bethesda].for the business meeting late in the afternoon on Tuesday, April 13. Rumors that the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS), which administered National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants, was blacklisting scientists on political grounds had circulated among attendees during the first two days of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) meeting. Disturbed by these rumors, Michael Heidelberger (AAI '35, president 1946-47, 1948-49) brought the matter to the floor of the business meeting. A firm believer that scientists could not afford to stay aloof from politics in the postwar era, Heidelberger had used the occasions of his two AAI president's addresses to call for openness and international cooperation in science and to challenge AAI members to become politically engaged.1 Now he called upon AAI to issue a formal protest of the alleged USPHS policy. At the suggestion of Albert Sabin (AAI '46), a committee comprised of Heidelberger, Thomas Scherago (AAI '48) drafted a resolution in April 1954 protesting the blacklisting and mailed it to AAI members for a vote. The resolution recognized the necessity of secrecy and thorough background checks in classified research but argued that such measures were unnecessary in unclassified areas. It \"earnestly urge[d]\" that unclassified research funds \"be allocated solely on the basis of scientific merit of the proposals and for the competence of the investigators involved, and that no funds be denied because of the investigator's political associations or beliefs.\"2AAI LOOKS BACK Members of the House Un-American Activities Committee outside of Chaiman J.

Shortly after the end of the Second World War, anti-communist sentiment quickly grew in the United States (see \"The Roots of McCarthyism,\" p.43). The fear of communist subversion was so pervasive by March 1947 that President Truman issued Executive Order 9835, which established a federal loyalty program and subjected all current and future federal employees to loyalty tests and reviews. If Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records or testimony from anonymous informants provided \"reasonable grounds\" to suspect an employee of affiliating with a group deemed by the attorney general to be subversive, the employee could be summarily dismissed. Although employees were entitled to a hearing before the Loyalty Review Board, they were not provided the names of their accusers, much less afforded the opportunity to confront them in court. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) extended the search for communists beyond the federal workforce and perpetuated the notion that communists in every sector of American society threatened the nation from within. HUAC captured headlines with the well-known investigations of the Hollywood Ten in 1947 and Alger Hiss in 1948. Other HUAC cases, such as that of physicist Edward U. Condon in 1948, may be less familiar to us today but were nonetheless significant at the time. In fact, the AAI Council first spoke out against the tactics associated with McCarthyism when it issued a resolution at the 1948 AAI annual meeting condemning HUAC for its handling of the Condon case (see \"Protesting the Politicization of Science,\" p. 45).3 American anxiety over communism increased dramatically in response to global and domestic developments of the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Soviets carried out their first successful atomic bomb test in August 1949, and Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the communist People's Republic of China two months later. On February 2, 1950, Klaus Fuchs was arrested for espionage, sparking the investigation that, months later, resulted in the arrest of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

Sixty years ago, scientists had similar concerns for their own funding, albeit for very different reasons. prominence when he delivered a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, dramatically claiming to have in his hand a list of subversives in the State Department. It was against this backdrop that the USPHS changed its procedures for screening NIH grant applications in June 1952. The change had been implemented quietly and was known to members of AAI and other FASEB societies only as an unverified rumor when they met in early April 1954. Confirmation came only after the FASEB meeting when the American Society of Biological Chemists issued a resolution calling upon the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to investigate the rumors.4 Oveta Culp Hobby, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,5 responded to the inquiry with the following statement on April 28: We do not require security or loyalty investigations in connection with the award of research grants. When, however, information of a substantial nature reflecting on the loyalty of an individual is brought to our atten- tion, it becomes our duty to give it more serious consid- eration. In those instances where it is established to the satisfaction of this Department that the individual has engaged or is engaging in subversive activities or that there is serious question of his loyalty to the United States, it is the practice of the Department to deny support. According to Hobby, more than 2,000 NIH grants had been awarded to 14,000 scientists in each of the 58 AAI History Compendium (2021)The Roots of McCarthyism: Communism and Anti-Communism in America Since the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, anti-radicalism and fear of internal subversion have been recurring themes in American politics. It is therefore no surprise that when the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) was founded in 1919, the party's revolutionary rhetoric, and the fact that the overwhelming majority of its members were recent immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, immediately aroused suspicion. Following a series of highly publicized bombings by subversive political elements, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, with the backing of Congress and widespread public support, launched a series of raids in cities across the country in December 1919 and January 1920 that rounded up thousands of individuals suspected of being communists. Hundreds of aliens were deported during what became known as the Red Scare, and the CPUSA was driven underground\u2014its membership falling below 10,000.1 During the turbulent times of the Great Depression, the CPUSA enjoyed a period of relative success in American politics. Communists worked with progressive groups in the 1930s and attracted new party members by playing a leading role in the social struggles of the day. By the mid-1930s, Americans who championed When Hitler invaded Russia in June 1941, the Roosevelt administration and its supporters, who were, by then, committed to aiding the Allies, actively worked to improve Americans' impressions of the Soviet Union. This U.S.-Soviet cooperation flourished briefly after the United States entered the Second World War, but the relationship quickly soured with the war's end, as both the U.S. and Soviet governments sought to control the post-war world order. While many liberals, however reluctantly, learned to work with communists during the Great Depression and the Second World War, conservatives (most, but not all of them, were Republicans) never ceased their criticism of communism as un-American. Many critics of President Roosevelt's policies charged that the president was a socialist, and a vocal minority even suggested that his administration was infiltrated with communists who were loyal to the Soviet Union. These charges failed to stick during the 1930s or early 1940s, but Republicans had far more success in portraying the Democratic Party as \"soft\" on communism by the end of the decade, as they blamed Roosevelt and his successor, President Harry S. Truman, for the \"fall\" of Eastern Europe and China to communism. President Truman attempted to seize the domestic communism issue from the Republicans by signing Executive Order 9835 and instituting the federal loyalty program in March 1947, but the Republican-controlled House Un- American Activities Committee conducted high-profile investigations into communist subversion and further stirred anti-communist sentiment. By the end of the 1940s, the foundation for the systematic persecution of those whose loyalty was called into question had been put into place. Once the federal government implemented the Truman loyalty program and legitimized the practice of screening employees based on their political beliefs and affiliations, similar policies were rapidly adopted by state and local governments as well as private organizations, including universities.2 No sector of society was safe from accusations of disloyalty. Leaders of all fields, including science, soon recognized that even their past political affiliations, if only slightly outside of the mainstream, could cost them their careers. 1. This brief overview of communism and anti-communism in the United States is based on Richard M. Fried, Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective (New York: Oxford University Pr ess, 1990), and Ellen Schrecker, The Age of McCarthyism: A Brief History with Documents, 2nd ed.

Roosevelt 's trade unionization efforts and publicly acknowledged the Democrats as the lesser of two evils by the 1936 presidential election. Following the signing of the Nazi-Soviet pact and the Russian invasion of Poland in 1939, the CPUSA quickly lost much of the goodwill it had engendered during the Great Depression. The change in policy confirmed suspicions that the party was under direct control of the Soviet government, and, thereafter, the reputation of the CPUSA was tied to that of the Soviet Union. www.aai.org 5916 AAI Newsletter November/December 2013 those who did suspect that they had been denied funding for political reasons undoubtedly kept quiet to sav e their careers. Nevertheless, AAI leaders were aware of at least three individuals who were on the USPHS blacklists: the names, \"Pauling,\" \"Kabat,\" and \"Peters,\" are handwritten in the corner of of AAI Councillor Merrill Chase's (AAI '38, president 1956-57) letters regarding the resolution of protest. 7 Both Nobel laureate Linus Pauling and distinguished Yale biomedical research scientist John P . Peters brought public attention to their cases in 1954 and 1955, 8 but there can be little doubt that when Heidelberger called upon AAI to act on the matter in April 1954, it was the plight of his former student, colleague at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S), and friend, Elvin A.Kabat (AAI '43, president 1965-66), that weighed heavily on his mind. Heidelberger knew that Kabat had been under investigation by the FBI for his alleged communist affiliations for the past few years, and he dismissed these accusations as \"manifestly absurd and of cruel potential damage to the career of one of our most promising and brilliant young scientists.\"9 In 1953, Kabat had applied to have an NIH grant renewed, only to be informed that his application \"falls in the group of applications for which grants cannot be made.\" 10 His other existing NIH grants were promptly terminated. USPHS officials offered clarification during a visit with Houston Merritt, chair of the Department of Neurology at P&S where Kabat was conducting the NIH-sponsored research. They informed Merritt that the grant application was rejected because of Kabat's past political associations but would be reconsidered if resubmitted without his name. Kabat refused to agree to this arrangement and instead imposed a boycott on USPHS. No one receiving USPHS funds would work in his laboratory until the blacklist was lifted.11 Kabat first encountered McCarthyism in 1947, when he began working as a part-time consultant at the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital, a position that required a loyalty and security investigation in accordance with Truman's Executive Order 9835. D uring the investigation an anonymous informant, whom Kabat later identified as chemist and Nobel laureate James Batcheller Sumner, told the FBI that Kabat had been a communist in 1937-38, the year that Kabat and Sumner were research fellows together in Uppsala, Sweden. 12 Kabat was dismissed by the Veterans Administration in light of this information, but he appealed the decision to the Loyalty Review Board and was reinstated as a consultant. 13 Elvin A.

In addition to the outpouring of support he received from scientists, he was also publicly defended by President Truman, who invoked executive privilege and refused to hand over any files related to the loyalty program to members of Congress. Without access to the files, Thomas and HUAC dropped the investigation. In July 1948, the Atomic Energy Commission renewed Condon's security clearance, and the case faded from the headlines. Although no longer chaired by Thomas, who resigned his seat in December 1949, HUAC subpoenaed Condon in August 1952. No new evidence was presented in the hearing, but the committee's report nevertheless declared that Condon was unsuitable for any position that required a security clearance. As individual agencies, not Congress, granted security clearances, the report was nonbinding. When Condon, in his capacity as director of research and development at the Corning Glass Company, applied for a new clearance to work on a contract with the U.S. Navy in June 1954, he initially received it. In October, however, the secretary of the Navy revoked the clearance and ordered a second security review after the Republicans used the Condon case as political fodder in the mid-term election. Fed up with having his loyalty questioned repeatedly, Condon retired from Corning and sought an academic appointment. Yet even in academia, the HUAC accusations impeded his search for permanent employment, and several universities withdrew their offers before he settled in at the University of Colorado at Boulder.6 1.

Parnell Thomas (R-NJ) in the weekly magazine Liberty in June 1947, a few months after he was appointed chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). \"They have a weakness for attending meetings, signing petitions, sponsoring committees, and joining organizations labeled 'liberal' or 'progressive' but which are actually Communist fronts.\"1 Thomas 's criticism was aimed at those scientists who actively resisted the secrecy and isolationism that he and many other politicians sought to impose on scientific research in the United States after the Second World War. One scientist, in particular, became the object of Thomas 's criticism\u2014 well-respected nuclear physicist and pioneer in quantum mechanics Edward U. Condon. On March 1, 1948, Condon, then the director of the National Bureau of Standards, became the subject of the first high-profile loyalty case involving a scientist when a HUAC subcommittee chaired by Thomas called him \"one of the weakest links in our atomic securit y.\"2 During the Second World War, Condon had served briefly as associate director of Los Alamos under J. Robert Oppenheimer but resigned after only six weeks in protest of some of the more stringent Manhattan Project security practices.3 He had accepted the need for security measures, such as fingerprinting and pre-hire backgr ound interviews, but protested others, especially the compartmentalization policies that prevented researchers from knowing what research teams working on other aspects of the same project were doing. Despite his disagreements with security officers at Los Alamos in 1943, Condo n's security clearance remained intact, and he continued to serve as a consultant on the Manhattan Project until 1945, when he was confirmed, without dissent, as director of the National Bureau of Standards by the Senate. After the war, however, Condo n's aversion to secrecy and his support for international scientific cooperation appear to have been enough to attract the attention of Thomas and his HUAC colleagues. In terms of specific charges against Condon, the subcommittee report made much of his membership in the American-Soviet Science Societ y, an organization formed during the war to foster scientific cooperation between the two allied nations, but which was now deemed a communist front by HUAC. AAI and four of the other five Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology member societies were www.aai.org 6118 AAI Newsletter November/December 2013Kabat's prominence prepared him to survive the ordeal better than could other, less distinguished scientists. Immediately after losing his NIH grants, Kabat secured funding from the Office of Naval Research and continued to receive support from the Navy for 17 years. 21 Furthermore, he had the backing of other prominent scientists, such as Heidelberger, who not only called upon AAI to speak out but also took matters into his own hands. In response to one USPHS request for him to review a grant application in December 1954, Heidelberger wrote, \"Because it has been the policy of the U.S. Public Health Service to judge contracts on the basis of vague charges and political considerations in addition to scientific fitness, I do not propose to waste my time on any consideration of the accompanying application for a Public Health Service grant, at least until authoritative announcement is made that this policy has been abandoned.\" 22 The AAI Resolutions The protest resolution authored by the Heidelberger committee in the wake of the April 1954 business meeting was mailed to AAI members in June of that year, following Hobby's statement on USPHS policy. To the surprise of AAI President Alwin M. Pappenheimer, Jr. (AAI '38, president 1954-55) and members of the AAI Council, the resolution \"met with considerable disapproval and a number of disturbed letters from members.\" 23 One member even resigned from AAI in protest of the resolution.24 When the final tally was recorded in August, 133 members had approved the resolution, and 49 opposed it; 252 members did not respond to the mail ballot.25 The opposition to the resolution reflected the anti- communist consensus of the era. The majority of those who disapproved of the resolution expressed concerns that it went too far to protect the rights of communists. 14. Ibid., 28; M.

A LEGACY OF ADVOCACY, continued from page 60 When it first dismissed Kabat, the Veterans Administration notified the local passport office of its findings, and Kabat 's passport was revoked. Although Kabat won his appeal before the Loyalty Review Board, his passport was not returned, and he was unable to attend the First International Congress of Allergists in Zurich, at which he was scheduled to deliv er a plenary lecture in 1951.14 That year, Pr esident Truman responded to increased political pressure to get tougher on communism by changing the standard for dismissal from government positions fr om \"reasonable grounds \" to suspect disloyalty to \"reasonable doubt\" of loyalt y, shifting the burden of proof from agency loyalty boards to those individuals suspected of being disloyal.15 Rather than endure another round of loyalty hearings, Kabat resigned his position at the VA hospital.16 Although never a C ommunist Party member, Kabat, like many politically progressive Americans at the time, held the Soviet Union in high esteem during the 1930s (see \"The Roots of McCarthyism,\" p. 43). Reflecting on his political leanings during these tumultuous years in 1983, Kabat recalled how the economic hardships that his family endured during the Great Depression had radicalized him and how he had admired the Soviet stand against fascism during the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), when the United States, Britain, and France attempted to remain neutral.17 He had even traveled to Leningr ad and Moscow Michael Heidelberger , ca. 1953 in the summer of 1937, Lasker Foundation before his fellowship year in U ppsala, and then to Spain the following summer, despite the fact that his U.S. passport did not permit him to do so.18 When Stalin agreed to the Nazi-Soviet pact in 1939, Kabat grew disillusioned with the So viet Union and communism, later writing that the pact, along with the subsequent Soviet invasions of Poland and Finland, \"shook me and I began to worry about my political views.\"19 But, in 1941, after Germany invaded Russia, \"the doubts generated by the Nazi-So viet pact were stilled,\" and Kabat helped establish a Russian war relief group at the Columbia U niversity Medical Center. 20 Even in the turbulent 1930s, these activities placed Kabat on the far left of the political spectrum; they were not, ho wever, seen as sinister until the late 1940s. 62 AAI History Compendium (2021)AAI LOOKS BACK Although it did not explicitly mention communism, it implied that not even avowed communists should be prohibited from receiving funds, declaring that \"even those who are in marked discord with the rest of the people . . . may, through the results of their research[,] render great service, present or future, to the very people with whom they are in discord.\"26 Despite the surprising objections from a significant minority of members, Pappenheimer and Secretary-Treasurer F . Sargent Cheever (AAI '50, president 1963-64)were unwilling to let the matter drop. Believing that \"the purpose of the resolution and the high moral tone which permeates it are most laudable,\" they hoped it might be rewritten so as to r eceive \"unanimous, or practically unanimous, support of the members. \"27 The AAI Council agreed and appointed a new committee composed of John H. Dingle (AAI '41, pr esident '50, pr esident 1971-72) to draft a new resolution. Committee members recognized the risks inv olved in issuing a statement of protest. Enders, in a letter written the day before learning that he would be awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, pointed out that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had recently announced that tax-exempt organizations that \"mixed in politics\" would lose their tax-exempt status. He did not, however, discourage AAI from taking action. On the contrary, Enders welcomed the opportunity to challenge not only the USPHS policy but also the IRS regulation: \"I should be very happy if this action of ours might lead to the legal determination of this [IRS] ruling which appears to me to be particularly dangerous to the free expression of opinion.\"28 As the committee attempted to find the appropriate words to protest the USPHS loyalty policy, Pappenheimer wrote Dingle offering his candid thoughts on what most AAI members desired out of the resolution: I think that many members of our Society feel that present members of the Communist Party or people of proved disloyalty have no business applying for grants from the very government that they are making every effort to overthrow. This of course has nothing to do with the present resolution but does render the interpretation of Mrs. Hobby's statement somewhat difficult. When, for example, she says \"where it is established to the satisfaction of this Department that the individual has engaged or is engaging in subversive activities\" what constitutes the satisfaction of her department? Is the mere fact that an individual once played string quartets with a member of the Soviet consulate satisfactory proof of that individual's disloyalty to the United States? Does the fact that an individual was interested ideologically in the Communist Party prior to 1938 indicate that he is disloyal to the United States at the present time and should not receive support for his research work?29 After two months of deliberating, the committee completed a fifth and final version of the resolution in December 1954. The authors shrewdly omitted any mention of communism or any statement that might be interpreted as defending the rights of 26.

The resulting resolution, a clear and concise statement of principles, was stronger for the omission. It declared that unclassified research grants \"should be awarded to investigators on the basis of their competence and integrity and the merits of the problem to be studied.\" It also warned of the consequences of violating the principle of scientific freedom: \"When research is open and unclassified, the imposition of political or other extraneous requirements on the investigator as a condition for awarding a research grant not only threatens the freedom of science and the principles of the American constitutional government, but may also deprive the nation of achievements of outstanding intellectual ability.\"30 The resolution was mailed to AAI members on February 16, 1955, so that they could consider it before the upcoming annual meeting. When it was finally voted on by members at the business meeting in San Francisco on April 12, 1955, the resolution received widespread approval, with only three members dissenting.31 The Legacy of McCarthyism in Science The AAI Council forwarded the resolution to NAS President Detlev W. Bronk, whom President Dwight D.Eisenhower had asked to investigate the growing controversy concerning selection criteria for unclassified research grants. The final NAS report sent by Bronk to the president in 1956 contained recommendations in accord with those outlined in the AAI resolution, namely that applicants for unclassified research grants should be judged solely on \"scientific integrity and competence\" and \"the scientific merits of their program.\"32 In August 1956, the Eisenhower administration declared that all executive agencies would adhere to the NAS recommendations for awarding unclassified research grants, effectively ending the NIH policy of withholding funds based on suspicions of disloyalty.33We know the names of only a few scientists who were persecuted for their political beliefs , not because there were only a few individuals but because we are aware of only those who were prominent enough that they could fight the accusations of communism and have their careers survive intact. Many others, perhaps some of them AAI members, who were denied funding or forbidden international travel because of their political beliefs, likely remained silent to salvage what they could of their reputations. All scientists of the era were affected, at least indirectly, for even those who did not suffer explicit sanctions had to be wary of crossing an unspecified political line. Many, no doubt, adopted self-imposed restrictions on political speech to ensure that their own careers were not threatened. The full extent to which McCarthyism affected AAI members and other scientists can never be measured. We can be certain, however, that McCarthyism had profound effects on scientists' professional societies, including AAI, as well as individuals. As navigating public policy became simultaneously more difficult and more necessary for scientists in the 1940s and 1950s, they increasingly relied on professional organizations, such as AAI, F ASEB, and the NAS, to take political stands and make policy recommendations, because they could do neither effectively as individuals. One commentator on scientific freedom in the 1950s noted this change and offered the following sound advice: \"Let the scientist ... become a functionally operating member of his professional organizations; they need his help, and he may someday need theirs.\"34 Bryan D.

Yet, this is precisely how one eminent immunologist, Mary Hewitt Loveless (AAI '41), may have appeared on a typical summer day during that decade. An allergist and clinical immunologist, Loveless pioneered the use of venom, which she meticulously obtained from wasps and bees in her own backyard, to treat patients who were susceptible to anaphylaxis when stung by these insects of the order Hymenoptera. It is her work in developing and refining this allergy treatment, the first successful venom immunotherapy for patients with hypersensitivity to Hymenoptera stings, for which she is best remembered today. Fiercely independent, Loveless was not afraid to engage in unconventional research methods. While her innovative approach to allergy treatment was largely ignored for much of her career, her persistence over more than one-half century of research ultimately won her accolades as the rest of the field embraced her methods. Early Life Mary Hewitt was born in Clovis, California, on April 28, 1899, to British immigrant parents who had fled an economic depression in England in the late nineteenth century. Settling in the southern California farming community in the 1890s, they found their economic conditions only moderately improved.1 To attend college, Mary worked part-time as a waitress and secretary to pay her way through Stanford University, receiving a B.A. in biology in 1921. Encouraged by the faculty to pursue a degree in medicine, she entered medical school at Stanford as one of only two women in a class of 25 and earned her M.D. in 1925.2 She married that same year and took the surname Loveless, the name she would use for the rest of her life, although the marriage soon ended in divorce.3 Following a medical internship year at San Francisco General Hospital, Loveless remained in the city to open a private practice. She also worked part-time for the California Department of Public Health and as an assistant in medicine at Stanford Medical School. It was while holding one of the Stanford staff appointments in the allergy clinic at Children's Hospital during the early 1930s that Loveless first became interested in allergy research.4 Loveless attributed her first opportunity to formalize her studies of allergy to a chance but fortuitous vacation encounter in 1935 with a London physician to the royal family.5 It was not his access to Buckingham Palace that proved consequential for Loveless but rather his acquaintance with Robert A.Cooke (AAI '20), a renowned allergist at the Asthma and Allergy Clinic at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. Given Loveless's interest and experience in allergy, the physician wrote a personal letter of introduction to Cooke for her and suggested that she stop in N ew York before returning to the Bay Ar ea.6AAI LOOKS BACK Creating a Buzz in the Field of Immunology: Mary Hewitt Loveless and the Development of Venom Therapy for the Prevention of Sting-Induced Anaphylaxis by Bryan Peery and John Emrich Mary Hewitt Loveless's passport photo, 1955 1 In 1988-89, Sheldon G. Cohen (AAI '64) corresponded with Loveless and interviewed her over the telephone. This overview of Loveless's early life is drawn from the following two articles, which Cohen wrote based on his notes on those conversations: \"In Conversation with Mary Hewitt Loveless, M.D.,\" Allergy Proceedings 10, no. 2 (1989): 153-55; \"Loveless on Wasp Venom and Allergy Immunity. Part 1,\" Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology 112, no. 6 (2003): 1248-52. 2 Cohen, \"In M.D.,\" 154; ibid., on Wasp 1,\" 1248. 3 Cohen, \"Loveless on Wasp Venom and Allergy Immunity. Part 1,\" 1248. 4 Ibid. 5 Unfortunately, if Loveless named the physician with whom she met in her conversations with Cohen, he did not include it in his accounts. Cohen, \"In Conversation with Mary Hewitt Loveless, M.D.,\" 154; ibid., Newsletter Winter 2013Loveless seized this opportunity to meet a pioneering researcher in allergy. She met with Cooke upon her return to the United States and was invited to stay as a guest researcher for three weeks to study the treatment of hay fever patients with injections of pollen extracts. Loveless must have impressed Cooke, for he offered her a research fellowship that kept her at Roosevelt Hospital for the next three years.7 Studies on Hay Fever and Blocking Antibodies When Loveless arrived at Roosevelt Hospital in 1935, Cooke's laboratory was attempting to determine the mechanism by which ragweed pollen extracts offered protection to individuals who suffered from hay fever. Anecdotal evidence of the effectiveness of such treatment was readily available, as the practice had been used in clinics for nearly 20 years, but no one really understood how the treatment worked. By transfusing serum from treated patients to untreated patients, Cooke and his Creating a Buzz in the Field of Immunology: Mary Hewitt Loveless and the Development of Venom Therapy for the Prevention of Sting-Induced Anaphylaxis by Bryan Peery and John Emrich colleagues demonstrated that the immunity produced by pollen extract injections was transferrable, and they concluded that a blocking antibody specific to ragweed pollen must be responsible.8 Loveless helped determine that this antibody was contained in the pseudoglobulin serum fraction9 and demonstrated that even nonallergic patients produced it when injected with pollen extract.10 Loveless continued her studies of blocking antibodies and the use of pollen extracts in treating hay fever after her departure from the Cooke laboratory in 1938 for a joint appointment as an assistant physician at New York Hospital and instructor of medicine at Cornell University Medical College.11 Here, Loveless published her \"Immunological Studies of Pollinosis\" as a series of five articles in The Journal of Immunology from 1940 to 1943.12 In the first of these articles, she described the thermostable property of the blocking antibody, providing a method of separating the blocking antibody from the reagin using heat and allowing her to determine that the thermostable antibody exerted its neutralizing effect by binding antigen directly.13 Department of Medicine, Cornell University Medical College, faculty and staff, 1946; Mary Hewitt Loveless is seated in back row, 4th from left Medical Center Archives of NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Mary Hewitt Loveless with Michael Heidelberger, no date Stanford Medical History Center 7 Ibid. 8 Robert A.

The Presence of Two Antibodies Related to the Same Pollen-Antigen in the Serum of Treated Hay-Fever Patients,\" The Journal 17 1/1/14 10:36 PM 66 AAI History Compendium (2021)To develop her skills in immunochemistry and further her understanding of blocking antibodies and their antigens, Loveless took advantage of a 1946 sabbatical to study under Michael Heidelberger (AAI '35, president 1946-47, 1948-49) at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.14 Even as she developed advanced laboratory techniques, Loveless remained first and foremost a clinician committed to improving immunotherapy for the treatment of her allergy patients through clinical experimentation. At the 1946 AAI annual meeting in Atlantic City, she reported successfully applying the principles and techniques she had developed in treating hay fever to a patient who was allergic to insulin.15 At times, her methods were highly controversial\u2014perhaps none more so than when she injected patients with mineral oil emulsions, based on Jules Freund's (AAI '24, president 1955-56) adjuvant, in the hopes of maximizing the duration of immunity between boosters.16 The Turn to Insect Venom Allergies In 1946, a colleague at Cornell asked Loveless if she knew of any treatment to prevent systemic allergic responses to insect stings. The colleague's mother had twice suffered near-fatal anaphylactic reactions to bee stings, and he thought Loveless's success in treating hay fever patients might enable her to help his mother.17 Hypersensitivity to Hymenoptera stings was known to be a relatively rare but severe condition. Physicians had reported hypersensitive patients experiencing a wide array of potentially fatal symptoms following stings, including a dramatic drop in blood pressure, coronary artery spasms, and swelling of the throat. Hypersensitivity to Hymenoptera venom was far less common than hypersensitivity to pollen, but, as one team of allergists noted, there was one crucial difference between the two: \"In the former, inadequate protection may mean the difference between life and death; in the latter the difference is simply between comfort and discomfort.\"18 When Loveless began her studies on wasp-sting allergies, epinephrine was the primary means of preventing fatalities from anaphylactic shock. It had proved to be quite effective at combating anaphylactic reactions when administered immediately following a sting. But allergists were interested in preventing the onset of symptoms by desensitizing hypersensitive individuals. Beginning in 1939, clinicians r eported success in desensitizing patients with whole-body extracts made by grinding up whole insects, leading many clinicians to conclude that \"the sensitizing agent seems to be in the entire body of the insect.\"19 Loveless began her experiments on Hymenoptera desensitization using whole-body extracts in 1948, but, after running chemical analysis on the whole-body extracts and pure venoms, she challenged what was then the conventional wisdom, arguing that the allergens were concentrated in the venom and hypothesizing that venom therapy would, for that reason, prove more effective than a regimen of whole- body extract injections.20 AAI LOOKS BACK Stinger being extracted from hand U.S. Department of Agriculture; Photo by Scott Bauer Honey bee Wikimedia Commons; Photo by Daniel Schwen 14 Cohen, \"Loveless on Wasp Venom and Allergy Immunity.

Loveless later explained that she included Fackler's name on the article to encourage him to enter the field of allergy research, but her generosity had little effect, as he \"preferred to be a general country doctor in a small town somewhere.\" Loveless quoted in Cohen, \"Loveless on Wasp Venom 2013There was one tremendous obstacle to venom immuno- therapy at the time: pure venom was not readily available. Undeterred, Loveless collected the insects herself, explaining in the methods section of her groundbreaking 1956 paper, \"Each autumn live wasps are procured either individually in the field with butterfly nets or, preferably, in intact hives so that uniformity of species is assured.\"21 She then anesthetized the insects and carefully removed their venom sacks, which she refrigerated for up to one year before grinding them up and injecting the venom into her patients. Although a tedious process, she grew quite proficient at it, reporting in 1964 that, after dissecting an estimated 30,000 insects over the years, she could \"do a bug a minute.\"22 In 1953, Loveless began a small trial that involved injecting patients with progressively increasing doses of venom over the course of one or two days. Uncertainty regarding her patients' tolerance thresholds made this a dangerous procedure for her to undertake. Although Loveless noted that \"in most instances\" the treatment was accomplished \"with only slight systematic reactions,\" she conceded, albeit rather euphemistically, that \"in three patients, ... the manifestations approximated (briefly) those described by the subject for his accidental stinging episode.\"23 In other words, she had induced anaphylaxis in these subjects in her clinic. By 1956, she had determined a standardized schedule and reported that anaphylactic reactions \"were entirely avoided. \"24 Moreover, a series of live sting tests in her office, as well as accidental stings suffered by her patients outside of her clinic, suggested that her venom immunotherapy was effective. Even after she was named emeritus professor of medicine upon her retirement from Cornell University Medical College in 1964, Loveless continued refining her techniques, keeping wasps and bees in the garden of her Westport, Connecticut, home and treating allergy patients in her private practice, which she maintained for another 25 years. By 1976, she had treated over 300 patients with her venom immunotherapy and reported that six venom sacs injected over the course of a few hours could provide protection for up to one year .25 Furthermore, she had begun replacing the annual booster shots of venom with live stings in her clinic for those of her patients who consented. Ten of her patients who lived in remote areas even \"learned to net, chill, and apply the suitable species of wasp to the leg\u2014with epinephrine and professional aid close at hand.\"26 The Loveless Legacy Loveless's \"Wasp Venom Allergy and Immunity\" was reprinted as the inaugural \"landmark article\" in Allergy Proceedings in 1989, but it was not welcomed as such when it was first published in 1956.27 For the most part, scientists seemed to pay little attention at all, as whole- body extract remained the recommended treatment for Hymenoptera allergy. The popular press, however, was enamored with Loveless and her procedures.

Lichtenstein (AAI '67), Martin D. Valentine (AAI '72), and Anne Kagey-Sobotka (AAI '78) of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine reported a single case in which they used honeybee venom to immunize a patient after whole-body extract failed to produce the desired effect.30 Making only passing reference to Loveless's work, they noted, \" Although some investigators have suggested treatment with the appropriate venoms, this treatment is not, in fact, possible within the constraints of federal regulations.\"31 Even this reference was not to Loveless's 1956 article but rather to a follow-up study that she reported in The Journal of Immunology in 1962.32 The group at Hopkins published the results of a single-blind controlled trial on venom therapy in 1978.33 They divided 60 patients into three groups, treating the first with venom, the second with whole-body extract, and the third with a placebo. Of the 18 patients treated with venom who agreed to a sting test, only one had mild systemic reactions. Members of the whole-body and placebo groups, on the other hand, fared so poorly that the trials were terminated early. Seven of the 11 of those treated with whole-body extract suffered severe systemic reactions following the sting test, as did seven of the 12 who received a placebo. Whole-body extract, the treatment method that had been favored by allergists since 1939, proved no more effective than the placebo. The following year, in 1979, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finally approved venom-sac extracts for use in the therapeutic treatment of patients with Hymenoptera venom allergies.34AAI LOOKS BACK Cover of the May 15, 1976, issue of Modern Medicine, featuring Mary Hewitt Loveless's article, \"The Sting: Prophylactic Venom Prevents Disaster\" 28 \" August's Deadly Stings,\" Life, August 9, 1963, 57-60. 29 Matt Clark with Dan Shapiro, \"Fighting Hives,\" Newsweek, April 11, 1977, 65-66. 30 Lawrence M.

Gary Alpert, 6920 AAI Newsletter Winter 2013Members of the Hopkins group later acknowledged, to varying degrees, Mary Hewitt Loveless's role in pioneering venom therapy. In 1977, Kagey-Sobotka, the most junior member of the research team, dedicated her dissertation to Loveless, \"who, thirty years ago, first suggested the appropriateness of venom immuno- therapy.\"35 Valenine later contributed an article on the significance of Loveless's research to \"The Allergy Archives\" series in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.36 Lichtenstein, however, remained somewhat skeptical, pointing out that Loveless \"never carried out controlled studies\" and questioning \"whether her once- or twice-a-year sting regimen was really effective.\"37 The same fierce independence and penchant for the unconventional that drew criticism also won Loveless many admirers. Robert A. Good (AAI '57, president 1975-76), in his AAI President's Address, recounted one instance in which Loveless's boldness contributed, at least indirectly, to a major discovery in basic immunology. Speaking in front of a large audience at the Fifth International Congress of Allergology and Clinical Immunology in Madrid in 1964, Kimishige Ishizaka (AAI '58, president 1984-85) presented experimental results that demonstrated that IgA-rich fractions contained reagins and suggested that IgA might be the reaginic immunoglobulin. Good recalled that Ishizaka's talk \"convinced me and, I think, almost everyone present,\" but Loveless rose to challenge Ishizaka's hypothesis. She reported having a patient who produced reagins, though he lacked IgA entirely. Ishizaka graciously thanked Loveless and, with this new insight, returned to his research. Within two years, he had discovered, isolated, and purified I gE and identified it as the reagin.38 It may have taken decades for some of her scientific achievements to be fully appreciated, but by the time of her death in 1991, Mary Hewitt Loveless was held in high regard by her peers. The AAI tribute to Loveless noted that she \"stood out among a very small group of Association members from whose work a rational understanding of asthma and human allergic disease would evolve,\" and recognized her as a \"pioneer clinical immunologist.\"39 Even after her death, Loveless contributed to the field of immunology. An avid investor who amassed a sizable estate by carefully following the stock market on a daily basis, she bequeathed nearly $4 million to her alma mater, Stanford University School of Medicine, \"for the benefit of immunologic research and study of life-threatening allergies.\" 40 Stanford, in turn, established an endowed chair in her honor, the Mary Hewitt Loveless, M.D., Professorship in the School of Medicine, a title held by Stephen J. Galli (AAI '80) since it was first awarded in 1999. Bryan D. Peery, Ph.D., AAI Assistant Historian John S. Emrich, Ph.D., 35 Quoted in ibid., 1252. 36 Ibid., 1252-54. 37 Lawrence M.

Emrich, Ph.D. By the early 1960s, the pace of advances in the field of immunology presented great challenges for researchers to keep abreast of the breakthroughs in the field. Few universities or medical schools offered courses in immunology, and even at those institutions offering courses, other faculty generally found them inaccessible, given their own teaching schedules. Moving to address the challenge, the 1964-65 AAI Council resolved \"to provide a brief intensive advanced course in Immunology for University Staff to encourage high standards of research and teaching in Immunology.\" Two years in the planning, the first course succeeded in setting the standard for short-course immunology education, a standard that remains intact to this day. The first AAI Summer Course in Immunology commenced on Monday, July 25, 1966, at Lake Forest College, a small liberal arts college 30 miles north of Chicago on the banks of Lake Michigan. Over the next 13 days, 57 attendees listened to lectures by 18 eminent immunologists covering 12 \"basic immunology\" topics. The co-directors, Dan the course into the still-familiar format: selected topics taught by specialists in each field. The faculty for the first course included Frank J. Dixon (AAI '50, H. Waksman (AAI '50, president1970-71). Most days featured a morning and afternoon session, eachdedicated to a particular topic, although organizers scheduled a fewdays with only one session to enable students to continue discussions with senior investigators \"in an informal workshop type environment.\" The following topics were covered at the first course: Antibodies: nature, structure, synthesis; Antigen-antibody Immunology; and Tumor immunology Although founded primarily for university instructors and investigators with M.D.s and Ph.D.s who did not have access to immunological training, the AAI Summer Courses in Immunology have evolved over the subsequent 48 years to address the needs of the broader immunology enterprise. Attendees today hail from the United States and abroad and from industry as well as academia. Students new to the discipline or those seeking more information to complement general biology or science training attend the AAI Introductory Course in Immunology. The Advanced Course is directed toward advanced trainees and scientists who wish to expand or update their understanding of the field. Both courses offer intensive six-day instruction by world-renowned immunologists. In 2015, the Introductory Immunology Course will be located in Long Beach, California, and the Advanced Immunology Course will take place in Boston, Massachusetts.

The city is known worldwide for its revelry and rich culture\u2014the pentimento for the various flags that have flown over her since the French first began colonizing the region in the late seventeenth century. In the early nineteenth century, the city became the third largest city in the United States and one of the wealthiest because its bustling port at the mouth of the Mississippi River was the intersection of trade between the nation's interior and the Caribbean, South America, Europe, and beyond. Here, we highlight diseases and institutions that have shaped the medical, public health, and social history of the state. Diseases Louisiana, because of its subtropical climate and home, near the mouth of the \"Mighty Mississippi,\" to the premier southeastern port in the United States, has been the site of many lethal and chronic communicable diseases, including yellow fever, malaria, hookworm, Hansen's disease, and bubonic plague. The presence of these diseases has channeled the current of biomedical research in the state. Epidemics and Outbreaks Yellow Fever. An acute infection caused by an RNA virus spread, primarily by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito, yellow fever was one of Louisiana's deadliest diseases before the early twentieth century. The mosquitoes carrying the disease typically hitchhiked to Louisiana aboard trading ships from their native Caribbean habitat. Mortality rates climbed as high as 60 percent during some epidemics, and in the New Orleans region, the disease was responsible for more than 41,000 deaths between 1817 and 1905. 1 An epidemic in 1878 began in the port of New Orleans and spread up the Mississippi River to the American Midwest, infecting more than 110,000 and killing at least 20,000. 2 An occurrence in 1905 marked the last yellow fever epidemic in the United States. By this time, the transmission cycle was understood, and public health campaigns, including mosquito prevention and eradication, limited spread of the disease before the first successful vaccine was developed in the 1930s. Bubonic Plague. In late June 1914, a bubonic plague outbreak in New Orleans was caused by rats from a cargo ship at the New Orleans Stuyvesant Docks. 3 In August, at the height of the outbreak, cases were reported at a rate of one every three days. A coordinated response by health officials, led by the U.S. Public Health Service, suppressed the outbreak by year's end through a combination of medical intervention and rat-reduction programs, which included \"rat-proofing,\" or destroying, hundreds of buildings AAI LOOKS BACK 1.

The 1914-1915 outbreak resulted in 31 reported cases, of which 10 were fatal. New Orleans continued to have infections until the city was declared free of the disease in the late 1920s. 4 Endemic Diseases Malaria. Although malaria never reached epidemic levels, it was a constant presence in the state, with a peak rate of 57 cases per 100,000 in 1944. 5 In 1947, the National Malaria Eradication Program began in the United States, focusing on 13 southeastern states. The program successfully eradicated the disease in the United States in 1951 through the reduction of mosquito-breeding sites and the application of insecticides. 6 An important breakthrough in malaria research was made at Tulane University School of Medicine in 1911, when Charles C. Bass (AAI '16) successfully cultivated plasmodia in vitro, using human blood. 7 Bass's technique allowed other researchers to better understand and devise new treatments for the disease. Hookworm Infections. Bass was also responsible for calling attention to the impact of hookworm infections in Louisiana, especially in rural children with continuous infection. He recognized growth and developmental problems resulting from the infected children's loss of iron and protein. 8 Through a series of studies in 1910 at Tulane, Bass, who was previously a country doctor, determined that the high rate of infection in rural communities was attributable to the geology of central and northern Louisiana, specifically the sandy soil; poor access to privies; and the \"habit among children...of going barefoot.\" 9 That same year, a Rockefeller Foundation report found that nearly 40 percent of the population in the South was infected with hookworms, validating Bass's assertions. Within a few years, a public health and education campaign eliminated these occurrences. 10 Hansen's Disease (Leprosy). This disease was well established in Louisiana, particularly in southern Louisiana. By the late 1880s, high incidence rates (4.5/100,000) in the state, especially in South \"French\" Louisiana, led to the creation of the Louisiana Leper Home in Carville to treat patients and research the disease. Infection rates continued to rise until the late 1920s (12/100,000), with the highest rates still observed in French Louisiana. Antibiotic treatments beginning in the 1940s successfully brought incidence in the state to near zero by the 1970s. 11 4.

The Daughters of Charity, a society of apostolic life for women within the Catholic Church, was founded in the seventeenth century with vows of charity, poverty, obedience, and service to the poor. The state was financially responsible for the infrastructure and supplies, and the sisters, who attended to the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of the community, received a very modest clothing stipend in lieu of a salary. When the sisters arrived at Carville, the resident physician had left\u2014one would not return until National Leprosarium was founded\u2014and because of budget constraints, a weekly doctor visit to Carville had to suffice. The Daughters of Charity officially ended its mission at Carville in 2006.

The original, official name of the institution was United States Marine Hospital Number 66, the National Leprosarium of the United States. In 1917, a federal bill was signed into law \"to provide for the care and treatment for those suffering\" from Hansen's disease and prevent the spread of the disease. In 1920, the Louisiana Leper Home was selected for the new federal institution.Institutions Research institutions and medical schools in Louisiana were founded to address the public's vulnerability to a rare confluence of public health threats. Here, we highlight six of the oldest institutions. All have contributed to the growth of immunology research in the state. Hospitals and Public Health Institutions Recognizing the need for a public hospital in New Orleans to serve the poor, a French ship builder residing in the city bequeathed money for what would become the city's venerable Charity Hospital. The hospital was founded on May 10, 1739, and operated constantly until 2005, when Hurricane Katrina forced its closure. At that time, Charity Hospital was the second-oldest, continuously operating public hospital in the United States. 1 Charity also served as a teaching hospital for Tulane University and Louisiana State University (LSU) medical schools, where many AAI members held appointments. The United States Marine Hospital [later named the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) Hospital] in New Orleans was founded in 1801, three years after the creation of the U.S. Marine Hospital Service. The initial mission of these entities was to provide medical care to ill and disabled seamen, including those in the U.S. Merchant Marine and U.S. Coast Guard. The mission of the hospital and officers quickly expanded to assist the city as a leader in clinical research and public health, leading campaigns to control epidemics and outbreaks, especially for yellow fever and bubonic plague. The hospital was closed in 1981, following severe cuts in federal funding. 2 The state opened the Louisiana Leper Home in Carville in 1894 and two years later, entered into a contract with the Daughters of Charity of St. Joseph, located in Emmitsburg, Maryland, to care for and treat its patients. 3 In 1921, the USPHS took operational control of the institution and established it as the National Leprosarium, in accordance with a 1917 federal law mandating the founding of a hospital for leprosy patients. 4 In addition to treating patients, the facility was updated to become a center for research into Hansen's disease (leprosy) transmission and treatment.

The Flexner Report brought national attention and scrutiny to the fact that few standards for admission and graduation existed for American medical schools. Shortly after the release of the report, medical schools were forced to raise their standards. Graduates of those schools that failed to conform to the new American Medical Association rating system, motivated by the Flexner Report, were denied medical licenses.the efficacy of sulfa drugs (1940s)5 and pioneered the use of Rifampin (1970s)6 in treating the disease. They also developed the first animal model using armadillos (1971)7 for studying the disease. In 1998, the National Hansen's Disease Program was relocated to Baton Rouge, although patients were allowed to choose whether to remain at Carville, receive a lifetime medical stipend, or relocate with the program. The Ochsner Clinic was opened in New Orleans in 1942, organized by Alton Ochsner and four other professors from Tulane. The clinic was modeled after the Mayo and Lahey Clinics, where specialists from different disciplines collaborated to diagnose and treat serious medical problems, while also emphasizing physician education. The Ochsner was the first of its kind in the South and enjoyed such rapid success that it was expanded to include a hospital, research facilities, and academic programs. The Ochsner Medical Center remains a cutting-edge clinical and research facility that garners international acclaim. 8 Medical Schools Two of the state's oldest medical schools are located in New Orleans. Tulane University School of Medicine was founded in 1834 as the Medical College of Louisiana, with the purpose of leading \"the advancement of science and the rational treatment of disease.\" Tulane issued Louisiana's first medical degree in 1835 and was one of two southern institutions identified as \"excellently situated in respect to medical education\" by the Flexner Report in 1910. 9 LSU School of Medicine was established and opened for classes in 1931. It has expanded over the years and still includes its original building next to Charity Hospital. As the preeminent private and public medical schools in New Orleans, Tulane and LSU have been leaders in clinical and basic research for more than one-half of a century. Today, Tulane, LSU, and Ochsner are joined by Tulane National Primate Research Center, LSU Shreveport, Southeastern Louisiana University, and other smaller research institutions contributing to growth of immunology research in Louisiana. n John S.

Among the scientists who arrived in the late 1940s and 1950s were several distinguished members of the American Association of Immunologists (AAI), including Jonas Salk (AAI '47), (AAI '65). We chronicle below the achievements of these and other leading immunologists and their roles in shaping the history of immunology in Pittsburgh. Early Medical Research in Pittsburgh The discovery of large coal veins in 1833 brought rapid industrialization to Pittsburgh. The transformation of Pittsburgh from a small frontier city to an industrial center was accelerated by the mass production of steel and the heightened demand for that product during the American Civil War. The city's prominence in higher education and medicine, however, experienced a slower emergence. Western University of Pittsburgh was incorporated in 1813 1 but lacked a sizable enrollment until the turn of the twentieth century. It was not until 1853, following a decade that witnessed endemic typhoid and tuberculosis, as well as multiple outbreaks of smallpox and cholera, that the first chartered public hospital, Western Pennsylvania Hospital, opened its doors. 2 A group of local physicians chartered the first medical school in 1883, and construction began after 250 shares of stock were sold for $100 each. 3 Western Pennsylvania Medical College opened its doors to the first class in 1886. Initially, the college was completely autonomous, but in 1892, it entered into a formal relationship with Western University, officially becoming the Medical Department of Western University, although it was the stockholders, not the university, who had ownership and authority over the department. Western University underwent dramatic changes in 1908 to raise both the standards and prominence of the school. A new name\u2014the University of Pittsburgh\u2014was adopted, the campus was relocated from its site in Pittsburgh's North Side section to the Oakland area of the city; and the university formally acquired the medical college. With full control of what was now the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, the administration of Pitt hired a new chancellor, Samuel McCormick, who, modeling the institution on the top medical schools in the country, began recruiting accomplished researchers for faculty positions and raising the standards for enrollment and graduation. Facilities and opportunities for clinical research followed, as a new medical school building was opened in 1911, and formal relationships were forged with St. Francis and Mercy hospitals in 1912. The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine was not the only medical research institution in the city in these years. The William H. Singer Memorial Research Laboratory was founded at Allegheny General Hospital in 1914 as a research laboratory dedicated to the study of medical and surgical problems. Its staff included Oscar M. Teague (AAI '20), a noted bacteriologist and the first active AAI member in Pittsburgh,4 as well as other researchers, who, although not AAI members, published early articles in The Journal of Immunology (The JI ).5 Western Pennsylvania Hospital also attracted talented immunologists AAI LOOKS BACK The Emergence of Immunology in Pittsburgh by Bryan Peery and John Emrich With IMMUNOLOGY 2014 taking place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, May 2-6, AAI salutes the current prominence of this city in biomedical research and reflects on the individuals and events contributing to its emergence as an international center for immunology.

Bronfenbrenner (AAI '20, president 1942-46) was director of research and diagnostic laboratories at Western Penn from 1913 to 1917, and Arthur P.Locke (AAI '26) and Ralph R. Mellon (AAI '22) were researchers in the laboratories from the 1930s until the 1950s. The stature of the medical research in Pittsburgh steadily increased from the 1910s through the mid-1940s, but a series of events\u2014the First World War, the Great Depression, and the Second World War\u2014delayed more rapid progress until the end of the 1940s. Post-War Pittsburgh Renaissance Turning the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine into a first-rate research institution had been William S. McEllroy's aspiration since his election as dean by the medical school faculty in 1938. 6 Born into an affluent Pittsburgh family, McEllroy had personal connections to Pittsburgh's private donors who might turn his dream into a reality. Resources and focus for McEllroy's plan were soon diverted to the U.S. war effort following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. With the war's end in 1945, however, McEllroy and Pitt benefitted from the financing and enthusiasm of industrialists and philanthropists united in efforts to usher in \"the Pittsburgh Renaissance.\" Their plan for revitalizing the city included drastically improving public health. McEllroy encouraged the university chancellor to use a portion of the new endowment to fund a university-wide interdisciplinary research program known as the Division of Research in the Natural Sciences. 7 Furthermore, in 1948, the Graduate School of Public Health was founded at Pitt with a $13.6 million endowment from the Andrew W. Mellon Education and Charitable Trust.8 McEllroy sought to make sure the medical and public health schools' interests were closely aligned. He found an ally in the dean of the new public health program, former U.S. Surgeon General Thomas Parran, Jr.,9 who argued that the success of the Graduate School of Public Health would depend on the School of Medicine's receiving the investment necessary to become a top-flight institution.10 With financial backing and the new Division of Research serving as an indicator of the direction in which Pitt was heading, McEllroy began recruiting researchers from around the country. Convincing established scientists to tie their fates to the nascent program proved difficult because the The Emergence of Immunology in Pittsburgh by Bryan Peery and John Emrich With IMMUNOLOGY 2014 taking place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, May 2-6, AAI salutes the current prominence of this city in biomedical research and reflects on the individuals and events contributing to its emergence as an international center for immunology .appointments lacked status. Younger scientists, however, could be attracted by the promise of independence and a unique opportunity to expedite their advancement through the academic ranks. 11 One researcher who was looking for just such an opportunity was Jonas Salk. Jonas Salk and Polio Research at Pitt After the war, McEllroy, recognizing virology as a young but promising field that might soon put Pitt on the map, began fundraising for virus research. In 1946, he secured funds from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) to start a Virus Research Laboratory. 12 His search for a director of the new laboratory led him to an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, Jonas E. Salk. Although Salks's credentials were respectable, he was hardly a luminary in 1947, and there was little to indicate that he would become the legend that he is today.13 The eldest son of working-class Russian immigrants, Salk grew up in the Bronx, New York, and attended City College of New York during the Great Depression before earning his M.D. from the New York University (NYU) College of Medicine in 1939. At NYU, he studied under William H. Park (AAI '16, president 1918-19) and Thomas Francis, Jr. (AAI '30, president 1949-50), who Jonas Salk and Julius S.

The previous year, Francis had become chair of the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health and director of the Influenza Commission of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board. Francis brought Salk to Michigan, helping Salk secure both a National Research Council Fellowship and a draft deferment. 15 After five years under Francis, Salk grew restless, desiring a promotion and more independence. He and Francis had a cordial relationship, but Francis could offer only an assistant professorship. When McEllroy promised to make Salk an associate professor and head of the Virus Research Laboratory at Pitt in 1947, he immediately accepted the offer.16 At the time of Salk's arrival in Pittsburgh, the medical school's transition to major research institution was far from complete. Salk soon realized that it fell upon him to be an impetus for change. He later recalled the shock of learning that most of his colleagues \"were part-time instructors who earned their living in private practice and had neither the time nor inclination for basic research.\" 17 He would have to build his laboratory from the ground up\u2014literally. Starting with two rooms and a technician in the basement of Municipal Hospital, he waged what one colleague recalled as \"a kind of guerilla war\" for space and funding. 18 He continued his investigations into influenza virus but increasingly turned to poliomyelitis virus, at least in part because he knew this research would attract funding. 19 When NFIP approached him in late 1947 about doing the tedious technical work of typing poliovirus, Salk readily agreed to do what senior researchers had shunned. In return, he received large research grants, beginning in 1948, to help him build his laboratory. 20 By 1949, his laboratory and offices had expanded to two floors in Municipal Hospital, he had been promoted to full professor, and he was hiring his own research faculty. One of the scientists whom he brought into his laboratory was Julius S. Youngner (AAI '50) from the University of Michigan, who, as a senior assistant research scientist at the National Cancer Institute, had specialized in cell culture techniques. Youngner would remain an active member of the Pitt faculty for the next 50 years. By 1951, Salk's laboratory had completed its typing project, concluding that there were three distinct types of poliovirus. The lab shifted its ef forts to producing a vaccine. Based on the success that his mentor Francis had had with a killed-virus flu vaccine, Salk chose to pursue a killed-poliovirus vaccine over the attenuated-virus vaccine that the majority of other scientists, including his rivals Albert B.Sabin (AAI '46) and Hilary Koprowski (AAI '46), preferred. Even within the small community of researchers at Pitt, Salk had competition. In 1950, Parran recruited William McDowall Hammon (AAI '46) to chair the Department of Epidemiology and Microbiology at the Graduate School of Public Health. Unlike Salk, who had no experience with polio research when he was hired to head the Virus Research Laboratory, Hammon had already established himself in the field when Parran convinced him to leave his position as dean of the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, for Pittsburgh. Wary of both killed-virus and attenuated-virus vaccines, Hammon preferred passive immunization through gamma-globulin injections containing polio-resistant antibodies. He conceded that passive immunization would not prevent infection, but he argued that it could prevent the worst symptom of infection\u2014paralysis. NFIP-funded, double-blind trials involving more than 50,000 children in 1951 and 1952 yielded compelling evidence that passive immunization was a major step in the war against Jonas Salk inoculating a young girl History of Medicine Division, National Library of Medicine William M.

Unfortunately, as Hammon himself pointed out, the immunity produced was only temporary, and the gamma-globulin was in short supply. 21 Meanwhile, Hammon's passive immunization approach was eclipsed by Salk's March 1953 announcement of the successful completion of the first human trials of his group's killed-virus vaccine. 22 The national field trial, which involved more than 1.8 million children and was overseen by Thomas Francis, commenced in June 1954, and, on April 12, 1955, Francis pronounced the vaccine safe and effective. 23 Salk instantly became a celebrity scientist, receiving a Presidential Citation and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1955 and the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award the following year. Although Salk left Pitt to head the Salk Institute in 1963, his accomplishments of the 1950s cemented Pitt's reputation as a major research center for medical sciences. Frank Dixon and the \"Pittsburgh Five\" In addition to attracting national attention through his own laboratory studies, Salk's administrative work helped contribute to the effort to transform Pitt into a major research institution. As the head of the search committee for a chair of the Department of Pathology in the medical school in 1951, Salk selected a scientist who shared several key characteristics with him: Frank J. Dixon was young, ambitious, and not yet well-known. 24 Dixon had grown up in St. Paul, Minnesota, and had attended the University of Minnesota, where he earned his M.D. in 1942 before entering the medical corps of the U.S. Marine Corps and serving in the Pacific Theater. Upon hisreturn to the United States in 1946, Dixon became a research assistant in the Department of Pathology at Harvard. He moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1948, where he was an instructor in the Department ofPathology at Washington University for two years before being promoted to assistant professor in 1950. The following year, Salk and his search committee offered a full professorship and the chair of the Department of Pathology to Dixon, who, at age 31, became the youngest department head at Pitt.25 As a research assistant at Harvard in 1946, Dixon had developed a new technique for labeling and tracking the location of proteins in the body using radioactive iodine.26 At Pitt, he used this procedure to study serum sickness and soon discovered that the host' s antibody immune response to foreign proteins in the injected serum caused deposition of immune complexes in tissues that led to tissue destruction.27 From these results, Dixon made a novel and important conclusion\u2014the body's immune response could have deleterious effects on the health of the host. Dixon's careful methodology in the study of serum sickness and kidney disease served as a paradigm for immune complex- mediated disease pathogenesis and established the field of immunopathology, a discipline critical to the understanding of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. In his second year at Pitt, Dixon received the Theobald Smith Award of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, an honor bestowed upon the most outstanding medical researcher under the age of 35.

He brought in young scientists as fellows and assistant professors and allowed them to devote themselves to laboratory research by hiring part-time faculty to take care of many of the teaching and clinical responsibilities. 28 Dixon believed that enthusiasm for research was contagious, explaining, \"Nothing is more valuable than for a student to sit down and talk to a young researcher, six or seven years his senior, and feel the excitement that comes from scientific inquiry.\" 29 One instance in which Dixon's teaching philosophy bore fruit was in the case of William O. Weigle (AAI '57), a laboratory technician from a working-class family, whom Dixon encouraged to pursue a Ph.D. at Pitt. 30 In 1960, Dixon received an offer from Edmund Keeney, director of the then relatively unknown Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, California, to establish a Division of Experimental Pathology. As long as Dixon could secure outside funding, he and his researchers would be free of administrative and teaching responsibilities and devote themselves to full-time research. Dixon, Weigle, Charles G. Cochrane (AAI '59)\u2014known as the \"Pittsburgh Five\"\u2014left Pitt for the Scripps Clinic in 1961, taking with them six post-docs and several members of the support staff. 31 Together, they laid the foundation for the world-renowned Scripps Research Institute. Dixon's pioneering achievements in immunopathology were formally recognized when he was awarded the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1969 and the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award in 1975. F.Sargent Cheever When William McEllroy retired in 1958, he was succeeded as dean of the School of Medicine by Francis Sargent Cheever. A fourth-generation Boston physician, Cheever attended the prestigious Groton School and received both his B.A. and M.D. from Harvard University. 32 Following a two-year medical internship at Presbyterian Hospital in New York, he returned to Harvard in 1939 as a research fellow in bacteriology, rising to the rank of assistant professor by 1946. In 1950, acceding to an invitation from his Harvard classmate William Hammon to join him at Pitt, Cheever became a professor of epidemiology and microbiology in the Graduate School of Public Health. 33 Shortly after arriving at Pitt, Cheever sought a second appointment in the Department of Bacteriology in the School of Medicine. Eager to add another first-rate researcher to the medical school faculty and to further the relationship between the medical and public health schools, McEllroy made Cheever a lecturer in the Department of Bacteriology in 1951. Cheever was well-liked by his colleagues in both schools, and his patrician background allowed him to run in the same social circles as wealthy Pittsburgh donors who soon looked to Cheever as a spokesman for the university. These qualities led Parran to encourage Cheever to prepare for a role in administration, so when McEllroy announced in January 1958 that he would retire at the end of the term, Cheever was a natural choice as his successor. 34 Cheever excelled in the position and oversaw the expansion of the medical school during his 11-year tenure. The highlight of these years was the formal integration of the medical and public health schools with several Pittsburgh hospitals into the University Health Center [now the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)]. From 1970 to 1974, Cheever served as president of the new medical center. Niels Jerne As dean of the School of Medicine, Cheever succeeded in attracting stellar faculty to Pitt, including Niels K. Jerne, who became chair of the Department of Microbiology in the School of Medicine in 1962. Jerne had already established himself as a preeminent immunologist at the time of his arrival. He had been a researcher at the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen for 10 years before joining Max Delbr\u00fcck's laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in 1954, where he published 28 Paull, A Century of Medical Excellence, 180; Oldstone, \"Frank James Dixon, 1920-2008,\" 5. 29 Dixon quoted in Paull, A Century of Medical Excellence, 181. 30 Oldstone, \"Frank Pittsburgh Five,\" Pitt Med, Fall 2012, 39, http://pittmed.health.pitt.edu/ Fall_2012/alumni.pdf. 32 \"Pitt Names New Dean of Medicine,\" Press Release, January 30, 1958, Documenting Pitt, University of Pittsburgh, http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?c=pitt pressreleases;view=toc;idno=pittpressreleases19580018. 33 Paull, A Century of Medical Excellence, 208; \"Cheever, Francis Sargent,\" American Men and Women of Science, 14th ed.

Jerne next headed the Biological Standards and Immunology sections of the World Health Organization in Geneva from 1956 to 1962, but, wishing to return to academic life and his immunological research, he seized the opportunity to chair the Department of Microbiology at Pitt when it arose in 1962. The change of venues paid immediate dividends. Jerne, regarded as one of immunology's greatest theorists, returned to the laboratory and made an important technical innovation. With Albert A. Nordin (AAI '72), a post-doc at Pitt, he developed the plaque-forming cell assay\u2014often called the Jerne plaque assay\u2014 which advanced the study of immunology at the cellular level by allowing researchers to see and enumerate antibody-producing cells in an agar plate.36 Jerne left Pittsburgh in 1966, succeeded at Pitt by Julius Youngner, who chaired the Department of Microbiology from 1966 to 1989. Jerne returned to Europe and directed the Paul Ehrlich Institute before becoming the founding director of the Basel Institute for Immunology in 1969. In recognition of his major contributions to the field of immunology, he was awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. New Directions: 1980s-Present Neither the growth of the medical sciences at Pitt nor the role of AAI members in advancing it ended in the 1960s. Donald N. Medearis (AAI '65) succeeded Cheever as dean of the medical school, serving from 1969 to 1974. One of his most significant acts as dean was recruiting Thomas Detre to head the Department of Psychiatry in 1974. 37 As senior vice chancellor of the health sciences from 1984 to 1998, Detre left a lasting legacy on UPMC. He oversaw the transformation of UPMC into a research hub of international renown by establishing several research institutes, including the Pittsburgh Transplantation Institute (renamed the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute in 1996) and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) in 1985.38 Under the direction of Ronald B. Herberman (AAI '69), UPCI was designated a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute, five years after its establishment, making it the youngest center to receive such a distinction. 39 Moreover, it was at UPCI that immunology began to emerge as one of the more significant areas of basic research at Pitt in the late 1980s. By 1997, the interdepartmental Graduate Program in Immunology had received accreditation and was authorized to award Ph.D. degrees.40 In January 2002, the School of Medicine established the Department of Immunology and appointed Olivera J. Finn (AAI '83, president 2007-2008) its founding chair. 41 Although there is now a permanent home for the study of immunology at Pitt, studies in the field and AAI members remain ensconced in several departments and institutes across the university. Since 1997, Charles R. Rinaldo, Jr. (AAI '78), has served as chair of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology in the Graduate School of Public Health, the position once held by William Hammon. Recognizing parallels between the mid-century work on polio carried out by his predecessors at Pitt and his own research on HIV and AIDS, Rinaldo declared in a 2004 interview, \"I look to history to help me look to the future.\"42 Salk, Dixon, Cheever, Jerne, and the many other AAI members who have called Pittsburgh home helped to establish the city as a major center for immunological research. In turn, Pittsburgh has contributed much to AAI. Five past presidents and one current councillor, Joanne L. Flynn (AAI '96, councillor 2013-present), have spent at least some of their professional years in Pittsburgh. Beginning with Arthur Locke, who became an associate editor of The JI in 1936, Pittsburgh immunologists have worked to ensure that The JI remains the preeminent journal in the field, most notably Joseph Feldman, who served as editor-in-chief from 1971 to 1987. Together, these immunologists have left behind an enduring legacy that continues to inform the work of immunologists the world over. Bryan D.

The exhibit featured many of the institutions, members, and external forces that have helped shape the eld in the nation's capital. FEATURE Institutions At the beginning of the 20th century, immunology research institutions in the Washington, DC, area were overwhelmingly government laboratories, including the Walter Reed General Hospital, U.S. Army Medical School [now Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR)], and the U.S. Public Health Service Hygienic Laboratory\u2014now the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Today the region is home to world-renowned public and private research institutions, an expanding biotechnology corridor, and a growing number of scientic societies, foundations, and other non-prots. The IMMUNOLOGY 2017 exhibit explored the region's immunology-related institutions through a brief history of the NIH, mapping of AAI member institutions, and a spotlight on the area's biotech industry and diverse non-prot community.USPHS Hygienic Laboratory, ca. 1920s National Library of Medicine Aerial view of the Clinical Center, NIH, 2014 NIH 82 AAI History Compendium (2021)AAI Annual Meetings Washington, DC, has been home to the AAI annual meeting 10 times. The city was host to the second annual meeting, which took place on May 10, 1915, at the Willard Hotel, and featured a program of 19 original scientic papers. The recently completed IMMUNOLOGY 2017 meeting stretched over ve days at the Washington Convention Center and included over 125 scientic sessions and three days of poster presentations. AAI Members AAI welcomed its rst Washington, DC, members in 1916, and witnessed membership growth throughout the metropolitan area over the next eight decades. The region has been a stronghold of AAI membership representing all career stages, from early-career trainees to established investigators and emeritus members. The strength and diversity of clinical and basic research in the area led some AAI members to make the region home for their entire careers. Of those, four have been AAI members for 50 or more years: Samuel B. Formal (Walter Reed Army Medical Center and WRAIR), Joseph A. Bellanti (Georgetown University Medical Center), Rose G. Mage (NIH), and Abner Louis Notkins (NIH). AAI members in the region have received some of the highest honors in the eld. They include a Nobel Laureate\u2014Baruj Benacerraf (NIAID)\u2014and eight Lasker Award recipients\u2014Anthony Freund (NIAID), Maurice R. Hilleman (WRAIR), Michael Potter (NCI), John B. Robbins (NICHD, FDA, and NIH), Albert B. Sabin (FIC), Rachel Schneerson (NICHD, FDA, and NIH), and Joseph E. Smadel (WRAIR and NIH). NIH Leadership The history of AAI members serving as NIH institute and center directors dates from the late nineteenth-century. The eleven past directors have included three at the Hygienic Laboratory, the rst director of the NIH, multiple directors of NIAID and NCI, and Ruth L. Kirschstein, who was the director of NIGMS and later the acting director of both the NIH and NCCIH. Today, three current NIH directors are AAI members: Anthony S. Fauci (NIAID), Richard Hodes (NIA), and Stephen I. Katz(NIAMS).External Forces As the center of the nation's government, Washington, DC, is also the hub of federal scientic funding and of social and political advocacy for research. The most important piece of biomedical funding is the NIH budget, which received its rst line item in the federal budget in 1938\u2014$464,000. The dramatic increase in the NIH budget following World War II marked a time of rapid expansion in the number of institutions carrying out basic and clinical immunology research as well as in the growth in AAI membership in the area. Although the NIH budget continued to increase throughout the twentieth century, including the doubling (1998-2003), the past decade has seen a degree of uncertainty in the funding landscape never before experienced by researchers. The city has been a focal point for many social movements. From Congressional hearings, to mailing of dimes to the White House for polio research to AIDS activism and creation of the iconic AIDS quilt to more recent rallies and protests supporting scientic funding and research, advocacy for research and patients has been a small but important movement that has taken place in the region. For over 100 years, the greater Washington, DC, area has been a primary contributor to AAI and the immunology community. Today, it is home to an increasingly diverse array of public and private immunology-related research institutions and non-prots, thousands of researchers, and leaders in the scientic community\u2014not to mention the headquarters of AAI and many other scientic societies. As the focal point of federal biomedical research, funding, policy, and activism, the nation's capital in 2017 offered AAI meeting attendees a vivid reminder of its unique and enduring relevance to our eld and to the future of scientic advancement.

A Brief History of Bovine Immunology in Texas Away from the large metropolitan areas of Texas, grazing herds of cattle have been such a xture that their visage has been an emblem of the 28th state for the past century. Since the mid-19th century, cattle ranching has been more than a way of life; it is an economic engine, producing beef, milk, and leather. As the cattle industry has made up a signicant segment of the state's economy for a century and a half, Texas has also been a leader in bovine immunological research. With IMMUNOLOGY 2018 in Austin, Texas, we take a look at this research through four important historical advances, beginning with \"Texas fever,\" a disease specic to the state that almost permanently ruined the industry, and concluding with a modern breakthrough in AIDS research using bovine models. Texas cattle industry In the 16th century, early Spanish explorers rst brought cattle to the area that is now Texas. Some of the livestock that were meant to sustain both the expeditions and permanent missions escaped and formed the basis for enormous wild herds that became Texas Longhorns. Until 1780, the market for beef from Texas was very limited because of Spanish restrictions on trade with French colonies. The United States annexed Texas in 1845, but it was not until the end of the Civil War that the age of the great cattle drives began with the Chisholm Trail, leading to the markets in Kansas. That legendary era only lasted approximately 20 years until the proliferation of barbed wire and the expansion of the railroad made the drives difcult and unnecessary. Today, Texas still leads the nation in cattle production, with over 12 million head at the beginning of 2018. 2 Because cattle ranching has always been vulnerable to disease, the understanding of how to prevent and cure infections has saved the industry on multiple occasions. Veterinary researchers and immunologists have been instrumental in investigating the causes of cattle diseases and developing methods to combat them. Theobald Smith and Texas fever (bovine babesiosis) Before the Civil War, southern cattle were often considered \"scrawny\" or lean compared with those in the north. 3 Once the cattle drives from Texas to the north began, the reason for this became clear, as northern cows started to fall ill after mingling with southern herds. Symptoms for affected cows included increased basal temperature, pulse, and respiration; loss of appetite; and in some cases, hemoglobinuria for a duration of eight to 10 days. 4 Mortality rates for northern cattle were as high as 90%, giving rise to legitimate fear of what soon became known as Texas fever. 5 States quickly outlawed Texas cattle drives across their borders and instituted quarantines against the Texas herds, jeopardizing the entire industry if a solution could not be found. Through years of observation, ranchers had long believed that ticks played an important role in the transmission of Texas fever. Map of the Chisholm Trail, a major Texas cattle drive, c. 1873 Livestock pest control poster, c. 1948 U.S. Department of Agriculture 84 AAI History Compendium (2021)Their homegrown theory, however, was dismissed for decades by researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as lacking \"the slightest foundation.\" 6 The rst researcher to give the tick theory serious credence was Theobald Smith (AAI '20), working on behalf of the USDA Bureau of Animal Industry. In 1899, Smith developed a simple experiment to test the tick vector theory of Texas fever transmission. First, he set up pens with healthy northern cattle, introduced tick-laden southern cows, and observed the northern cattle for signs of illness. Within four months, three quarters of the northern cattle had died of Texas fever. Smith then painstakingly removed all of the ticks from the southern cows and moved them to a tick-free pen with fresh northern cattle, and again observed the northerners for signs of illness. This time they were all asymptomatic. 7 The ranchers' theory was vindicated, and Smith had proven, for the rst time, that ticks could act as a disease vector. Smith published his ndings in 1893, and the same year, the Texas state legislature established the Livestock Sanitary Commission [renamed the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) in 1959] to ght Texas fever. 8 Smith continued his work on Texas fever and, in experiments over the next four years, he isolated and identied the pathogen that the ticks were carrying. He named this protozoan Pyrosoma bigeminum , but the genus is now Babesia, and either Babesia bovis or Babesia bigemina can cause the disease. 9 In addition, he identied mechanisms of immunity to the disease among northern and southern cattle populations. 10 This research suggested that vaccines could be possible, but Smith also developed a practice that was immediately effective: dipping cattle in chemical baths containing an arsenical solution to kill any attached ticks. A cow with no ticks cannot transmit Texas fever to other cows. Because cattle fever ticks are host specic, simply removing cattle from an area will cause the ticks there to starve. This strategy, combined with federally mandated dipping, reduced the tick population enough that most cattle quarantines could be lifted by 1916. 11 Although cattle fever ticks were considered eradicated in the United States by the 1960s, acaricide-resistant ticks from Mexico are currently re-emerging in South Texas. Brucellosis Once Texas fever was under control, another persistent problem began to vex the cattle industry: bovine brucellosis\u2014a highly contagious disease that can decimate a herd through spontaneous abortions and decreased milk production; cause weight loss, loss of young, and infertility; and spread lameness throughout American cattle herds. By the mid-1930s, it was estimated that the majority of herds had infection rates of 13-16%. 12 In addition, humans can also contract brucellosis from infected cattle. Called \"undulant fever\" in humans for the waves of temperature variation, cases of brucellosis in the United States went from only 46 in 1926 to 1,787 in 1934. 13 People most often caught brucellosis by drinking raw milk, a problem that Karl F . Meyer (AAI '22, president 1940-41) largely solved by 1931 by promoting diagnostic tests and pasteurization. In Texas, however, livestock workers were the primary victims through their close contact with infected cattle. 14 Bovine brucellosis proved difcult to combat effectively: in the 1930s and 1940s, arsenical and mercurial drugs were tried, as well as therapeutic vaccines, but they produced very limited success. 15 Dozens of articles on aspects of Brucella appeared in The Journal of Immunology at this time. Although Texas began a calf-vaccination program in 1959, compliance rates remained low as the vaccine sensitized the calves to the standard serum agglutination test. 16 In 1980, the TAHC instituted new standards developed by the USDA, and just 10 years ago, Texas was nally declared free of bovine brucellosis. 17 Anthrax The soil of the southwestern Texas plains is not fertile ground for many crops, but it does produce one unwanted harvest: anthrax spores. In the 1950s and '60s, bone-meal production, a process in which bones of cattle that had died from anthrax were ground and spread in the low-acid soil of pastures as a feed component, unwittingly seeded the soil with the spores, creating a new and extended problem for the cattle industry. 18 Theobald Smith Library of Congress Dipping steers to remove ticks Cattle Raisers Museum www.aai.org 85Unlike the bacteria that cause Texas fever and brucellosis, Bacillus anthracis is a remarkably tenacious organism, able to survive for decades in spore form. Typically, the spores are buried at a safe depth, but a wet spring\u2014followed by a dry summer\u2014sets the stage for their emergence after the drought breaks. 19 As there is no way to eradicate B. anthracis from the environment, the disease must be managed through vaccination or culling. Robert Koch identied the bacterium in 1876, and Louis Pasteur subsequently developed an anthrax vaccine in 1881. In 1935, Max Sterne isolated an avirulent strain of B. anthracis and produced an effective, attenuated vaccine with it that is still in use today. Most cattle, however, will not be exposed to anthrax spores, so the culling of infected animals has been a more economical option. One of the rst AAI members in Texas, Kenneth L. Burdon (AAI '36), founding chair of microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine, spent much of his career researching spore-producing bacteria and developed methods of differentiating B. anthracis from other species in the genus. Accurate diagnosis in both human and cow from only clinical signs is very difcult, so Burdon's criteria have been important in effectively identifying infection. Human immunology and HIV Texas cattle have recently proven to be allies in human immunology research, including the ght against HIV . In 2013, as part of a widespread team of researchers, Waithaka Mwangi (AAI '02) and Michael Criscitiello (AAI '01) at the Texas A&M University College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, found that bovine antibodies possess unique structures of exceptionally long complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) that form \"stalk\" and \"knob\" domains. 20 The knob on the long CDR H3 turned out to be almost completely responsible for binding to viruses, leading researchers to wonder whether any of the structures they target exist on human pathogens. 21 They did not have to wonder long. A new study, also involving Mwangi and Criscitiello, has now elicited broadly FEATURE Bacillus anthracis Centers for Disease Control andPrevention 86 AAI History Compendium (2021)1. John L.

These antibodies, which are capable of neutralizing multiple HIV strains, can be produced in cows much faster than is currently possible in human experimentation. The cows at A&M received immunizations with a protein that antigenically mimics the HIV envelope glycoprotein, rapidly eliciting broad and potent serum antibody responses. 22 Ten to twenty percent of people with HIV also produce bNAbs, but typically only after two years of infection and not at a rate sufcient to produce therapeutics. 23 The cow study showed 96% neutralization breadth in only 381 days. Cows may have evolved the ability to produce bNAbs so quickly as a result of their complex digestive tracts: the resident bacteria necessary to break down tough grasses pose an infection risk if they escape the gut, so a versatile mechanism to produce antibodies would be benecial to them. The antibodies that the cows produce have promise to work in humans\u2014\"with a few tweaks,\" according to Criscitiello. 24 This study may also have potential as a model for production of antibodies for other human diseases. Although the cattle industry in Texas today is almost unrecognizable from its 19th-century roots, many of the challenges of keeping cows healthy remain the same. At many institutions across the state, immunologists continue to perform important research that expands knowledge of both bovine and human immunity. More information about the history of immunology in Texas will be featured in a special exhibit at IMMUNOLOGY 2018 in Austin.

The seeds of this relationship were planted one year earlier at the second annual meeting of AAI in 1915, held at the Willard Hotel, in the nation's capital. Founding member and AAI Council President A. Parker Hitchens (AAI 1913) proposed to the council a resolution extending \"active membership, without the payment of dues\" to the directors and assistant directors of the laboratories at the Army Medical School, the Naval Medical School, and the Hygienic Laboratory of the PHS. 1 Hitchens himself had served in a variety of capacities in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and understood the importance of the governmental funding of medical research. By offering these memberships to scientists in these laboratories, AAI could forge important connections and reinforce the importance of a professional society for the growing field. In the context of World War I (1914-1918), this overture to military medical science was also a statement of patriotism and readiness to cooperate for the nation's good. 2 Hitchens' resolution was unanimously approved. This declaration made clear that these special memberships were to be associated with director-level positions\u2014not administrators\u2014from these laboratories, suggesting that it was meant to attract working scientists into AAI. During the election of new members at the 1916 annual meeting, no names were read for these new members; 3 only when the election was confirmed by the council did their names finally appear in the official record. 4 With the association only three years old in 1916, membership categories were still a bit fluid; no formalized membership criteria or categories existed. Just one year later, however, when the first AAI Constitution and Bylaws were enacted, honorary memberships were eliminated. Any honorary memberships prior to the new bylaws were converted to active ones; the idea of non-dues memberships was quietly abandoned. 5 Because of this, the only people to enjoy this benefit were Edward B. Vedder and Eugene R. Whitmore at the Army Medical School, Edward R. Stitt and Charles S. Butler at the Naval Medical School, and George W. McCoy and Arthur M. Stimson at the Hygienic Laboratory. Of these former honorary members, McCoy had the most significant involvement with AAI. Just two years after becoming a member, he was elected to the AAI Council and became the ninth AAI president in 1922. During his time as director of the Hygienic Laboratory, the scope of research there grew to encompass basic science, in addition to applied research. In his tenure with the federal George W. McCoy, AAI president 1922- 1923, was the director of the Hygienic Laboratory (pictured) and the National Institute of Health. 88 AAI History Compendium (2021)government, McCoy presided over the Hygienic Laboratory becoming the National Institute of Health and remained its director until 1937. In that same year, AAI declared McCoy a special honorary member. The dues ledger for McCoy indicates that he was never charged a membership fee throughout his lifelong affiliation with AAI. The other laboratory directors who had received honorary membership (before the 1917 bylaws) continued their research, even after leaving the posts that had provided them AAI membership. In addition to being the only honorary member to publish his work in The Journal of Immunology, Vedder remained in the Army in various research positions. His efforts gained wider recognition by demonstrating that beriberi was a deficiency disease, and in 1936 he first synthesized thiamine for its treatment. 6 After retiring from the Army in 1920, Whitmore taught at George Washington and Georgetown universities. 7 Stitt remained in the Navy, authored two foundational textbooks on bacteriology and tropical disease, served as President Woodrow Wilsons's attending physician after his stroke in 1919, and was promoted to surgeon general of the Navy in 1921. 8 Butler spent his career in the Navy, retiring in 1939.9 Stimson spent his entire career in the PHS (1902-1941), serving as the chief of the Division of Scientific Research from 1922-1930. 10 The three institutions that employed these scientists no longer exist as they had in 1915. The growth of government and military research had necessitated their expansion and relocation to the Maryland suburbs surrounding Washington, DC. After the Hygienic Laboratory became the National Institute of Health under McCoy, the institute relocated to its current Bethesda campus in 1938 and gradually expanded into the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of today. The Army Medical School underwent a few name changes before settling on its identity as the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and moved its headquarters to its current location in Silver Spring. The Naval Medical School, once located at the Old Naval Observatory in Washington, DC, moved to the new National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda in 1942. As part of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, on May 13, 2005, the Naval Medical Center became part of the larger Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, across the street from NIH. The scientists employed at these government research institutions have been an active and vital part of AAI since the first honorary memberships were bestowed on its early directors. Today, AAI has the honor of counting more than 220 members from their laboratories. The foresight that Hitchens displayed more than a century earlier laid the groundwork for a long and productive relationship, which has had a profound impact on the study and understanding of immunology. Attendees at IMMUNOLOGY 2017 will be able to view a special exhibit highlighting leading members and influential immunology institutions in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. The History Exhibit will be located on the 2nd floor of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center . 1. \"Minutes of Second Annual Meeting of the American Association of Immunologists,\" May 10, 1915, AAI Archive, Rockville, MD [her eafter, AAI Archive-Rockville]. 2.

There wasn't an official group that focused on supporting women immunologists, and addressing career issues unique to them, in the association's first 57 years. In 1970, the AAI Council approved the formation of a five-member Committee on Women's Status. The first committee was chaired by Helene C. Rauch, M.D., Stanford University (AAI '67), and included two other women, Justine S. Garvey, Ph.D., California Institute of Technology (AAI '56) and G. Jeanette Thorbecke, M.D., Ph.D., New York UniversitySchool of Medicine (AAI '61, president 1989-90). In 1974, the committee grew to eight members to become the Committee on the Status of Women and Minority Groups. In 1976, the committee was comprised entirely of women. In 1978, this committee split in two, becoming the Minority Affairs Committee (MAC) and CSOW. The mission of the CSOW was to enhance career opportunities and advance the involvement and recognition of women immunologists within the scientific community. In 1992, the CSOW created a forum for discussion about the challenges of being a woman in science by sponsoring its first symposium at the AAI annual meeting held in Anaheim, CA. This \"How Far Can Women Succeed in Science?\" symposium 1 featured three scientists: Susan Leeman, Ph.D., professor, Boston UniversitySchool of Medicine, Thoughts Concerning Women inScience Florence P . Haseltine, M.D., Ph.D., director ofpopulation research, National Institute of Child Healthand Human Development, NIH, P aying Attention to the Unwritten Rules Phyllis Moen, Ph.D., professor of human development/family studies and sociology, Cornell University,Women as a Human Resource in ScienceIn addition to the committee' s interest in career development for women in science, the CSOW has promoted scientific discussion about diseases affecting women. At the 1993 annual meeting in Denver, CO, the CSOW hosted United States Surgeon General M. Jocelyn Elders, M.D, for a keynote lecture on women's health issues. Elders' keynote was followed by a symposium entitled \"Modern Women, Modern Plagues: Looking Towards the 21st Century,\" which featured scientific talks of \"three diseases of particular importance to women,\" identified as systemic lupus erythematosus, heterosexual AIDS, and breast cancer. 2 The CSOW also highlighted these issues, as well as accomplishments of women immunologists, through a semi-regular feature in the AAI Newsletter, \"XX-IMMUNO-NOTES-XX.\" This feature, which premiered in the September 1993 issue and continued until 2003, sought to \"inform all scientists in our organization about the contributions and activities of female Immunologists.\" 3 In 2001, the CSOW conducted a survey examining the percentage of women faculty members within immunology departments or women in immunology graduate programs across 27 institutions in the United States, comparing it to the percentage of women receiving a Ph.D. The committee found that, although 48.1% of immunology graduate students in 2001 were women, they accounted for just 21.4% of immunology faculty members. 4 The CSOW published these findings in the August 2001 AAI Newsletter . A follow-up survey (reprinted on pages 30-33) was conducted in 2016 by the current committee to examine changes in gender equity FEATURE G. Jeanette Thorbecke AAI President, 1989-90 The committee found that, although 48.1% of immunology graduate students in 2001 were women, they accounted for just 21.4% of immunology faculty members. In 2016, the percentage of women in immunology faculty positions at these institutions had risen to 29.1% while the representation of women among immunology graduate students held relatively steady at 50.5%. 90 AAI History Compendium (2021)over the last 15 years across these same 27 immunology departments and programs. In brief, in 2016, the percentage of women in immunology faculty positions at these institutions had risen to 29.1% while the representation of women among immunology graduate students held relatively steady at 50.5%. 5 At IMMUNOLOGY 2003 in Denver, CO, the CSOW hosted a \"Careers Lunch,\" to \"provide an opportunity for aspiring scientists to meet in small groups with leading scientists from academia, industry, and government, to discuss career-related topics.\" 6 The \"Careers Lunch\" evolved into a co-hosted the AAI Education Committee) \"Careers in Science Roundtable\" , and has been a popular activity at the meeting ever since. This unique career session features a \"table leader\" expert in a certain topic who answers questions and discusses their topic with up to 8 table participants. Open to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, this annual event draws many early-career scientists who are interested in speaking with more experienced scientists on topics related to the work environment (academic research, biotech industry, governmental agencies, non-profits), the transitions from specific career stages, issues in balancing career and family in any career path, and more.Among its most recent career-development services, in 2013, the CSOW established the Career Advisory Board, which provides early-career scientists and senior postdoctoral fellows an opportunity to obtain guidance from more senior PIs having insight and experience with specific issues. 7 An online matching process will link the requester with an experienced scientist. Topics include recruiting, grant writing, building networks, balancing family and work, and more. The committee also works to enhance opportunities for women to be selected as speakers and/or chairs at professional meetings and seminar series, or to serve as reviewers, editors, board members, consultants, or in other professional capacities. The CSOW has compiled a Women AAI Member Speaker list of AAI women members who work in immunological research or fulfill leadership roles in non-research careers related to the field. These CSOW activities have helped to enhance the recognition of women scientists through symposia and presentations, career advice, and surveys assessing the status of women in the field. 1. \"Highlights of the 1992 AAI Special Symposium: How Far Can Women Succeed in Science?\" AAI Newsletter, Summer 1992, 8. 2. \"XX-IMMUNO-NOTES-XX: Introduction,\" AAI Newsletter, September 1993, 6. 3.

Indeed, with an inaugural issue published 18 months into WWI, papers in that rst year included research on war-related diseases. With the arrival of WWII, this trend continued more rapidly and in more far-reaching ways, in content and production. As timely and on point as The JI is today, the same held true yesterday, as well. WWI: Reshaping a Young AAI Although the United States stayed out of WWI until April 1917, the ghting had an impact on the formation of The JI and the shape of AAI, which had been founded only a few years earlier, in 1913. Of the latter, medical service in the military was important enough to AAI leadership that at the second annual meeting in 1915, well before American involvement in the war, AAI extended \"active memberships, without the payment of dues\" to the directors and assistant directors of the laboratories of the Army Medical School, the Navy Medical School, and the Hygienic Laboratory of the U.S. Public Health Service (renamed the National Institute of Health in 1930). 1 With regard to The JI, the founders envisioned it as an international journal, 2 but the state of world affairs precluded participation with subscribers, contributors, and editors from the countries of the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire). By March of 1917, The JI, with 439 subscribers, went to \"practically every foreign country,\" in Europe except the Central Powers countries. 3A month later, on April 6, 1917, the U.S. Congress issued a formal declaration of war and plunged the country into the Western Front in Europe. The AAI Council passed a resolution offering the \"services of trained bacteriologists and immunologists and the facilities of their respective laboratories\" to federal and state government. 4 Many AAI members, including future presidents and editors of The JI, responded to the call and enlisted in the U.S. Army Medical Reserve Corps (MRC). 5 So many volunteered that the 1919 annual meeting was very short on abstract submissions. AAI President William H. Park (AAI '16, president 1918-19) sent a letter to the membership, in which he asked that \"all who have had a chance to do experimental work, will feel it a duty to present a report of this at the annual meeting.\" 6 Nonetheless, only 16 abstracts were presented that year, down from 38 the year before. Answering the call of duty obviously had an impact on the structure of the AAI Council. When Council member Richard Weil died in the line of duty as a member of the MRC, 7 his seat was lled by George McCoy, who had been given membership as director of the Hygienic Laboratory of the Public Health Service. In 1918, the rst editor-in-chief of The JI , JI , 1916-48, secretary-treasurer 1918-45), was appointed both treasurer pro tem and secretary to replace Willard J. Stone (AAI '13, treasurer 1913-18) and Martin J. Synnott (AAI '13, secretary 1913-18), both of whom were serving in the MRC. 8 AAI LOOKS BACK 1.

Minutes of Council Meeting, January 31, 1918.The JI in a World at WarAs AAI and its members celebrate 100 years of The Journal of Immunology (The JI), we're continuing to examine events that had a profound impact on the journal. This article studies the influence that World Wars I and II (WWI/II) had on The JI in its rst three decades. World War I recruitment poster, 1917 Arthur N. Edrop, Library of Congress 92 AAI History Compendium (2021)Immunology on the Battleelds In his president's address, published in the September 1, 1918, issue of The JI, John A. Kolmer (AAI '13, president 1917-18) expressed optimism regarding how the science of immunology would affect the conduct of the war. 9 He predicted that \"a notable victory over the common enemy, disease, will be recorded as one of the greatest triumphs in this greatest of all conflicts\" through improvements in sanitation, immunization, and treatment. 10 Immunologists had made advances in combating many diseases that once plagued battleelds, including smallpox, typhoid, tetanus, diphtheria, and syphilis. Typhoid, in particular, was no longer the threat it had once been: as late as 1898, 85 percent of all U.S. deaths in the Spanish-American War were from typhoid, but with mandatory immunization against the disease for all U.S. troops in WWI, the disease claimed only 227 soldiers, one-quarter of one percent of all U.S. deaths in the war. 11 Kolmer's prediction was proven largely true, as WWI was the rst U.S. war in which the death rate from disease was lower than that from battle. 12 Kolmer also recognized major challenges that could be exacerbated by the war. Most pressing to him were the development of tests for immunity to pneumonia, tuberculosis, and meningococcal meningitis, along with immunizations against measles, anterior poliomyelitis, syphilis, and gonorrhea. 13 Tuberculosis and meningitis were among the top wartime killers of American soldiers, although pneumonia overshadowed these two by far, accounting for 83.6 percent of deaths from disease. 14 Of these 40,000 deaths from pneumonia, 25,000 were attributable to pandemic influenza, a development that Kolmer could not have predicted. Even before the pandemic of 1918-19, influenza had captured the interest of immunologists. The winter of 1915-16 had seen a sharp increase in the mortality rate from influenza, as an epidemic of the disease swept through most of the nation, killing thousands of people. 15 The mortality rate from influenza in 1916 was 26.4 per 100,000, the highest it had been since 1900. 16 During the pandemic, this ballooned to 400 per 100,000 among American soldiers in the United States in the second week of October 1918 alone. In response to these conditions, The JI, in the July 1919 issue, carried three articles focusing on influenza research. All three described experiments with Bacillus influenzae, or Pfeiffer's bacillus (now Haemophilus influenzae), then suspected to be the cause of influenza rather than an opportunistic pathogen. An article by F . M. Huntoon (AAI '18) and S. Hannum consideredboth the causal and opportunistic roles and alsoattempted to understand the relationships betweenthe various strains of influenza \"in order to account forthe epidemiological features of the pandemic.\" 17 The JI continued to publish research that sought to address the causes of the pandemic for years after.18 9.

Dewitt Welsh, Library of Congress Typhoid prophylaxis, World War I, c. 1917Images from the History of Medicine, National Library of Medicine www.aai.org 93Venereal Disease Another perennial health problem highlighted by the war was sexually transmitted infection. With over four million troops mobilized, the American armed forces needed to educate their personnel on the dangers of venereal disease, specically syphilis and gonorrhea. Pamphlets published for the War Department contended that because \"such diseases as small-pox, yellow fever and typhoid have been practically wiped out...the greatest menace to the country is venereal disease.\" 19 From 1916 to 1920, 17 articles on syphilis and various tests for the disease appeared within the pages of The JI. Kolmer was especially optimistic about the recent advances in the management of syphilis, as the older mercury-based treatments had largely been replaced with the rst chemotherapeutic drug, arsphenamine, also known by its trade name Salvarsan or \"compound 606.\" This arsenic-based medication was painful to the patient, required more than 18 months of treatment and at least 50 injections, bore unpleasant side effects (such as nausea and vomiting), and had to be stored in sealed vials of nitrogen\u2014but it worked. 20 Ikuzo Toyama and Kolmer published an article on their work to explain the mechanisms of both arsphenamine and the older treatment of mercuric chloride. They determined that both drugs worked by increasing antibody production in small doses, whereas massive doses would have the opposite effect. 21 Research on the treatment of syphilis and gonorrhea led to effective public health education campaigns, as was evidenced early on in research concerning the incidence of these diseases among members of the armed forces. Although venereal diseases were still the most frequentcause for soldiers to be out of commission, a study found that, of the 48,167 cases treated at ve army camps in the United States in the year ending May 21, 1919, 96 percent had been contracted before the patient enlisted. 22 The constant bombardment of soldiers with information about these diseases produced an army with far lower rates of infection than the general public.Interwar Years After the Armistice of November 11, 1918, both the United States and the AAI returned to a normal state of affairs. By early 1920, The JI had a subscription agent in Berlin to distribute the journal in Germany. 23 In the decades that followed, the economic fortunes of most post-war countries were in a state of flux, but the United States thrived during the Roaring Twenties until Black Tuesday, October 29, 1929, when the stock market crashed, and the Great Depression began. On June, 16, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the National Recovery Administration (NRA) as his rst large-scale legislative attempt to begin righting the country's economic ship. The goal of the new agency was to bring fair, regulated competition to the market and better working conditions to laborers through the creation of codes to stabilize production; set price controls; and regulate collective bargaining, wages, and maximum work hours for laborers. The NRA emblem, a blue eagle clutching a gear in one talon and lightning bolts in the other, symbolized industry and power. The symbol quickly gained a foothold in the American consciousness and was displayed in shop windows and printed on the packaging of goods to demonstrate support for the agency. Although use of the emblem was voluntary, businesses that did not display or use it were often boycotted. Scientic publishers were not immune to the public pressure to include the NRA logo on their journals. Thus, the NRA eagle rst appeared prominently on the cover of the October 1933 issue of The JI. 24 19.

NRA poster, c.1933 Library of Congress Medical and Surgical Supply Committee of America notice, Nov. 1940 The Journal of Immunology 94 AAI History Compendium (2021)WWII: Supporting the Effort By the late 1930s, immunology had become an established eld of research that was both growing and diversifying, and The JI was the preeminent journal for immunology in North America. At that time, the journal was publishing one issue each month and nearly 1,000 pages of research each year. When WWII broke out in Europe in 1939, the rst visual clue of the war in The JI was a full-page notice from the Medical and Surgical Supply Committee of America in the November 1940 issue. A large, bold headline exclaimed that \"Great Britain Needs Surgical Equipment,\" in its solicitation of donations of medical supplies from medical professionals and institutions. After the United States entered the war, The JI voluntarily and proactively took steps to conserve paper in anticipation of restrictions on supplies. In January 1942, The JI published an \"Explanation to Subscribers,\" explaining the new format of the journal, with smaller type and narrower margins to t the same amount of content into roughly 20 percent fewer pages. 25 In 1943, the War Production Board codied such efforts, issuing regulations limiting publishers to 90 percent of the weight of paper they had used in 1941. 26 In early 1944, a \"V\" logo (\"'V' for Victory\") appeared on the cover, indicating that the journal was complying with wartime paper restrictions. Paper wasn't the only commodity that The JI was asked to help conserve. The August 1942 issue included a visually arresting headline over a message from the publisher, Williams and Wilkins: \"URGENT: Notice of War Production Board Order Related to Obsolete Plates.\" The War Production Board had issued Conservation Order M-99, which required the owners of obsolete printing plates to turn them over so their metals could be used in the war effort. 27 Williams and Wilkins had previously provided authors published in The JI with the plates used to print their gures. The announcement informed authors that they were subject to \"ne or imprisonment\" if they did not comply with the government order. Such penalties, however, were likely intended for businesses, not individuals with a single plate here and there. 28 The expansion of War Production Board restrictions affected the scientic enterprise more broadly, as travel restrictions caused the cancellation of scientic meetings, including the AAI annual meetings in 1943, 1944, and 1945. Funding War-Related Research On June 28, 1941, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order No. 8807 to establish the Ofce of Scientic Research and Development (OSRD) \"for the purpose of assuring adequate provision for research on scientic and medical problems relating to the national defense.\" 29 This new agency would spend over half a billion dollars on scientic research during the course of the war. Many contributors to The JI beneted from OSRD funding during the war. A total of 23 articles described research funded in whole or in part by OSRD contracts, and the May 1946 issue featured ve articles with OSRD funding\u2014one-half of the content for that issue. The OSRD-funded articles in The JI reflected the changing needs of the military; the earliest of these articles described research on perennial threats, such as tetanus, typhus, and syphilis, whereas later articles dealt with diseases faced by soldiers ghting in the Pacic, such as dysentery and malaria. These papers were studies in basic research, as well as new and improved diagnostic and treatment options, including vaccine and penicillin research. Seymour Halbert (AAI '47), Stuart Mudd (AAI '27), and Joseph Smolens (AAI '43) of the University of Pennsylvania published three articles on aspects of Shigella, which had caused several severe outbreaks of dysentery in all theaters of the war. 30 Two OSRD-funded articles described methods of producing the Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin, the agent responsible for gas gangrene. Although both incidence and mortality of gas gangrene had declined sharply since WWI, prevention of the debilitating condition remained a priority for 25. The average article length in 1941 was 12.7 pages. With the new format in 1942, the average article length was 10.1 pages. 26.

The wording of Order M-99, while technically including individuals, was clearly intended to apply to companies, as its pr imary effect was to compel printers and publishers to certify that they had no obsolete plates in their possession before obtaining new metal. 29.

Volume IV: Communicable Diseases Transmitted Chiefly Through Respiratory and Alimentary Tracts (Washington, D.C.: Ofce of the Surgeon General, Department of the Army, 1958), 393. \"Explanation to Subscribers,\" Jan. 1942 The co-authors, including Manfred Mayer (AAI '46, president 1976-77), published a series of ve articles detailing their unsuccessful quest to nd a malaria vaccine. Even with the relative luxury of a large population of volunteer subjects for research and over $5.5 million spent on malaria research, that goal remained out of reach. 32 At the outset of the war in Europe, penicillin had not yet been used to successfully treat bacterial infections in humans. A few years into the war, however, this changed, and there was an urgent need to understand the antibiotic properties of penicillin and to ramp up production of the new drug. In the United States, the OSRD and pharmaceutical companies were largely responsible for initiating this research. Although there was only one OSRD-funded paper on penicillin research, 33 the OSRD recommended or supplied penicillin for two other experiments that were published in The JI. 34 Werner Henle (AAI '38, president 1962-63) and Gertrude Henle focused their research on influenza during WWII from their lab at the University of Chicago; the pair received OSRD contracts for human subject research that resulted in two articles in The JI. 35 The Army Epidemiological Board Many contributors to The JI, the Henles among them, received wartime funding from the Board for the Investigation and Control of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases in the Army (later shortened to the Army Epidemiological Board). At the urging of Brigadier General James S. Simmons, Chief of Preventive Medicine in the Ofce of the Surgeon General during WWII, and his deputy, Stanhope Bayne-Jones (AAI '17, president 1930-31), the War Department approved the Board in January 1941 to \"prevent catastrophic outbreaks of disease.\" 36 Influenza was a high priority for the military, as the pandemic during WWI had been one of the largest sources of medical non-battle casualties in the U.S. Army abroad and at home. Among the 17 initial board members and commission directors were nine AAI members, including four past presidents, two future presidents, and six long-time members of The JI editorial staff, four of whom were editing the journal throughout the war. Bayne-Jones served as the rst administrator of the Board, and Francis G. Blake (AAI '21, president 1934-35) was its rst president. Among the other prominent AAI members and editors of The JI who served with the Board were Oswald T. Avery (AAI '20, president 1929-30), Alphonse R. Jr. (AAI '30, president 1949-50). In the next two years, John F . Enders (AAI '36, president 1952-53) joined the Commission and Karl F . Meyer (AAI '22, president 1940-41) joined theCommission on Tropical Diseases, adding two moreactive editors of The JI to the Board. Albert Sabin (AAI '46) served on the Board's Commission on Neurotropical Virus Diseases and in 1943, went to Cairo to set up a lab for the study of sandfly fever, infectious hepatitis, and poliomyelitis. 37 Sabin was very pleased with the results of his research in the field, especially on sandfly fever, which also shed light on other mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue. 38 31.

The JI was among the journals publishing research produced by the various commissions. Non-military Research The JI continued to publish research, independent of the military, on a broad spectrum of topics, including allergic reactions, new technologies, bacteriophages, polio, and the discovery of a new disease. During the war, Mary Hewitt Loveless (AAI '41) completed her influential ve-part series, \"Immunological Studies of Pollinosis.\" 39 The power of the electron microscope, invented the previous decade, was harnessed to begin the investigation of the processes, mechanisms, and structure of antibodies. Alfred D. Hershey (AAI '42) completed his six-part series on \"Specic Precipitation\" and multiple papers on phage-antiphage reaction. 40 Polio remained a disease of constant concern on the homefront during the war. Although no major discoveries regarding polio were made during the war, the research helped set the stage for the post-war breakthroughs. In The JI, 12 papers on polio were published with contributions from 12 different authors at seven institutions. The authors included Beatrice F . Howitt; Joseph L. Melnick (AAI '48), a pioneering virologist; and Ulrich Friedemann, a refugee of Nazi Germany. All of the articles were funded by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (commonly known as the March of Dimes), an organization that quickly became a major sponsor of polio treatment and research. 41 In the September 1944 issue, the discovery of the Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) by Kenneth C.

Generally, non-lethal in humans, the virus makes an excellent vector and is used extensively in biological research because it has broad host range and incredibly efcient replication. It is used as a vector to transmit genes encoding vaccines (for viruses of public health interest, such as Chikungunya) and vaccines for cancers that are virally induced. SFV has also been used to treat cancer because it has high anti-tumor properties and therefore, enhances the immune response against solid tumors. Wartime Diversity The JI became a home for a greater diversity of authors and institutions from around the world during the war. It published papers from Jonas Salk (AAI '47) and Alfred Hershey well before they were internationally recognized. Five papers were published to complete a Ph.D. requirement, including that of Abram B. Stavitsky (AAI '50). It published papers from a wide range of institutions, including universities, government facilities, and pharmaceutical companies. Of the 124 articles published during the WWII, 35.9 percent had at least one female authorManuscripts were accepted from Australia, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Ireland, Iceland, Israel, Mexico, Sweden, Turkey, and Uganda. The JI also published papers from scientists who had fled the Nazi regime, including immunologists Werner and Gertrude Henle, Manfred M. Mayer, and pioneering biomathematician Felix Bernstein. Faced with changes in research caused by two world wars, The JI held true to its mission of publishing peer-reviewed articles at the forefront of immunological research. Following the return to peacetime after WWII, the Cold War would soon begin, and a \"Doctor Draft\" would affect the research of the next generation of immunologists; this will be explored in the next AAI Newsletter .

For 20 years, spanning the Korean and Vietnam wars, newly minted physicians had to contend with the prospect of being drafted into the armed forces \u2014what became known as the Doctor Draft. A number of AAI members were required to fulll their military service away from the lab at military hospitals. Fitch was one of the many young men who managed both to fulll their responsibility to their country and maintain a course toward a research or clinical career. In 1952, President Harry S. Truman signed into law an act establishing the Doctor Draft, which was initially intended to bolster the ranks of military personnel during the Korean War. The Doctor Draft, however, remained in place following the war's end in 1953 to maintain medical readiness of the armed services in the event that the Cold War became \"hot.\" Following their internship, doctors subject to the Doctor Draft could be inducted for two years of service in the armed forces, potentially disrupting their plans to begin clinical residency or continued education and training toward a research career.Scientists and the Doctor Draft: Frank Fitch-The Air Force YearsFEATURE: AAI PROFILES IN LEADERSHIP In a recent interview, AAI member and past president Frank Fitch shared recollections of the military training and service that were components of his early career path in science.

From Gunter, the young doctor traveled west to Sheppard Frank Fitch, c. 1956 Courtesy of Frank Fitch Frank Fitch served as base doctor at Sheppard Air Force Base 1955 to 1957. www.aai.org 99AFB in Wichita Falls, Texas, not far from the Texas- Oklahoma border, to serve the remainder of his commission as a base doctor. Fitch arrived at Sheppard AFB, a large aviation training base, in the winter of 1955, now joined by Shirley. The hospital on the base served as a referral center for several bases in Texas and Oklahoma. As he lacked a pathology specialty designation, Fitch was considered a general doctor and assigned to departments as needed. His rst assignment was as Assistant Chief of OB-GYN, a specialty in which he had gained knowledge by way of a corresponding, two-month rotation during his internship. After a luckily uneventful week of being on call, Fitch received what would be his permanent assignment on base in the Dependents' Clinic Dispensary, a eld of medicine (pediatrics) in which he had limited practical experience. Fortunately, a seasoned pediatrician was already assigned to the clinic when Fitch arrived. Although the pediatrician's commission ended two months after Fitch's arrival, Fitch \"learned more about practical pediatric medicine from him than in my previous academic settings.\" Soon thereafter, a newly enlisted doctor with a pediatric specialty designation arrived at the clinic. Although Fitch was not able to perform bench research during his service as he had hoped, a number of his cases called for study far beyond that required for the average patient. One memorable case involved a four-month-old girl with a goiter caused by a very unusual thyroid abnormality. The base did not have the facilities necessary for the radioactive iodine testing that he needed, but Fitch diagnosed and treated the infant's condition using remote labs. Fitch spent two years in the Air Force but never once set foot in an airplane. He kept busy on base though. The base doctors often had to deal with domineering senior medical ofcers who would treat the reserve ofcers capriciously. One senior pediatrician, in the last two months of his active duty, instituted unreasonable and disruptive procedures in the clinic, demanding that all pediatric cases be referred to him. When Fitch and one of his colleagues refused to follow his rules to the letter, they were \"banished\" to the enlisted men's dispensary, where they would see up to 100 patients a day.In Wichita Falls, the Fitches lived more like civilians than career military\u2014their home was off base, and Frank did not remain a member of the Ofcers Club after it was no longer required. They did, however, make friends with other military families and occasionally used base facilities. The biggest event while in Wichita Falls occurred on January 7, 1956, when their rst child, Margaret, was born at the base hospital. At the end of his service in January of 1957, Frank and Shirley packed up their car and were about to head back to Chicago when it suddenly began to snow. It was already late in the day, but the Fitches decided to set off through the snowstorm anyway and \"never looked back.\" Fitch's time in the Air Force helped convince him that he denitely wanted a career in research rather than clinical practice. Although he had to put aside research for those two years, his military commitment had come at a time when the United States was not at war, and the professional and living conditions at Sheppard AFB were decent. Even though Fitch did not follow in his father's footsteps and become a practicing physician, the two did nd common ground. After 40 years of practice, his father retired and was elected mayor of Bushnell, serving in that capacity from 1969 to 1977. Fitch recollected, \" At that time, we had a friendly competition going: who got the prize this month for getting the most money from the federal government to support our activities, his as mayor and mine as a scientist.\" During the years of the Doctor Draft, Fitch and many other AAI members managed to balance their duty to their country with the work they needed to do to launch their research careers. For some, their service was a professional setback, while, for others, it provided them with their rst experiences in immunology. Fitch went on to a long and distinguished career at the University of Chicago, and to years of service to AAI as a member of Council, president, and editor-in-chief of The Journal of Immunology. Ultimately, Fitch feels that his time in the Air Force was a reasonable price to pay; he calls it \"payback for my other good fortune.\" *All quotes from Frank Fitch's AAI Oral History Project interview (www.aai.org/ohp), unpublished family history, and a September 15, 2017, phone interview with the Fitch.

The base doctors often had to deal with domineering senior medical ofcers who would treat the reserve ofcers capriciously. One senior pediatrician, in the last two months of his active duty, instituted unreasonable and disruptive procedures in the clinic, demanding that all pediatric cases be referred to him. When Fitch and one of his colleagues refused to follow his rules to the letter, they were \"banished\" to the enlisted men's dispensary, where they would see up to 100 patients a day.In Wichita Falls, the Fitches lived more like civilians than career military\u2014their home was off base and Frank did not remain a member of the Ofcers Club after it was no longer required. They did, however, make friends with other military families and occasionally used base facilities. The biggest event while in Wichita Falls occurred on January 7, 1956, when their rst child, Margaret, was born at the base hospital. At the end of his service in January of 1957, Frank and Shirley were about to head back to Chicago when it suddenly began to snow. It was already late in the day, but the Fitches decided to set off through the snowstorm anyway and \"never looked back.\" Fitch's time in the Air Force helped convince him that he denitely wanted a career in research rather than clinical practice. Although he had to put aside research for those two years, his military commitment had come at a time when the United States was not at war, and the professional and living conditions at Sheppard AFB were decent. Even though Fitch did not follow in his father's footsteps and become a practicing physician, the two did nd common ground. After 40 years of practice, his father retired and was elected mayor of Bushnell, serving in that capacity from 1969 to 1977. Fitch recollected, \" At that time, we had a friendly competition going as to who got the prize this month for getting the most money from the federal government to support our activities\u2014his as mayor and mine as a scientist.\" During the years of the Doctor Draft, Fitch and many other AAI members managed to balance their duty to their country with the work they needed to do to launch their research careers. For some, their service was a professional setback, while, for others, it provided them with their rst experiences in immunology. Fitch went on to a distinguished career at the University of Chicago, and to years of service to AAI as a member of Council, president, and editor-in-chief of The Journal of Immunology. Ultimately, Fitch feels that his time in the Air Force was a reasonable price to pay; he calls it \"payback for my other good fortune.\" Quotes are from Frank Fitch's AAI Oral History Project interview (www.aai.org/ohp), unpublished family history, and a September 15, 2017, phone interview.

The entire rst volume in 1916 contained only a single use of photographic images\u2014a series of ve photographs showing kidney lesions resulting from chronic anaphylaxis. 1 All of this changed, of course, with the arrival of the rst ads, which drew the reader from text to eye-catching, graphic elements meant to induce purchases. Looking back on decades of ads published in The JI, we see that they illustrate a fascinating history of the journal and the eld: what advertisers thought would interest early scientists and how ads changed to address the needs of immunology's maturing, diversifying, and expanding discipline. Ads in the rst 50 years of The JI fall into four general categories according to their specic appeals or styles. The largest group of ads promoted the tools necessary to perform research, such as lab equipment, research animals, and reagents, with the drugs and other pharmaceutical products comprising a second category. A third type of ad publicized civic engagement campaigns that would be of interest to scientists. A fourth category emerged when journal advertisers began using modern graphic design and advertising techniques to strengthen their message. The following advertisements (Figures 1-4) are examples of each of thesecategories. 1 T. Harris Boughton, \"Kidney Lesions in Chronic Anaphylaxis,\" The Journal of Immunology 1, no. 1 (1916):105-18Figure 1: Mandler Diatomaceous Filters, LOOKS BACK www.aai.org 101Tools for Immunology Research Ads comprising the broadest of the four categories focused on tools of immunological research: equipment, literature (scientic and medical journals and books), research animals, and reagents. Perhaps the nest example in this category is the rst advertis ement ever to appear in The JI. The Arthur H. Thomas Company promotedits Mandler diatomaceous lters(Figure 1) in the rst ad everplaced in the journal (December1916 2). It stands as an example of the instructive nature of earlyadvertising for tools used inimmunological research. The adincludes a detailed rendering anda technical description of the usesand composition of the lter, as wellas pricing. More discursive thanmost ads today, the description ofthe lter was written at a collegereading level as was appropriatefor readers of The JI, most of whomwere M.D.s in 1916. The advancedlevel of writing highlights thecooperation between bacteriologistsin industry and the U.S. governmentin perfecting the lter. The Mandler lter, itself a new product on the market in 1916, was novel also for being designed and built in the United States. At the time, many American manufacturers of laboratory equipment were copying European designs. American production of such equipment arose with the growth of laboratory research in the U.S. prior to the outbreak of the World War I. Arthur H. Thomas Company, foundedin 1900 in Philadelphia, was an early supplier of domestic and European laboratory products to the American market. When, in 1914, the company redesigned its catalog with illustrations and detailed 2 Research yielded no ads in The JI prior to volume 2, issue 1, in December 1916.Figure 2: Save the Tenth Child, 1922 The Journal of ImmunologyAAI LOOKS BACK 102 AAI History Compendium (2021)descriptions, such as seen in Figure 1, the catalog emerged as the \"bible\" of the U.S. laboratory research industry. Arthur H. Thomas Company was renamed Thomas Scientic in 1983 and continues to sell equipment and supplies to the scientic community today. Products of Immunology Research Some of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies of their day advertised their products in The JI, including Parke-Davis & Company, H. K. Mulford Company, The Arlington Chemical Company, and Wyeth. 3 These and other companies promoted drugs and other pharmaceutical products. Ads for these pharmaceutical products (for treating diseases and allergies) were present in almost every issue of The JI through World War II. These included treatments, antitoxins, and vaccines for maladies such as hay fever, poison ivy, pertussis, tuberculosis, scarlet fever, influenza, and diphtheria. The \"Save the Tenth Child\" advertisement (Figure 2) is notable as one of the few that attempted to sell a pharmaceutical product to clinicians through a combination of fact and fear. The ad, which appeared only once in The JI (December 1922), called attention to diphtheria, still a deadly disease. In the previous year, there were 206,000 cases, with 15,520 deaths (7.5 percent mortality rate). Even with the availability of diphtheria antitoxins for over two decades and an easy and reliable diagnostic test for the disease (the Schick test), the mortality rate among children at the time was typically higher, up to 20 Call, 1923 The Journal of Immunology www.aai.org 103In 1890, Emil von Behring announced that he had created a successful diphtheria antitoxin. The following year, George Davis (\"Davis\" in Parke-Davis) recruited scientists from the University of Michigan, including E. M. Houghton (AAI '16). Theyset up a lab and developed theParke-Davis antitoxin. 4 By the early 1920s there were manyantitoxins commercially availablefor clinicians to select. In thiscase Parke-Davis appealed to thereaders' sense of responsibilityto their \"little patients\"\u2014notonly the responsibility effectively but to Antitoxin available.\"Without mentioning cases ofdeaths from antitoxin but newsworthy,the ad antitoxin, produced\"in bythe Pure Food and Drug of1906, this appeal to purity andhigh scientic standards wasparticularly attractive. Civic Engagement Campaigns Civic engagement campaigns appeared exclusively in the rst three decades of the journal with ads promoting involvement in issues of public concern or public health crusades. In November 1923, the rst civic engagement campaign advertisement appeared in the nal issue of the year. It would have been striking to any reader of the journal because of the rst use of color ink in The JI. The ad (Figure 3) is for the seventh annual American National Red Cross Roll Call in 1923, which lasted 4\u00030LOWRQ\u0003/\u0011 \u0003+RH\u00c1H\u000f\u0003\u00b47KH\u0003(DUO\\\u0003+LVWRU\\\u0003RI\u00033DUNH\u0010'DYLV\u0003DQG\u0003&RPSDQ\\\u000f\u00b5\u0003Bulletin of the History of Chemistry\u0003\u0015\u0018\u000f\u0003QR\u0011 \u0003\u0014\u0003 \u0015\u0013\u0013\u0013 \u0003\u0016\u0014\u00b2\u0016\u0015\u0011Figure 4: Aardvarks We Don't Have, 1955 The Journal of ImmunologyAAI LOOKS BACK 104 AAI History Compendium (2021)from Armistice Day, November 11, to Thanksgiving, November 29. This annual fundraising drive recruited new volunteers and brought in a signicant portion of the more than $10 million the Red Cross spent each year. This ad was rather unusual compared with most American Red Cross ads of the early 1920s. Ads at that time typically featured images of Red Cross nurses promoting the organization's non-militant activities, including public health nursing services in rural areas, disaster preparedness, and the Junior Red Cross. Although the First World War had ended ve years before on November 11, 1918, the Red Cross of the early 1920s was an organization in transition. After receiving accolades during the war, it entered peacetime turmoil as the Red Cross faced plummeting membership, declining dues, a reorganization of the national ofce, and public critiques of wartime management and nances. Despite these challenges, the organization remained steadfast to its commitments, including the growing nancial burden of being a primary provider of treatment and benets for disabled veterans and their families. 5 Although having no bearing on research, the appeal and accompanying artwork would have resonated deeply with members of the American Association of Immunologists (AAI) and readers of The JI. 6 Following an AAI resolution in April 1917 offering the \"services and facilities\" of member laboratories to the \"Federal and respective State governments\" to satisfy the need for \"bacteriologists and immunologists\" for the war effort, a signicant number of AAI members and The JI editors had become directly involved in the war. 7 Some volunteered in the U.S. Army Medical Corp and served in hospitals or on the front lines in Europe. Others who enlisted remained in the states conducting wartime research at their laboratories. 8 The wartime experiences of AAI members would have made them promising candidates for participation in the Roll Call.Modern Advertising As the birth of modern advertising started to \"animate the inanimate,\" using eye-catching color printing and photography, journal ads began appealing to the reader through visual creativity as well as a compelling \"story.\" Modern advertising came a little later to The JI than to commercial publications, but the 1950s brought contemporary design and advertising techniques to the advertisements published in the journal. The ads were no longer plainly factual. Text was simplied and abbreviated, and most ads featured new design and fonts, photography, color, trademarks, and/or slogans. Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) stood apart as one of the most innovative advertisers (Figure 4), especially in the use of color ads. BD had recently expanded beyond designing and manufacturing medical equipment with its acquisition of Baltimore Biological Laboratory in 1955. BD Laboratories quickly became a signicant source of the reagents so important to immunological research and began promoting their products such as the one featured in the ad on the previous page. This particular ad uses a contemporary approach in both design and copy to sell specialized biological research materials to scientists in the same way that consumer goods were sold to the public. 9 The whimsical language and design appealed to modern sensibilities, but the ad still informed the readers about what BD could offer. It focused on the wide variety of products: 124 products in 323 package forms, which reflect both the diversity of tools and expanding need of new reagents being used by researchers. Author: John S.

The sweeping work of history\u2014spanning Anton van Leeuwenhoek's discovery of microbes in the 17 th century through Paul Ehrlich's \"magic bullet\" targeting syphilis in 1909\u2014has remained in print since its original publication in 1926 and inspired not only generations of immunologists but also many adaptations as well. Legitimate scientic credentials were behind the fame de Kruif (AAI 1921) achieved as a writer of popular science. Having obtained his Ph.D. (1916) from the University of Michigan under the mentorship of Frederick Novy (AAI 1920, president 1924-25), 1 de Kruif enlisted in the U.S. Army and participated in the Mexican Expedition against Pancho Villa in 1916-17. Later, as a member of the Army's Sanitary Corps during World War I, he created a method for more rapid production of an antitoxin to Clostridium perfringens, 2 a major cause of gas gangrene during the war.3 Following the war and his return to the University of Michigan as an assistant professor, de Kruif fell in love with a laboratory assistant, Elizabeth (\"Rhea\") Barbarin. Already married with two small children, de Kruif divorced his rst wife and soon married Barbarin, which created a nancial strain. To meet his new obligations, de Kruif, at the encouragement of his literary idol, H. L. Menken, undertook freelance writing while continuing his teaching and laboratory research with Novy. 4 The latter endeavor soon proved fruitful, as his research on hemolytic streptococcus and anaphylatoxins caught the eye of scientists, including Simon Flexner (AAI 1920), at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (RIMR; now the Rockefeller University). 5 As a result of his growing prominence, de Kruif was appointed as an associate at RIMR and began work in the laboratory of Flexner. By then, however, de Kruif was already becoming disillusioned by the state of medical research and practice. 6 He believed that increasing specialization was robbing the eld of thoughtful generalists thus detaching it from the immediate needs of patients and allowing moral crusades to exert too much control over the direction of research.Paul de Kruif and Microbe Hunters : Revisiting an Early AAI Member and a Book That Inspired Generations HISTORY: AAI LOOKS BACK Frederick G. Novy AAI Collection, Center for Biological Sciences Archive, UMBC Laboratory on the campus of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, c. 1925 Courtesy of Science History Institute 112 AAI History Compendium (2021)de Kruif's rst forays into writing about science, although published anonymously, nevertheless got him \"red\" from Flexner's lab. 7 In a series of four articles in The Century Magazine and a chapter in Harold E. Stearns's Civilization in the United States, de Kruif framed the medical eld as becoming increasingly driven by prot, novelty, and moral crusading. He condemned this trend as \"medical Ga-Gaism.\" 8 When Flexner discovered the true authorship of the publications, he saw them as an attack on RIMR and asked for de Kruif's resignation in 1922. 9 de Kruif complied but nonetheless published a collected and expanded edition of the offending essays dedicated to \"my teacher of bacteriology...without his permission.\" 10 de Kruif's dismissal from RIMR left him free to collaborate with celebrated author Sinclair Lewis on the Pulitzer-winning novel Arrowsmith, the story of a scientist torn between the rigors of pure science and the demands of public health crises. To prepare for the novel, he and Lewis boarded a tramp steamer bound for the Caribbean. In the islands, they indulged in the sampling of tropical cocktails while producing a 60,000-word outline for the novel, drawing on their experiences in the region and de Kruif's scientic knowledge. Lewis was impressed, not only by de Kruif's technical contributions but also by his literary sensibilities. He later told H. G. Wells that de Kruif was \"a man with a knife-edge mind and an iconoclasm that really means something.\" 11 The collaboration helped de Kruif as well: it taught him to write for a broader audience. Arrowsmith was released in 1925 to wide critical acclaim. The book focuses on an issue that de Kruif had been weighing and writing about during the early part of the decade: the tension and conflict between medicine and basic research. The book's protagonist, Martin Arrowsmith, is a microbe hunter who, after nding success in the Midwest, is invited to join a highly respected biomedical research institute in New York\u2014echoing the narrative of de Kruif's own life. It is in his capacity leading a biomedical research team that Arrowsmith faces the life-changing dilemma of having to choose between being faithful to basic science and his principles or betraying them. It was during his work with Lewis on Arrowsmith that de Kruif's next idea for a book emerged, with the sprouting of a seed planted years before by Jules Bordet, a colleague at RIMR. The work was to be a collection of stories proling scientists and how theirdiscoveries fundamentally altered the understandingof microbiology. de Kruif would start at the beginningwith the microscope and carry his narrative to near-present day, covering this history by telling 12 stories of14 scientists. To many in the public and the scienticcommunity, Microbe Hunters was the nonction sequelto Arrowsmith. In 1926, when Microbe Hunters was released, the eld of immunology was still young and, at times, produced hypotheses and discoveries that were at odds with prevailing theories in some of the older, more established biomedical elds. In his presidential address that year, Wilfred H. Manwaring (AAI 1917, president 1925-26) acknowledged the \"skepticism with which many of the theoretical phases of our subject have been received by works in the older medical sciences.\" 12 He attributed this skepticism, in large part, to disagreement over Ehrlich's receptor theory, which was being widely tested by new methods. Immunologists were also focused on the matter of blood typing, a topic of frequent discussion at the AAI annual meeting and in the pages of The Journal of Immunology. Microbe Hunters opens with a quartet of pioneers who established the existence of microscopic organisms and demonstrated their role in disease. The rst of these is van Leeuwenhoek, who rst saw miniscule animals through his revolutionary microscope in the 17 th century. de Kruif's focus then turns to Lazzaro Spallanzani and the lengthy series of experiments he performed in an attempt to disprove spontaneous generation. Rounding out this section are Robert Koch's identication of specic pathogens and their connection to diseases, and Louis Pasteur's innovations in vaccines and the neutralization of microbes.Sinclair Lewis, c. 1925 Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University Microbe Hunters rst edition cover,c. 1926 www.aai.org 113Yellow Jack poster, c. 1938 The book next focuses on the discoverers of mechanisms crucial to the immune system and understanding disease transmissions, as well as early developers of treatments and cures. By this time in the early 20 th century, the hygiene theory was widely accepted, and the germ theory had been well established, thus making the modern biomedical setting more recognizable to the reader. Elie Metchnikoff's discovery of macrophages (\"the nice phagocytes\") was a critical step in the understanding of innate immunity. Emile Roux and Emil von Behring developed the rst successful diphtheria antitoxin, introducing serum therapy to the world. Theobald Smith (AAI 1920) proved that cattle were catching Texas fever from ticks, demonstrating that insects and other arthropods could act as disease vectors. Smith's precedent led the way for the work of David Bruce (tsetse fly and sleeping sickness), Ronald Ross and Battista Grassi (mosquitoes and malaria), and Walter Reed (mosquitoes and yellow fever). The nal microbe hunter featured in the book is Ehrlich, whose \"magic bullet\" against syphilis was the rst example of successful chemotherapy treatment for a specic disease. de Kruif saw Ehrlich's achievement as the practical culmination of the centuries of research performed by the other scientists proled in the book. In most of his early science writing, de Kruif adopted a sensationalist tone\u2014and in Microbe Hunters, he was practically breathless. In keeping with the heroic age of medicine, he made his subjects larger-than-life heroes, frequently imagining dialogue that they would exclaim at moments of discovery. A book review in JAMA noted that de Kruif described the innovators as \"far from the perfect and rather priggish members of the human race that they are sometimes represented to be\" but that his style had \"an exaggerated quality which is annoying.\" 13 The reviewer predicted that the book would be appreciated by scientists and a general audience alike. Microbe Hunters found immediate and enormous success. It quickly became a national and international bestseller and was soon translated into 18 languages. Some subjects of the book, however, were less impressed. The most notable of these was Ross, the British scientist who received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for identifying the role of the mosquito in malaria transmission.Ross strenuously objected to how de Kruif portrayed his rivalry with Grassi. In an open letter, Ross, along with Aldo Castellani, George C. Low, David Nabarro, and Cuthbert Cristy, complained that de Kruif's account was \"almost entirely apocryphal...not supported by reference to the original literature...[and] clearly derived almost only from his own imagination or from spurious prompting by others.\" 14 Ross argued that some of de Kruif's statements went so far as to violate British libel laws\u2014and indeed, the British edition of Microbe Hunters was published without the chapters on Bruce and Ross. 15 Notwithstanding the controversy, the book was a bestseller and has remained a staple of medical history. The impact of Microbe Hunters went far beyond the printed page. In the 1930s and '40s, adaptations of the book made their way to stage, radio, and screen, usually with de Kruif's involvement. The author collaborated with another Pulitzer winner, Sidney Howard, to transform his chapter on Walter Reed into the play Yellow Jack in 1934. The story of Reed battling yellow fever in Cuba at the end of the Spanish-American War gave a young Jimmy Stewart his rst dramatic stage role as a young private who volunteers to be bitten by a mosquito in hopes of proving the method of transmission. Critics praised Yellow Jack, but this early translation from book to stage was not a hit at the box ofce. 16 Nevertheless, four years later, the play was successfully adapted for the screen; the lm's cast featured Lewis Stone, who had actually served in the Spanish-American War, as Reed. Under the Works Progress Administration of the New Deal, the Federal Theatre Project (FTP) produced hundreds of classic and original plays, including one adapted from de Kruif's chapter on Ehrlich, with the unlikely title Spirochete. The play premiered in Chicago in 1938, just two years after U.S. Surgeon General Thomas Parran famously declared war on syphilis. Spirochete was a huge success, especially considering that the word \"syphilis\" had been considered almost too obscene for print just one year before. Theater-goers could even take a Wasserman test in the lobby during intermission. 17 The show's Seattle run was Treponema pallidum Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 114 AAI History Compendium (2021)the most successful FTP production in the city, with 3,000 people attending the performances. 18 Americans did not have to go to the theater to hear stories of microbe hunters; they could also tune in to a weekly radio series. The FTP worked with de Kruif to adapt Microbe Hunters as the rst 14 episodes of the radio drama series Men Against Death. The series ran weekly from June 30, 1938, to April 22, 1939, on the CBS network, dramatizing four of de Kruif's books of popular science for a national radio audience. The best known adaptation of Microbe Hunters is the 1940 lm Dr . Ehrlich's Magic Bullet, another production that pushed the boundaries of what was considered decent for the screen. Its topic was technically prohibited by the Motion Picture Production Code of 1934, which stated that \"sex hygiene and venereal diseases are not acceptable subject matter for theatrical motion pictures.\" 19 Nevertheless, the search for a chemotherapeutic cure for syphilis was dramatized in a high-prole movie starring Edward G. Robinson as Ehrlich, with an Oscar-nominated script by John Huston. The bulk of the lm was shot in black and white, but the views of microscope slides were in Technicolor. In lieu of actual microphotography, however, the lmmakers used rubber models of syphilis spirochetes on giant slides and injected dye into them while activating them from below with wires. 20 Critics praised the lm for both its bold approach to a difcult topic and the performances of the cast. For decades after its publication, Microbe Hunters was an inspiration and springboard for future biomedical researchers and doctors, and the book launched a new genre of science writing that flourishes to this day. Outdated as it is by current measure, both in terms of historical rigor and antiquated racial overtones, Microbe Hunters remains a classic documentary of the earliest microbiologists and immunologists and serves as an inspiration to new scientists. Today, de Kruif's fast-paced narrative continues to be relevant to a wide audience as an exciting entry point into the origins of immunology and the eld-shifting discoveries of its early years.Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet poster, c. 1940 National Library of Medicine 1 An abbreviated version of de Kruif's dissertation was published in 1917.

The three factors Kolmer believed would lead to a \"triumph over disease\" were \"prevention by sanitary measures, specic immunization and improved methods of treatment of the inevitable and unavoidable sick and injured.\" To this end, many members of AAI joined the war effort when the United States entered in 1917\u2014the third year of the war\u2014 in many different roles. Some focused on wartime research in their own laboratories. Others joined the U.S. Army Sanitary Corps or Medical Department, which coordinated research in U.S. and European labs. A few, including future AAI president Stanhope Bayne-Jones, volunteered to ght in the trenches. Here we commemorate the ending of the war with the Armistice on November 11, 1918, one hundred years ago. 116 AAI History Compendium (2021)26 AAI NEWSLETTER JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2019 26 W A 99HISTORY Oswald T.

Since 1961, the mesa has also been the nexus of immunological research in the region. The history behind San Diego's community of universities, research institutes, and biotech companies, however, starts at the beginning of the twentieth century. The Early Decades Bioscience research in San Diego began in 1909 when newspaper magnate and philanthropist Ellen Browning Scripps donated $150,000 to the University of California Regents to support the Marine Biological Laboratory in La Jolla, the western hemisphere's rst permanent marine science center.1 At the time, the city's population was a mere 39,500 people. In 1924, inspired by the discovery of insulin, Scripps contributed an additional $300,000 toward the founding of the Scripps Memorial Hospital and Scripps Metabolic Clinic to investigate and treat diseases, especially diabetes.2 During the Second World War, Torrey Pines had been the location of Camp Callan, a U.S. Army anti-aircraft training facility. Though postwar demobilization brought a signicant reduction in the military presence in San Diego, a U.S. Marine Corps rifle range at Camp Matthews continued to occupy a sizable portion of the mesa. With San Diego's population rapidly expanding\u2014it would reach 573,224 by the end of the 1950s\u2014many residents of La Jolla, the increasingly affluent San Diego neighborhood just north of downtown, were growing more uncomfortable living so close to an active range. 3 At the same time, three endeavors were underway that would help dene the future of the mesa. The Scripps Clinic, which separated from the hospital and became the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, was actively recruiting biomedical scientists for its new research facility. Jonas Salk (AAI '47) had begun searching for a site where he could establish a research institute following his success with the polio vaccine. And the University of California set its sights on building a new campus in the area.

The city owned the rights to 49,000 acres of pueblo lands on the mesa and surrounding areas, and business and civic leaders decided to use that land to attract scientic research to the area. University of California, San Diego The University of California was the rst to take advantage of the newly available real estate. Roger Revelle, then the director of the Scripps Oceanographic Institute, led the push to create an entirely new campus in San Diego rather than expanding the Los Angeles campus. General Dynamics, a large defense and aerospace company, helped ensure that the city would provide the land for it by promising to invest $1 million in the university. 4 With this guarantee, the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), was ofcially established on November 18, 1960, as a school focused on \"mathematics, physics, chemistry, and the earth and biological sciences.\" 5 As part of the initial campaign of recruitment, S. Jonathan Singer (AAI '70) came to UCSD from Yale University in 1961 to join the new Department of Biology, where his research led to the fluid mosaic model of the cell membrane. 6 Fewer than 25 years after admitting its rst class of undergraduates, UCSD was one of the top recipients of NIH funding, ranking 16 th out of 1,636 institutions in 1987, with $73 million in grants.7 Scripps Research The establishment of UCSD on Torrey Pines Mesa opened up new possibilities for other institutions, and Scripps moved quickly to stake a claim of its own. The director, Edmund Keeney, wanted to transform the small clinic into \"a Rockefeller Institute of the West Coast.\" 8 To launch the new Division of Experimental Pathology in 1961, Scripps recruited Frank J. Dixon (AAI '50, president 1971-1972) and the rest of the \"Pittsburgh Five,\" a group of immunologists from the University of Pittsburgh. Dixon, William O. Weigle (AAI '57), Charles (AAI '59) brought several postdocs and other laboratory staff with them to La Jolla, forming the foundation of immunological research at Scripps. 9 By 1970, Dixon was the chair of biomedical operations at Scripps and, in 1974, he was made director of the entire research institute. Under his leadership all operations were consolidated at the new Torrey Pines campus in 1980. Since the arrival of the Pittsburgh Five in La Jolla, Scripps has consistently employed the largest number of AAI members in the San Diego area. Salk Institute Seeking a suitable spot in California to found his new institute, Jonas Salk was initially leaning toward the San Francisco Bay area. On a scouting visit to Palo Alto, Salk got to know Melvin Cohn (AAI '51; remembered on page 58 of this issue), then a recent arrival at Stanford, as they drove around looking at potential sites. When Revelle invited Salk to La Jolla, however, he was impressed not only with the beauty of Torrey Pines Mesa, but also the opportunity to join a nascent community of research institutions. 10 Unfortunately for Revelle, Salk successfully convinced the city of San Diego to grant him a prime strip of 27 acres overlooking the Pacific Ocean that Revelle had hoped would go to UCSD, leading to a bitter public conflict. 11 Funding from the March of Dimes allowed construction of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to begin in 1962.

Cohn was part of the inaugural cohort of six resident fellows hand selected by Salk and was also one of the organizers of the landmark 1965 Antibody Workshop in Warner Springs. At that gathering just outside of San Diego, immunologists and molecular biologists found common ground\u2014and the modern direction of immunology took shape.12 Legacy The founding of the \"big three\" institutions on Torrey Pines Mesa\u2014Scripps, UCSD, and Salk\u2014 established a beachhead for bioscience research in San Diego. Others quickly followed. In 1976, what is now known as the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute was founded as the La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation. More recently, the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, founded in 1989 by has grown rapidly to become the professional home to one of the region's largest contingents of AAI member researchers. Over the past 40 years, San Diego has also become a major hub for the biotech industry. In 1978, UCSD professor Ivor Royston launched the region's first biotech company, Hybritech, which was a pioneer in the use of monoclonal antibodies. The company' s alumni have gone on to found dozens of other rms in San Diego. 13 AAI members have founded or conducted research at more than 100 biotech companies in the area, which today include BioLegend, BD Pharmingen, Thermo Fisher Scientic, AnaptysBio, Arena Pharmaceuticals, and NantKwest. In 1989, Ralph Reisfeld (AAI '67) noted one obvious measure of the success of immunology and biomedical research in San Diego. Scientists, as he put it, no longer had to ask how to spell \"La Jolla.\"14 1. Ellen Browning Scripps (1836-1932) with her brother E.W. Scripps founded the largest newspaper chain in the United States in the early 20th century. She became one of the largest philanthropists in Southern California with her fortune that was over $3 billion in today's money. In addition to the Marine Biological Laboratory and Scripps Memorial Hospital and Scripps Metabolic Clinic, she helped establish or fund Scripps College and the Torrey Pines State Reserve, among others. 2.

Although the city is a relatively new center for the eld, it has long roots in biological research and has rapidly become an important hub of innovation. In the March/April 2019 issue of the AAI Newsletter, we looked at the pioneers of immunology on Torrey Pines Mesa. Here, drawing on the IMMUNOLOGY 2019 history exhibit, we explore additional aspects of immunological history in San Diego. The Growth of Immunology in San Diego The rst members of The American Association of Immunologists (AAI) in San Diego, beginning in 1961, were scientists at the Scripps Research Institute. For most of the 1960s, the only two institutions in San Diego with AAI members were Scripps and the Salk Institute. In the middle of the decade, the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), began an intense recruitment campaign to attract top scientists, including immunologists, to the institution. By the late 1970s, immunology was flourishing at all of the \"Big Three\" institutions on Torrey Pines Mesa, with the local AAI membership growing from zero to nearly 100 in less than two decades. Torrey Pines Bluff, La Jolla, c. 1948 Milo Woodbridge Williams Photographs, UCSD Map of biotech companies with AAI members in San Diego AAISquare in midtown, San Diego, c. 1941 Library of Congress 122 AAI History Compendium (2021)The local biotechnology industry was born in 1978 with the founding of Hybritech and quickly became represented in the AAI membership. Hybritech, founded by UCSD professor Ivor Royston (AAI '81), was a pioneer in the use of monoclonal antibodies, and its alums have gone on to found dozens of other rms in San Diego, such as Dura, IDEC, and Viagene. By 1990, AAI was represented at over a dozen companies in San Diego. That number doubled by the turn of the century. AAI members have founded or conducted research at more than 100 biotech companies in the area, which today include BioLegend, BD PharMingen, Thermo Fisher Scientic, AnaptysBio, Arena Pharmaceuticals, and NantKwest. The last two decades have been marked by diversication in research opportunities, as new biotech rms and research institutes were founded, and joint centers and partnerships between institutions on the mesa were established. AAI members are now well represented at a variety of research environments in San Diego, with the largest numbers at UCSD, Scripps Research, and the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. Distinguished Members Once Frank Dixon (AAI '50, president 1971-72) and the rest of the \"Pittsburgh Five\" arrived at Scripps Research in 1961, and Jonas Salk (AAI '47) established the Salk Institute, San Diego began to attract many distinguished AAI members. The rst AAI president to serve his term in San Diego was Karl Habel (AAI '52, president 1969-70) who, following a long tenure at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was recruited in 1967 to continue his research and teaching at Scripps and UCSD. Richard Dutton (AAI '63, president 1995-96) came to La Jolla from London in 1962, initially to perform research at Scripps before moving his laboratory to UCSD in 1968, where he spent almost three decades conducting research using in vitro studies of the antibody response and T cell response. Jonathan Sprent (AAI '80, president 1998-99) arrived at Scripps in 1984, where for nearly two decades he conducted research elucidating the role of the T cell. The most recent president from San Diego is Linda Sherman (AAI '81, president 2014-15) who, since joining Scripps in 1978, has made discoveries connected to the interface between autoimmunity and tumor immunity. In addition to these past presidents, San Diego has also been home to Joseph Feldman (AAI '63, EIC 1971-87), the second longest serving editor-in-chief of Immunology; Mitchell Kronenberg (AAI '84, secretary-treasurer 2009-15), who since 2003 has been president and chief science ofcer at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI); recipients of the AAI Excellence in Mentoring Award Norman R. Klinman (AAI '67) in 2006 and Michael B.A. Oldstone(AAI '70) in 2011; and members of the inaugural class of theDistinguished Fellows of AAI and Sherman. Institutions The expansion of immunology in San Diego included the establishment of independent non-prot research institutes beginning in the 1970s. Three of the earliest that brought many AAI members to San Diego were the La Jolla Cancer Research Institute (now the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute), the Medical Biology Institute, and the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology (now the La Jolla Institute for Immunology). Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute was established when William and Lillian Fishman left Tufts University, set off for San Diego in 1976 with a $180,000 planning grant from the National Cancer Institute, and founded the La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation. 1 The early pioneers on Torrey Pines Mesa made the Fishmans feel at home: the Scripps Research Institute provided laboratory space for the fledgling foundation, and Jonas Salk visited to offer an electron microscope. 2 In 1979, Erkki Ruoslahti (AAI '77) joined the foundation and, under his leadership, it grew rapidly and produced many innovations in cancer immunology, particularly in the area of extracellular matrix proteins. 3 John C. Reed (AAI '97) made important discoveries of the proteins involved in apoptosis and their mechanism in Linda A. Sherman, c. 2014 AAI Richar d W.

Ellen Browning Scripps was the embodiment of the American Dream and the new dynamism of women in the early 20th century. An immigrant, journalist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, she became one of the most important leaders in the creation and development of San Diego scientic and educational institutions. Scripps was born October 18, 1836, in London, England. When she was seven, she emigrated with her family to Rushville, Illinois. Scripps matriculated at Knox College, one of the few institutions of higher learning to admit women, where she studied science and mathematics and earned her certicate in 1859 (no diplomas were awarded to women at that time). While at Knox she witnessed, on October 7, 1858, one of the Abraham Lincoln-Stephen A. Douglas debates. She laterreturned to Rushville and becamea teacher. After the Civil War, Scripps moved to Detroit to work in the family business, The Detroit Evening News, the newspaper that launched the Scripps publishing empire. There, she acted as a proofreader and writer of front-page features that included columns on women's suffrage and prohibition. She built a fortune by investing her own money in, and advising, the Scripps Publishing Company run by her brother, E. W. Scripps. The company soon grew to become the largest newspaper chain in the United States, with major papers rst in the Midwest and then Western cities. In the early 1890s, Ellen and E.W. bought land in San Diego (Miramar Ranch), where they lived until 1897 when she built a seaside cottage in La Jolla. By the rst decade of the new century, Scripps had become a pillar of the local community, engaged personally and philanthropically in a growing number of progressive causes.Scripps' philanthropic interests were focused almost exclusively on educational and scientic endeavors. In San Diego, she helped establish or fund the Bishop's School; La Jolla Woman's Club; Birch Aquarium at Scripps); San Diego Zoo; and many museums, libraries, and arts programs. Outside of San Diego, she founded Scripps College in Claremont, California, and was benefactor of educational and scientic programs as far away as Cleveland, Ohio. Additionally, Scripps helped establish two world-renowned scientic institutions located in San Diego\u2014Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Scripps Research. Scripps Institution of Oceanography Initially established in June 1903 as the Marine Biological Association (MBA) of San Diego, the independent research laboratory was funded by Ellen and E. W. for its rst decade, which included a move to its current location in La Jolla and construction of its rst permanent laboratory. Individually, Ellen bequeathed $150,000 in 1909 to support a permanent location in La Jolla, and from 1913 to 1916 donated $130,000 for the construction of additional campus facilities, including the iconic pier. 1 In 1912, after the MBA deeded its property to the University of California Board of Regents, the facility was renamed Scripps Institution for Biological Research; the current name was conferred in October 1925. Ellen Browning Scripps, 1919 Scripps Institution of Oceanography Photographs, UCSD Scripps Institution of Oceanography Scripps Institution of Oceanography Photographs, UCSDDowntown San Diego, c.1915 Library of Congress 124 AAI History Compendium (2021)Scripps Research In 1924, inspired in part by the revolutionary discovery of insulin by Frederick Banting and Charles Best in the early 1920s, Scripps founded the Scripps Memorial Hospital (now Scripps Health) and, within it, the Scripps Metabolic Clinic, a research facility with the mission to investigate and treat diseases, especially diabetes. When Scripps died in 1932, she left the clinic $300,000 (~$5.5 million today) \"preferably for research.\" 2 In 1946, the clinic separated from the hospital and began to build new research facilities and recruit scientists. Today it is known as Scripps Research. On February 22, 1926, Scripps became one of the rst women to appear on the cover of Time magazine, which recognized her for her many philanthropic efforts and called her the \"most beloved woman in Southern California.\" It is estimated that her lifetime donations amounted to over $36 million in 2018 dollars. Scripps died at her home in La Jolla on August 3, 1932, a few weeks before her 96th birthday. 1 Elizabeth Shor, Deborah Day, Kevin Hardy, and Dora Dalton, \"Scripps Timeline,\" Oceanography 16, no. 3 (2003), 111-12. 2 Mary Lindenstein Walshok and Abraham J.

The advances made by researchers at the foundation attracted the attention of generous donors, prompting several name changes over the years; it has been known as Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute since 2015. The Medical Biology Institute (MBI) was founded in 1982 on the Torrey Pines Mesa by David Katz (AAI '72), a former Scripps researcher, and within a few years had provided the eld with an invaluable tool. In 1988, a research group at MBI led by Donald Mosier (AAI '69) was one of the rst to create a functioning immune system in a mouse. 4 Using the severe combined immunodeciency mouse that Melvin Bosma (AAI '96) had developed in 1983, Mosier's team injected human peripheral blood leukocytes into the peritoneal tissue of the mouse's chest, creating mice that could produce human antibodies. 5 The La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) has quickly grown to become one of the top three employers of AAI members in San Diego. Founded in 1988 as the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology by a group of scientists from academia and industry, LJI began laboratory operations the next year with the arrival of Kimishige University. Kimishige Ishizaka was appointed president and scientic director of the institute in 1991. In subsequent years, LJI has been led by AAI members Howard Grey (AAI '65) and Kronenberg. From the very beginning, LJI has maintained the world's longest running industry-academic partnership in its collaboration with the Japanese pharmaceutical rm Kyowa Kirin Pharmaceutical Research. The rm has rst negotiating rights to translate basic research discoveries stemming from those Institute projects that it funds. 6 In La Jolla, the Institute and company share adjoining laboratory facilities on the edge of the UCSD campus. The growth and diversication of immunology research in San Diego has probably far exceeded the dreams of Frank Dixon and the Pittsburgh Five when they arrived to set up the rst immunology laboratories in San Diego. Nearly six decades later, the city is a thriving hub of immunology investigation and discovery at its many research centers and biotech companies. 1 \"Building a Foundation: Q&A with Lillian Fishman,\" San Diego Union-Tribune, April 27, 2013. 2 \"Building a Foundation.\" 3 Kathryn Philips, \"Closing in on Cancer,\" Los Angeles Times Magazine, February 19, 1989, 16. 4 The other team that made a similar innovation at the same time was led by Irving L.

In his last weeks, Major Weil had worked tirelessly to ght successive, overlapping epidemics of measles and pneumonia among the World War I draftees, mostly rural and fresh off the train, until he nally succumbed himself. At its next meeting in March 1918, the AAI Council issued a resolution expressing sorrow and honoring Weil for both his \"unwearying labors in his chosen eld\" and his untimely death in the line of duty. 1 Childhood and Education Born in 1876, Richard Weil came from a well-to-do family with many ties to New York City society and the local Jewish community. Both of his parents had immigrated to the United States from Bohemia in the early 1850s and quickly found comfortable employment. Leopold Weil was a broker at the United States Custom House, and his wife Matilda ran a prominent Jewish girls boarding school. \"Mrs. Leopold Weil 's School\" educated students from wealthy families all over the country in English, French, German, and Hebre w. Richard was the seventh of eight Weil children who grew up in a series of houses on the U pper West Side of Manhattan that also served at various times as Matilda's classrooms and as home to her extended famil y, several student boarders, and a sizable domestic staff. A gifted student, Weil matriculated at Columbia University where he earned an A.B. at 20 years of age. He immediately continued on to the College of Physicians and Surgeons where he earned his medical degree in 1900.2 Upon graduation from medical school, Weil began a two-year residency at the German Hospital in New York City .3 He then travelled to Europe where he continued his training in laboratories and clinics at the universities of Vienna and Leipzig.4 Shortly after returning to N ew York City in 1904, Weil married Minnie Straus, the daughter of Macy 's co-owner Isidor Straus.5 His return also coincided with accepting a position at Cornell University Medical College (no w Weill Cornell Medicine). He taught Weil's father worked as a customs broker at the Merchant's Exchange Building (now the National City Bank Building) at 55 Wall Street. Photo ca. 1899-1919.

His publications appear diverse\u2014cancer, cobra venom, and blood transfusions\u2014but were fundamentally an exploration of understanding hemolysis. He investigated methods to identify evidence of early stages of cancers circulating in the blood and the effect of cobra venom on human blood, and was the rst to demonstrate the feasibility of \"icebox\" (refrigerated) storage of blood for transfusion. 7 Cancer, however, was the primary focus of his early research. In addition to his work on devising a blood test for cancer, he examined the hemolytic reactions of cancer, tumor immunology in rats, and the effects of novel experimental cancer treatments including radium. Owing to his investigative work, Weil became a charter member of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in 1907. 8 By 1912, Weil's focus began to pivot away from cancer towards anaphylaxis. Although he still authored the occasional article on cancer research, the preponderance of his publications until his death related to his ongoing experiments supporting the cellular mechanisms of anaphylaxis. His ndings ran counter to the humoral theory then dominating American scientic thought. 9 His 22-part series on the topic, which only ended upon his enlistment in the Army, proved prescient as discoveries in the 1960s veried the cellular mechanism of anaphylaxis. The series also proved influential to a new eld of science\u2014immunology\u2014as the editors of The Journal of Immunology (The JI) selected parts 14 through 17 as the rst articles published in its inaugural issue. 10 The Beebe Affair Following his early successes, Weil found himself thrust into the national scientic spotlight when he became embroiled in controversy over a purported cancer treatment at Cornell. In 1915, he was involved in a trial on the validity of \"autolysin,\" a \"liquid extract of vegetable origin\" as a cancer cure. 11 The primary investigator of the initial study in 1912 was Silas P . Beebe, a Cornell physiological chemist and a founder of the AACR. Beebe claimed the miracle drug could, with just a few injections, produce \"consistent improvement\" in inoperable and previously incurable cancers. 12 He also announced\u2014in the pages of the New York Times\u2014his intention to move forward with the treatment commercially. 13 Weil's demonstration that autolysin was not a credible treatment for cancer, coupled with Beebe's push to commercialize the drug, resulted in Cornell asking Beebe to resign from his position as professor of experimental therapeutics, and the department was abolished. Furthermore, scientic societies asked for his resignation or no longer published his science. 14 Following Beebe's departure, Weil found himself the target of numerous inquiries about the promised effects of autolysin. In response, he published a scathing rebuttal in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), showing that\u2014contrary to Beebe's Isidor and Ida Straus with their family in Elberon, N.J., September 1905.

Out of a job, Beebe was enraged by the challenge and excoriated Weil in JAMA, accusing him of \"willfully misrepresent[ing]\" the study and not \"acting solely from good motives.\" 16 Because autolysin possessed none of the capabilities Beebe had ascribed to it, Weil emerged from the imbroglio with increased national credibility as a scientist. AAI and The JI In addition to his research, Weil offered his service to scientic societies. He was instrumental in recruiting early AAI members and helping select the initial editorial board of The JI in 1915. 17 The next year, he became the founding editor of AACR's The Journal of Cancer Research, the rst English-language cancer journal. Weil also served as the third president of AAI (1916-1917). In keeping with the bylaws at the time, Weil was to serve on the AAI Council until 1924, but when the United States ofcially joined the First World War on April 6, 1917, he resigned his position and was commissioned as an ofcer in the U.S. Army Medical Corps. His rst posting at Fort Benjamin Harrison, northeast of Indianapolis, Indiana, was brief. He was quickly promoted to major and detailed to Georgia's Camp Wheeler 18 as the chief of medical staff. At Wheeler, a newly constructed U.S. Army National Guard mobilization and training camp near Macon, Weil experienced a world vastly different\u2014scientically and socially\u2014from New York City. The Great War and Camp Wheeler Camp Wheeler was a temporary 21,000-acre tent camp rapidly built on drained swampland in the spring and summer of 1917. The training camp and mobilization center, which opened in August, 19 housed both white and black men from Georgia, Alabama,Florida, and parts of Virginia. 20 Most of the recruits came from rural areas where they were less likely than soldiers from cities to have been exposed to many communicable diseases. At the same time, they were more likely to be infected by endemic parasites, such as hookworm, that compromised their immune systems. When Macon's coldest winter in 40 years hit, the Army was unprepared: the men were not equipped with sufciently warm clothing, the camp lacked winter tents, and conscripts were kept in close quarters at all times to keep warm. Because of this, Wheeler was presented with signicant challenges to preventing communicable diseases, like the flu. These conditions collectively paved the way for a serious outbreak of measles at the close of 1917. According to Colonel Victor C. Vaughan (AAI 1915), then the chief of the Army's Division of Communicable Diseases, \"Not a troop train came into Camp Wheeler...in the fall of 1917 without bringing from one to six cases of measles already in the eruptive stage.\" 21 In addition, 60-70% of recruits were infected with hookworm, which often results in vitamin A deciency that increases susceptibility to both measles and pneumonia. The measles patients not only had weakened immune systems, but they also were brought together in the hospital tents where their coughs could further spread pneumococcus. 22 It was a perfect storm for igniting an epidemic. Among the approximately 20,000 recruits at the camp,23 there were 522 cases of measles in October 1917, and 2,421 the next month. In this already compromised population, an epidemic of pneumonia struck next, with 84 cases in October and 452 in November. About a quarter of the men admitted with pneumonia in these two months died. Conditions in the camp were bad enough that in Macon, rumors began flying of dozens of men dying in a single night. 24 Weil dedicated himself tirelessly to caring for the sick, but by November 11, 1917, he had fallen ill himself. When word of Weil's illness reached his home in New York, his wife Minnie immediately traveled to Georgia with a specialist from New York to be by his side and assist in his care. Also present on the medical staff was a fellow AAI member, Ernest G. Stillman (AAI 1930), who had been sent to Wheeler to help ght the pneumonia epidemic. 25 Weil's condition quickly worsened, however, and he died after eight days of illness. The governors of two states made visits to Wheeler to investigate claims of poor medical facilities. Both Governor Hugh Dorsey of Georgia, who toured the camp while Weil lay on his sickbed, and Governor Charles Henderson of Alabama, who arrived the week after Weil's death, found that under Weil, the medical staff had performed admirably. 26 Camp Wheeler, 1918 National Archives Silas P. Beebe, ca. 1908 Courtesy of the American Association for Cancer Research www.aai.org 129On November 23, Surgeon General William C. Gorgas, accompanied by William H. Welch and Victor C. Vaughan, arrived at the camp to evaluate the medical situation. By this time, additional medical staff had also been brought in. There were now 280 doctors battling the epidemics at Wheeler. Gorgas explained to a concerned press that the cause of the measles epidemic was a lack of \"resisting power\" to the disease among the new recruits from rural areas who had not previously been exposed. He added that \"a young man who wants to be a soldier should contrive to have his measles when he is a child.\" 27 Out of all the U.S. Army camps in 1917, Wheeler had the highest rates of admissions for measles and lobar pneumonia, leading to the second highest death rate in the Army and National Guard. 28 To combat epidemics at the camps hardest hit by these diseases, Army medical staff began to keep patients separated in cubicles formed by sheets hung from frames between their beds. This practice proved successful enough that the Surgeon General's ofce recommended that it be continued and used more generally\u2014an important innovation when the influenza pandemic hit the next year. 29 Influenza Prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, influenza was not a reportable disease in the general public, but the Army began to track the number of influenza cases among the troops as soon as the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917. Most training camps saw hundreds of unremarkable cases that year, like any other flu season. At Wheeler, there were 685 cases of influenza in the last three months of 1917, but none produced complications and not a single man died. 30 The influenza pandemic began quietly on March 4, 1918, at Camp Funston in Kansas, among men from nearby Haskell County. 31 By April, and half a country away, 1,967 cases of influenza were reported at Wheeler\u2014a few with complications\u2014but there were still no fatalities from the disease. 32 In the late spring of 1918, this initial spike in cases was not seen as the rst wave in a global pandemic, but the ofcial report from the Surgeon General described it as an epidemic. When the most signicant wave of pandemic influenza came in autumn of 1918, Camp Wheeler was relatively well prepared for it. Hoping to stave off a repeat of the autumn 1917 pneumonia epidemic, Russel L. Cecil (AAI 1920) and Henry F . Vaughan went to Wheeler in September 1918 to begin a large study on prophylactic vaccination for pneumonia. They vaccinated 13,460 men against pneumococcus Types I, II, and III, and were able to demonstrate an effective immune response before their work was cut short by the appearance of influenza. 33 Notably, their research showed that while overall mortality from pneumonia was signicantly lower among those vaccinated, mortality from pneumonia secondary to influenza was unaffected. Initially, the camp was placed under quarantine following reports of influenza both in the local civilian population and at other military camps. Nationwide, 40,000 cases of influenza among soldiers had been Army health charts detailing morbidity rates for measles and pneumonia at training camps including Camp Wheeler, October 1918-March 1919 National ArchivesPictured from left: Vaughan, Gorgas, and Welch University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library 130 AAI History Compendium (2021)reported by the end of September. Up to that point, Wheeler was publically considered free of influenza, but on the 28 th of the month, camp ofcials acknowledged that their rst cases had been admitted to the base hospital. The lessons learned in the measles and pneumonia epidemics of 1917 seem to have had a positive effect on Wheeler's preparedness for pandemic influenza. Having already experienced one of the worst battles with communicable disease among all the Army camps, Wheeler's medical staff was practiced at identifying and isolating patients who displayed dangerous symptoms. Exact comparisons to other camps are unfortunately impossible; unlike their counterparts at the vast majority of Army camps, Wheeler's physicians made an ofcial diagnosis of influenza only upon a laboratory nding of Pfeiffer's bacillus (Haemophilus influenzae [then known as Bacillus influenza]), at the time thought to be the cause of influenza. Because the bacterial infection does not always present in every instance of influenza, this practice would have ignored many actual cases of the disease. Even with this administrative discrepancy, however, the records show that Wheeler experienced signicantly lower than average rates of admission and death for all respiratory diseases in 1918. Tribute to Richard Weil Richard Weil's funeral was held with military honors at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan on November 23, 1917. The respect the young physician-scientist commanded among his peers was evident in the men who served as his honorary pallbearers. They included Rufus Cole (AAI 1917, president 1920-21), director of the Rockefeller Institute; William M. Polk, dean of the medical school at Cornell; William B. Coley, father of cancer immunotherapy; and Arthur F . Coca (AAI 1916, The JI editor-in-chief 1916-48); as well as several other prominent physicians, scientists, businessmen, and bankers. Weil is remembered for his remarkable and selfless service to his country and his seminal contributions to the eld of immunology. His service during World War I and his efforts to address Camp Wheeler's medical problems demonstrated the important role immunologists played during this challenging period. 1 Kolmer, Synnott, and Hitchens, \"Resolutions upon the Death of Dr. Richard Weil,\" March 30, 1918. 2 As the son of Jewish immigrants, Weil was fortunate to get his education before Columbia and many other U.S. universities ins tituted restrictive quotas that limited the number of Jewish students in the early 20th century. 3 The German Hospital was renamed Lenox Hill Hospital in 1918 to tie it to its location as well as distance it from any associa tion to Germany during World War I. 4 \"Major R.

Wollstein's conclusion was a call to action advocating for more opportunities for women in all aspects of medicine. She declared that the current generation was the rst to have \"entered societies and laboratories for the benet of all.\" 1 Wollstein spoke in an era when women in science and medicine were viewed by many in the scientic community as inferior to their male counterparts. They were not generally provided the same rights and privileges as men in the laboratory or clinic. Medical societies typically banned women or elected only a token few, sometimes to a lower member status than men. By contrast, from the time of its founding ve years after Wollstein's speech, The American Association of Immunologists had no gender restrictions, and women and men alike were elected as full members. To mar k Wome n's History Month in March 2020, we prole ve women immunologists who in the early decades of the 20th century persevered in the elds of bacteriolog y, serolog y, public health, pediatric patholog y, and drug dev elopment. They moved the science of immunology forward while simultaneously opening the eld to future female immunologists. These pioneers are Mar tha Wollstein 1931), and Jessie Marmorston (AAI 1932). These women were at very different career stages when they joined AAI; most were immigrants or rst-generation Americans, and all were accomplished immunologists. Given gaps in the historical record, they also represent other trailblazing women scientists of their era whose lives and accomplishments have been lost to histor y. Martha Wollstein, M.D. (1868-1939) Martha Wollstein (AAI 1918) was an accomplished physician, researche r, and the \"rst North American pediatric pathologist\" when she became one of the rst women elected to active AAI Babies Hospital, c. 1876-1914 New York Historical AAI: Five Women Pioneers in Immunology AAI is dedicated to preserving the historical accounts of women who influenced the eld of immunology. Thank you to John Emrich, Ph.D., and Charles Richter, M.Phil., of the AAI Ofce of History for their tireless research for and preparation of this article. www.aai.org 133membership in 1918.2 She was born in New York City on November 21, 1868, to German Jewish immigrant parents who encouraged her education. Wollstein received her M.D. in 1889 from the Woman's Medical College of the New York Inrmary, 3 interned at Babies Hospital,4 and in 1891 was appointed its pathologist\u2014a unique position for a woman of that time because it allowed her to practice the full scope of pathology, including patient care, bench research, and autopsies. Her clinical and basic research at Babies Hospital included malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and typhoid fever. But it was her investigation of the bacterial causes of infant diarrhea that rst caught the attention of the scientic community, including Simon Flexner (AAI 1920), the recently appointed rst director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (RIMR). In 1903, Wollstein isolated Shiga bacillus, which only three years prior had been shown to cause dysentery, in some of her patients. 5 Flexner, whose research focused on dysentery in the Philippines,6 was so impressed by her research that he offered her a position as an assistant researcher at RIMR in 1906. In her concurrent position at RIMR, most of Wollstein's research was non-pediatric in nature, with the exception of polio research with Flexner. 7 She maintained her duties and pediatric research at Babies Hospital, including publishing an important, three-part series on the incidence and clinical effects of TB in babies. This was the rst study to provide data specic to childhood TB. 8 At RIMR, her signicant collaborations included developing methods and protocols to create anti-meningitis serum with Harold Amoss (AAI 1917) 9 and streptococcal and bronchopneumonia studies with Samuel J. Meltzer. The latter collaboration would influence measles researchers generally, and the streptococcal research would become the life's work of one of her successors at RIMR: Rebecca Lanceeld (AAI 1931, president 1961-62). 10 With the outbreak of the influenza pandemic of 1918, Wollstein became intimately involved with the influenza research at RIMR because of her earlier research on the development of a Pfeiffer's bacillus serum. 11 At the time, Pfeiffer's bacillus (today known as Haemophilus influenza) was considered widely to be the causative agent for influenza, although new studies were beginning to question the accuracy of this belief. Wollstein's work provided additional evidence that the prevailing hypothesis was incorrect and that the bacillus was a secondary infection. 12 Wollstein's core research remained focused on childhood diseases, and in the late summer of 1918, she published her most influential discovery on the etiology of mumps. 13 The popular medical consensus held that a type of coccus was the causative agent of mumps because it was isolated from the blood, saliva, and fluid aspirated from the swollen parotid gland. Wollstein's research denitively concluded that mumps was not bacterial but viral in nature. In 1921, after RIMR did not extend an offer to her to join the staff on a permanent basis, she returned full time as the pediatric pathologist at Babies Hospital and devoted her research to pediatric diseases, including leukemia, TB, influenza, and meningitis. During her career, Wollstein published more than 60 scientic papers and won numerous honors, including an appointment as head of the pediatric section of the New York Academy of Science (1928) and election to the American Pediatric Society (1930) as its rst female member. 14 Olga Povitzky, M.D. (1877-1948) Olga Raissa Povitzky (AAI 1920) had a 41-year research career with the New York City Department of Health\u2014remarkable for a woman who came to Philadelphia from Lithuania as a 16-year-old girl on her own, speaking only Russian. Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research Lab Staff (Wollstein middle row, rst on left) Rockefeller Archive Center Postcard of Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania, 1906 134 AAI History Compendium (2021)Povitzky joined her older brother Charles, a druggist who had immigrated two years earlier. 15 She learned both English and medicine at the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania (now part of Drexel University College of Medicine). 16 She managed to overcome the language barrier, but later recalled an incident in which she was asked what she thought of a lecture on Darwin and replied\u2014without meaning to make a pun\u2014\"I did not understand it very well but there seemed to be a lot of monkey business in it.\" 17 Povitzky completed her M.D. in 1901 and briefly maintained a private practice in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, before moving to New York City, where she spent the rest of her life. She became a U.S. citizen in 1904. She earned a doctorate in public health from N ew York University (NYU) in 1905 and that same year began her research in the Health Department laboratories, initially working on equine glanders, a contagious bacterial infection that created nodular legions primarily in the lungs and skin.18 She was also an active lecturer on public health at NYU. Povitzky was politically active, donating to the socialist magazine The New Review and advocating for wome n's suffrage. During the F irst World War, she joined the rst contingent of the Wome n's Oversea Hospitals, sponsored by the National Amer ican Woman Suffrage Association. In February 1918, she set sail for the war zone in France with a group of 30 other women that included nurses, a plumber, a carpenter, a chemist, drivers, and ve other physicians. The male French military surgeons initially viewed the women with suspicion, but only briefl y. A day after their arrival at the eld hospital, it was suddenly flooded with 650 wounded from a German advance . The women \"did not stand on their dignity but did whatever needed to be done,\" including cutting off bloody bandages, giving injections, and preparing wounded soldiers for surger y. Povitzky was then sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris to receive specialized training in gas gangrene. She spent the rest of the war at the Laboratoire d'Epidemiologie at Le M ans \"doing all the bacteriological, physiological, and chemical examination for the military hospitals of Sarthe, Mayenne, Eure et Loire and Orne.\"19 After the war, Povitzky returned to the N ew York City Department of Health, where for several years she oversaw the manufacture of diphtheria antitoxin in the laboratory of William H. Park (AAI 1916, president 1918-19). She also studied H. influenzae, experimenting with a serum that could cure meningitis caused by this bacterium.20 Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, she published in The Journal of Immunology 21 and other journals, primarily on developments that rened production techniques for diphtheria toxoid and antitoxin, and also on pertussis. In the 1930s, Povitzky designed a rectangular two-liter Pyrex culture bottle for diphtheria antitoxin production that was later adopted in a larger ve-liter size as the standard vessel for the Salk polio vaccine. The durable \"Povitsky bottle\" proved ideal for culturing poliovirus in a custom-made rocking rack. 22 She remained active in the laboratory until just two years before her death in 1948. Winifred Ashby, Ph.D. (1879-1975) immunology while conducting research for her Ph.D. dissertation.23 This work led her to develop the rst technique to determine red blood cell lifespan in humans. The Ashby technique (or Ashby method) was a major step in increasing the efcacy of blood transfusions and the management of chronic anemia. The technique saved countless lives during World War II because it was the primary First Contingent of Women's Oversea Hospitals, c. 1918 (Povitzky front row, third from right) National Archives Winifred Ashby National Library of Medicine www.aai.org 135method to assess the storage and shipping of blood for transfusion required for the war effort. By the late 1960s, the Ashby technique of differential agglutination was replaced by radioisotope-tagging of red blood cells, which was safer, easier, and provided a higher degree of precision and accuracy. 24 Ashby and her family emigrated from England to Chicago when she was 14. She earned her B.S. from the University of Chicago (1903) and an M.S. from Washington University in St. Louis (1905). While at Washington University, Ashby became interested in immunology, but did not immediately enter the eld. Instead, over the next 12 years, she travelled to the Philippines to study malnutrition, taught high school physics and chemistry, and worked in laboratories at Rush Medical College and the Illinois Central Hospital. In February 1917, she began a Mayo Foundation fellowship in immunology and pathology. 25 Her research at the Mayo Foundation tested the widely accepted theory that the lifespan of an average human erythrocyte was two to three weeks. Ashby set out to determine the lifespan of transfused red blood cells in patients, adopting the technique that would come to bear her name. It was based on the fact that type AB, A, or B blood cells (Group I, II, and III in her terminology) will agglutinate when treated with serum from a person of another blood type, while type O blood cells (Group IV) lacking ABO antigens will not agglutinate. Ashby transfused patients of blood type A, B, or AB with type O blood and then treated blood specimens in vitro with anti-A or anti-B serum, which would agglutinate the blood cells of the patient but not those of the blood donor. She determined that counts of unagglutinated cells from the specimens correlated with the number of transfused blood cells present in the recipient's circulation, and that the transfused cells could persist for 30 days or more. 26 Further research proved that a red blood cell could circulate for up to 110 days.27Following her graduation from the University of Minnesota in 1921, Ashby became a researcher in the division of experimental bacteriology at the Mayo Foundation; in 1923 she became a member of the Mayo Clinic staff. In 1924 Ashby accepted a position as an immunologist at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., where she supervised the serology and bacteriology laboratories. While at St. Elizabeths, Ashby's research initially focused on immunology, pathology, and hematology. Later in her career, she also studied brain and central nervous system enzyme chemistry, notably carbonic anhydrase and patterns of enzyme distribution in brain functions. She ofcially retired in 1949, though she remained at St. Elizabeths as a guest researcher until 1958. 28 Eleanor Bliss, Sc.D. (1899-1987) The research that Eleanor Albert Bliss (AAI 1931) performed with sulfanilamide drugs saved the lives of countless soldiers in World War II, as well as that of the U.S. president's son. Her work with fellow Johns Hopkins University professor Perrin H. Long uncovered numerous uses for the sulfa compounds and launched antibacterials into the public consciousness. Bliss grew up in Baltimore and attended Bryn Mawr College, receiving her A.B. in 1921, and then continued to Johns Hopkins where she earned her Sc.D. in 1925. She immediately joined the Hopkins faculty as a fellow in medicine. Early in her career, she worked on influenza and whooping cough but soon turned her attention to ghting streptococcal infections. In 1934 she and Long isolated minute beta hemolytic streptococci that would be classied as the Lanceeld group F . 29 Bliss's scientic epiphany came when she traveled to London in July 1936 to attend the Second International Congress of Microbiology. There, she learned of Leonard Colebrook's (AAI 1915) rst clinical study to treat haemolytic streptococcus using the recently created sulfa drug Prontosil. Colebrook's research proved that Prontosil A chemistry laboratory in St. Elizabeths Hospital, c. 1910 National Library of Medicine Eleanor Bliss, 1942 Richmond Times Dispatch; Newspapers.com 136 AAI History Compendium (2021)was the rst synthetic drug to effectively treat a range of bacterial infections in humans and rendered a particularly strong response to streptococcal infections. 30 Bliss and Long immediately requested samples of Prontosil for their own research, and by that September had successfully treated a seven-year-old girl for erysipelas (a streptococcal infection of the skin and supercial lymphatics) with p-aminobenzenesulfonamide (PABS, or sulfanilamide), one of the intermediate molecules of Prontosil. That November, Bliss and Long presented their preliminary ndings at the meeting of the Southern Medical Association in Baltimore. In December, the team achieved its rst successful treatment of streptococcal meningitis, which previously had a nearly 100% mortality rate. 31 Days later, front-page news broke that the president's son, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr., had also been cured of a lethal streptococcal infection using a treatment based on Bliss and Long's ndings. 32 Within months, several clinical trials demonstrated the drug's efcacy against a broad range of infections. The next year, Bliss defended the proper use of sulfanilamide after the S. E. Massengill Company produced an \"Elixir of Sulfanilamide\" that contained toxic diethylene glycol, resulting in more than 100 deaths in 15 states. The direct result of the tragedy was the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which established more stringent safety standards for drug production and sales. 33 The Second World War proved the importance of Bliss's work. Sulfa drugs were used extensively on the battleelds and in military hospitals to treat and prevent infection and were included as part of the standard issue rst-aid kit. 34 Toward the end of the war, Bliss served as an advisor to the U.S. Army Chemical Corps (then called the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service) on defenses against biological weapons. 35Bliss remained on the faculty at Johns Hopkins until 1952, when she returned to her alma mater Bryn Mawr as professor of biology and the graduate dean. She remained there until her retirement in 1966. Jessie Marmorston, M.D. (1900-1980) From an early age, Jessie Marmorston (AAI 1932) spoke her mind and excelled at practically everything she set out to do. Born in Kyiv (then part of the Russian Empire), she arrived in the United States with her family in 1906 and settled in Buffalo, New York. Her mother's death the next year inspired her to become a doctor. 36 She had her rst job in medicine at a dentist's ofce when she was only 10 years old. 37 As a teenager, Marmorston was active in theater and debate clubs\u2014and known as \"an enthusiastic and wordy suffragette.\" 38 The powers of persuasion she developed in her youth proved useful when she convinced the Buffalo Federation of Mothers to set aside funds for her university and medical school tuition. 39 She graduated from the University of Buffalo with a pre-med degree and earned her M.D. (1924) from the University of Buffalo School of Medicine, followed by an internship at Monteore Hospital in the Bronx, New York City. There she met David Perla, also an intern, and their shared love of immunology turned into a scientic partnership. Marmorston moved to Cornell University Medical College and was briefly married to Julius Gottesman, another physician, but her professional relationship with Perla continued, eventually developing into her second marriage. The couple published two well-received books on their research before Perla died prematurely of a sudden heart attack in 1940. 40 Through Perla's social network, Marmorston had made some connections within the Hollywood lm industry, and in 1943 she moved west to take a position as assistant professor of medicine at the University of Southern California (USC). Two years later, she married lm producer Lawrence Weingarten, who would eventually produce Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. She also became the personal physician and condante of Louis B. Mayer, the co-founder of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. Marmorston used these Hollywood connections to generate funding for scholarships at USC; in 1959 she Tube of Prontosil tablets, c . 1935-1950 Science Museum, London Jessie Marmorston, 1951 National Library of Medicine www.aai.org 137Referencesarranged a benet screening of Ben-Hur that resulted in more than $100,000 in donations in a single night.41 The next year, she was elected a Fellow of the American College of Physicians and named one of 10 Women of the Year by the Los Angeles Times. 42 Socializing with lmmakers did not slow the pace of Marmorston's research in Los Angeles. Supported by several grants from the United States Public Health Service and the National Institutes of Health, she continued to publish extensively on hormonal mechanisms and their possible applications for treating cancer, heart disease, and other conditions\u2014including those related to the aging process. Her research also explored links between mental health and the immune system. Marmorston stayed at USC for the rest of her professional life, becoming professor of experimental medicine in 1953 and clinical professor of medicine in 1957. In addition to her research, she served as the supervising director of the California Foundation for Medical Research and as an attending physician at Cedars-Sinai Hospital and Los Angeles County Hospital. She was a consistent advocate for greater opportunities for women in the medical and research professions. 43 Marmorston (second from right) with Clayton G.

Following the unfortunate cancellation of the AAI annual meeting due to public health restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the History Office of AAI is pleased to present the following, expanded version of the exhibit for members and other readers of the AAI Newsletter. Bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis), responsible for the worst pandemics in history, was unknown in Hawai'i until the last days of the 19th century. When it appeared there, local government health authorities reacted swiftly and severely. The resulting quarantines and public health measures turned into a local disaster and a tragedy for Honolulu's large Chinese population. The Third Plague Pandemic When a plague outbreak began in China in 1860, triggering the world's third plague pandemic, experience from previous outbreaks in other parts of the world demonstrated that the disease was more than a substantial health threat; it was one that conveyed terror of historic proportion. Death from the disease was inevitably painful and gruesome, and depending on the virulence of the strain, fatality rates could range from 35% to 90%. The populations previously struck by pandemic bubonic plague had experienced mortality rates so high that it was difficult to count the total deaths. The Plague of Justinian (biovar Antiqua) occurred from 500 to 700 CE, peaking in 541-542, and resulted in 25-100 million deaths. The Black Death (biovar Medievalis), which occurred during the 14 th century, peaked between 1347- 1351 in Europe and resulted in 75-200 million deaths in Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. As news of the emerging outbreak in China began to spread, public health officials around the world became alarmed, particularly those in Asia and the Pacific Islands. By the mid-1890s, the third plague pandemic was well underway, traveling via overland and shipping trade routes to countries around the globe, including Hong Kong, India, Egypt, Japan, South Africa, France, Great Britain, and Australia. 1 This pandemic, however, provided researchers the ability to study the plague at the microscopic level for the first time. In 1894, bacteriologists Shibasaburo Kitasato and Alexandre Chinatown before the fire Archives HISTORYHow Honolulu's Chinatown \"Went Up in Smoke\" The First Plague Outbreak in Hawai'i, 1899-1900 Kaumakapili Church after the fire, 1900 Hawaii State Archives 140 AAI History Compendium (2021)Yersin traveled to Hong Kong to study the plague outbreaks in Asia and\u2014independently of one another\u2014managed that year to identify the bacillus responsible for the disease. 2 A year later, Paul-Louis Simond, a Pasteur researcher in Bombay, India, demonstrated that fleas were the vector that transmitted the plague bacterium. Precauti ons in Hawai'i The growing threat of plague outbreaks led the Hawaiian government (see sidebar pg. 34) to intensify inspections of all ships in Chinese and Japanese ports bound for Hawai'i. Sand Island in Honolulu Harbor became \"Quarantine Island,\" where all ships from ports where outbreaks had occurred were held for a week. 3 Initially, the measures proved effective: although plague spread throughout other Pacific islands, Hawai'i remained apparently safe. 4 Unknown to nearly everyone in Honolulu, however, plague quietly arrived in the city's harbor in June 1899 on the Japanese passenger liner Nippon Maru bound for San Francisco. The first signs had been detected at the ship's first stop in Nagasaki, where a teenage passenger died on May 26. He had no outward signs of disease, but Japanese medical officers made a diagnosis of bubonic plague by visual examination of his glands under a microscope. 5 The Nippon Maru was then held in a week-long quarantine, during which the ship was washed with carbolic acid and all its contents steamed. Only after the decontamination was it allowed to continue its voyage to Honolulu. Another passenger died on the approach to Hawai 'i, and upon the vessel 's arrival, the Hawaiian government 's bacteriologist found \"considerable numbers of a short bacillus, rounded at both ends, and like the bacillus of bubonic plague.\"6 No cargo was allowed off the ship, mainland-bound passengers were not permitted to disembark, and the few Honolulu-bound passengers were transferred to a separate quarantine ship. However, no efforts were made to prevent rats from escaping the quarantined ship. Health authorities in Honolulu decided not to make this case public.7 Chinatown, Honolulu Chine se visitations to Hawai'i date to the late 18th centur y, when Chinese sailors arrived in the islands along with the earliest European and American explorers and traders. The first permanent residents came in 1823 and, by 1840, 10% of the 400 foreigners living in Honolulu were Chinese. The rise of the sugar industry in the 1850s brought a new wave of Chinese laborers seeking work on the plantations. Most did not work the sugar fields for long; they found work on smaller farms or went into business for themselves. By 1884, 18,254 Chinese residents made up 22.7% of Hawai'i's population and represented the largest non-Hawaiian ethnic group in the islands. 8 Most Chinese in Honolulu lived and worked in the city's Chinatown, a 14-block neighborhood bordered by Honolulu Harbor to the west, Nu'uanu Stream to the north, and downtown Honolulu to the south. It was a densely populated district, home to approximately 7,000 people and many Chinese- and Japanese-owned businesses by the turn of the century. 9 Plague and Quarantine in H onolulu The first case of the flea-borne disease emerged when You Chong, a bookkeeper in Honolulu's Chinatown, fell ill on December 9, 1899, and developed telltale buboes before dying three days later. Four neighbors succumbed quickly thereafter. By that time, plague had likely been spreading quietly among the local rat population for months. Unfortunately, although the bacillus had been identified five years earlier, still very little was understood about how it behaved. 10 On December 13, Honolulu newspapers announced the threat of plague and asked for volunteers to report to the Territorial Board of Health (BoH) to begin inspections of properties. 11 Two days later, they confirmed that several people had indeed died from plague. The BoH closed inter-island ship traffic, sealed off Chinatown, and restricted travel in and out of Honolulu. A corps of volunteers began inspections to find any additional cases. Believing that plague germs could live inside walls, under floors, and amongst personal belongings, they sprayed premises with various disinfectant solutions, including sulfuric and carbolic acids. 12 When no further cases were found for a week, the quarantine was lifted on December 19. A Second Wave and Quarantine The week of Christmas, however, brought at least four new cases of plague. The BoH blamed the residents of Cordon sanitaire of Chinatown, c. Dec. 1899 - Jan. 1900 Hawai'i State Archives www.aai.org 141Chinatown for the outbreak, reflecting long-held racist stereotypes about their standards of cleanliness or the foods they ate.13 The board also distributed a multi-lingual pamphlet promoting cleanliness and citing Kitasato's research on plague.14 By 3:00 AM on December 28, National Guard troops enforced a cordon sanitaire \u2014a literal rope barrier in the streets\u2014to prevent 10,000 people from leaving the 14-block Chinatown neighborhood.15 News of the situation was slow to arrive to the mainland: on December 30, while the new quarantine was in effect, stateside newspapers proclaimed that \"bubonic plague has been stamped out in Honolulu.\"16 Sanitary Fires The situation took an ever- darker turn when the BoH, frustrated by the pace of abatement and hoping to re- open Honolulu more quickly, began setting fire to homes and businesses where plague was found. For the first three weeks of January, buildings were destroyed by \"sanitary fires\" every day. Readers of the Honolulu Advertiser could track the intentional demolition of Chinatown through maps updated daily to show which blocks had been burned or marked for burning. Inferno This tactic took a disastrous turn on January 20 when strong winds blew flying embers from one of the fires onto the wooden steeples of the recently constructed Kaumakapili Church.17 As if a spark had landed in a tinderbox, the gothic church quickly burned to the ground and flames spread to neighboring buildings. The out-of-control Chinatown inferno generated heat so intense it melted metal cookware, but the citizen guards wielding axe handles insisted on maintaining the quarantine line until the fire forced everyone to flee.18 The blaze destroyed 60 acres of Chinatown and the surrounding neighborhoods, leaving more than 4,000 people homeless and only five gutted buildings standing.19 Even after the fire was extinguished, the BoH continued to set controlled burns in the emptied district, fortunately with no further conflagrations.20 With the horrific failure of the quarantine measures, authorities placed the former residents of Chinatown into detention camps to minimize the spread of the disease. Cases nevertheless continued to appear for the next two months, including on the big island of Hawai'i.21 Ultimately, the BoH reported that the Honolulu plague outbreak produced a total of 71 diagnosed cases and 61 deaths through March 31, 1900. Plague Reaches the United States Just after midnight on March 6, 1900, bubonic plague arrived in the continental United States. In San Francisco, the dead body of Chick Gin, a 41-year-old Chinese laborer, was discovered in the basement of the Globe Hotel, a run- down boarding house in Chinatown. This discovery set in motion public health measures, including quarantines; cordon sanitaire; intensive disinfecting efforts that included burning personal property; and racist stereotypes that were similar, if not more pronounced, than those that recently Fighting the fire in Chinatown, Jan. 1900 Hawai'i State ArchivesBelongings in the street; cordon sanitaire at end of street, c.

It also led to the establishment of a federal plague laboratory in 1903, which would become home to a number of future AAI members and their research over the next few decades. 22 George McCoy and Anti-plague Efforts in Hawai'i In October 1911, George W. McCoy (AAI 1915, president 1922-23) arrived in Hawai'i to lead the Leprosy Investigation Station, but he also brought with him years of experience with plague. Shortly after the 1899-1900 Honolulu plague outbreak, McCoy had been sent to the Philippines to serve as a quarantine officer on his first assignment with the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS). In the Philippine Commission's annual report to the PHS, McCoy described his frustration with the ineffective policies employed against diseases such as cholera. 23 He was later assigned to postings in China and Japan, where he served as one of the inspectors checking ships bound for Hawai'i for indications of plague, and then to the Plague Laboratory in San Francisco, which he led from 1908 until his posting to Honolulu in 1911. 24 Plague had continued to show up occasionally in the rural areas of the Hawaiian Islands, so McCoy instigated a survey of cases both prior to his arrival and during his tenure there. His findings showed that the disease was not limited to any ethnic group; the victims were ethnically and economically diverse. 25 Large-scale rodent reduction efforts resulted in the capture and extermination of tens of thousands of rats and mice. From 1910 to 1913, one in every 1,442 rodents examined was found to be infected with plague. 26 A New Concept in Plague Transmission By the 1930s, the concept developed by Karl F . Meyer (AAI 1922, president 1940-41) of a rodent population acting as a reservoir of disease had yielded to more effective plague abatement techniques, 27 which were employed in Hawai'i by the PHS and BoH to successfully reduce rat populations and, consequently, potential human exposure to plague. 28 \"The Passing of Chinatown\" before (January 20) and after (January 24) the fire, Honolulu Advertiser , 1900 Hawai'i State Archives Want More AAI History?

Centuries of isolation meant that Hawaiians were particularly vulnerable to diseases from all over the world. Estimates of the native population in 1778 range from 300,000 to nearly 700,000. Just 40 years later, the figure had dropped to about 150,000, and by 1900, to only 28,800. Aggressive public health measures prevented an even worse decline, and today the Native Hawaiian population has returned to nearly 300,000. Since first contact with Europeans, the islands became a strategic trading and military location in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. By the late 19 th century, as U.S. naval power increased, Hawai'i became more attractive to the expansionist nation. American business and government interests incrementally seized control of Hawai'i, which impacted every level of governmental control, including public health. 300-500 AD Polynesians first inhabit Hawaiian Islands 1778 British explorer Captain James Cook lands in Hawai'i; he publishes an account of the \"Sandwich Islands,\" providing the earliest documentation of European contact with the islands 1785 The first trading ship lands in Hawai'i on its way to China; sandalwood trade and whaling soon become major industries 1804 \"Okuu\" (probably cholera) epidemic kills nearly 15,000 1810 Kamehameha formally establishes Kingdom of Hawai'i and proclaims himself king after a 15-year struggle with the ali'i (chiefs) 1819 King Kamehameha II abolishes the kapu\u2014the traditional religious and legal system that governed all aspects of Hawaiian life 1820 The first Protestant missionaries arrive from the United States 1828 The Aedes mosquito is first identified in Hawai'i 1835 The first commercially successful sugar plantation is opened by Ladd and Company ~1840 Leprosy is first diagnosed in Hawai'i 1845-49 Influenza, dysentery, measles, and whooping cough kill approximately 10,000 1848 King Kamehameha III enacts the Mahele, a land division act that introduces legal provisions for private ownership of land, opening the way for rapid growth of sugar plantations 1853-54 A smallpox epidemic kills approximately 10,000; smallpox vaccination is made mandatory 1859 Queen's Hospital, named for Queen Emma, is founded to provide medical care to the Hawaiian people 1866 Leprosy patients are first sent to Kalawao, Moloka'i 1870 Scarlet fever kills \"great numbers\" of Hawaiians 1872 King Kamehameha V dies without an heir, ending the House of Kamehameha 1874 Riots during the subsequent succession crisis are suppressed by U.S. and British troops; Kalkaua becomes King of Hawai'i 1875 The Reciprocity Treaty signed between the United States and Kingdom of Hawai'i provides for duty-free import of Hawaiian agricultural products into the United States and of U.S. agricultural products and manufactured goods into Hawai'i; the growth and consolidation of sugarcane plantations and processing plants soon follows 1884 The Reciprocity Convention extends the Reciprocity Treaty (1875) and provides the United States exclusive rights to Pearl Harbor 1887 King Kalkaua is forced to sign a new constitution (the \"Bayonet Constitution\") that strips the monarchy of power and severely restricts voting rights.

Plague Doctor, physician wearing a 17th century plague preventive costume Wellcome Library www.aai.org 145Presented below are excerpts from one of the AAI Oral History Project's most recent interviews, with AAI Distinguished Fellow Barry R. Bloom (AAI '67, president 1985-86). Dr. Bloom is the Joan L. and Julius H. Jacobson Research Professor of Public Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Recognized as a leader in global health, Bloom pursues research primarily focused on leprosy and tuberculosis (TB). This interview was conducted on May 10, 2019, at IMMUNOLOGY2019 in San Diego. Please note that this interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. To learn more about Dr. Bloom, including his year spent working in the Jimmy Carter White House, view the full interview at www.aai.org/OHP . Discovering A Passion and Purpose My background is pretty much undistinguished other than the fact that everybody in my family, all my uncles and one aunt, were physicians, so it was expected from the day I was born that I was going to be a doctor.... In a bolt of adolescent rebellion, I decided not to go to medical school, although I had applied and was admitted, and Rockefeller University had started a new immunology program as a graduate university, and this is what I wanted to do. One of the attractions was... one introductory course, which was one Nobel laureate after another talking about theoretical physics, quantum physics, everything you could think of, much of which we didn't understand, but we were impressed by the personalities. Postdoctoral Training Across the Pond My thesis was published essentially intact in an annual review called Progress in Allergy with, I think, 600 references. Otherwise, I think I would be driving a taxi with no paper and not much to show. But because of a connection in the laboratory of a prior immunologist who studied in London, I decided I would study\u2014since I had not gotten very far with cell-mediated immunity\u2014I would study antibodies, and I went to work with professor Rodney R. Porter (AAI '73) at St. Mary's Medical School in London. Porter, as you know, won the Nobel Prize for the structure of antibodies, absolutely marvelous guy from Lancashire, very difcult to understand his dialect, but HISTORY AAI Oral History Project: An Interview with Dr. Barry Bloom The AAI Oral History Project, which debuted in 2013, is a major initiative to provide contemporary investigators and the public a rare view into the lives and times of influential immunologists. Beginning in the spring of 2012, AAI arranged for award-winning oral historian Brien Williams, Ph.D., to undertake a series of interviews with past AAI presidents. Interviewees were asked about their family backgrounds, early interest in science, reasons for studying immunology, career and research highlights, challenges in balancing professional and private lives, and hobbies outside of the laboratory, along with major changes in immunology over the course of their careers and the future of immunology and science in the United States. Since its launch, the Oral History Project has accumulated 48 interviews with preeminent immunologists. Please visit www.aai.org/OHP to view interviews in their entirety as well as selected clips. 146 AAI History Compendium (2021)one of the nicest and most generous and intuitively bright individuals I've ever met. My project was very straightforward. [Porter had] learned that antibodies had two chains. My project was to nd out which chain had the active site. I worked really hard, and I worked day and night, and I made my own DEAE [Diethylaminoethyl] columns, because in England at that time, you didn't buy kits or columns; you made them. So I learned a lot about how to do science, and to make a long story short, I did not nd where the active site of antibodies was. [It was] another total failure. It turns out you need both chains to have an active site. I learned a lot about how to separate chains, and I had a lot of negative results. Embarking on an Academic Career I had to return and get a job and I didn't get a huge number of offers, and, for a variety of reasons, wanted to move to New York. My wife was then a student in Asian Studies at Columbia University, so [we] returned to New York, and the original job offer was in the neurology department, because they wouldn't hire me in microbiology as I didn't have any papers. But I had an idea of what I wanted to do.... There's lymphocytes\u2014 in those days, we didn't have T cells\u2014and there were macrophages, and the question that was raging was which cell had specicity for antigen. My colleague Boyce Bennett spent hours with me working on how to separate cells, and what we showed is that it was lymphocytes, not macrophages, that had thespecicity for antigen. And when we showed that it was the lymphocytes that were inhibiting macrophages, and we showed that as few as a half percent of immune lymphocytes would inhibit the migration of the remainder of normal macrophages, we gured out they must be making something and secreting it.... We called it migration inhibitory factor, and that was really the rst of the lymphokines that had been discovered and the rst non- antibody product of lymphocytes that had been described in the literature. So that 's how I got started in the business of cell-mediated immunit y, a long series of failures, and for reasons not clear, I somehow lucked out at the end.....I got started in the business of cell-mediated immunity, a long series of failures, and for reasons not clear, I somehow lucked out at the end.Introduction to Global Health The result of the paper on the lymphokines' migration inhibitory factor led to a totally unexpected invitation.... After we published the Science paper on cytokines and which cell had specicity for antigens,1 I got an invitation from the World Health Organization (WHO) to come to Geneva to explain my work. Later, WHO ofcials arranged a meeting in New Delhi for the following year, and there were three outsiders. One had discovered a colony-stimulating factor, which has had a great power in medicine and in the pharmaceutical industry; one discovered that there was a relationship between sickle cell and malaria; and I was the third of that group. Also there were a series of Indian leprologists, and it was all overseen by a young Norwegian named Tore Godal, who later became head of the Special Programme on Tropical Diseases at WHO and the rst director of Gavi [Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]. It was an extraordinary meeting. It was like a clash of two cultures. Leprosy and TB We knew nothing about leprosy and leprologists knew nothing about basic immunology, and the number of questions we could ask was extraordinary. [And these questions] would be easier to answer in leprosy than almost any other condition, because in contrast to TB, as you know, leprosy is caused by a relative of the tubercle bacillus called Mycobacterium leprae. We can't study easily what goes on in the human lung. It's very difcult. But leprosy's a skin disease. It rarely disseminates internally, probably because it doesn't grow at high temperatures, and skin is at a lower temperature, about 32 to 34 degrees centigrade. The second striking thing about this odd disease is that it isn't a single clinical entity; it's a spectrum that correlates perfectly with the immunology. At one end of the spectrum, lepromatous leprosy, the bugs flourish. They grow essentially only in macrophages or Schwann cells around the nerves and they cause nerve damage. At the other end of the pole, there's a massive inltration of what we would now see as CD4, CD8, and macrophages, and almost no visible bacilli. The macrophages kill off the bacilli, but in the process, they damage the nerves as well. As a consequence , it was an Anteroposterior (AP) x-ray of a patient's chest with advanced TB CDC www.aai.org 147HISTORY extraordinary, unique opportunity to study the whole range of cellular immune responses from unresponsiveness to too much responsiveness in the context of a human disease. So I have spent a good part of the rest of my life studying immune responses in leprosy, and it has remained, at least for me, a rewarding subject. The other extraordinary fascination about leprosy is that there's no other disease [for which] people in the MiddleAges were buried alive, burned at the stake, or thrown out of cities with a bell and candle and left to survive in the deserts on their own. It not only has a history but it has a stigma, and that led me to believe that, yes, I wanted to do basic science, but not just to write papers in Science, Cell, and Nature; I wanted to do basic science on real diseases with real pathogens, and at the time I started, nobody, or virtually nobody, worked on real antigens. This was the era of reductionist science, people working on model systems, so the major antigen was dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin [DNP-BSA]. [ We were] not aware of anybody dying of bovine serum albumin as a major cause of illness, and here we were working on leprosy bacilli in patients and in animal models, particularly interested in the part of the spectrum where the immune response killed off the bugs but caused tissue damage. That struck me as very odd, and if you think of what tuberculosis is like, it's a massive immune response to wall off the bacilli that causes a hole in the lung and massive tissue damage in the lung. And while we couldn't get access to lungs, the principles, I thought, were likely to be very similar. The other possibility was that the tissue damage we saw in skin in leprosy might be relevant to autoimmune diseases, and the particular case of interest was the possibility it mightbe related to multiple sclerosis, where there was inltrationof white cells into the brain with concomitant damage ofnerve cells. So I flew back from India full of enthusiasm, worked with a terric neuropathologist at Einstein named Henry Wisniewski, and we did a really simple experiment. We sensitized guinea pigs to tuberculin and then we injected a little tuberculin into the head of some guinea pigs to see what would happen, and what would happen was astonishing: a massive cellular response, a dissociation of the sutures that hold the brain together, and the guinea pigs ' heads blew up. So we had created an articial neurologic autoimmune disease by creating a specic immune response to a foreign antigen in the vicinity of nerve cells in the brain, and the specic response to the tuberculin led to a nonspecic damage of the nerve cells. That's what goes on in tuberculoid leprosy, and, to some extent, that may also go on in some autoimmune diseases elsewhere in the body, and that was called \"bystander demyelination.\" Collaborations From there, I've worked for a large part of my career in collaboration with wonderful students and fellows. The rst that I would mention on this occasion is one of my early postdocs, JoAnne Flynn (AAI '96, president 2018-19), who came with abackground in microbiology and is now [2019], I'm proud to say, president of the American Association of Immunologists. As JoAnne came to the lab, she was really good at microbiology and genetics and really didn't know anything much about immunology, so we gave her some immunology projects that turned out to be absolutely transformative for the eld. It was at that time that knockout mice became available, and so we got mice that had knockouts in gamma interferon, and they died from TB very rapidly, at 21 days. We had mice that lacked tumor necrosis factor [(TNF)] and we assumed those mice would not show pathology, but, in fact, they died at the same time as the gamma interferon knockouts. We reconstructed the mice to show that if you triggered both, you need both interferon gamma and TNF to get a protective response in the mice. JoAnne then asked, what about killer cells? And she used mice with knocked out MHC Class 1 and showed that CD8 and cytotoxic cells seemed to be important for protection. JoAnnereally laid the basis for the fundamental cellular mechanismsof protection, in cellular terms, of how you get protection against leprosy and how you get protection against TB. We still don't know in molecular terms, any more than I did when I was a graduate student, about what molecules are really crucial for assuring protection and being necessary to develop r ationally a perfect vaccine. But to continue my studies in leprosy, [Robert Modlin (AAI '86) and I] found that there was a mechanism in humans, at least for killing TB in vitro, that depending on products of activated lymphocytes, probably interferon gamma, and other cytokines, and it worked by a mechanism totally different than what we found in mice. So in my lab, John Chan (AAI '06) and some other students and postdocs showed the major mechanism for killing TB in mice was not oxygen radicals, which is what killed most other bugs at the time, in terms of our knowledge, but it was killed in mice by reactive nitrogen oxides and reactive nitrogen species. The...extraordinary fascination about leprosy is that there's no other disease [for which] people in the Middle Ages were buried alive, burned at the stake, or thrown out of cities with a bell and candle and left to survive in the deserts on their own. 148 AAI History Compendium (2021)We showed that human macrophage is killed by a different mechanism, in vitro at least, and the mechanism required the engagement of vitamin D. We worked out a completely unique pathway where vitamin D led to the production not of radicals but of a protease or an antimicrobial compound that had the ability to put a hole in the membrane of the very tough membranes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and leprae. To make a very long story short, we've worked out a lot of the mechanisms important for activating macrophages, at least in vitro, to control and kill TB, and we also showed that one of the things that the lymphocytes of the old days\u2014now, CD8T cells\u2014did is a subset of them could not only kill infected macrophages, they could kill the TB within the macrophages.With the help of a young junior faculty named Sam Balin and Robert Modlin's lab at UCLA, we showed that this requires a subset of killer cells that is able to put a hole in the membrane of the target cell with perforin and deliver antimicrobicidalcompounds granzyme and granulysin. The Importance of the WHO When I was invited in 1968, I think, to go to India for the rst time, it's an experience I really never got over, and I was absolutely motivated to try to use science in some way, not to make drugs and vaccines in my lab, but [to] understand the basic science that might allow others to do that [and] target it on diseases of the Third World. As a result of that, this wonderful Norwegian who had created the rst leprosy center in Africa....was invited to return to WHO and set up a program on leprosy, and he asked me then to join him as an advisor to that program that was called IMMLEP [Steering Committee on the Immunology of Leprosy]. It was funded, tiny amounts of money, by the Norwegian government, and my role was to try to get some of the best scientists in the world to come for nothing to WHO and share their ideas and share something else as well. It turns out the leprosy bacillus was discovered seven years before Robert Koch discovered the tubercle bacillus. It has never been able to be grown in a test tube . It is a completely genetically degenerate organism. It barely can survive in vivo.I was absolutely motivated to try to use science in some way, not to make drugs and vaccines in my lab, but to understand the basic science that might allow others to do that and target it on diseases of the Third World. It's amazing that it actually causes a disease. Nonetheless, how do you study leprosy if you can't study the bug? It doesn't grow. Except there was a wonderful guy at CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] named Charles C. Shepard (AAI '51) with another group who showed that it did grow in two animals. It grew in the footpad of mice, which has low body temperature, but you can't get a lot of bacilli out of a footpad in a mouse to study the bug worldwide. It also grew in a weird animal called the nine-banded armadillo, Dasypus novemcinctus, and these are all over the southeast of the United States. They have really crappy immune systems. Because they're encoated with an armor coating, they don't need much of an immune system, and I believe that that's the major reason M. leprae grows. They have a low body temperature and they have a lousy immune system. A contract was let by WHO and enabled two major laboratories studying leprosy to grow enough bacilli in armadillo livers\u2014you could get 1010 per gram of tissue. That's a lot of bacilli. WHO organized that, the IMMLEP Committee oversaw that, and the bacilli that were obtained were made available at no cost to any scientist in the world qualied to study leprosy. While with many other infectious diseases, we're worried about giving anything away because they Nine-banded armadillo CDCMycobacterium leprae bacteria CDCScanning electron microscopic image of Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC www.aai.org 149were interested in setting up companies, we were pretty sure there was not going to be a lot of money to be made from a company that worked on leprosy. My lab and another lab elsewhere simultaneously made the rst monoclonal antibodies against antigens of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis. We gave that to WHO, and that was distributed free of charge to everybody that wanted it in the world. Then I was privileged to meet at WHO with two giants in the eld of molecular genetics, Ron[Ronald W.] Davis at Stanford and Rick [Richard A.] Young atMIT, who had invented the rstreally useful gene expressionsystem, where you could clone genes into a phage lambda gt10 or gt11 and make foreignproteins from almost anythinginE. coli, and thus we had the ability to manufacture or atleast allow laboratories to makebuckets of any TB or M. leprae antigen. And in the courseof it, the DNA enabled thesequence of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis to be done. Noneof this would have gotten donehad not a wonderful collection of people outside the eld ofimmunology, outside the eldof genetics, been willing towork for WHO for a common purpose to use their skillsand knowledge and to makeeverything that we discovered free and open to anybody inthe world. So I became heavily involved then in WHO activities. I was the rst chair of the outside advisory committee called STAC, Scientic and Technical Advisory Committee, to the leprosy program....Since it was such a model program that did the science and gave it all away, that led to the origins of the so-called Tropical Disease Research Programme [ed. Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR)], which WHO then created for diseases like malaria, leishmaniasis, lariasis, and the hope was that they would also pull scientists from all sorts of elds together to move forward on these now-called neglected tropical diseases. So that has been an extraordinary and wonderful experience. Then I switched. They created a vaccine program and supported research, and I chaired the committee called IMMTUB, the Immunology of Tuberculosis, and that has spurred on efforts to develop the basic science underlyingvaccines. In the last year, we've seen two papers in The Ne w England Journal [of Medicine] that indicate there are now hopes for having better ways to immunize people than we've had for the last 100 years. So immunology is really making an impact on two almost totally refractory diseases. TB is now the largest cause of death in the world from any infectious disease, exceeding HIV and malaria for the rst time, so this is a serious effort that WHO has inspired and now many labs are contributing to. People forget that essentially allvaccines are iterative processes. The rst go is never the perfectvaccine, and there is a history of almost all vaccines requiringcontinuous improvement. SoI'm not condent that these two papers are the last word, but if they show in larger studies thekind of protection, 50 percent,or for people under 25 yearsof age\u2014one of them showed84-percent protection\u2014whenyou're getting 10.7 million new cases a year, I'll take a 50-percent effective vaccineany day. It would be a huge impact. Leprosy Today So the status of leprosy is that there was a counterpart committee to IMMLEP , which was called TLEP , the mission of which was to develop drugs, and they developed drugs, tested them in mouse models. The situation with leprosy is both interesting and somewhat discouraging. It is interesting because that treatment has been applied to those countries that have a leprosy problem. When I started, there were 12.5 million registered\u2014leprosy is a notiable disease to all governments. There were 12.5 million patients registered to have leprosy. Assuming that was 50 percent of all the patients, that half were missed, not least because of the stigma and their reluctance to come on, there must have been 25 million at the start of those IMMLEP and TLEP programs. There are now fewer than 800,000 registered new patients, an astonishingly effective impact of drugs, mostly on people who already had the disease. It's a very, very slow disease. The discouraging part is the incidence rates. The number ofnew cases has not fallen, and what that means is people aretransmitting leprosy before they know they have it and go in\"Anyone can get leprosy, but leprosy can be cured,\" public health poster, India National Library of MedicineHISTORY 150 AAI History Compendium (2021)for treatment. If they do go in for tr eatment, they get cured, 90-some percent cures, not a problem. What's really important there is the only way we have to test a vaccine is very expensive long-term trials in patients at risk for TB, which is a low percentage, even in high-burden areas. What we really need to know is what are the immunologic correlates that guarantee protection. We know for polio if you have neutralizing antibody, you're protected. Done. For hepatitis B, it's exactly the same, and we even know what isotype of antibody guarantees protection. We haven't got a clue what are the essential ingredients to guarantee if you saw these cytokines, these T cells, these NK cells, and innate immune cells, this vaccine worked, this patient is protected. So we have lots of immunology yet to do. Science and the Public I look at my role as, in many of these aspects, [one] of making mischief, and so the current cause of mischief with which I am engaged has to do with the issue of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the U.S. As an immunologist, you can't ignore the fact that we have now more measles cases than we've had in the last 20 years. We have a great vaccine for measles, mumps, and German measles. How is that possible in America? What does it mean to have religious and moral objections to a bloody vaccine that saves lives, and what are we going to do about it? So in this effort, I can just say that in two editorials, one in The Washington Post recently and one in The Journal of the American Medical Association hooking up with a major educator, Scott Ratzan, and Larry Gostin, who's head of HealthLaw at Georgetown, we've put together a set of proposals of how we can tighten up the immunization in this country particularly, to cut out the efforts, quite successful at this point,of the anti-vaccine groups by trying to get the truth about safety and efcacy of vaccines and protect our kids who don'tget a vote on this. Kids don't vote on whether they're going to be protected against measles or blindness or deafness orencephalitis or pneumonia; their parents do. And as a result, we've got to get more persuasive in pr otecting those kids with the tools we have.So that's the effort that I'm engaged in, and have been quite pleased in the last couple weeks. A whole slew of vaccine experts, which I don't pretend to be, and health law experts and people administrating health programs in universities have started to join and say, \"We have to be able to do something to increase the level of awareness and understanding, deal with the social media, with misinformation. Vaccines don't cause autism. Vaccines do save lives.\" That seems to be a battle to take on the politicians right now in\u2014there are only two states that have not had [measles] outbreaks, and they're the states you wouldn't guess\u2014 Mississippi and West Virginia\u2014who do not have exemptions, other than medical exemptions, for vaccines, and they have had no recent outbreaks. So it's telling you something, and we have to begin to deal with that at a legislative level in states to protect our kids. The Diverse and Exciting Field of Immunology Where can you get a eld where you can study fundamental immune responses, regulation of a really complicated system? The dean at Albert Einstein when I was there was a neuroanatomist, and he liked to say to students, who always roared at this, that the brain is the second-most important organ of the body, and he never specied what the other organ was. For me, it was always the immune system and lymphoid system, even more complicated, probably, than the brain. The ability to recognize almost any compound, any chemical in the environment that it's never seen before and make a response to it, that's astonishing. And then to be able to go from very basic mechanisms, from DNA and RNA and all that, to how do you develop a vaccine or a diagnostic that's going to make a difference in the world, I mean, [in] how many elds can one investigator have the freedom to nd their niche in any part of a giant scientic spectrum? So it remains even more exciting now than it was when I was a student. Reference 1 Barry R. Bloom and Boyce Bennett, \"M echanism of a reaction in vitro associated with delayed type hypersensitivity,\" Science 153, no. 3731: 80-2.I look at my role as...making mischief, and so the current cause of mischief with which I am engaged has to do with the issue of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the U.S. Barry R. Bloom, AAI OHP interview, 2019 AAI www.aai.org 151HISTORY Part I\u2014Understanding and Treating a Perplexing Disease In the late 19th century, sporadic outbreaks of a perplexing and debilitating disease began to appear in both the United States and Europe. Most of those affected, primarily young children, would experience a fever and perhaps some pain or stiffness and then recover. But in a small percentage, the disease would progress to paralysis of legs or the diaphragm, sometimes leading to death. Poliomyelitis, or simply polio, presented medical researchers and early immunologists with special problems that grew more urgent as outbreaks became epidemics and the effects of the disease more severe. From its inception, The Journal of Immunology (The JI) published some of the most important research on the nature of polio, ultimately leading to the successful vaccines of the 1950s. The Discovery of Viruses Although polio seemed like a new plague at the dawn of the 20 th century, evidence of its paralytic effects can be traced to ancient Egypt and ancient Greece. This disease was rare and, to all appearances, random and therefore not well understood until shortly after the discovery of viruses in the late 19 th century. Bacteria were first seen by the naked eye with the invention of the microscope by Antonie Van Leeuwenhook in 1668; soon thereafter the field of bacteriology was born. Virology came much later because the causative agents could not be seen even under the highest powered light microscope. The term virus (\"poison\" in Latin) had been used for centuries to describe medical maladies for which the cause was mysterious. The imprecision of the Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms, 1914 U.S. Department of AgriculturePublic notice of poliomyelitis quarantine National Library of Medicine 152 AAI History Compendium (2021)term, however, would end with the 1898 discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), an infectious agent that could be spread through the sap of the tobacco plant. 1 The experiment underlying the discovery was rather straightforward and owed its success to the porcelain Chamberland filter, which had pores so small that a solution that passed through it would be bacteria free. Typically, the filter was used to strain out bacteria to be tested. However, when a pasteurized aqueous solution containing crushed-up leaves of diseased tobacco plants was forced through the filter, the remaining solution could still infect tobacco plants. Though the TMV was not seen, nor could it be grown in laboratory cultures, it was the first \"filterable virus\" to be isolated. 2 Many more viruses were soon isolated. The first vertebrate virus, foot-and-mouth, was isolated in 1898, and the first human virus, yellow fever, was isolated in 1900. And in 1935, Wendell M. Stanley (AAI 1957) was the first to crystalize a virus\u2014the TMV\u2014and demonstrated that it was composed of protein and ribonucleic acid. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946 for his research. Polio Outbreaks In the mid-1800s, doctors were reporting clusters of infantile paralysis during the summer months in the United States and Western Europe, though the clusters were so small and sporadic that uncovering a clinical diagnosis for the disease was impossible. The first epidemic in the United States occurred in the Otter Valley of Vermont during the summer of 1894. Charles Caverly, a diligent local doctor, was able to trace the 123 people comprising the Vermont cases and noted the sex, age, symptoms, and outcome for each. Though unable to determine the cause of the disease, he laid the groundwork by reaching three important conclusions: polio had the potential to become an epidemic; most of the victims were children, not infants, thus \"infantile paralysis\" was a misnomer; and some victims experienced an extremely mild form of illness with minor symptoms and a quick recover y.3 In July 1904, the world 's first major epidemic of polio began in Sw eden. The countryside around Stockholm had seen outbreaks of polio sporadically over the previous three decades, with the most recent in 1895. The 1904 epidemic began in a small village 155 miles southwest of Stockholm. Within three months, cases had been reported in nearly every county in the country. In August alone, 360 cases were reported, and by year's end there was a total of 1,031. 4 A majority of the cases became the subject of a comprehensive survey by Ivar Wickman, who crisscrossed the country to get detailed accounts from victims and families. His conclusions reinforced Caverly's hypotheses, vastly expanding the understanding of the disease: it was spread through personal contact; all infected persons, symptomatic and asymptomatic, were contagious; and the incubation period for first symptoms was three to four days after infection and a further six to eight days for paralysis. 5 The number of polio epidemics increased in number and severity into the 20 th century, and with each epidemic, understanding of the disease increased incrementally. The causative agent, however, remained a mystery. The Polio Virus On December 18, 1908, Karl Landsteiner (AAI 1922, president 1927-28) rose to give a talk at the Royal and Imperial Society of Physicians in Vienna. The topic of his talk was polio, and he was there to announce that he had isolated the filterable virus responsible for the disease. Landsteiner had taken a sample from the inflamed spinal cord of a child recently claimed by the disease, ground it up in sterile water, and injected it into guinea pigs, rabbits, and mice to no avail. Then he injected samples into the abdomen of two monkeys. The first died after eight days, and the second became paralyzed from the waist down before dying on Day 18 post-infection. The spinal cords of both monkeys exhibited the telltale lesions of polio. Further research using filtrates yielded identical results. The polio virus had been isolated. 6 Flexner and Early Polio Research in the United States Back in the United States, Simon Flexner (AAI 1920), the director of the recently opened Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (RIMR) and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Experimental Medicine, had begun his own polio research. By 1907, the country was also experiencing an increase in outbreaks both in number and severity during the summer months. That year, New York City health officials reported 2,000 cases, and similar outbreaks were reported in Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Vermont. 7 Charles Caverly Rutland HeraldKarl Landsteiner National Library of Medicine www.aai.org 153HISTORY Later, after successfully reproducing Landsteiner's work, Flexner began a series of experiments to determine where the virus entered the body. And like Landsteiner and many other researchers, Flexner was using a monkey model for the disease. This choice in model had its positives and negatives. Monkeys were able to be infected by polio, though not naturally. Like today, they were expensive and difficult to buy and maintain; by contrast, at the time of Flexner's research, the origins and previous conditions of the monkeys were usually completely unknown. Flexner's research into the entry point for the virus began with feeding his test subjects poliovirus by mouth. None got sick. Next, he introduced the virus into their sinuses by using a swab dipped in filtrates and watched as the monkeys soon became sick. Flexner reasoned, incorrectly as it turned out, that the virus entered through the nose and traveled into the central nervous system. 8 By 1911, an optimistic Flexner was quoted in the New York Times saying, \"We have already discovered how to prevent infantile paralysis\" and that the \"achievement of a cure, I may conservatively say, is not now far distant.\" 9 What later research would show was that, unbeknownst to Flexner, his selection of a Macaca mulatta (rhesus monkey) was the fatal flaw in his research because that species is unable to orally contract polio. 10 The 1916 Polio Epidemic The year 1915 proved relatively unremarkable for New York City public health officials; in terms of public health, the numbers were very similar to those in 1914. While deaths brought on by the prevailing endemic communicable diseases remained relatively constant in 1915, the maladies remained a daily threat to the nearly five million residents of the city. The top pathogen-related deaths included pneumonia (10,692), tuberculosis (10,321), diphtheria (1,271), measles (662), influenza (394), whooping cough (395), typhoid fever (327), and scarlet fever (310). There were no vaccines or effective therapeutics for any of these, and readily available laboratory testing existed for only a few. 11 The biggest event in the city that year was the women's suffrage parade down Fifth Avenue on October 23. The official counts for the gathering ranged from 25,000 to 60,000 participants and at least 100,000 spectators. Polio would have caused little worry to residents of the city's five boroughs, young or old, as only 70 deaths had been attributed to the disease in the entire state. Across the United States in 1915, only 691 reported deaths were caused by polio, of which the vast majority were children under the age of five. As winter waned into the spring of 1916, there was no warning that New York City was soon to become ground zero for the first major outbreak of polio in America.Simon Flexner National Library of MedicineBrooklyn, NY , 1914 New York Historical Society 1916 New York polio epidemic chart New York Dept. of Health, 1917 154 AAI History Compendium (2021)The first issue of The JI came out just three months before cases of polio started appearing in May of 1916 in a densely populated section of Brooklyn known as Pigtown. By year's end, the disease would claim the lives of more than 6,000 people, mostly children, and leave another 21,000 with permanent physical disability. This first major American epidemic of polio hit the New York City area hardest: about 9,000 children were affected, and 2,343 of them died. 12 At the time, very little was known about how polio was transmitted or how to prevent infection. Because only about one percent of infected patients experience paralytic symptoms, the virus seemed less contagious than it actually was, and public health officials had difficulty identifying routes of transmission. 13 Medical and government authorities instituted sanitation drives, food inspections, and even travel bans for children. 14 Treatment options were limited during the epidemic as well. By the time polio had caused paralysis in a child, all a physician could do was prescribe medication to treat the pain and fever. 15 The iron lung had not yet been developed to treat cases of respiratory paralysis. A Catalyst for AAI Researchers Many of the earliest AAI members would have witnessed the New York polio epidemic firsthand. Thirteen members, including Arthur F . Coca (AAI 1916, EIC 1916-1935), William James W. Jobling (AAI 1914, president 1915-16), and Richard Weil (AAI 1914, president 1916-17), lived in New York City during the summer of the outbreak. Another six New Yorkers would join AAI in the ensuing year, including Hans Zinsser (AAI 1917, president 1919-20) and Peter K. Olitsky (AAI 1917). The 1916 epidemic inspired new research on polio, and in its early years, The JI published important articles that built on the previous discoveries of Landsteiner and Flexner. At this point, it was still very challenging to work with polio because the virus could not be successfully cultured in vitro. Monkeys were the only experimental animal that the virus would reliably infect, making experiments expensive as well. John Kolmer (AAI 1913, president 1917-18) published the first article on polio in The JI with Anna E. Freese. Hoping Areas particularly involved in the poliomyelitis epidemic of 1916 = A polio health pass was required in some states due to travel restictions, 1916 Smithsonian, National Museum of American History www.aai.org 155HISTORY that a complement-fixation diagnostic could be developed for polio as had been done for syphilis, they used samples of cerebrospinal fluids and blood sera from patients in different stages of polio infection to determine (1) whether specific antigen could be detected in corresponding tissues, and (2) whether antibodies for \"various and easily cultivated\" bacteria could be demonstrated. Unfortunately, their research showed that the Wassermann reaction was uniformly negative for acute anterior poliomyelitis. 16 They found that though there was some evidence of complement fixation with polio serum, the reactions were too insignificant to be used as a practical diagnostic. 17 Seeing similarities between the polio and rabies viruses, H. L. Abramson (AAI 1918) and Herman Gerber of the NewYork Department of Health tried to produce a vaccinebased on those analogous properties. They conductedexperiments to determine if a highly potent strain of polioisolated at RIMR could be attenuated either chemically orwith heat, as with rabies. Attenuation with formalin proved \"decidingly not encouraging,\" so they turned to heating methods. 18 Abramson and Gerber showed in monkeys that a course of five injections of the heat-treated virus over five days could produce substantial immunity to the potent virus when introduced later. A Return to Polio Research Polio continued to plague American children: 1921 and 1925 had significant spikes in cases and deaths, and 1927 was the worst year since 1916. 19 After a gap of almost 10 years, polio research in The JI picked up again with wide-ranging approaches to understanding immunity to the disease. In 1927, W. Lloyd Aycock and J. R. Kagan reviewed the state of polio vaccine science and showed that it was possible to produce immunity without active symptoms. 20 The Kolmer and Brodie Vaccine Trials By 1934, research had advanced sufficiently to make the first serious human trials possible. As in the case of the competing Salk and Sabin vaccine efforts that would come later, two scientists independently developed initial polio vaccines, one using killed virus and one using attenuated. John Kolmer attenuated the virus with sodium ricinoleate to produce a vaccine. 21 Monkey tests looked promising, so he then tested his vaccine on himself and his assistant with no ill effects. Kolmer quickly moved to tests on children. His own sons received it first, and then he distributed it to physicians across the country. In September 1935, he reported that 10,725 children had been given the vaccine, and none who had received all three doses had contracted polio. There were, however, nine cases in children who had only one or two doses. 22 Also in 1934, Maurice Brodie (AAI 1934) began work on a polio virus in the Bureau of Laboratories of the New York Department of Health under William H. Park. Using formalin-killed virus, he produced humoral immunity in monkeys reliably, but tissue immunity in only a few (a live virus had the opposite ratio). The common belief at the time was that tissue immunity was the more important component of protection from the virus. 23 Like Kolmer, Brodie swiftly moved to human trials on more than 4,500 children. He also reported five cases of polio among the vaccinated subjects, but two of those children had been exposed just prior to receiving the vaccine, and another only 13 days after getting just a single dose. 24 Now there were two vaccines that offered the promise of bringing an end to the scourge of polio. Sidney Kramer made a large comparative study to verify efficacy of these two vaccines, funded partly by the President's Birthday Ball Commission for Infantile Paralysis Research, the original precursor to the March of Dimes. 25 The study showed that neither vaccine was significantly more effective than a John Kolmer injecting his son with polio vaccine, 1935 Detroit News First article on polio in The JI The Journal of Immunology, April 1, 1917 156 AAI History Compendium (2021)control. Kramer cited private correspondence in which Kolmer said that he no longer believed that sodium ricinoleate actually attenuated the virus. At the 1935 American Public Health Association annual conference, both vaccines were denounced as ineffective or dangerous. Brodie acknowledged the failure of his work in person. 26 Ultimately, however, Brodie's vaccine did produce immunity in children comparable to the natural immunity of adults (75 percent), but the concerns raised in 1935 by the scientific community effectively barred further research at the time. 27 Much later research suggests that the cases of polio in children who received Kolmer's vaccine may have been provoked by the monkey spinal cord antigens, which were present due to the production method of the vaccine and not from the introduced virus itself. 28 In the ensuing years, polio remained a significant problem in the United States, with most years seeing 4,000 to 10,000 cases. The numbers began skyrocketing in 1943, but by that time the outbreak of the Second World War had funneled research away from diseases such as polio in favor of studies addressing the immediate needs of the war. In the next issue of the AAI Newsletter, we will pick up the story of polio as it played out in the postwar years, as growing outbreaks spread to more cities and suburbs. Our focus will be on the basic research that made effective polio vaccines possible.

See \"Polio: Part I\u2014 Understanding and Treating a Perplexing Disease\" in the December 2020 issue. The rejection of the Kolmer and Brodie polio vaccines as too dangerous was a setback in terms of scientic research (see \"Polio: Part I\" in the December 2020 issue of the AAI Newsletter), but at the same time, popular sentiment was being mobilized to ght the disease. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had contracted polio as an adult in 1921 and had found some relief through hydrotherapy in the waters of Warm Springs, Georgia. This experience inspired him to advocate for more effective treatments for what was then known widely as infantile paralysis.The National Fight Against Polio On January 30, 1934, Roosevelt's inner circle of friends celebrated his birthday at the White House dressed in Roman togas, poking fun at critics' claims that the president had dictatorial ambitions.1 They were not the only ones commemorating Roosevelt's birthday. In cities and towns across the country, Americans danced, celebrated, and raised over $1 million for the President's Birthday Ball to Combat Infantile Paralysis. At each of the numerous events, 70 percent of the proceeds went to local polio treatment and relief, while the remainder helped fund the Warm Springs Foundation.2 The Birthday Ball immediately became an annual event. Beginning in 1935, the President's Birthday Ball Commission for Infantile Paralysis Research mobilized to \"wipe out the disease itself\" on a national scale.3 Ahead of that year's Ball, Roosevelt named Paul de Kruif (AAI 1921) secretary of the Commission and tasked him with the responsibility of determining how to distribute the 30 percent of proceeds not retained for local care.4 They wanted a cure, not just treatment. The March of Dimes Three years later, Roosevelt reorganized the Commission into the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP). The popular comedian and singer Eddie Cantor told radio listeners to send \"a march of dimes all the way to the White House,\" and Americans responded by mailing in 80,000 dimes in addition to the $1.5 million collected for the 1938 Birthday Ball.5 Contributions kept climbing: in 1945 the March of Dimes raised nearly $19 million. Like donations, however, cases of polio were steadily increasing.6 John F. Enders's Flasks of Poliovirus Cultures National Museum of American History President Roosevelt's Roman-themed birthday party, 1934 Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and Museum THE BASIC RESEARCH BREAKTHROUGHPOLIO: PART II 158 AAI History Compendium (2021)Treatment and Research Polio was the second-most researched human virus worldwide from 1935 to 1960, only exceeded by influenza.7 But without a vaccine, the most effective treatment for patients suffering the most life-threatening effects was the iron lung. By enclosing the patient's torso in a chamber in which the air pressure could be increased or decreased, the device kept paralyzed lungs pumping. The iron lung was rst used on a polio patient in 1928, but for the next decade the technology was extremely expensive and hard to obtain\u2014by 1936 there were still only 222 in operation worldwide.8 In 1937, Edwin Both invented a much less expensive respirator that could be produced easily and rapidly. The newly available technology increased survival rates signicantly but could do nothing to prevent long-term paralysis. The War Years When the United States entered the Second World War, research on primarily childhood diseases like polio was deprioritized in favor of diseases that would affect military readiness at training bases in the United States or ghting overseas. In Boston, a little-known assistant professor at Harvard Medical School (HMS) was encouraged to direct his research toward mumps for the war effort.9 Because other more established researchers were working on the major war- related diseases, such as influenza, typhus, and yellow fever, there was little room (or funding) remaining for John F. Enders (AAI 1936, AAI president 1952-53), so he began a new study on mumps.10 This seemingly small choice of switching to non-clinical, in vitro mumps research would yield signicant discoveries about the disease and, within a decade, also break the logjam that had prevented progress in polio research.On the home front during the war, the number of polio cases continued to climb each year, from 4,033 in 1942 to 12,449 the next year, and to 19,029\u2014 with 1,433 deaths\u2014in 1944. 11 The Journal of Immunology (The JI) published a few articles on polio over the course of the war, most of them by S. D. Kramer at the Michigan Department of Health. Kramer had been prolic in polio research from the late 1930s, demonstrating in 1939 that the poliovirus could be found in the stools of apparently healthy carriers.12 Supported by grants from the NFIP , Kramer was able to continue working on polio through the war, publishing research on the production of immunity in mouse models.13 A New Understanding of Poliovirus A dramatic rise in polio case numbers following the end of the war led to a major resurgence in polio research. Widespread use of the iron lung was saving many children from death, but also leaving increasing numbers with chronic disabilities. With the war over, researchers were free to focus on this new rising threat. Joseph L. Melnick (AAI 1948), who would later become a titan in polio research, was one of the rst to publish on polio in The JI in peacetime. In 1946, he had been working on novel applications of the ultracentrifuge to isolate the poliovirus from monkey stool.14 The proliferation of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract inspired Melnick's later classication of the group of enteroviruses, with the poliovirus as its prototype.15 John F. Enders All research on a polio vaccine to that point had been performed without the ability to culture the poliovirus. For any experiment on polio, the virus had to be isolated and puried from monkeys, which increased the time and cost involved in the process. It was also widely accepted that the virus would only grow in nervous tissue, which was difcult to culture and grow in vitro. Three researchers at HMS, led by Enders, made the key discovery that would lead to effective vaccines not only for polio but also for a range of other common viral diseases. John F. Enders had a unique background among his peers at HMS. He was classically trained in English literature, including Poster for President's Birthday Ball, 1939 Library of Congress Drinker Respirato r, the rst widely used iron lung, ca. 1930 Harvard Medical School Library www.aai.org 159HISTORY research in Celtic and Teutonic language, having earned an A.B. and M.A. in the eld. He was working on a Ph.D. with the goal of becoming an English teacher before a chance encounter with Hans Zinsser (AAI 1917, AAI president 1919-20), professor of bacteriology and immunology at HMS.16 In 1925, Enders accompanied a friend from his boarding house, Hugh Ward, who was an instructor in Zinsser's department, to the laboratory as he changed some media in bacteria cultures. Enders later wrote that \"[Zinsser and I] soon became friends, and thus I fell into the habit of going to the laboratory with him in the evening and watching him work. I became increasingly fascinated by the subject\u2014which manifestly gave him so much pleasure and about which he talked with such enthusiasm\u2014and so eventually decided to change the direction of my studies.\"17 Virus Research Enders soon switched from a Ph.D. in English to one in bacteriology and immunology (which was unusual because at the time an M.D. was more common for both clinical and basic researchers in the eld). He then spent the next 15 years working with Zinsser. His rst faculty appointment came at the age of 32. Initially his research focused on immune responses to bacteria, but in 1937 he made the move to viruses. Enders began his virus research while working with William McD. Hammon (AAI 1946) on a usually fatal disease in kittens known as panleukopenia, also known as cat distemper or enteritis. Enders and Hammon identied the virus that causes the disease and demonstrated that the virus initially infects the bone marrow. They created a vaccine that quickly became the standard in veterinary care.18 Enders also began research on the growth of the herpes simplex virus, assisted by then fourth-year medical student Thomas Weller (AAI 1943).19 Their initial work on the tissue-culture method was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War, when Weller left to serve as head of the Departments of Bacteriology, Virology, and Parasitology at the U.S. Army Antilles Medical Laboratory in Puerto Rico. The New Enders Lab In 1947, the Boston Children's Hospital asked Enders to establish an infectious disease laboratory, which would be partially funded through a ve-year basic viral research NFIP grant to HMS. Enders and Weller were soon joined by the third member of their team, Frederick C. Robbins (AAI 1952), who had been the chief of the Viral and Rickettsial Disease Section of the Fifteenth Medical General Laboratory of the U.S. Army, serving in North Africa and Italy. Initially, all their research was viral, but none of it was on polio. Enders continued his mumps research, while Weller went to work on chicken pox and Robbins on the viral cause of infant epidemic diarrhea. All three, however, were working on in vitro cultivation to grow their viruses. In 1948, Enders and Weller developed the rst successful method for growing the mumps virus in vitro using a culture of mainly chicken-embryo fragments and ox blood. Weller then took that method and attempted to grow the chicken pox virus in vitro with embryonic human muscle and skin as the culture, with the addition of a combination of penicillin and streptomycin to eliminate bacterial contamination.20 Importantly, Weller discovered that if the nutrient media was changed at regular intervals, the tissue would live longer, thus allowing more time for the virus to propagate.21 The Breakthrough Having some leftover culture flasks from his chicken pox experiment, and at Enders's suggestion, Weller added some of the Lansing Type II poliovirus they had in the laboratory's freezer. At the same time, Robbins was readying his cultures for experiments to identify viruses responsible for infant diarrhea using mouse intestines and used the Lansing strain in a few of his flasks. Poliovirus grew successfully in Weller's cultures; it did not in Robbins's.22 Weller's successful experiment led the team to quickly refocus all their research on growing poliovirus in vitro.To that point, polio was still considered primarily a disease of the nervous system. But the composition of Weller's culture, combined with the abundance of recent research showing that poliovirus was found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans, inspired the three scientists to attempt to Postcard of Harvard Medical School campus, ca. 1941 Thomas Huckle Weller, 1968 National Library of Medicine Frederick C. Robbins, 1955 National Library of Medicine 160 AAI History Compendium (2021)culture it in non-nerve human embryonic tissue, including intestine.23 The team successfully cultured all three strains of poliovirus, opening up the possibility of in vitro studies of the virus and enabling rapid development of effective vaccines.24 Expensive monkeys\u2014and the risks involved with maintaining a population of infected animals\u2014were no longer necessary to produce the virus for research. Their technique also led to the isolation of several other viruses and the development of corresponding vaccines: measles, rubella, mumps, herpes simplex, was published in a three-part series in the December 1, 1952, issue of The JI.25 Nobel Prize The trio received the Nobel Prize for \"their discovery of the ability of poliomyelitis viruses to grow in cultures of various types of tissue\" in 1954 after some controversy in the Nobel committee. Enders had rst been nominated individually in 1952. Sven Gard, the chair of virology at the Karolinska Institut, had long been involved in polio research and evaluated the nomination favorably but expressed reservations about awarding the Prize to Enders alone. The next year, John Dingle (AAI 1941, AAI president 1957-58) nominated Enders along with Weller and Robbins, but the nomination was not advanced. In 1954, the Nobel Committee received nine nominations for Enders, two of which included Weller and Robbins.26 This time, Gard was determined that the Nobel Prize go to the scientists who had unlocked the mystery of polio. The Nobel Committee initially recommended Vincent du Vigneaud as the laureate, but Gard enthusiastically pushed the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institut, the body responsible for the nal decision for the Prize in Physiology or Medicine, not to follow the recommendation of the Committee and instead select Enders, Weller, and Robbins. The Assembly accepted Gard's arguments and awarded the team the Nobel in 1954. News of the unusual behind-the-scenes dispute was leaked to the New York Times, but du Vigneaud received some consolation when he was given the Nobel Prize in Chemistry the very next year.27 Even as Nobel Laureates, Enders, Weller, and Robbins are not familiar names like Salk or Sabin are today because their work was not as public facing as the vaccine creators' . Nevertheless, their discovery came at a crucial time when polio was affecting more children than ever before. Toward a Vaccine In the fall of 1949, Jonas Salk (AAI 1947), the nearly 39-year-old director of the Virus Research Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, wrote to Enders requesting a sample of a successful culture material for growing poliovirus. Salk, searching for a faster way to produce a killed virus vaccine, was deferential to Enders, stating that he did \"not want to intrude on any things you might be doing or want to do...if you have already made plans to do any studies of this sort on your own.\" Enders initially turned down Salk's request as they were conducting some preliminary studies toward a vaccine. Unbeknownst to Salk, Enders and his two younger colleagues were at odds about the next step of their research. Enders viewed vaccine research as beneath basic researchers, and a problem more suited for industry to undertake. Furthermore, he recognized that their relatively new lab was \"not set up for vaccine production.\" As head of the lab, Enders's argument won the day and samples of and techniques for tissue culture were shared with Salk. The race toward a successful vaccine was gaining speed. 28 In the July issue of the AAI Newsletter, we will cover the application of this basic research to the development of successful polio vaccines and the legacy of the national drive to defeat an epidemic disease.

It was not, however, the rst time AAI was faced with calling off this celebrated conference. During the Second World War, AAI was unable to meet for three years due to federal wartime travel restrictions. Today, AAI is a much larger and more complex association, and it is also better equipped to keep immunologists connected in difcult and disruptive times. In this issue, AAI looks back at the rst time an unprecedented situation forced the disruption of our annual meeting. War When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and other American military installations in the Pacic on December 7, 1941, Congress ofcially declared war on Japan the next day. Germany, quickly followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States on December 11, and Congress responded in kind hours later. Although the war in Europe had begun more than two years prior, the United States spent those years attempting to stay neutral while secretly aiding the Allies.1 After Pearl Harbor, the country was suddenly embroiled in a global conflict. The Last Meeting Before Restrictions The 1942 meeting was held in Boston, Massachusetts,at the Parker House hotel,famous as the birthplaceof both Boston cream pieand its namesake roll, andas the location where futurepresident John F. Kennedy announced his candidacyfor Congress in 1946. 2 In a change from previous years,the meeting was scheduledfor only a single day.Of the 50 scientists who presented research at the 1942 meeting, half were from either the host city of Boston or the states of New York and New Jersey. The rest were from across the country and around the world, including from North Carolina, Illinois, Minnesota, and California, and even S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. 3 The scientic program was wide ranging, with presentations on various aspects of complement xation; immunization; protein reactions; and diseases such as tuberculosis, influenza, and polio.4 On the morning of April 1, the AAI Council met. The minutes of that meeting show very little indication that the country was rapidly mobilizing for war. The normal business of the association was handled, including electing new members and nominating the next president, Jacques J. Bronfenbrenner (AAI 1920, AAI president 1942-45). The Council approved the \"Note to Contributors\" inThe Journal of Immunology (The JI) and discussed specicstyle standards for manuscripts\u2014all very normal business. They also voted to accept membership in the Federation ofAmerican Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) \"if andwhen invited.\" 5 The biggest issue of the meeting ar ose when Arthur F. Coca (AAI 1916), who had served as editor-in-chief of The JI since its founding in 1916 and as secretary-treasurer since 1918, offered his resignation from the latter post. The minutes reflected Coca's explanation that \"on account of his very limited diet, he might be prevented from attending Recalling the Suspension of AAI Annual Meetings, 1943-45\" Till a More Favorable Time\" The Parker House Hotel, Boston, MA Library of CongressSpeed limit sign between Lititz and Manheim, PA, 1942 Library of Congress www.aai.org 163meetings held in distant places.\" His Council colleagues asked him to postpone his decision \"until a suitable successor could be found,\" which would end up taking longer than expected.6 The only indication in the minutes that things werenot right in the widerworld was the decisionthat the project for anInternational Handbookof Immunology be \"tabled till a more favorable time.\" 7 Wartime Rationing Even before the 1942 meeting, the United States was facing restrictions on the home front as massive mobilization demanded raw materials. In addition to the well-known rations for products such as sugar, meat, nylon, and silk, some of the rst rationing standards restricted civilian transportation in order to conserve rubber for production of airplane tires and engine components. The War Production Board banned all civilian automobile sales as of the rst day of 1942, and tires were rationed beginning January 5. Within two months after the AAI meeting, a national speed limit of 35 mph was established, as tires were shown to last four times longer at that speed than at 65 mph. 8 At the same time, gasoline was rationed on the east coast. By the end of the year, gas rationing would be nationwide, with most civilians eligible to buy only four gallons per week. Traveling across the country to a conference became not only logistically impossible, but unpatriotic as well. Every mile put on a private car's tires was viewed as stealing rubber from military airplanes. Joseph Eastman, the director of the federal Ofce of Defense Transportation (ODT), launched an intensive propaganda campaign urging voluntary restriction of unessential travel to avoid necessitating government control of railroad trafc. Even though 1943 had been expected to be a very busy year for travel\u201414,500 organizations had planned national or state conventions\u2014most groups chose to voluntarily cancel their events to support the war effort. 9 Missed Meetings The 1943 AAI annual meeting was supposed to have taken place in conjunction with (or as part of) the FASEB meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 6-10.10 In keeping with both voluntary and legal restrictions, the AAI Council decided to cancel rather than encourage scientists to travel from points across the continent to Cleveland. Also cancelled was the year's AAI election, so Bronfenbrenner remained the association's president until another meeting could take place. With the war still ongoing in 1945, the White House issued a \"Ban on Conventions\" that was really a series of requests. Starting in February, all conventions of more than 50 people were to be cancelled, hotels were to refuse reservations for unapproved Life in the War Years When the United States entered the Second World War, it was still recovering from the Great Depression that began in late 1929. New Deal programs had helped drop the unemployment rate from a high of 24.9 percent in 1933 to 9.9 percent in 1941. The military enlistment of eligible men and rapid growth of the defense industries quickly brought the unemployment rate down to 4.7 percent in 1942, and it averaged 1.7 percent for the remaining war years.Jim Crow laws (state and local laws in the South) continued unabated during the war years to enforce strict racial segregation in everyday life while disenfranchising black voters through poll taxes and literacy tests. With far fewer segregation laws, northern states nevertheless imposed de facto segregation as housing discrimination created poor, racially homogenous neighborhoods. The federal government was segregated: all branches of the military continued their 150-plus years of ofcial segregation, just as federal government agencies maintained their segregation that had been ofcially imposed by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913.

Bronfenbrenner Missouri Digital Heritage HISTORY 164 AAI History Compendium (2021)The war also delay ed AAI becoming a member society in FASEB. The 1942 meeting was the second in a row held in conjunction with the FASEB annual meeting. That year, AAI formally applied for FASEB membership, but approval had to wait for the next FASEB meeting, which did not occur until 1946. Because of the unprecedented delay, FASEB ofcially backdated the join date of AAI to 1942. The JI Although AAI was unable to hold meetings while wartime restrictions were in place, it was still able to contribute to scientic research through The JI, which continued publication without interruption. Much of the research the journal printed was directly applicable to the war effort and, in many cases, was funded by the federal government. (See \"The JI in a World at War\" in the October 2016 issue of the AAI Newsletter for more on wartime publications.) Back to Business When Japan surrendered to the Allied forces on August 15, 1945, the process of returning to normalcy on the home front began. The ODT lifted the nationwide 35 mph speed limit only four days later.12 By the end of the war, 99 percent of the Baseball Continues Baseball in the United States was far and away the country's biggest sport. A month following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Judge Kenesaw M. Landis, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, wrote to President Roosevelt requesting guidance about the upcoming season for the 16 major league and 320 minor league teams, all whites only. \"If you believe we ought to close down for the duration of the war, we are ready to do so immediately...If you feel we ought to continue, we would be delighted to do so. We await your order.\"Roosevelt replied a day later, stating that \"it would be best for the country to keep baseball going\" because baseball \"provides a recreation which does not last over two hours or two hours and a half, and which can be got for ve ry little cost....Here is another way of looking at it\u2014if 300 teams use 5,000 or 6,000 players, these players are a denite recreational asset to at least 20,000,000 of their fellow citizens\u2014and that in my judgment is thoroughly worthwhile.\"The war did, however, change baseball by moving more games to the evening in keeping with Roosevelt's request: \"I hope that night games can be extended because it gives an opportunity to the day shift to see a game occasionally.\" With major league baseball and its minor leagues given a \"green light\" from the president, the Negro Leagues also continued play throughout the war. With higher employment spurred by the war industries, the leagues saw records in attendance during these years and a revival of the Negro World Series in 1942.Hundreds of ballplayers from the major and Negro leagues, and thousands from the minors, served in all branches of the military for the duration of the war. Many of them lost their lives.With so many players overseas, a women's league, the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League, was formed and began games on May 30, 1945. Initially more similar to softball, their game evolved to be virtually the same as men's baseball as the women's athleticism became apparent.President Franklin D. Roosevelt throws out the rst pitch Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and Museum Ration Book, Ohio , United States, 1942 National Museum of American History meetings, and all trade shows were to be cancelled.11 Hoping the war would conclude in early 1945, FASEB was once again tentatively planning to hold its annual meeting in Cleveland, May 8-10 if possible. The war dragged on too long to allow it, however, and the AAI Council likewise complied with the government 's requests. www.aai.org 165stock of passenger automobiles, frozen in 1942, had been allotted. The last of the auto rationing ended on October 30.13 In a November 28, 1945, letter to AAI members, Bronfenbrenner announced that the 1946 meeting would go forward as planned in March in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Although the federal restrictions had been lifted, plans for a FASEB meeting until that point had been uncertain because of difculty securing accommodations.At the March 12, 1946, Council meeting, the minutes reflected not only the election of Michael Heidelberger (AAI 1935, AAI president 1946-47 and 1948-49) as the rst new president in four years, but also a unanimous motion offering Coca, still serving as secretary-treasurer, the Council's \"hearty congratulations, its deep appreciation of his long and faithful services...and its wish that his active interest in the Association continue.\"14 The scientic program of the 1946 meeting returned to atwo-day format, with 80 scientists giving 46 talks. Penicillin,which had rst been used to treat streptococcal meningitisin 1942, and then extensively in the battleelds of the SecondWorld War, was a major theme of the rst session. With the war over, AAI members were investigating how the new antibiotic interacted with a variety of bacteria. Other presentations dealt with antibody formation, anaphylaxis, influenza, and diseasesthat had been encountered in the Pacic such as dengue feverand malaria. 15 Polio also gured into this meeting. Among the new members elected at the 1946 meeting were two giants in the then-ongoing battle against polio, Albert Sabin (AAI 1946) and Hilary Koprowski (AAI 1946). John F. Enders (AAI 1943, AAI president 1952-53), who was soon to culture poliovirus for the rst time, was on the AAI Council but did not participate in the membership voting that year \"on account of absence from his ofce.\"16 IMMUNOLOGY2020 The necessity of cancelling IMMUNOLOGY2020 and holding IMMUNOLOGY2021 as a virtual meeting due to the COVID-19 pandemic was as clear as it was unfortunate. The AAI annual meeting today is of a magnitude much larger and more complex than it was in 1942, but digital communication has ensured that the business of the organization can go on, even during years when world events preclude an in-person meeting, with much less disruption than in earlier times.

The Roosevelt administration was able to get around the Neutrality Acts in a number of ways to aid the Allies, including the Lend-Lease programs. 2 Kennedy also proposed to Jackie Bouvier (1953) and held his bachelor party (1953) at the Parker H ouse. 3 Otto Bier (AAI 1947) was afliated with the Instituto Biol\u00f3gico de S\u00e3o Paulo, but at the time of the 1942 meeting was at Columbia U niversity on a Guggenheim Fellowship. 4 Program of the Twenty-ninth Annual Meeting of the American Association of Immunologists, 1942, AAI Archiv e, Rockville, MD. 5 Minutes of the Meeting of the Council of the American Association of Immunologists, Apr il 1st, 1942, AAI Archive, Rockville, MD. 6 Minutes, 1942. 7 Minutes, 1942.8 Bradley Flamm, \"Putting the Brakes on 'Non-Essential' Travel: 1940s Wartime Mobility , Prosperity, and the US Ofce of Defense,\" Journal of Transport History 27, no. 1: 79. 9 Civilian War Transport: A Recor d of the Control of Domestic Trafc Operations by the Ofce of Defense Transportation, 1941-1946 (Washington: US Government Printing Ofce, 1948), 84. 10 The ofcial record is unclear if the AAI annual meeting would be held at the same location and time as the FASEB annual meeting or would, for the rst time, be held as part of the FASEB meeting. 11 Civilian War Transport 85. 12 Civilian War Transport 175. 13 Civilian War Transport 159. 14 Minutes of the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Immunologists, March 12, 1946, AAI Archive, Rockville, MD. 15 Program of the Thirtieth Annual Meeting of the American Association of Immunologists, 1946, AAI Archive, Rockville, MD. 16 Minutes, "}
