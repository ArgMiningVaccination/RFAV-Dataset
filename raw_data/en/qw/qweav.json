Qadar In Disease \u00b7 Human illness is part of qadar. Medical treatment is not denial of or attempting to reverse qadar. Both the disease and its treatment are part of Allah's all-embracing qadar. \u00b7 The human in his limited knowledge cannot distinguish between curable and incurable disease. Human experience has shown that diseases considered incurable a few years ago are now curable. \u00b7 It is therefore logical that humans in ignorance of the true situation should play safe by treating all diseases to the best of their ability being fully aware that this is an attempt and leave the rest to Allah. \u00b7 Immunization and other preventive measures are treatment before disease and are not denial of qadar. Qadar In Death, al qadar fi al mawt \u00b7 Allah alone determines the life and death of cells, tissues, organs, and the whole human organism. No human can give life or take it away. \u00b7 The human can be involved as an agent but not as a cause. \u00b7 This is a matter that King Nimrod could not grasp in his arguments with Ibrahim (PBUH). Ibrahim told the King that Allah gave and took away life. The King countered by killing one person and sparing the life of another one.[i] The king either did not understand or chose to ignore the issue at stake, creating life de novo. LIFE, hayaat \u00b7 Life, from the tauhidi-based holistic integrative Islamic paradigm, shumuliyat al Islam, is a complex phenomenon with biological, chemical, social, psychological, and spiritual components. \u00b7 The relations among the components of life are governed by the physical laws, sunan al kawn, of balance, mizan, equilibrium, i'itidaal, and reciprocal action-reaction, tadafu'u. \u00b7 Humans share biological life with plants and animals and share spiritual life with angels. \u00b7 Humans are the only creation to have both biological and spiritual life at the same time. \u00b7 Human life devoid of spirituality is like animal or plant life. Health, sihhat, raahat, 'aafihat \u00b7 Health is a positive and holistic state of well-being and not mere absence of disease or illness. \u00b7 Health includes spiritual, physical, psychological, emotional, and psychological dimensions in holistic balance and equilibrium. \u00b7 The spiritual component is the most important and its impairment adversely affects all the other components. \u00b7 Holistic measures of quality of life and health must incorporate all the dimensions above. Soul, ruh \u00b7 The ruh, the permanent and eternal essence of each human life, was created before Adam. \u00b7 Ensoulment, nafakh al ruh, occurs in intra-uterine life. It is a spiritual event that also sustains biological life; Desoulment, naza'u al ruh, is followed rapidly by biological death. \u00b7 The limited knowledge of humans about the ruh is only from revelation, wahy. \u00b7 The Qur'an used several terms that seem to be referring to various manifestations of the same essence of human life: ruh, nafs, aql, naasiyat, lubb, dhihn, fuad etc, \u00b7 These terms can be mapped by experts in tafsir al Qur'an to spiritual, psychological, cognitive, emotional, and social modalities that professionals use in providing holistic spiritual support to patients. Spiritual Support, al da'am al ruhi \u00b7 Patients should be supported to reach calmness devoid of fear or anxiety by accepting death as a transitional event. \u00b7 The transition is from inferior and temporary life on earth, hayat al duniyat, through the interregnum, hayat al barzakh, to the superior and eternal life in the hereafter, hayat al akhirat. \u00b7 Death is not a terminal event and neither does it break the reassuring direct communication between the human and the Creator. \u00b7 Of all links and relations that a human can have, it is only the link with Allah that persists after the disappearance of parents, siblings, children, spouses, friends, and enemies Psychological Support, al da'am al nafsaani \u00b7 The patient should be supported to ascend from the lowest to the highest levels of the nafs. \u00b7 From the evil-inclined soul, nafs al ammarat to the self-conscious \u00b7 From the self-conscious soul, nafs lawaamat to the high levels of the calm soul, nafs mutmainnat. \u00b7 Nafs mutmainnat is described as raadhiyat, mardhiyat, qanuu'at. \u00b7 At this level the patient bravely faces the suffering and pain of illness. Cognitive Support For The Patient, al da'am al ma'arifi/al fikri \u00b7 The patient should be supported to appreciate illness as just one minor phenomenon in the wide and expanding spatio-temporal dimension of the universe 'aalamiin. \u00b7 The patient should be guided to appreciate that illness can have beneficial aspects such as forgiveness of sins and bringing out the best in the human who can overcome pain and suffering and stay calm and composed. Emotional Support, al da'am al 'aatifi \u00b7 The patient's self-worth, self-esteem, and self-confidence to face the challenges of illness should be enhanced. \u00b7 The patient should be aware of the superiority of human creation that overcomes innate weakness such as evil-doing fisk, and spilling blood, safk al dima, to become a vicegerent, khalifat, who with limited control of the universe, taskhiir, is able to build a material civilization, imarat al ardh. Social Support, al da'am al ijtima'e \u00b7 The patient should be given support to live the remaining life with the highest quality of social relations with the family and the wider community. \u00b7 Members of the family should be welcome as partners in patient care and should be treated as honored guests of the hospital with all the rights of the visitor, huquuq al dhaif. \u00b7 The patient should be enabled to stay in contact with the outside community and not be confined to the 4 walls of the hospital room: news, visits, participation in radio talks etc Physical Support, al da'am al maadi \u00b7 The spiritual support professional cannot ignore the physical needs of the patient. \u00b7 The primary necessities, dharuraat, are those needed to preserve life like basic staple food and water. \u00b7 The needs, haajiyaat, bring emotional satisfaction like favorite dishes served in an attractive way. \u00b7 Embellishments, tahsiinaat, and complementaries, mukamillaat, are what are beyond the necessities and needs Spiritual Healing \u00b7 Dua, ruqyah, tawakkul, and raja are spiritual treatments. \u00b7 It is permitted to slaughter on behalf of the sick taqarruban ila al llaah and to give the poor. \u00b7 HCWs must make dua for the patients because qadar can only be changed by dua. \u00b7 HCWs can make ruqya for the patients by reciting the two mu'awadhatain or any other verses of the Qur'an. \u00b7 Payment for ruqya is allowed. Conclusion \u00b7 Islam has concepts of life and health than can guide spiritual support for the patient. \u00b7 The multi-dimensional manifestations of the ruh require that spiritual support consider spiritual, psychological, emotional, social, and physical modalities of patient welfare. \u00b7 Little research has been carried out on spiritual support from the Islamic perspective. \u00b7 Because of its multi-dimensional aspects, spiritual support should be recognized as a separate profession that goes beyond religious guidance, "}
