Laser Pain Centers is your best choice!

Traditional medicine fails time and time again, and leaves you hopeless and sitting in pain, or addicted to pain pills, and even worse. High Power - High Dose Laser Therapy (HDLT) is more than another pain management approach. The Diowave Laser is revolutionizing pain relief. Our High Power High Dose Laser Therapy Patient Center is achieving close to a 90% success rate. While many patients are completely pain free now, others are experience 50% and 60% less pain. And while some cases don't allow for the results that we hope--as some of our patients have said--less pain is a success! Have specific questions about what we can do for you? Let us know right now. Your pain free life can start as soon as we can determine your specific needs. All patients who come to our clinic for evaluation and treatment will first receive a comprehensive neurological, orthopedic and biomechanical physical examination. We will then discuss your diagnosis and whether or not you can benefit from HDLT. In order to get permanent, if not long term results for conditions of the feet we must address and correct the biomechanical issues or kinetic chain dysfunction of the patient. With this correction, the laser can now heal the inflamed tissue and not only provide the best outcome, it will lessen the number of treatments necessary. Don't waste another minute in pain, come out and see us today! I was experiencing severe pain on the outside of my right knee. I had a partial knee replacement over 8 years ago and thought I was headed for a total knee replacement. DIOWAVE Laser Therapy was recommended to me and after one treatment the pain was gone. I slept the entire night for the first time in over 2 weeks without waking up with pain. - Jack K.
