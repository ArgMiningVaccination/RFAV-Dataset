This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\u00a92015 do-TERRA Holdings, LLC Microplex MVp 052715 Preformed vitamin A is found in foods from animal sources, including dairy products, fish, and meat (especially liver) (6). Beta-carotene is by far the most important provitamin A carotenoid; however, alpha-carotene is another provitamin A carotenoid. The body can convert these plant pigments into vitamin A (6). Vitamin A is important for normal vision, the immune system, growth, bone formation, reproduction, and healthy skin (1, 4-6). Vitamin A supports normal cell growth and differentiation, playing a critical role in the normal formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs (2). 2. Vitamin C Alternative names: L-ascorbic Acid, L-ascorbate, Calcium Ascorbate, Magnesium delivers stable forms of vitamin C: calcium ascorbate and magnesium ascorbate, (which also delivers two of the most important nutrients, calcium and magnesium, for our skeletal and cardiovascular systems). Vitamin C, is a water-soluble nutrient, meaning that your body doesn't store it. We have to get what we need from food, including citrus fruits, broccoli, and tomatoes, or through supplementation (7). Vitamin C is a powerful, water-soluble antioxidant that helps neutralize free radicals (8). Vitamin C is needed for the normal growth and repair of tissues in all parts of the body (7). Vitamin C helps the body make collagen, an important protein used to make skin, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels (7, 11-13). Vitamin C helps maintain and support healthy immune system function (8-10). Vitamin C helps maintain healthy skin and slow signs of premature aging (7). Vitamin C helps keep blood vessels flexible and resilient (7, 13). Vitamin C can easily be depleted by stress and exercise (8). 3.
