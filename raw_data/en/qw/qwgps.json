U 17.1. Progression policies - The college or school creates, makes available to students and prospective students, and abides by criteria, policies, and procedures related to: Academic progression Remediation Missed course work or credit Academic probation Academic dismissal Dismissal for reasons of misconduct Readmission Leaves of absence 2 Rights to due process Appeal mechanisms (including grade appeals) 17.2. Early intervention - The college or school's system of monitoring student performance provides for early detection of academic and behavioral issues. The college or school develops and implements appropriate interventions that have the potential for successful resolution of the identified issues. 3) College or School's Comments on the Standard: The college or school's descriptive text and supporting evidence should specifically address the following. Use a check to indicate that the topic has been adequately addressed. Use the text box provided to describe: areas of the program that are noteworthy, innovative, or exceed the expectation of the standard; the college or school's self - assessment of its issues and its plans for addressing them, with relevant timelines; findings that highlight areas of concern along with actions or recommendations to address them; and additional actions or strategies to further advance the quality of the program. For plans that have alr eady been initiated to address an issue, the college or school should provide evidence that the plan is working. Wherever possible and applicable, survey data should be broken down by demographic and/or branch/campus/pathway groupings, and comments provided on any notable findings. How student matriculation, progression and graduation rates correlate to admission and transfer policies How academic counseling and/or student support staff work with students seeking to retain or regain good academic standing, and how extensively they are utilized How early intervention and remediation rates correlate to progression How academic probation, leaves of absence, dismissal, readmission, due process, and appeals rates correlate to progression How the college or school is applying the guidelines for this standard in order to comply with the intent and expectation of the standard Any other notable achievements, innovations or quality improvements Interpretation of the data from the applicable AACP standardized survey questions, especially notable differences from national or peer group norms Professional and Academic Guidance Standard 15 discusses the structure and management guiding the professional development of students, inclusive of (but not limited to) the ident ification and remediation of behavioral and/or professional misconduct. We refer the reader to the school's self -assessment of Standard 15 for a more thor ough discussion of professional standards and guidance. Prior to the implementation of the co -curricu lum, students met with their advisors on a voluntary basis. Some students met with their advisor frequently, and received substantial guidance on their academic and professional development, both for students in good academic and professional standing, as well as those not in good standing. However, not all students took advantage of this opportunity. With the implementation of the co -curriculum, all students are required to meet with their advisor each semester. 3 This provides much more consistency in ensur ing that students have access to the academic counselling and support necessary to successfully complete the professional program. Academic Progression Academic p rogression is ensured through course scheduling, pre-requisites , and access to academic advising. Academic curriculum plans are available for students in the Pharmacy Student Handbook (Appendix 17A ), on the Student Blackboard Community site, and SOP website @ https://ww w.ndsu.edu/pharmacy/pharmd/ . All students must achieve a minimum grade of \"C\", or \"Pass\" in Pass/Fail courses in the professional program in order to progress. Appeal mechanisms (including grade appeals) are detailed in CHP Policy 3.01, and NDSU Policies 326, 335, and 337 ( Appendices 17B -E). School of Pharmacy Policy 3.20 Academic Remediation ( Appendix 17F ) outlines remediation and is available in the Pharmacy Student Handbook and in the SOP Policy Manual @ https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/pharmacy/documents/schoolinfo/School_of_Pharmacy_Policy_Manual_11.13.18.pdf . SOP faculty expect students to attend class following NDSU Policy 333 Class Attendance Policy (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/policy/333.pdf ). Only excused absences are eligible for remediation of any work or points missed due to the absence. CHP Policy 3.10 Instructional Continuity Policy describes procedures for making up missed work in the event of an emergency that prevents the instructor fro m holding regular class periods ( Appendix 17 G). Dismissal or termination from the program can be from a variety of reasons following CHP Policy 3.01, 3.03, and 3.14 ( Appendices 17B, with the ADSA&FD for termina tion due to professional issues or the SrAD (for academic issues), the corresponding administrator will discuss available options with the student. There is a possibility of readmission after a dismissal by initiating the appeal process. The student may send a letter to the corresponding administra tor outlining their request, reasons for past deficiencies, improvements that have been made, and a plan to ensure future success. For academic issues, this appeal is then reviewed by the SOP Academic Affairs and Student Progress Committee who decides the outcome. Professional issues are handled by the CHP Student Affairs Committee. Leaves of A bsence If a student needs to take a leave of absence, they first initiate the process by contacting the ADSA&FD , who then will, after meeting with the student, noti fy the SrAD. Each leave is individualized depending on the nature of the student's situation. There is no difference in this process whether the leave is professional or personal. Leaves of absence are handled procedurally at NDSU. Students who wish to leave the institution for a period of time must submit a \"Withdraw to Zero Credits\" form to the NDSU Office of Registration and Records ( https://www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms/ ). The studen t must inform the ADSA&FD in writing before the withdrawal form is accepted. Alternatively, students frequently proactively contact the ADSA&FD , at which point a conversation occurs with the studen t and the Associate Dean helps the student navigate the withdrawal process. In both cases, during the conversation, as well as in the ADSA&FD's response to the student's request, information about how to return following the leave of absence is provided . This entails a formal written request that must be made to both the ADSA&FD and the NDSU Office of Registration and Records to reactivate admission. It also involves a discussion of various policies impacting the return, including School of Pharmacy Pol icy 3.22 Maximum Time for Completion of the PharmD which is 8 years ( Appendix 17J ). 4 Early Intervention Professional College Policy 3.01 provides a set of parameters (along with consequences and adjudication procedures) to manage behavioral issues (Appendix 15D ). All behavioral issues sanctioned under Policy 3.01 are addressed by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development. Thus, the School of Pharmacy has a clearly defined mechanism in place to address behavioral issues once they occur. As discussed in Standard 15, NDSU Policy 326, NDSU Policy 335, use of the Professional Misconduct Tracking (in the CHP) and the Academic Misconduct Tracking (at NDSU) forms govern student conduct, tracking , and due process for academic and profess ional misconduct (Appendices 15E -F). Students and faculty can find useful information and resources that promote academic honesty and integrity at https://www.ndsu.edu/academichonesty/ . NDSU requires all syllabi to contain a reference link to Policy 335, as well as an academic honesty statement. The College of Health Professions instituted a Professional Misconduct Tracking form in 2012 to address professional misconduct proactively . This form was developed by faculty, but students had substantial input, and indeed defined, the parameters of its use. For example, students had strong opinions about being required to report each other, and the criteria that would require such self -reporting. Faculty an d staff in the College who observe instances of unprofessional behavior (as outlined by College Policy 3.01) that are best addressed immediately and informally by the faculty/staff (rather than through a formal sanction under College Policy 3.01) complete the form. This form is recorded and stored (just like other student files) in the Dean's Office, by the ADSA&FD . As noted above, when forms are submitted, faculty and staff are expected to address the issue with the student and inform the student about the submission of the Professional Misconduct Tracking form. If various faculty and staff submit multiple forms on a single student (always when three forms are submitted, and in special instances when two or fewer forms are submitted), the ADSA&FD calls a meeting with the student. The incidents are discussed, and sanctions under College Policy 3.01 are assigned. Aggregate reports are available from the ADSA&FD for faculty to view . Academic A recent initiative under the auspices of the SrAD is identifying students failing the ir first exam in the semester in each class as a way to help students regain academic standing early on . The SrAD obtains exam results for all courses and notifies the faculty advisor of unsuccessful students. The notification includes a request for advisors to reach out to the ir advisee as a general check in and offer of assistance. This i nitiative has been particularly helpful to identify P1 students early on who may be at risk as well as to monitor the progress of students who are on , or have been on, academic probation or warning. Results from fall 2019 semester reveal 17 P1 students fai led one or more of their first semester exams with 8 P1 studen ts failing one or more courses (delaying their graduation) . Of the 8 P1 students who failed a course , 6 of them failed one or more of their first semester exams . The results indicate this initiative may be useful as an early warning system for P1 progress as well as faculty advisor early intervention may have helped at risk students regain academic standing. Upon conclusion of each semester, the SrAD solicits from faculty the names of professional students who did not pass their course or who were offered remediation due to a failing grade. Student s who are unsuccessful in their coursework are issued a letter from the SrAD with a copy sent to their faculty advisor. Those with up to 2 course failures during the program are placed on academic probation for one semester ; students with a total of 3 course failures are placed on academic warning for the remainder of the program, and those with more than 3 course failures are terminated from the program. Students on 5 academic probation and warning are also asked to meet with the SrAD to discuss reasons for their lack of success, improvement plan, and to develop an individualized curriculum / co -curriculum plan going forward. All instructional f aculty in the School of Pharmacy are informed prior to the start of the next semester about professional pharmacy students who are either on, or have been placed on, academic probation or warning, and by extension are deemed as \"At Risk\". The intent is for instructors to be aware of students who may need extra help and to reach out to the students before i t is too late in the semester. Instructional faculty reach out to the SrAD &/or the AD SA&FD during the semester for guidance &/or assistance with struggling students. One missing piece of infrastructure is a statistical tracking mechanism to identify at risk professional students before they are placed on academic probation. The ADSA&FD recently developed a preliminary model based on academic performance prior to entry into the Doctor of Pharmacy program. In other words, information collected through the admissions process, on both academic and professional evaluation criteria, will be us ed to identify students who are statistically more likely than their peers to become academically \"at risk\". The program was built and will be beta tested during the Spring 2019 semester. AACP Survey Data As noted in question 40 of the most recent AACP Faculty Survey, NDSU faculty are less confident than faculty at peer institutions and nationally that the program has an effective process in place to manage poor student academic performance. A recent change was to revise Polic y 3.20 Academic Remediation such that remediation is treated the same as a course failure 4) College or School's Final Self -Evaluation: Self -assess how well the program is in compliance with the standard by putting a check in the appropriate box : Compli ant Compliant with Monitoring Partially Compliant Non Compliant No factors exist that compromise current compliance; no factors exist that, if not addressed, may compromise future compliance. No factors exist that compromise current compliance; factors exist that, if not addressed, may compromise future compliance /or Factors exist that compromise current compliance; an appropriate plan exists to address the factors that compromise compliance; the plan has been fully implemented; sufficient evidence already exists that the plan is addressing the factors and will bring the program into full compliance. Factors exist that compromise current compliance; an appropriate plan exists to address the factors that compromise compliance and it has been initiated; the plan has not been fully implemented and/or there is not yet sufficient evidence that the plan is addressing the factors and will bring the program into compliance. Factors exist that compromise current compliance; an appropriate plan to address the factors that compromise compliance does not exist or has not yet been initiated /or Adequate information was not provided to assess compliance Compliant Compliant with Monitoring Partially Compliant Non Compliant 6 5) Recommended Monitoring: If applicable, briefly describe issues or elements of the standard that may require further monitoring. N/A Development of a Simple Model to Identify At-Risk Professional StudentsThe Challenge In 2016, new Accreditation Council on Pharmacy Education (ACPE) developed new accreditation standards and guidelines. Two changes are noteworthy The requirement that each college/school of pharmacy develop and implement a \"co- curriculum\" The requirement that each college/school of pharmacy develop a statistical model to gauge students' risk of not successfully graduating from the professional program with their intended cohort and correlate that risk with admissions criteria.Study Objective The purpose of this study is to develop an initial, descriptive, comprehensive, statistical profiling model that identifies at-risk students, and the factors that signal risk, from the pre-professional through the first professional year of study in the North Dakota State University Doctor of Pharmacy Program. Study Objective The study is: Initial - only examine the first half of study Descriptive - examine the factors that correlate with students becoming at- risk. Comprehensive - students fail to progress in any number of academic courses/experiences and many factors go into admitting students. The study will: Broadly guide future, more directed profiling initiatives in specific areas/courses. Allow for out of sample forecasting and cohort-specific characteristics. Methodology We seek a method of data analysis that: Allows multiple input (admissions) and output (professional student success) variables Is flexible Is intuitive Can be applied to data with and without well-defined statistical properties. Can be applied to small (perhaps too small for regression and SEM) and large sample sizes Can be implemented without the use of specialized statistical software (i.e., it can be implemented in Microsoft Excel)Methodology Based on these considerations, we adopted: Simple Pearson and Spearman Correlations Understand basic trends in the data Maximum Correlation Analysis (MCA) as the technique of choice. Used in Tofalis, JORS, 2001 Murphy, Rosenman, McPherson, and Friesner, MCRR, Let variable X be \"success in admissions process\" X is a linear combination of all major pre-professional criteria used to assess admission, including grades and soft skills. X = a Where w1 ,..., wJare parameters for each of the J admissions characteristics. The model can include or exclude an intercept. Data may be unstandardized or standardized using z-scores.MCA Methodology Let variable Y be \"success in the first year of the professional program\" Y is a linear combination of all major professional program criteria (courses) used to assess admission, including grades and soft skills. Y = b Where 1 ,...,are parameters for each of the L professional progression criteria. The model can include or exclude an intercept. Data may be unstandardized or standardized using z-scores.MCA Methodology MCA uses the following nonlinear programming model, which can be implemented using Excel's Solver's nonlinear programming routine: ,,,...,,,..., Subject to: Y = b X = a MCA Methodology We look for three major things: Large weights (more important criterion) In sample model fit (magnitude the overall correlation) Consistency/uniqueness across cohorts.Methodology Retrospective, descriptive empirical analysis Use current \"P2\" professional pharmacy cohort (admitted two years ago; 4-5thyear college students) Use current \"P3\" professional pharmacy cohort (admitted three years ago 5-6thyear college students).

We are excited th at you are a student in our professional program and I want to provide for you some informa tion that I hope will be of assistance to you during your academic journey with us. A very important person during yo ur time with us is your adviso r. This individual is available to assist you in planning your program o f studies and answer questions ab out future career options. I urge you to meet regularly with your advisor especially if you have any questions, concerns or need help with any academic, College, or campus issues. Faculty and staff are prepared to work with you on an individual basis and help guide y ou through your journey with u s. Additional career information can also be found in our Administrative Offices in Fargo - Sudro 12 3 and by attending our Annual Career Fair in September at the FargoDome. The professional curriculum is designed to challenge you and to teach you to become an independent learner and to work in collaborative interprofessional healthca re teams. Therefore, students are expected to take a very active role in their education and take responsibility for their own learning. Student active learning is a major emphasis of our program. You will be asked to apply your knowledge, dig for the answers to questions, comm unicate both v erbally and in writi ng, critically think and problem-solve through case discussions, practice team-based care with students from other disciplines, and participate in numerous experiential activitie s. I encourage you to ask questions in class and to learn by understanding and applying the material p resented rather than by simply memorizing factual information. The goal of our curriculum is f or you to achieve the necessary life- long learning skills which will bec ome important to you in your future career as a health professional to be able to \"keep up\" with the plethora of new information as sociated with our rapidly changing health care system. Your ultimate su ccess will be determined by the am ount of effort you are willing to put into your academic studies. So work hard and give your best eff ort in all that you do. If you give us your best, you will receive the best in your educational experi ence with us. It will also be important that you learn more than just the tec hnical skills of practicing in your discipline but that you also learn what it means to become a health professional and practice professio nalism in every and all situations. You will need to learn how to practice ethically, responsibly, with honesty, integrity, and good moral character and treating others (e specially your patients) with c ompassion, caring, understanding, and respect which is expected of any health professional. These wil l be the keys to your future success as a health professional. We desire to provide a positive learning environment for all st udents here within the College and we strive to continually improve our program. Students are a very important part of this process and we actively solicit your input and ac tive participation through va rious formats. Students are elected from each class to serve on the Dean's Student Liaison Committee. Th is committee meets with the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development throug hout the year to bring student concerns to the att ention of the administr ation. In addition, t he College holds a Deans' Open Forum each semester to allow students an opportunity to interact dire ctly with the Dean (and his administrative leadership team) on matters of interest and conc ern to students. And I also want you to know that my door is always open to you, so pleas e don't hesita te to stop by my office if you need my assistance for anything. We encour age you to use these sources as well as visits with faculty, or any of the members of the staff in our Administrative Offices whene ver you have issues that need to be brought to our attention. In addi tion, I encourage you to becom e actively involved with your profession by joining one of our student pro fessional organizations. This is a great way to learn about what's going on within your profession and begin contributing to the a dvancement of your future professional career and practice. This \"Handbook\" is devoted to academic information to help enha nce student success within our program. We hope you find it helpf ul to you. I wish you much su ccess in your educational pursuits with us and in your later pr ofessional practice. Best wishes to you fo r a successful year! Charles D. Peterson, Pharm.D. Dean, NDSU College of Health Professions 4 GENERAL FAQ AN INFORMAL GUIDE: The following is a series of inform al responses to ques tions most frequently asked about rules and procedures at NDSU. For further information, please refer to the current NDSU Bulletin ( www.ndsu.edu/bulletin/ ), your adviser, Administrative O ffice in Sudro 123, the Office of Registration & Records in Ceres 110, or One Stop in the Memorial Union. ACADEMIC ADVISERS Who is my adviser? Students in the pre-pharmacy and professional pharmacy progra m are assigned an adviser. It is important to m eet with your adviser on a regu lar basis to receive updated curricular information. Advisers help student s learn how to complete the registration procedures. Students are responsible for the course and program selections which they ma ke. However, an adviser is a valuable source for acquiring in formation about the advisabilit y of student choices. (If you desire a change of adviser, please contact the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development, School of Pharmacy, 231-7601.) Do I need to see my adviser about my semester schedule? Yes, make an appointment with your adviser during advising week to plan your schedule of classes. Dates for advising and registration are available on the Office of Regi stration & Records web site ( www.ndsu.edu/registrar ) and \"The Spectrum,\" published twice per w eek when full semester classes are in session. CREDITS How many credits do I need to be a Sophomore, a Junior and a Se nior? You need 27 credits to be classified as a Sophomore, 60 credits to be classified as a Junior, and 90 credits to be classified as a Senior. To graduate, you must successfully complete all g eneral education requirements, the requirements in your major, and with a minimum of 2.0 grade poi nt average. A complete list of University requirements for grad uation is in the current NDSU B ulletin. What is the limit on the number of credits I can take per semes ter? Full-time students will carry from 15 to 19 credits per Semester. Registration for more than 20 credits is not recommended. Special permission from your adviser and a grade point average of at least 3.0 are required to register for more than 20 credits. You mu st obtain a \"Petition to Enrol l in More Than 20 Credits\" form under the link, \"Over 20 Cr edits Petition,\" at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . How many credits will I lose when I transfer to NDSU from anoth er school? O r d i n a r i l y y o u shouldn't lose any. However, a \"D\" grade in any course does no t transfer to the College of Health Professions. Some technical courses may not fit your degree pr ogram and in this case some extra work may be required. For eva luation of transfer credit see cu rrent NDSU Bulletin. How many credits can I transfer from a junior or community coll ege? All college-level credits from regionally accredited institut ions transfer; however, not all may apply to the particular degree program you have selected. To obtain a baccalaureate degree yo u must complete at least 60 semester credits at a four year college or university. At leas t the last 37 of these credits must be at the junior or senior level . (See current Bulletin.) 5 How do I challenge a course? A student who is currently registered may seek credit by chall enging a course. A course challenge usua lly consists of a special com prehensive examination; however, additional types of performance may be required for some course s. A course challenge is only permitted for courses in which t he student has not received tra nsfer credit or has no previous academic record. Prior registrations are allowable if course was dropped prior to the No Record Drop deadline in a given term. Student must be registered at NDSU during the semester in which you wish to challenge a course (see current NDSU Bulletin for complete desc riptions). Procedures for pursuing a course challenge may be found at: www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/regist rar/forms/challenge.pdf Is it possible to obtain college credits by taking examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board (CLEP and AP)? Yes. Students may demonstrat e evidence of college-level achievement through the use of n ationally standardized tests. Competency to write these examinations may have been gained th rough intensive preparation in high school, extensive reading in a particular field, or other types of formal or informal pre paration. A student may not repeat by proficiency testing a course t hat has been previously taken or failed at NDSU or another accredited institution. Score reports must be sent directly to NDSU from the awarding agency/board. School reports and student-issued grade r eports are not considered off icial for purposes of awarding credit by examination. DEGREES (CURRICULUM REQUIREMENT) How do I petition for a waiver or substitution of a curriculum requirement? To petition, you must obtain a \"Request to Waive or Substitute Courses\" form under th e link, \"Substitute/Waive a Course\" at www.ndsu.edu/registrar/forms . In this petition, which is presented to the Academic Affairs Committee of the College of Health Professions, you state exact ly why you think you should have a waiver. The Committee will revi ew your petition and you will b e notified of their dec ision. (Petitions should be submitted onl y when special circum stances make it vir tually impossible for you to meet the regular degree requirements.) Only departmental and college requirements may be waived. University requirements may not be waived. GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS Who must complete the General Education Requirements? The General Education Requirements apply to all students. What are the General Education Requirements? The General Education Requirements are listed in the current NDSU Bulletin. A l ist of the courses approved f or the different categor ies is provided at www.ndsu.edu/regist rar/academics/gened. General Education transfer with the ND University System. Students who plan to transfer from one institution to another in the ND University System should c heck with Office of Registration & Records in Ceres 110 or One Stop in the Memorial Union. GRADES AND ACADEMIC STATUS What is the G.P.A.? Grade Point Average. For each credit of \"A\" you receive four (4) honor points; three (3) for each credit of \"B\"; two (2) for each credit of \"C \"; one (1) for each credit of \"D\"; and zero (0) for each credit taken in which a grade of \"F\" is received. The GPA is computed by dividing the total number of honor points earned at NDSU by the total number of cr edit hours in which honor points were recorded. For example, a person with a G.P.A. of 3.00 has a grade average of \"B.\" The minimum GPA of 2.00 is required for graduation. Developmental courses do not count toward graduation requirements. 6 If I do not do well in a course, may I take it over again? Yes. The second grade, whether higher or lower, will replace the first grade in computing the GPA. B oth grades are listed on your Permanent Record. To replace a grade for a course taken at NDSU, that course MUST be repeated at NDSU. The one exception is that NDSU students may regi ster for a Tri-College course to repeat a course previously taken at NDSU. NOTE: PROFESSIONAL COURSES IN THE PHARMACY PROGRAM - please refer to Policy #3.24, Repetition of Professional Course s, in the College Policy Manual. NOTE: PRE-PHARMACY CORE COURSES, Policy #2.21.1 - The total number of pre-pharmacy core courses which may be repeated shall be lim ited to three. The grade received during the student's final attempt for any core pre-p harmacy course will be us ed in evaluation for admission. A withdrawal is not c onsidered an attempt. A core course is one that is included in the GPA for admission purposes. CURRENT COMPETENCY, Policy #2.28 - Coursework in the areas of science and mat hematics must be no more than seven years old at the time of application to the pr ofessional program. Coursework presented in these areas t hat is older than seven years must have current competency demonstrated.

STUDENT ACADEMIC AND CONDU CT STANDARDS POLICY 3.01 (revised October 31, 2018) Introduction The mission of the NDSU College of Health Professions is to edu cate students and advance research and professional service in pharmacy , nursing, allied sciences, and public health. The College has established professionalism and ethics as two of its core values. Pharmacists, nurses, allied health care professionals, public h ealth professionals, and pharmaceutical scientists must live up to the hi gh ideals of their profession. Their lives must be guided by the principles of honesty and integrity, in order to ensure that the public can r egard their words and actions as unquestionably trustworthy. To develop an understanding of and respect for these principles of honesty and integrity as applied to the academic work of pharmacy, nursing, allied science, and public health students, the College of Health Professions has developed this student conduct policy. This pol icy is applicable to anyone enrolled as a student in the College, including those in the pre-professional , professional, and graduate programs. This policy also applies to any student taking a course for credit i n the College. Acceptance of this policy is required as a condition of admission to the College. Academic Standards The academic standards of the College of Health Professions dif fer from those of the University. Any student who fails to meet or exceed the University standards ma y be placed on University probation or suspension (see the current NDSU Bulletin for university inform ation on academic deficiencies). Semester Grade Point Average (All Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all undergraduate and professional students shall maintain a se mester grade point average of 2.00 or above for each semester enrolled in the College of Health Profe ssions. All graduate students are expected to maintain a 3.0 grade point average as well as any o ther academic policies outlined by the graduate school. Any student who fails to attain a semester GPA of 2.0 or above may be placed on College probation. Students who have been placed on academic probation for two (2) consecutive or three (3) non- consecutive semesters shall be suspended from enrollment in the College. After two suspensions, 20 students will be terminated from the College. (Termination from the College does not prohibit the student from registering elsewhere in the University provided t he academic standards of the alternate college of registration have been met or exceeded.) A student who is suspended and desires readmission into the Col lege m u s t f i l e a r e q u e s t f o r r e - admittance with the Senior Associate Dean at least 60 days prior to the be ginning of the semester in which readmission is sought. In addition, professional students must seek readmission to the professional programs in Pharmacy, Nursing, Allied Sciences, an d Public Health through the Admissions Committee of t heir respective program. Minimum Grade Requirement (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all students enrolled in the professional programs of the Colle ge must complete all required courses within the College with a grade of \"C\" or above. Studen ts are encouraged to refer to program- specific policies related to minimum grade requirements which c an be found in the College Policy Manual at www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions/college_information /policy_manu al/. Graduate students are expected to uphold policies and procedures consistent with the graduate school and to maintain a 3.0 grade point average. Students Enrolled in College Aff iliated Educational Training Pr ograms (Professional Students): To be in good academic standing within the College, all student s enrolled in College affiliated internships, clinical, or experiential training programs are al so required to uphold the academic standards of that affiliate and will be subject to the terms of probation, suspension, and termination of the affiliated program. Student s failing to meet affiliated pro gram academic standards may also lead to termination from the College. Conduct Standards High standards of professional c onduct are expected from all st udents, both to facilitate the learning of all students and to promote professional values. Individuals are ex pected to represent the College, professional program, or profession in a positive, professional manner. Students conducting clinical experiences, rotations, and/or in ternships must also uphold the specific policies of their clinical site. All students are held responsible for exhibiting the following professional attributes : honesty, integrity, accountability, confidentiality, and professional demeanor. Aca demic dishonesty and professional misconduct are unacceptable. If there is doubt about whether or not academic or professional conduct is appropriate, individuals should query the Dean's Office. Examples of unprofessional conduc t include, but are not limited to, the following: Academic Misconduct: 1. Cheating, includes but is not limited to, the following: a.

Reporting Process Academic Misconduct 1. Students are required to report any academic misconduct to t he Senior Associate Dean within 7 days of the occurrence. Failure of the student to report violat ions within the required time could result in immediate expulsion from the College and/or its progr ams. Graduate students must also report to the Department Chai r of the graduate program. 2. The course instructor who suspects that academic misconduct has occurred in their course or other instructional context has an initial responsibility to: a ) inform the student(s) involved of his/her suspicion and the suspicion's grounds; b) allow a fair opportun ity for the student to respond; and c) make a fair and reasonable judgment as to whether any academic misconduct occurred. 3. The course instructor will report academic misconduct violations to their Department Chair within 7 days of the occurrence or di scovery of the misconduct. 4. The Department Chair will r eport the academic misconduct to the Senior Associate Dean . 22 Professional Misconduct 1. Students are required to report any professional misconduct to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development within 7 days of the occurrence .

A copy of the Student Academic Misconduct Tracking Form will be placed in the student's academic file. Professional Misconduct 1. Professional misconduct issues may be more likely to happen outside of the classroom and have broader implications for the well-being of students, faculty, a nd staff in the College. Hence, the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development has the initial and primary responsibility for administeri ng and enforcing professional mis conduct issues. 2. The Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Developme nt will work collaboratively with the Department Chair (and where appropriate, individual instructors ) to resolve professional misconduct issues. Department and College Related Sanctions Additional academic and/or professional disciplinary sanctions for the department/program may be assigned by the Department Chai r depending upon the circumstanc es and nature of the misconduct. The Department Administrator will not ify the student in writing of the sanction and rights to due process and forward a copy to the Senior Associate Dean &/or Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development. The Senior Associate Dean may impose additional disciplinary sa nctions for the College and will notify the student in writing and the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (if a graduate student involved). Disciplinary action for academic and professional misconduct will depend based upon the seriousness of the misconduct. In general, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, any of the following: 1. Probation. 2. Supervised probation. 3. Suspension from the College. 4. Termination from the College. (Termination from the College of Health Professions does not prohibit the student from registering else where in the University provid ed the academic standards of the alternate college of registrati on have been met or exceeded.) 23 In cases of particularly egregious or multiple instances of aca demic/professional misconduct, the Dean of the College may also recommend expulsion from the university. Student's Right to Appeal Students sanctioned for violations of the College Student Acade mic and Conduct Standards Policy have the right to appeal.

An appeal for any sanction must be made in writing within 15 business days of the sanction letter. The date of the letter shall be the date the letter is postmarked. If hand-delivered, a notation of that date will be made in the student's file. 5. Appeal letters must specify i n detail one or more of the fol lowing bases of appeal: a. the sanction was too severe for the offense; b. the decision for non-action/ac tion/sanction was made in an a rbitrary or capricious manner; c. the finding of the Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy having been violated was not substantiated by evidence, and/or d. the student's/student organization's rights were violated (s pecify those rights believed to have been violated). Appeal Review Process (Pre-professional and Professional Studen ts) 1. Appeals made to the Senior Associate Dean or Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development will be reviewed by t he Academic Affairs Committee or Student Affairs Committee of the College depending upon the cond uct violation in question. 2.

Unresolved Appeals After the College appeals process has been completed, if the st udent/organization is not satisfied with the appeal decision, the student/organization has the right to appe al the decision to the Provost. The Provost will make the final dec ision on any appeals. Incomplete Disciplinary Process Students with pending disciplinary or legal actions, with sanct ions for which an appeal has been submitted but not resolved, or whose sanc tions have not been successfully fulfilled, will not be allowed to graduate from NDSU with a degree, major, or program of study offered by the College of Health Professions. In such cases, the College reserves the right to place a hold on a stud ent's graduation until the case has been successfully resolve d and the sanctions hav e been successfully fulfilled. 24 Annual Pledge, FERPA Not ification, and Signature I have read and understand the above policy. I agree to accept and abide by this Student Academic and Conduct Standards Policy of the College of Health Professions. I understand that possible violations of this policy and sanctions imposed, as well as information used to su bstantiate violations (including, but not limited to, criminal background ch ecks and drug screens), may b e shared with College affiliated educational training programs, clinical sites at which I may complete progr am-specific experiential requirements, licensing and/or certification boards relevant to my program of study, clinical sites at which I work for non- academic reasons (i.e., for pay or to volunteer), and other fac ulty, staff or administrators within the College of Health Professions and North Dakota State University who hav e a legitimate interest in my education. I understand that I have the right to revoke the College of Healt h Professions' ability to share this information at any time. Should I revoke the ability of the College of Hea lth Professions to share relevant information with the aforementioned parties, I also understand that I am im mediately ineligible to complete a degree offered within the College of Health Professions, and I volunta rily (and immediately) withdraw from my major or program of study within the College. I understand that withd rawing from a major or program of study within the College of Health Professions does not prevent me fr om pursuing another major at North Dakota State University. I am also awa re of and assume responsibility for following other College and Department policies as stated in my major or program of study's student ha ndbook. STUDENT COMPLAINT POLICY 3.28 The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), at the behest of the U.S. Secretary of Education, requires all accredit ed pharmacy programs to establi sh, implement and assess a formal complaint policy for students. Mor e specifically, all accredit ed colleges or schools of pharmacy must establish a comprehens ive policy with a sim ple set of procedure s whereby all students enrolled in the College (and the pharmacy program in particular) can submit and resolve a complaint about the educational process. While such procedures do not always produ ce an outcome that meets the student's preferences, they do ensure that students have access to an equitable and efficient means to remediate their complaints. The complete set of ACPE standa rds regarding student complaint policies can be found on pages 38-39 (Standar d 20) of the follo wing The NDSU College of Health Profe ssions takes student complaints very seriously. Our goal is to ensure that students have access to transparent, due process in a manner that leads to an appropriate resolution of the complaint. To that end, a copy of the NDSU C ollege of Health Professions policy relating to this issue is available on its website at www.ndsu.edu/heal thprofessions . Students who have difficulty accessing this webpage may also obtain a copy o f the complaint policy in the Dean's Office (Sudro Hall 123). A discussion of this policy shall tak e place annually during the orientation process for first profe ssional year students. Each student complaint will be appropriately documented and inv estigated. A chronological record of each complaint, including the nature of the complaint, written records of the complaint procedure and the final outcomes of the resolution process shall be maintaine d in the Office of the Dean of the School of Pharmacy, and shall be available for review by ACPE or its r epresentatives upon wr itten request or in the process of an on-si te evaluation visit. Student complaints generally fall within two major categories: complaints about unfair grading and all other, non-grade-related complain ts. Student complaints about grades are generally handled at the level of the University, since grades are usually administered through the NDSU Office of Registration and Records. Other student complaints remain under the purview of the individual colleges within NDSU. 25 Student Complaints Regarding Grades University Grade Appeal Policy 337 NDSU has an establis hed policy regarding complaints about gradi ng, otherwise known as \"grade appeals\". The full grade appeal policy, which includes hearing procedures, is available at www.ndsu.edu/fileadm in/policy/337.pdf . While students actively considering a grade appeal are referred to the aforementioned we bsite for the s pecific details of the policy, a summary of the policy is outlined below. With the exception of i ncomplete grades, a course grade is cons idered final unless an appropriate appeal is filed by the student. Gr ade changes are also consider ed only for those students who have not yet earned a degree for whic h the course in question was ap plied. For a student who has reason to believe that they have been iss ued an incorrect or inappropriate grade, he/she must initiate a request for a change of a grade w ith the instructor within fifteen (15) instructional days of the first day of the semester immediately following the semester in which the grade was awarded. For Spring Semester courses, the request may be made within fifteen (15) instructional days of the start of Fall Semester. A grade appeal is formally initi ated when the student presents the Grade Appeal Form to the instructor. If there is an unsatisfactory dec ision, the student must consul t the Department Head, and the Dean or a designated college committee, p roceeding from one level to th e next only after an unsatisfactory decision of the conflic t at that level. In the event that the i nstructor is also t he Department Head or Dean, he or she need onl y be consulted in t he capacity of instr uctor. In the event of an unsatisfactory decision within the college, the student may submit a formal wr itten appeal to the Grade Appeals Board Chair. Such an appeal shall be m ade within fifteen (15) instruc tional days after conclusion of the college proceedings a s stated above. Non-Grade Student Complaints Pre-professional and professional pharmacy students who have a non-grade-related complaint can seek resolution of t hat complaint through the following procedu res. It is important to note that these procedures represent the sole av enue for student complaints reg arding non-grade-related issues, including (but not limited to) ACPE standards, policies and pro cedures. Additionally, because the pharmacy program spans multiple departments, the non-grade comp laints are handled through the Dean's Office, rather than by the departments themselves. 1. The student(s) or, in cases where student anonymity is requ ired, their advocate (also known as the \"plaintiff(s)\") will file a formal written complaint (de livered through the postal service or NDSU email) to the Dean's Office in the NDSU College of Health Professions. 2. The written complaint must include a description of the pol icy, procedure or ACPE standard in question. It must also summarize the argument of the plaint iff (including the grounds for the appeal or complaint) and provide a reasonable amount of evi dence supporting the claim. 3. Upon receipt of the written complaint, the complaint will b e assigned to either the Senior Associate Dean (as the Chair of the College Academic Affairs Co mmittee) if the complaint is primarily academic in nature, or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development (as the Chair of the College Student Affairs Commit tee) if the complaint is primarily non-academic. The plai ntiff(s) will receive email no tification (via NDSU email) within forty-eight hours of the receipt of the complaint concerning th e identity of the Associate Dean handling the complaint. 4. The Senior Associate Dean (or, if a non-academic issue, Ass ociate Dean for Student Affairs & Faculty Development) shall c onvene a meeting of College Acade mic (or, if a non-academic issue, Student) Affairs Committ ee to review the complaint. Bec ause the procedures for both Associate Deans and Committees are similar in procedure, they w ill henceforth be referred to generically as \"Associate Dean \" and \"Committee\", respectivel y. The Committee meeting shall occur within thirty days from the time that the Associate Dean receives the written complaint. 26 5. Once the Committee has met, t he Associate Dean shall prepar e and submit a formal, written reply to the student(s) based on the recommendation of Committe e. The reply shall include an evaluation of the complaint, a description of any violations , and a proposal for any necessary corrective action. The reply will be sent through off icial NDSU delivery methods (i.e., the postal service, campus mail and/or the NDSU email sy stem) within fifteen business days from the time that the Co mmittee makes a decision. 6. Decisions of the Committee t hat demonstrate arbitrary and c apricious treatment, or that are fundamentally inappropriate in the eyes of the plaintiff(s) may be appealed to the Dean of NDSU College of Health Professions. In such cases, the student (s) file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed directly to the Dean. The written complaint would also identify and pro vide evidence indicating that the Associate Dean and/or the Comm ittee acted in an arbitrary, capricious or otherwise inappropriate manner. 7. If unsatisfactory resolution occurs after the appeal to the Dean, a final appeal may be made to the Provost. Once again, the student(s) must file an appeal using steps one through three outlined above, except the written complaint would be addressed directly to the Provost, rather than the Dean, and would provide evidence substantiating the claim of unfair treatment at prior procedural levels. STUDENT TECHNICAL STANDA RDS (PHARM.D) POLICY 3.29 The North Dakota State Univers ity College of Health Professions ' mission is to educate students and advance research and professional service in pharmacy, nursing, allied sciences, and public health. As a corollary to this mission, t he Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D .) program seeks to train students who have the ability, interest and work ethic necessary to be eligi ble for licensure, and embark upon a successful career as a health care professional. Thus, the Phar m.D. professional program requires students to undertake the full set of activities that are necessary to complete their program of study. The goal of every licensed pha rmacist is to provide safe and effective care to patients. In order to provide that care, individuals mu st have the physical, cognitiv e and social skills necessary to learn, practice and master each of the competencies of one's professio n. Failure to demonstrate these competencies not only endangers the patients under the pharmaci st's care, but also impacts the ability of other providers to provide sa fe and effective patient care. Therefore, the following techni cal standards represent competen cies necessary to complete the Pharm.D. professional program and provides additional guidance to the College Student Technical Standards Policy 3.11 for students. Students must be able, with or without reasonable accommodations, to consistently demonstrate these competencies. Students who fail to demonstrate these competencies are ineligib le for admission or progression in the NDSU Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) professional program. The technical standard compete ncies are organized into five general categories: 1. Perception/observation 2. Communication 3. Motor/tactile function 4. Intellectual, conceptual, int egrative, and quantitative abil ities 5. Behavioral and Social Attributes 1. Perception/Observation Competencies Students must be able to utilize their senses and mental abilit ies to perceive and observe information presented through: Written material Audiovisual material Demonstration Large-group lectures Small group discussi ons and presentations One-on-one interactions 27 Laboratory experiences Patient encounters (at a d istance or close at hand) Procedures 2. Communication Competencies Students must be able to communi cate effectively and efficientl y (in English) using nonverbal, verbal, and writing st rategies with faculty members, other members of the healthcare team, patients, familie s, and other students, in ord er to: Produce written and or al communication Elicit information Convey information Clarify information Create rapport Work collaboratively Develop therapeut ic relationships Demonstrate com puter literacy 3. Motor/Tactile Function Competencies Students must have sufficient mot or function, skills, and tacti le ability to execute basic tasks in the training and provisi on of patient care. This inclu des coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equ ilibrium, and functional use of the senses o f touch and vision in order to: Attend and pa rticipate in classes, groups , and activities which are part of the curriculum. Conduct basic laboratory procedures and tests. Perform basic, non-sterile compounding. Demonstrate as eptic technique. Examine patients (including in spection, auscultation, palpati on, percussion, and other diagnostic maneuvers). Administer immunizations, perfo rm cardiopulmonary resuscitati on, perform palpitation, auscultation, and percussion. Provide patient care appropr iate to the circumstances. Perform in a reasonably indepen dent way in potentially high s peed/high demand/emergency en vironments. 4. Intellectual, Conceptual, Inte grative & Quantitative Compete ncies: Student must be able to demonstrat e higher-level cognitive abil ities, which include: Memory Rational thought Visual-spatial comprehension Conceptualization Application Measurement Calculation Analysis Representation (oral, written , diagrammatic, three dimensiona l) Organization Synthesis Clinical reasoning Ethical reasoning 5. Behavioral and Social Competencies Students must consistent ly demonstrate attributes of profession alism, including: Empathy, compassion, integrit y, and respect for others. Preparation, initiative, and a ccountability cons istent with a commitment to excellence. Commitment to legal and ethical principles pertaining to the provision of patient centered care. Mindfulness of the environment, recognizing that one's profes sionalism is constantly evaluated by others. 28 Reasonable Accommodations under th e Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) The College strongly encourages a ny student who suspects that h e or she may have a disability to contact the NDSU Office of Dis ability Services for guidance con cerning the steps that are necessary to document and verify the nature and extent of the disability. Consistent with NDSU and Federal policies, students with document ed evidence of disabilities may request reasonable accommodations. However, such requests are not r easonable if they disrupt, are detrimental to and/or endanger patients, students, co-workers and/ or instructors, or otherwise cause a fundamental a lteration to the program. Failing to Meet, Reporting and Ad judicating Technical Competenc ies Applicants and students of the P harmacy Doctorate professional program who consistently fail to demonstrate the competencies ident ified above are ineligible fo r admission or progression in the program. Students who are admitted to the Pharmacy Doctorate pr ofessional program and who realize (either through their own effort s or as demonstrated by a licen sing board, a preceptor or a faculty member in the program) that they do not (or no longer) consistently demonstrate the requisite technical competencies to be e ligible for licensure have an eth ical obligation to self-report that information to the College's administration (i.e., the appropri ate department chair, t he Senior Associate Dean and/or the Associate Dean for Student Affairs). Once realized (through own awareness or as reported to them by a licensing boar d, faculty, or preceptor), failure to self-report a consistent lack of technical competencies represent s a violation of the Student Co nduct Policy (College Policy Manual, Policy 3.01). SUBSTANCE MISUSE TESTING POLICY 3.14 The NDSU College of Health Professions is committed to ensuring safe, healthy learning environments, including both dida ctic and experiential learning environments, for all of its students. The use of illicit drugs, as well as the overt misuse of alcoho l and/or legally prescribed medications (including, but not l imited to, mood altering medications) comp romise learning environments and are prohibited under College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy an d University Policy 155. It is beneficial for all College of Health Profe ssions stakeholders (including i ts students, faculty, staf f, clinical partners, and the patients and families we se rve) to establish a testing policy process to ensure the safety and health of these learning enviro nments, as well as to ensure an equitable due process for students who are alleged to partake i n substance misuse. Basis for Testing The College of Health Professions reserves the right to require any student enrolled in one of its pre- professional or professional programs and/or enrolled in any co urse housed within the College to undergo testing for substance mi suse. All testing is coordinate d and monitored through the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development (ADSAFD). All testing must be direct observation, 10 panel (or higher) tests, and must be conducted at a WADA-accredited or SAMHSA- certified laboratory. Per Co llege Policy 3.12: Student File Con tents, all test results shall be maintained in a secure location in the Offi ce of the ADSAFD, and may be in cluded in the Student's Personal File. The default method of analysis w ill be urinalysis, although the ADSAFD reserves the right to require alternative methods of analysis ( for example, blood analysis or hair analysis) where appropriate. Alternative methods (if requi red) will be disclosed in writing when notifying the st udent about the need to be tested. Nonrandom Testing Nonrandom testing for substance misuse may occur as a requireme nt for entry into clinical sites (per site policies or program-specif ic experiential education polici es), or to fulfill the requirements of sanctions imposed und er College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Po licy. Reasonable Suspicion Testing Incidents or events involving sus pected substance misuse by stu dents shall be reported to the ADSAFD using the Reasonable Susp icion Reporting Form. Reasonabl e suspicion shall be determined using objective evidence (photos , legal documents, or other doc umentation), reports made by credible sources (law enforcement, clin ical site staff, NDSU faculty and staff, etc.), or a combination of these sources. Because it is a violat ion of University Policy 155 and College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct 29 Policy to misuse alcohol or pre scription medications, or to use illicit drugs, and te sting may exonerate the student of an alleged policy violation should the allegatio n be made falsely, the ADSAFD may exercise discretion in determining what evidence is of sufficie nt credibility to require testing. A descriptive summary of the evidence will be provided to the stu dent at the time the student is informed of the need to submit to testing. Random Testing The College of Health Professions may implement a random substa nce misuse testing program. Should a random subst ance misuse testing pr ogram be implemented , the parameters of the program must be made freely available on the College of Health Professi on's website, and students must be provided notice of the policy at l east 6 months prior to its im plementation. No more than 5 percent of the active College of Health Pr ofessions student body may be ra ndomly selected for testing in any academic semester. No student will be randomly identified for t esting more than once in a single academic year. The random selecti on of students will be impleme nted using a computer generated random number generating process, with interval (or other non-w eighted) sampling. A summary of that selection process shall be provided to the Dean of the Col lege of Health Professions on an annual basis. Testing Process Students who are required to und ergo testing will be notified i n writing via NDSU email. Upon receiving a request for testing, students ar e responsible for providing a 10 (or larger) panel, direct observation, drug screen from a reputable, appr opriated licensed vendor with in 12 business hours of the date and time of the request. The student i dentified for testing is sole ly responsible for obtaining his/her own appointment for testing, his/her transportation to the appointm ent, and paying the costs of these tests. An original copy of the test results must be delivered to the O ffice of the ADSAFD at the end of the 12 business hour window. Test result s that show evidence of a dilu ted sample will not be accepted, and will not result in additional time in which to submit test resu lts. Ramifications for Positive Test Results or Failure to Test in a Timely Manner Students whose test results are positive are subject to sanctio ns outlined in College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Once sanc tions are assigned, a student' s rights of due process are also outlined in College Policy 3. 01: Student Conduct Policy. Students who fail to submit an original copy of their test resu lts within the 12 business hour window face additional sanctions under C ollege Policy 3.01: Student Co nduct Policy. More specifically, students who fail to provide the r equired test results within t he 12 business hour window will be sanctioned under the pres umption that the test results for the substance misuse in question are positive. Testing Alternatives Students whose religious, cultural or other practices prohibit them from undergoing a specific type of drug test may request that the ADSAFD require an alternative te st, so long as the alternative test is of equal or greater accuracy and prec ision than the original test required by the ADSAFD. All parameters identified previously apply to t he alternative test. In the eve nt that no such test exists, or in the event that students are unable to jus tify the need for an alternative test, students may be found in violation of College Policy 3.11: S tudent Technical Standards. TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENT S FOR PHARMACY STUDENTS Students are required to purchase an iPad for use in the classr oom, Thrifty White Concept Lab, and experiential rotation sites. The Pharmacy program endorses a full size iPad that has 32 GB o r higher based upon the amount of memory, sharpness of display, a nd speed. However, students may choose any current iPad version and size, including previous iP ads (5, 6, Air or Pro) since Apple has a consistent operating system between devices so that older devices are still compatible when upgrades are made. When making your choice, keep in mind that t he iPad will be utilized for a variety of applications incl uding note taking and for testing; the iPad mini may not be an optimal choice for all formats. 30 Other devices, such as smartphon es, android tablets, and/or lap tops cannot be substituted for the iPad requirement. It is import ant to keep the technology consis tent in the learning environment so that all students have the same learning experience. Even though oth er devices can do some of the same things an iPad can do, all of t hese devices operate off differe nt platforms. Not all educational apps will work on all platforms and some devices (e.g. smart phone) are n ot appropriate for some apps (exams). Lastly, apps are designed to work on tablets, not laptops. If y ou have already purchased a device other than an Apple iPad it may be possible to sell it on Craig slist, eBay, or Amazon so that you may recoup some of your investment. We highly recommend that iPads be purchased through the NDSU Bo okstore. Exclusive arrangements have been made with the NDSU Bookstore to allow st udents the ability to charge the iPad to their student account. For students with financial aid, the charge will be subtracted from your aid. The NDSU Bookstore has know ledgeable staff including: Brad Sonmor, Dept. Manager, and Justin Hills, Certified Apple Technici an. Finally, Bookstore personnel will assist students with any service issues for all iPads purchased fr om them. Options to purchasing a less expensive iPad include buying a \"refurbished\" iPad through the online Apple store or purchasi ng one through Craigslist, eBay, or Amazon. It is recommended that students also purchase the AppleCare+ Wa rranty. The cost of the warranty is $69 - $129 for two (2) years and provides technical support and repairs, including coverage for up to two (2) incidents of accidental damage (such as dropping it) . See http://store.apple.com/us/pro duct/S4689LL/A/applecare-for-ipad for more information. (Note: If your parents purchase this device fo r you, their homeowners insuranc e may cover the iPad, minus the cost of the deductible, in the event i t is stolen. You will need to keep track of the device ID in order to report it.) The AppleCare+ Warranty c an be purchased fr om the Bookstor e. Again, the NDSU Bookstore will assist students with service i ssues if the iPad was bought from them. Students have also found that pur chasing an external keyboard i s advantageous for taking notes in class. There are several to choos e from, some of which are desc ribed in this article: https://www.digitaltrends.com /mobile/best-ipad-keyboards/ . Lastly, a word about iPad Apps. In itially, you will \"need\" only a few Apps, many which are free. At the minimum, you will need: An App to take notes in class on your iPad. The iPad comes loa ded with \"Notes\", which is basically a blank legal pad you c an take notes on. Newer versio ns of the iPad come with \"Pages\", Apple's version of Word . NDSU students can also downlo ad Microsoft Office on their iPads for FREE! Check the following for details: https://www.ndsu.edu/its/software/ software_licensing_program/mi crosoft/office_proplus/ If you want to take notes on a course handout that you've down loaded, \"iAnnotate\" is a fantastic App and wort h the $9.99. Another note taking App that is cheaper is Notability for $9.99 that is a white board applic ation for drawing, writing, a nd note-taking. \"Adobe Reader\" view PDF doc uments and also p rovides annotat ion options-FREE Some textbooks are available as downloads on t he iPad as a Kin dle, iBook, &/or Nook and you will find electronic books are cheaper than the hardcover n ew edition. Typically, the Kindle version is the most ec onomical of the three listed. You will need to install the \"Kindle\" App-FREE Blackboard - FREE - and Yuga App which is a lso FREE to be able to access these sites directly without having to go through Safari. High Point Mobile Campus Connection - FREE - https://m.cnd.ndus.edu .

TERMINATION - RIGHT TO TERMI NATE ENROLLMENT POLICY 3.03 The College of Health Professions reserves the right to termina te the enrollment of any student at any time, if the student demonstrates that he or she is unsuited fo r a professional career and its inherent responsibilities and obligations. Circumstances that may lead t o student termination will include, but not be limited to, violation of sta te or federal statutes or re gulations. TUITION In 2012 the North Dakota Board of Higher Education approved a d ifferential tuition for the pharmacy professional program which is higher than the standard universi ty tuition rate. Differential tuition is needed to cover the higher costs associated with a professional degree program. This differential tuition does not include other s tudent fees, room and boards, a nd miscellaneous expenses. As noted earlier, students are expected to complete certain degree requi rements including Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience (I PPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Pract ice Experience (APPE) during summer months in addition to the regular academic year. Startin g with the fall 2013 semester, students should expect to be charged (and t o pay) differential tuition o n course credits for all professional program degree requirements regardless of the term in which cre dits are earned. The amount of differential tuition in an ac ademic term can be found on the ND SU Financial Aid and Scholarships website: www.ndsu.edu/onest op/accounts/ .There is a non-refundable admission deposit fee of $500 for students who have been accepted to the pharmacy program. T his fee is to assure their place in the class and will be applied to the differential tuition for t he first semester of the professional program. 32 NDS U ENTRY-LEVEL PHARM.

To enter the pre- pharmacy program the student must qualify for and obtain admiss ion to the University. Applications to NDSU may be obtained from t he NDSU Office of Admission. Admission to the professional phar macy program is competitive a nd limited to 85 students each year. Students are selected based upon successful prior academic performance at the time of admission. There are two paths to gain admission into the pharmacy program . New Early Admission Pathway (EAP) to the Professional Entry-Lev el Pharm.D. Program The first is our \"early admissi on\" path. This path is designed for high achieving high school students who seek an expedited path to the professional program. Student s are selected for this path based on their academic credentials (incl uding high school grade point a verages and ACT or SAT scores) at the time they apply to NDSU. Prefer ence is given to North Dakota re sidents. Supplemental applications are submitted online directly to the Pharmacy Admissions Commit tee. A nonrefundable $125.00 application fee must accompany the supplemental application. St udents are evaluated during the summer before they enroll at NDS U as first year students, and w ill be offered admission to this path on or before May 15 of that year . Once accepted on this admissi on path, students must attend NDSU for the entire six-year program . The first year entails standard pre-professional studies. At the conclusion of the first year, st udents who maintain academic an d professional requirements transition into a five-year professional program. During the first year i n the professional program, students complete all remaining pre-prof essional requirements, including an expedited set of courses that prepare them for the final four years of the professional progr am. Students also complete the Pharmacy College Admissions Test (PCAT) and an on-site interview. Transition into the final four years of the professional program is guaranteed as long as stud ents meet all academic and professional requirements. Students accepted into the \"early ad missions\" path, but who fail to meet all academic and professional requi rements, are encouraged to a pply to the professional program through the second path described below. Traditional Admission Pathway to the Professional Entry-Level P harm.D. Program The second path is our \"traditi onal\" path. Pre-pharmacy student s (including transfer students) typically apply for admission to the four-year professional program durin g the second (or in some cases the third) pre-pharmacy year. Admission to the professional pharma cy program is competitive and limited to the difference between the numbe r of available seats (85) an d the number of \"early admission\" students entering the final four years of the professional program each year. Students are selected based upon successful pre-pharmacy academic performance. Prefer ence is given to North Dakota residents and students who attend NDS U. A cumulative grade poin t average of 3.0 (4.0 = A) or above is required before an applicant will be evaluated for admission to the professional program. The actual admission cutoff is much higher. The Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) is an admission requirement. Students must take t he PCAT during the July or Sep tember testing dates. An on-site interview is part of the admission process for the professional program. Supplemental applications are due on or before December 31 for subsequent fall semester admis sion. Supplemental applications are submitted online directly to the Pharmacy Admissions Commit tee. A nonrefundable $125.00 application fee must accompany the supplemental application. Applicants should note that admission to the University does not grant admission to the Entry Level Pharm.D. Program. All students mu st apply and be formally acce pted by the Pharmacy Admission Committee of the School of Pharmacy before they may begin the professional courses in the four years of the pharmacy program. 35 Students may apply to the School of Pharmacy for admission into the Professional Pharmacy program upon satisfactory completion of t he pre-pharmacy program or evi dence that this program will be successfully completed at either NDSU or another accredited col lege prior to admission. Students not previously enrolled at NDSU must apply both to NDSU (with a NDSU Application for Admission) and to the School of Pharmacy (wi th the Supplemental Pharmacy A pplication form). Applications will be reviewed by the Pharmacy Admission Committ ee, which is composed of administrators, pharmacy practit ioners, and pharmacy faculty in the basic, administrative and clinical sciences. The size of each entering professional class is limit ed by the availability of the resources of the School of Pharmacy and the c apacity of the c linical facilit ies. NDSU is a state supported institution, thus, residents of North Dakota will be given primary considera tion. Residents from other states who attend NDSU full time will also be given partial residency pref erence. A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (4.0=A) or above is required before an applicant will be evaluated for admission to the Professional Entry Level Pharm.D. Program. The actual admissio n \"cut off\" is generally much higher than a 3.0. Application Procedures 1. APPLICATION MATERIALS are available on PharmCAS and should b e submitted by December 31. The student is res ponsible for seeing that ALL app lication materials are submitted and received by December 31. Applications with mater ials missing will not be considered for admission. Applic ations received after December 31 may not be evaluated. Applications submitted after De cember 31 will be used to fill r emaining spots in the professional program if any are available after evaluating thos e applications submitted prior to the December 31 deadline. 2. APPLICATION FEE - All PharmCAS fees must be paid before your application will be processed. A $125.00 non-refund able application fee is required for admission. 3. If the applicant is not a current or former NDSU student, se parate application must be made for admission to NDSU through the NDSU Office of Admission. 4. Official transcripts from all universities and colleges atte nded must be sent to the NDSU Office of Admission AND to the College of Health Professions. The tra nscripts must contain the winter quarter or fall semester grades. Students must show transcr ipt evidence that all coursework required by the en d of the spring term (courses listed by name and number) will be completed by the end of spring term.

Note: NDSU students not enrolled in the pre-pharmacy major must contact the Office of Registration & Records to request their transcripts be forwarded to the School of Pharmacy. 5. The Pharmacy College Admissi on Test (PCAT) is required. Com pleted scores must be sent to the Chair of the Pharmacy Adm ission Committee. For informat ion on the PCAT, contact us at 701-231-7601. The School of Pharmacy requires that students take the PCAT in July, September, October or November 2018 as their most recent exam. We will accept PCAT scores back three years (July 2015 to November 2018). The web address for the PCAT is www.pcatweb.info . 6. All courses must be completed with at least a grade of \"C.\" Selected core courses, indicated by an asterisk (*) must be completed by the end of fall semeste r prior to the December 31 deadline date to apply to the pharmacy program. Remaining cour ses, which are required and listed in the pre-pharmacy curricu lum, MUST be completed by the end of spring term. The only exceptions are the elective s which may be completed during the summer (up to six credits). 7. An interview on campus is par t of the evaluation process for students who receive final consideration for admission. 36 Notification of Acceptance 1. Applicants are notif ied of their acceptanc e as rapidly as ad mission decisions are made. 2. Acceptance Deposit: Applicants who are offered a position i nto the entry-level Professional Pharm.D. program are required to submit a non-refundable deposi t fee of $500.00 to the School of Pharmacy to assure a p lace in the class. This deposi t is typically due within 30 days of receipt of an admission lette r. This fee will be applied to the differential tuition for the first semester of the professional program. 3. Differential Tuition. In 2012 the North Dakota Board of High er Education approved a differential tuition for the pharmacy professional program which is higher t han the standard university tuition rate. Differential tuition is needed to cover the highe r costs associated with a professional degree program. This differential tuition does not include other student fees, room and boards, and miscellaneous expens es. As noted earlier, stude nts are expected to complete certain degree requirements including Introductory Pharmacy Pra ctice Experience (IPPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) during summer mont hs in addition to the regular academic year. Starting with the fall 2013 semester, st udents should expect to be charged (and to pay) differential tuition on course credits for all professional program degree requirements regardless of the term in which credits are earned . The amount of differential tuition in an academic term c an be found on the NDSU Financial Aid and Scholarships website: www.ndsu.edu/ones top/accounts/ . 4. An additional $100 fee is required. It will be applied to t he first year annual fee for registration as a Pharmacy Student Intern in N orth Dakota, with the North Da kota Board of Pharmacy. Note: this $100 annual fee for licensure as a student intern is required by the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy for four years of enrollment in the professio nal program. Once a student is accepted into the professional pharmacy program, he or she i s expected to continuously hold a valid North Dakota Pharmacy Intern license for the entir ety of their professional program. Reapplication A student who has made application to the professional program but is not accepted, who fails to enroll after being accepted or who was uns uccessful in the Early Admis sions Pathway program (EAP), may reapply for admission to the professional program. Students are allowed to apply to the program twice (including the EAP). Regardless of whether or not a student mee ts the eligibility r equirements, once a student pays the pharmacy applicat ion fee, that application off icially counts toward the limit of two attempts. All academic and admission requirements in force at t he time of his/her reapplication must be met. PLEASE NOTE The faculty reserve the right to change rules and regulations i ncluding those relating to admission, instruction and graduation. Su ch changes may apply to prospect ive students, as well as students already enrolled. Changes will be shared with students in a ti mely manner. However, it is the responsibility of the student to periodically contact their adv iser or the Dean's Office to obtain current policies.

An essentia l first step is the est ablishment of a patient- pharmacist relationship that s upports engagement and effective communication with pat ients, families, and caregivers throughout the proce ss. In addition, at the core of the process, pharmacists continually collaborate, document, and communi cate with physicians, other p harmacists, and other health care professionals in the provision o f safe, effective, and coordina ted care. This process is enhanced through the use of interoperable informati on technology sys tems that facili tate efficient and effective communication among all individuals involved in patient care. (Figure 1). Using principles of evidence- based practice, pharmacists: A. Collect The pharmacist assures the collect ion of necessary subjective a nd objective informati on about the patient in order to understand the relevan t medical/medication history and clinical status of the patient. Information may be gathered and verified from multiple sources including ex isting patient records , the patient, and other health care professionals. This process includes collecting: A current medication list and m edication use history for pres cription and nonprescription medications, herbal products, and other dietary supplements Relevant health data that may include medical history, health and wellness information, biometric testresults, and physica l assessment findings Patient lifestyle habits, pre ferences and beliefs, health and functional goals, and socioeconomic factors that affect access to medications and other aspects of care 58 B. Assess The pharmacist assesses the info rmation collect ed and analyzes the clinical effects of the patient's therapy in the context of the patient's overall health goals in order t o identify and prioritize problems and achieve optimal care. This proc ess includes assessing: Each medication for appropriat eness, effectiv eness, safety, a nd patient adherence Health and functional status, r isk factors, health data, cult ural factors, health lit eracy, and access to medications or other aspects of care Immunization status and the need for preventive care and othe r health care services, where appropriate C. Plan The pharmacist develops an indi vidualized pati ent-centered care plan, in collaboration with other health care professionals and the patient or ca regiver that is evidence-bas ed and cost-effective. Thi s process includes establishing a care plan that: Addresses medication-related problems and optimizes medicatio n therapy Sets goals of therapy for achiev ing clinical outcomes in the context of the patient's o verall health care goals and access to care Engages the patient th rough education, em powerment, and self- management Supports care continuity, inc luding follow-up and transitions of care as appropriate D. Implement The pharmacist implements the ca re plan in collaboration with o ther health care professionals and the patient or caregiver. During the process of implementing the ca re plan, the pharmacist: Addresses medication- and he alth-related problems and engages in preventive care strategies, including vaccine administration Initiates, modifies, discont inues, or administers medication therapy as authorized Provides education and self-management tr aining to the patien t or caregiver Contributes to coordination of c are, including the referral o r transition of the patient to another health care professional Schedules follow-up care as needed to achieve goals of therap y E. Follow-up: Monitor and Evaluate The pharmacist monitors and eval uates the effectiveness of the care plan and modifies the plan in collaboration with other health c are professionals and the pati ent or caregiver as needed. This process includes the continuous monito ring and evaluation of: Medication appropriateness, e ffectiveness, and safety and pat ient adherence through available health data, biometric test results, and patient feedback Clinical endpoints that contri bute to the patient's overall h ealth Outcomes of care, including pr ogress toward or the achievemen t of goals of therapy Information from PHARMACISTS' PATIENT CARE PROCESS MAY 29, 2014 59 NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY PROFESSIONAL PHARM ACY CURRICULUM (PRE-REQS) 2019/2020 Note: An additional 6 credits of Professional Electives MUST be completed PRIOR to P4 Year P1 (39 credits) FALL 2019 C r SPRING 2020 C r Micr 470, Basic Immunology 3 PSci 369, Pharmaceutics tical Biotechnology PSci 412, Chemotherapeutic Agents (Oncology/ID) (PSCI 411) 3 PSci 411, Principles of Dynamics 3 PSci 470, Pharmacokinetics (PSCI 3 Phrm Phrm Pathophysiology II 350, Introduction to Pharmacy Prax 2 Phrm 351L, Pharmacy Practice Lab I 2 Phrm 352, Introduction to Healthcar e Systems 2 Phrm 480, Drug Literature Evaluation 3 TOTAL 18 TOTAL 18 SUMMER 2019 - Phrm 355, Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experien ce (IPPE) I , 120 hours = 3 cr. * (All P1 classes) P2 (38 credits) FALL 2019 C r SPRING 2020 C r PSci 413, Endocrine/Resp/GI Dynamics (PHRM 340, 341, Interprofessional Health Care Practice (PHRM 355) 3 PSci 414, Cardiovascular Dynamics (PHRM 340, 3 (PHRM 340, Phrm Top Hematology and Oncology (PSCI 410, PSCI 412) 3 TOTAL 17 TOTAL 17 SUMMER 2019 - Phrm 455, IPPE II, 160 hours = 4 cr. * (P1 course work + PHRM 400, 450, 452L, & 565) P3 (30 credits) FALL 2019 C r SPRING 2020 C r Phrm 475, Pharmacy Man agement (PHRM 350, 352, 452L) (PHRM 532, 537, 538) 3 500, Top II (PHRM 400) 1 Phrm 552L, Pharmacy Pra ctice (PSCI PSCI 536, Mgmt (PHRM 475, PHRM 480) 2 Phrm 537, Renal, Fluid & Ele ctrolytes (PSCI 414) 2 Phrm 572, Pharmacy Law and Ethics (PHRM 350, 352, 452L) 3 Phrm 540, Public Health (PHRM 352) 3 Phrm Pharmacotherapy ractice Lab III (PHRM 452L) 2 TOTAL 18 TOTAL 15 P-4 (40 credits) 40 W eek Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE), Phrm 581 through 589, Rotations 1 through 9.

Cody Wiberg, Pharm.D ., Executive Director Minnesota State Board of Pharmacy 2829 SE University Ave., Suite 530 Minneapolis GRADUATE RESIDENCY FAQS What is a Pharmacy Residency? A pharmacy residency is an organi zed, mentored, post-graduate t raining program. Typically, a residency is completed directly after graduating from a Doctor of Pharmacy p rogram. However, some may choose to complete residency after prac ticing as a licensed pharmacist fo r a few years. What will I learn in a residency program? You will learn the k nowledge and gain the experience required o f pharmacists in various areas of practice, allowing you to further refine your clinical skills and bring y our pharmacy-based problem solving abilities to a higher level. You will have the opportunity to learn from pharm acists who are experts in their area of pharmacy, many of which have achieved addi tional board certifications. Why should I do a residency? This is an opportunity to bridge the gap between being a pharma cy student one day, and the next day being a licensed pharmacist. You will hav e the opportunity to fortify your strengths, strengthen your weaknesses, and develop confidence in your abilities as an individual pharm acist. Other benefits include a competitive advantage in the job market, networking opportunities, career p lanning, and attendance/part icipation at local and national meetings. M any clinical positions are now requirin g a residency. What is the duration of residency program? Each residency is typically one year. They start July 1 and con clude June 30 each year. Some residencies are offered in combination with a postgraduate degree (M.S., MB A). There are also some combination programs allowing you to complete both a PGY-1 and PGY-2 progra m over the course of 2 years. Additionally, there are non-traditional program s, where a pharmacist may comp lete their PGY-1 residency over two years. Are all residency programs the same? No. The type of residency you select will depend on your career objectives. Select a program that will prepare you for the type of job you event ually want to have. Some PGY-1 programs allow you to focus your residency based on your interest. In some ca ses, an individual may procee d with a second year of training to obtain this specialized experience. Examples of current residency types inc lude: PGY-1 (\"Pharmacy Practice\" or \"General\") Pediatrics Psychiatry Ambulatory Care Infectious Diseases Oncology Pharmacy Management Managed Care Critical Care Are residencies only for hospital-based programs? No. There are many ambulatory bas ed programs. In fact, these pr ograms are among the fastest growing type. Additionally, there are community pharmacy based programs. Do I get paid during this program? Yes. Most residencies pay roughl y $40,000-$45,000 for the year. Some programs allow the opportunity to pick-up extra pharmacist shifts to earn extra pay. Most program s offer fringe benefits (e.g. health care, investment opportunities, etc.). Also, you may be eligible for deferring payment on your student loans during the program. 63 I'm not sure what type of progr am is right for me. What do you suggest? The most common type of residenc y is a PGY-1 (\"Pharmacy Practic e\" or \"General\") residency. It covers a broad spectrum of practice ar eas and patient types. Required ex periences include acute care, ambulatory care, drug information, and practice management. In addition to these \"core\" elements, each program has various specialty areas to comp lete the training experience. Al so, a research project (in collaboration with one of your preceptors) is completed during the residency year. Som e programs include teaching/precepting opportunities in cooperation with an affiliated college of phar macy. Finally, programs have various service (\"staffing\") requirements. Typica lly, staffing requires functio ning as a pharmacist during evening and/or weekend hours. How do I apply for a residency program? PGY-1 and PGY-2 residencies (ASHP-accredited) require participa tion in the residency-matching program. This is a formal process that a ttempts to match applicants to t heir choice of programs and vice versa. Programs that are in the process of rec eiving accreditation may also par ticipate in the residency-matching program. Check with the individual program s to verify their accreditatio n, and match parti cipation status. To participate in the Match for a position designated as a PGY- 2 residency, an applicant must have already completed a PGY-1 residency, or currently be in training in a P GY-1 residency program that will be completed before the start of t he PGY-2 residency. Current PGY-1 residents who are interested in continuing their training in a PGY-2 residency offered by the same sponsor as the applicant's P GY-1 residency (e.g., the same or an affiliated organization) may be able to obtain the position through an Early Commitment Process. App licants who are committed to a position in this manner do not need to register for or participate in the M atch. After I complete this residenc y experience, what is next? You will have an advantage over man y of your peers regarding em ployment opportunities. More \"doors\" will be open to you, and you will have more freedom in your career c hoice. Many employers value residency- trained pharmacists, and some jobs require residency experience . Graduates of residency programs go on to the following: pharmacist posit ions (staff, specialist, manager , etc.) in their area of tra ining, faculty positions, specialty residency programs , or fellowship programs. How do I find out more about residency programs and where they are located? Here are a few good resources: https://www.ashp.org/Pr ofessional-Development/Residency-Informa tion, college's direc tors, and ASHP's Midyear Clinical Meeting, which showcases virtually all of the ASHP-accredited programs.

Public health is defined as the pr actice of helping members of society live healthier, longer lives. More specifically, public health focuses on improving the general he alth of communities through efforts to monitor the spread of diseases, initiati ves (both clinical and policy-o riented) to prevent diseas e and disability, and by promoting healthy lifestyles th rough education and community en gagement. Public health is both an art and a science. It is practiced by int er-professional teams whose me mbers' training spans a wide array of academic and vocational fields. Of particular importance to public health in our state is deter mining how to meet the challenges of change and diversity within rural areas. R ural health solutions are essen tial to the well-being of North Dakota and to other areas of the nation and the world. North Dakota is an ideal loc ation for rural public health research in addition to the application of practical s olutions to health improvement for rural communities. Public health is an interdisciplinary field; it is common for many people to gain c ompetencies and/or training in a related field (medicine, nursing, pharmacy, bus iness, engineering, etc.) and subsequently move into public health as a matter of vocation or occupati on. The MPH degree is uniquely de signed to accommodate the needs to these individuals. It blends theory and pr actical knowledge across a wide array of disciplines, and is the \"degree of choice\" among practiti oners in the field. There are three specializations t o choose from within the MPH d egree at NDSU. The specializations of Community Health Sciences or the Management of Infe ctious Diseases are the most suitable for most pharmacists, as they prepare health professionals to integrate public health initiatives and policies within traditional medical models. It is designed to provide pharmacis ts and other health professionals with a better understanding of their diverse roles in public health. For more information on the NDSU MPH program you can visit www.ndsu.edu/publichealth or contact the Academic Coordinator/Lecturer, Ste fanie Meyer, at Stefanie.meye r@ndsu.edu. PHARM.D./MPH DUAL DEGREE OPTION The Master of Public Health (MPH) offers diverse tracks in public health that build upon the stre ngths of campus to meet the practical needs of the public and health car e practitioners who serve it. Specializations at NDSU include community health sci ences, management of infectiou s diseases, and American Indian public health. The MPH degree consists of 42 cr edits and can be completed in t wo years as a full time graduate student. Pharm.D. students are abl e to complete a Pharm.D./MPH dual degree in as little as one extra year of study. Pharm.D. students who are in good academic standing a re eligible to apply for the Pharm.D./MPH program through the graduate school during their P2 year. Why Public Health? Practitioners in our region hav e limited opportunities for adva nced, practical public heal th training that focuses on the unique challenges facing this largely rural area that en compasses North Dakota and other Northern Plains states. There are many u nderserved populations living in the region that would benefit from expanded public health interventions. Fo r example, the American Indian c ommunities have typically been underserved and significant health disparities between this population and others have resulted. Overall, there is much to be gained from greater collaboration within the Northern Great Plains, and the education of public health professionals is a natural start ing point to facilitate that co llaboration. 68 Is the MPH accredited? Yes. T he Council on Education for Publ ic Health (CEPH) at its October 6-7, 2016, meeting acted to accredit the Master of Public Health Program at North Dakota State Universit y for a five-year term, extending to December 31, 2021. What are the admission requireme nts for the Pharm.D./MPH dual d egree? You must be enrolled in the Phar m.D. program and in good academ ic standing. In additi on to graduate school requirements (with the exception of the GRE; the PCAT score can be used inst ead for Pharm.D. students), the MPH Admissions Committee may invite selected applicants for an interview. How do I apply to the Pharm.D./MPH dual degree? You apply online during the spring semester of your P2 year thr ough the Graduate School at http://ndusndsugrad.askadmissions.n et/emtinterestpage.aspx?ip=a pplication and choose \"Public Health.\" If you are a P1 student and wish to get started early, apply onlin e at the above website but choose \"Non-Degree\" in the drop down box during the spring semester of your P1 year . This will allow you to take PHRM 632 for Graduate credit. Up to nine grad uate credits can be taken as a non-degree student. When can I start the MPH program? Applications are reviewed each year beginning March through May for a fall semester start. You may also take up to nine graduate credits as a non-degree seeking student wit h permission of the instructor. How much does it cost for MPH courses? Tuition and fees for MPH coursework can be found here: www.ndsu.edu/onestop/a ccounts/tuition/gra duate_tuition_fall_201 scholarships available? Yes. Scripts Sc holars Program offers scholarships for P harm.D. dual degree students. The program provides four (4) $10,000 scholar ships nationally each year to enrolled dual degree students. The awarded students are given $2,500 per semes ter for four consecutive sem esters, totaling $10,000 over two years. For application instructi ons, please contact: ExpressScriptsScholars@aacp.org . The College of Health Professions has a limited number of schol arships and awards available for assistance to students. Applications for scholarships and awards are avai lable February 1 of each calendar year on the college web page, www.ndsu.edu/healthprofessions . Deadlines vary. NOTE: Specific information related to criteria for selection of scho larship recipients is available in the Office of Development in Sudro Hall 120. When are MPH courses offered? MPH core courses are generally offered in the evening to accomm odate students who work. These courses are only offered in the Fall and Spring semesters. There are no summer core courses, although the MPH practicum may be completed during summer. Current students are encouraged to talk with their faculty advisors for the most up -to-date information on course offerings. Does the MPH program accommodate distance learners? MPH students can take their courses on campus at NDSU or off -campus through live video broadcasts of classes (IVN). Since I will not enroll in Phrm 555 IPPE III or Phrm 552L in th e P3/Public Health year, do I still need to complete the required online tr ainings (e.g. HIPAA, HIPAA Secur ity, NDSU P reventing Methamphetamine Abuse , etc.)? Yes. You will still need to compl ete the required trainings in the fall of your P3/Public Health year. In addition, you will need to be registered as a Pharmacy Intern in the stat e of North Dakota. 69 Can I take courses in more than one area of specialization? Yes, there is a list of electiv es in each specialization that a re available to all MPH students. You are welcome to take additional credits if you are interested. Can I change to a different specialization track after starting the MPH program? Yes. You must be in good academic standing within the MPH progr am and the admissions committee for the specialization you wish to enter must agree that your backgroun d is sufficient for the transition. Contact the Academic Coordinator/Lect urer if interested. Where can I do my Practicum? Can the Practicum be done in anoth er country? NDMPH has secured Practicum affi liation agreements with local, national, and global sites in public health. Students can also request a Practicum site without an existing affiliation agreement, but this must be done a minimum of 6 months in advance of the Practicum start date to e nsure that a working agreement can be established. Practicums can be d one in other countries as long as an acceptable agreement can be established beforehand. What are the hardware and software requirements for off -campus students? The ability of a student to succ eed in a distanc e education cla ss depends on his or her ability to understand both the course structure and the associated technology. Inform ing students of what skills and technology are needed for distanc e education allows t hem the opportunity t o self-evaluate their capability to succeed in the course. At the time of admission to the program, students are required to ensure that their computers meet the minimum hardware and software re quirements described below. Reg istration for the c ourse constitutes the student's understanding and acceptance of the requirements nece ssary to participate in the course.

After successful completion of 76 semester hours, interviews, a nd the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT), students are admitted to a fou r-year professional program. The Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, one of six academic departments of the College of Health Professions, subscribes to the missions of the College and of N orth Dakota State University in the provision of Teaching, Research, and Service. T he Department provides instru ction in disciplines applicable to science. The faculty design and conduct research in the natural and biologic al sciences, as well as mentor graduate and Professional students in advanc ed concepts of pharmaceutical sc ience and in the process of scientific inquiry. NDSU offers both the MS and Ph.D. degrees in Pharmaceutical Sci ences. The graduate program emphasizes both research and teaching excellence. The doctor of philosophy degr ee is awarded in recognition of high scholarly achievement as evidenced by a per iod of successful study, the s atisfactory completion of examinations and the development of an acceptable dissertation project covering some significant aspect of a major field of learning and research. After successful completion of a Ph.D. degree program , students have had a high level of success gaining highly desirable employment i n academia, industry and governmen tal agencies. The dual program (Pharm.D./Ph.D.) is designed to provide an opp ortunity for outstanding pr ofessional students in the Pharmacy Program at North Dakota State University obtain re search experience and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. It is proposed that this can be accomplished with an additional three years of study and research placed between the second and the third years of the four-year professional pr ogram. It is believed that the combinat ion of the Pharm.D. and Ph.D. d egrees will greatly enhance the student's research background, critical thinking skills, and marketability for lea dership positions within t he profession of Pharmacy in academic, government, and industrial environments. Summer Research Experience During the summer between the P1 and P2 years, up to six studen ts per year will be allowed into an introductory research experience phase of the Pharm.D./Ph.D. program and wil l spend twelve weeks rotating throughout these three research laboratories. A summer stipend will be provided for each participating student in return for a 20 hour/week commitment (These funds are to be obtained from the C ollege's differential tuition funds). Admission Students in the Doctor of Pharmacy program will make an applica tion to the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences by December 20h at the end of the fall term of their second year (P2) in the p rogram for acceptance into the Pharm.D./Ph.D. program. T hey should have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or above. At the same time, an application to the graduate school should also be made. The GRE should als o be taken by the end of this semester. Pharm.D./Ph.D. applications will be considered by the Departmen t as for all graduate students. Course requirements during the professional program The Pharm.D. curriculum is unchanged. In the fall semester of the P1 year, a faculty member(s) will make the students aware of the Pharm.D./P h.D. option, and briefly outlin e the program. 76 The Ph.D. Graduate Dissertat ion Years (i.e. G1, G2, G3) Students will receive a monthly stipend, and tuition waiver dur ing Ph.D. graduate year 1 (G1), year 2 (G2) and year 3 (G3). For this time period the students are full-time gradua te students in the Department, subject to the same expectations (e.g. seminar participation, 6 credits of PSCI 790 , year-round study, etc.). D uring the three graduate years, the students will be required to complete STAT 725 (3 c r), BIOC 701 (4 cr) and BIOC 702 (4 cr). In addition, if interested, students may take other 700-level courses availa ble in the department and university. Thus by the end of G3, the students will have a mi nimum of (12 cr) 600-level an d (up to 21 cr) 700-level didactic credits. At the end of three graduate years, students would be able to write disser tation and pass the final thesis examination. In addition to didactic credits, students will take 1 credit Semin ar (PSCI 790) in the fall and the Spring semesters of each of the three graduate years. Students will also be require d to take 60 thesis research credits (PSCI 799) during three graduate years. NOTE: Professional pharmacy students who are enrolled as a full or part time student at NDSU, and who are pursuing a joint degree with the Doctor of Pharmacy program , must complete all required pharmacy training as required by the Doctor of Pharmacy program (includi ng, but not limited to, training on HIPAA & Privacy, HIPAA & Security, Blood-borne Pathogens, Preventing Me dicare Fraud, Waste and Abuse, and Combating Methamphetamine Abuse) regardless of whether they are completing pharmacy academic or experiential credits in a given semester. These trainings are r equired until such time as the student graduates with a Doctor of Pharm acy degree or officially dis-en rolls in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. The Clinical Years (P3 & P4) For the final two years of the professional program, dual degre e students will receive a waiver of NDSU base tuition and pharmacy differential tuiti on. No changes in the didactic coursework of the P3 y ear are proposed. Program requirements for the participants Once accepted into the dual degree program (i.e. the G1 year an d beyond), the student is considered to be a full- time graduate student in the Department of Pharmaceutical Scien ces. They must maintain a GPA of 3.0 or above. Ph.D. Summary: 12 credits of 600 and at least 18 out of 21 suggested credits o f 700=30 didactic credits, with 6 credits seminar and 60 credits dissertation gives a total of 96 graduate credits. Up to 12 credits of 600 level courses can be used for the Pharm.D. P3 and P4 years will remain as it is in the traditional Pharm.D . program. Suggested Course Schedule for Pharm. D. /Ph.D. Students P-1 Year: It would remain the same. In summer, students are required to do a research rotation in three laboratories. Please contact the Department of Pharmaceutical S ciences (231-7661) for details. P-2 Year: It would remain G-1 Year: BIOC 701 (4 cr), BIOC 702 (4 cr), 725 (3 cr), PSCI 790 ( 2 cr), PSCI 799 (15 cr), PSCI cr), PSCI 670 (3 cr) G-2 Year: PSCI 790 (2 cr), PSCI 799 (25 cr), and at least any two of th e following 3 credit courses: PSCI 612/613/614/615 G-3 Year: PSCI cr) P-3 and P-4 Years: Unchanged Students interested in pursuing this option need to see Dr. Sin gh, the Chairman of Pharmaceutical Sciences, to begin the process. His office i s located in Sudro Hall 136. 77 PHARMACY STUDENT ACTIVITIES & ORGANIZATIONS The American Pharmaceutical Association-Academy of Students of Pharmacy (APhA-ASP) The mission of the American Pharmacist Association Academy of S tudent Pharmacist (APhA-ASP) is to be the collective voice of student phar macists, to provide opportuniti es for professional growth, to improve patient care, and to envision and advance the future of pharmacy.

Kappa Psi Kappa Psi is a professional, co-ed fraternity whose main purpos e is to unite its members and to help them become better professionals. We try to achieve this by being actively involved in community affairs, university affairs, and the College of Health Professions. Throughout our history, the Beta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Psi has maintained a stout brotherhood founded on industry, sobriety, fellowship, and high ideals. Our chapter ha s been involved in many community service events including volunteering for Bet hany Homes, the New Life Center, the American Diabetes Association, t he Ronald McDonald house, the A rthritis Foundation, Dor othy Day Food Pantry. We also provide a monthly meal a long with a blood pressure scre ening at low income hous ing in West Fargo. We consistently earn the highest cum ulative all-Greek GPA. We spo nsor an annual Homecoming pig roast, a faculty appreciation dinner, a Spring Formal, and other social activiti es. We are also active on the local, regional, and national levels of Kappa Psi. Kappa Psi was founded in May 1879 at the Russell Military Acade my in New Haven, Connec ticut. Initially, it was a medical pharmaceutical fraternity and continued as such until 1 924. At that time, by mutual agreement, the members of both professions decided to separate into two distin ct groups. The medical group became Theta Kappa Psi and the Pharmacy group became Kappa Psi. Our chapter was f ounded April 25, 1924 and was one of the 27 founding chapters of Kappa Psi Pharmaceutical Fraternity. Our chapter became co-ed in 1998. We continue to thrive on the North Dakota State campus as a source of brotherh ood for pharmacy students.

Native American Professional Program (NAPP) To address the critical shortage of Native American pharmacists in the United States, the College initiated NAPP (then known as the Native American Pharmacy Program) in Septemb er 1987. The program was designed to recruit and facilitate the entry of Native American students into the C ollege and provide them with counseling and retention services to increase their c hances for academic success. In 2009, NAPP members transformed t he program into a student or ganization and made it inclusive of all the majors within the College, thus changing the name from Native American Pharmacy Program to Native American Professional Programs. NAPP meets monthly to discuss a variety of topics related to th e knowledge and skills needed to pursue degrees offered by the College of Health Professions at NDSU. Counselin g and tutorial services for students, financial aid and scholarship information, and internship and future career o pportunities also are presented. The NDSU National Community Phar macists Association Student Cha pter (NCPA) NCPA is a national organization representing independent commun ity pharmacy practice. In 1987, the national office began a student outreach program that has founded studen t chapters in 41 colleges of pharmacy across the nation. The mission of the NCPA st udent outreach program is to foster entrepreneurial sp irit in pharmacy students and introduce them to opportunities in independent pharmacy pra ctice and ownership. 79 Established at NDSU in April 2000, the NCPA Student Chapter pro vides a forum for students to learn about the many career options available in independent community practice . The objectives of the chapter are to promote the profession of pharmacy and the role of independent pharmacy in the health care system, and to maintain and expand educational programs and st rengthen student members' pro fessional, business, and leadership abilities. Goals of the chapter are to sponsor pharmacists involved in an innovative practice to speak at meetings, start a management/ownership workshop for students interested in owning their own pharmacy, participate in service activities to the community, and to send students to the NCPA A nnual Convention in October of each year. Benefits of membership in the student chapter include a variety of scholarships, low interest student loans, and a student publication called The New Independent in addition to the national journal America's Pharmacist. Students also receive free registration to NCPA's national convention an d opportunities to do a rotation or summer internship at NCPA headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. Membership is op en to all NDSU students enrolled and in good standing with the University.

Each year we hold a clinical skills compet ition in the fall semester, with the local winning team representing NDSU at the American Society of Health-System Phar macists (ASHP) Midyear Clinical Meeting. NDSHP-NDSU members are also involved with several com munity service activities throughout the year. Our organization is a member of the Student Societies of Health -System Pharmacy (SSHP) in coordination with ASHP and NDSHP. Membership is open to all pre-pharmacy and phar macy students at NDSU with an interest in health-systems pharmacy. Phi Lambda Sigma (PLS) In February 1991, Phi Lambda Sigma was initiated at NDSU. The purpose of Phi Lambda Sigma, the National Pharmacy Leadership Society, is to promote the development of l eadership qualities in pharmacy, especially among young pharmacy students. By peer recognition the Society encou rages participation in all pharmacy activities. Membership crosses fraternal and organizational lines, thus, th e Society does not compete with any other organization. The Society describes a leader as a \"do-er\" in pharmacy, one wh o gets the job done. It avoids the stigma of being called an \"officers club\" by recognizing the performance, not t he office. 80 Membership in Phi Lambda Sigma consists of four categories: stu dents, faculty, alumni, and honorary. For a student to be eligible for member ship, he or she shall be of hi gh moral and ethical character, shall have completed at least 135 quarter hours or 90 semester hours of scholastic w ork applicable toward the pharmacy degree, and shall have a grade point average of 2.5 on a 4.0 grading system . Prospective members are considered for membership by submitting an application during the spring semes ter.

APPENDIX 17BNorth Dakota State University Policy Manual _____________________________________________________________________ SECTION 326 ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT SOURCE: NDSU President NDSU Faculty Senate 1.PHILOSOPHY AND PURPOSE 1.1 North Dakota State University is committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity of its endeavors in the pursuit of academic activities including research, instruction, and service. The University will promote an open and honest atmosphere in reviewing and reporting possible academic misconduct. 1.2 Scholarly inquiry creates the expectation for strict integrity in its pursuit. Integrity is defined as a commitment to intellectual honesty, and personal responsibility. As a public institution engag ed in research, NDSU has an obligation to ensure public trust and confidence in our academic programs and publications. NDSU is committed to creating an environment which promotes responsible conduct that embraces attitudes of excellence, trust, and lawfulness in all our endeavors. It is essential to create this environment in order to maintain academic integrity, which in turn will promote academic excellence leading to reliable and accurate research results.1 Because misconduct in scholarly inquiry, inclu ding the improper expenditure of funds, threatens the confidence in the academic endeavor, it is the responsibility of the University to foster an academic environment that discourages misconduct in all endeavors of scholarly activity and to develop policies and procedures to deal forthrightly with possible misconduct associated with scholarly activity . 1.3 These policies and procedures deal with academic misconduct and define a process to report, review, investigate, and resolve, allegations of academic misconduct. They are directed toward governing behaviors to maintain integrity in the pursuit of scholarly, academic activities, and they are consistent with the principle of self-regulation in maintaining integrity in scholarly inquiry.2 2.APPLICABILITY 2.1 These policies are applicable to all persons employed at NDSU and associated with NDSU through academic activities. These would include, but are not limited to faculty, adjunct faculty, research professors, lecturers, collaborators, staff, technici ans, post -doctoral fellows, graduate, and undergraduate students, and volunteer assistants. However, allegations against graduate and APPENDIX 15Eundergraduate students which are course related will be handled under NDSU Policy 335: Code of Academic Responsibility and Conduct. 2.2 While this policy deals with internal allegations, any NDSU employee wanting to charge misconduct against an individual(s) outside the University must have discussed the allegations with the Department Chair, Dean , and Provost before proceeding with such allegations. 3. DEFINITIONS 3.1 Academic or scientific misconduct shall mean fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, misrepresentation of sources, breach of confidentiality, or other practices, including fiscal impropriety, that seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the discipline for proposing, for conducting, or reporting research; or material failure to comply with a sponsor's requirements that uniquely relate to the conduct of the research. It does not include honest error, or honest differences in interpretations or judgments of data. 3.2 Allegations shall mean any written or oral accusation by any University official or other Complainant, from inside or outside of NDSU, of possible misconduct that is forwarded to the Office of the Provost. 3.3 Complainant means any person who makes a f ormal allegation of research or scholarly misconduct under this Policy. 3.4 Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them. 3.5 Falsification is manipulation of research materials, equipment, processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record. 3.6 Inquiry shall mean informal information gathering and initial fact -finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of misconduct warrants an investigation. 3.7 Investigation shall mean the formal examination and evaluation of all relevant facts to determine if misconduct has occurred. 3.8 Plagiarism shall mean taking over ideas, methods, or written words of another without acknowledgment of and with the intention that they be credited as the work of the deceiver. Different academic disciplines may have their own separate definition which may add additional elements that need to be taken into consideration in an allegation of plagiarism. 3.9 Respondent shall refer to the accused or the person against whom an allegation of research misconduct is directed or who is the subject of a research misconduct proceeding. 3.10 Scholarly inquiry , creative activity , and research shall be considered synonymous terms. 4. PRINCIPLES 4.1 Due to the wide variety of endeavors of scholarly activity, no one set of guidelines can cover all situations. Also, because of the seriousness of the nature of this subject, several basic principles must be used to guide the processes. 4.2 Allegation(s) must receive immediate, appropriate, thoroug h, and impartial consideration. 4.3 The Complainant who in good faith reports apparent academic misconduct shall be protected from recrimination. Good faith allegations are those that are made with the honest belief in the truth of the allegation based on the information the Complainant had reasonable access to at the time of the allegation. 4.4 The Respondent, Complainant, witnesses, and committee members must be afforded confidential treatment during the entire process to the extent reasonably possible. Disclosure of the charges and evid ence under this policy will be made only as specified in the regulations of the sponsoring agency or as required by the North Dakota Open Records Act. Any violation of this rule is also considered a matter for disciplinary action. Further, the Respondent must be afforded confidential treatment to the extent reasonably possible while being given an opportunity to respond to the allegations and provide a defense during the Inquiry or Investigation phases. A confidentiality agreement can be required. 4.5 From receipt of the initial allegation to the completion of the investigation, every effort will be made to obtain and secure evidence that will be directly applicable to the case. All evidence must be carefully weighed to determine whether an allegation has been made in good faith or malice. 4.6 In order to determine misconduct, NDSU must find (1) that there was a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant academic or professional community; (2) it was committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly; and (3) the allegation must be proven by a preponderance (greater than 50%) of the evidence. 4.7 If allegations of apparent academic misconduct are shown to be unfounded and have been made with the malicious intent of destroying a career and reputation, the evidence of this fabrication is to be presented to the Provost for appropriate examination and possible disciplinary action. 4.7.1 Malicious allegations to harm or harass other individuals will not be tolerated by the University, nor will retaliation against the Respondent, Complainant, witnesses, or inquiry or investigative committee members. Further actions against Complainants who have acted in bad faith may be taken under NDSU policies that apply to employment and termination procedures. Actions that may be taken by NDSU could include, but are not limited to, termination of employment or expulsion. 4.8 Any University action imposing sanctions must comply with the procedural requirements of the applicable personnel or student policies (see Policies 220, 335, 350.3, or 601 ). 4.9 Challenges against a member of the Academic Integrity Committee for a conflict of interest shall be handled by the committee first and then, if the matter is not resolved, by the Pres ident of the Faculty Senate. 5. ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT PROCEDURES In dealing with academic misconduct allegations, NDSU will follow a three phase process: (1) Phase I - receipt of the allegation; (2) Phase II - an immediate inquiry of the allegation; and (3) Phase III - if warranted, an investigation of the allegation wh ich may lead, where applicable, to recommendations for appropriate sanctions and reporting. Actual sanctions and appeals will be considered separately and will be handled through other administrative processes. 6. PHASE I: RECEIPT OF ALLEGATION 6.1 Initially, the Complainant should report the allegation and provide evidence to the university official who is the immediate supervisor of the Respondent. The person receiving the allegation is hereafter referred to as the receiver of the allegation. 6.1.1 Any National or Federal agency involved could also be notified. Most agencies will not investigate initially and will allow NDSU to proceed as the primary investigating body. The funding agency will review the submitted reports to determine if further actions need to be taken. Federal agencies expect each institution to handle these proceedings and will only take charge if there is an immediate need to handle the case themselves. 6.2 Upon receipt of an allegation, the receiver of the allegation must immed iately inform the Provost (or specified designee) formally, in writing of the nature of the allegation. The Provost will inform the President. 6.3 Allegations of academic misconduct by a Complainant (other than the University acting through its administration) must normally be received within six years from the time when alleged academic misconduct occurred. Other exceptions include: (1) the Responde nt continues or renews any incident of alleged research misconduct that occurred outside the six-year limit through the citation, republication or other use for the potential benefit of the Respondent of the research record that is the subject of the alleg ation; (2) NDSU, following consultation with appropriate agencies, determines that the alleged misconduct, if it occurred, would possibly have a substantial adverse effect on the health or safety of the public; or (3) there is an allegation of fraud which prevented the discovery of the alleged misconduct. Allegations older than six years will normally not be accepted. 7. PHASE II: INQUIRY 7.1 Upon receipt of an allegation, the Provost will prepare a statement of allegation which identifies the Complainant, and notifies the Respondent, the appropriate department chair(s), and academic dean(s) of the allegation with available evidence. 7.2 The Respondent and Complainant will be offered initial consultation at the time of the receipt of the allegation to assist all parties in understanding the extent of this policy and procedures, and the potential and real consequences. They shall be provided copies or informed of the location of relevant policies and/or rules. 7.3 The Provost shall appoint an inquiry committee of three persons consisting of non-administrative, tenured faculty with the rank of professor (emeritus and emerita professors are elig ible). Members of the committee may be external to the University and non -faculty members may be appointed if a specific case warrants their inclusion to review the allegation(s). 7.3.1 The inquiry committee will determine if there is sufficient basis to conduct an investigation based on whether (1) the allegation falls within the definition of academic misconduct as defined above; (2) the allegation is sufficiently credible; and (3) the allegation is specific enough so that potential evidence of academic misconduct may be identified. \"Sufficient basis\" means that there is enough evidence that could be adequate to establish a violation if proven. 7.3.2 Interviews must be conducted, where possible, with both the Respondent and the Complainant and any othe r persons who may have information relevant to the allegation and purpose of inquiry. The Complainant and the Respondent must comply with appropriate requests by the inquiry committee for documen ts and other relevant evidence. 7.3.3 The committee may seek an opinion by a recognized authority in the Respondent's field. 7.3.4 Upon completion of the inquiry, the committee will prepare a report which shall include: (1) the name and position of the Respondent(s); (2) a description of the allegation of misconduct; (3) list of persons interviewed; (4) a summary of the evidence; (5) the conclusions of the inquiry; (6) a rationale for the recommendation that the alleged misconduct did or did not warrant an investigation; (7) any comments by the Complainant and Respondent; and (8) identification of relevant grants or other funding involved. 7.4 The Complainant and Respondent shall be given a complete copy of the report. Each will be given 10 working days to respond to the report and their comments will become part of the record. 7.5 The inquiry report will be completed and submitted to the Office of the Provost within 60 calendar days from the receipt of the initial allegation, unless circumstances which can be documented indicate reasons for exceeding this 60 da y period. 7.6 If the Provost determines that there is no basis to conduct an investigation, a copy of the inquiry report shall be maintained for a period of seven years in the Office of the Provost. This is to permit a later, independent assessment of the reasons for de termining that an investigation was not warranted should this be requested by an appropriate agency. 7.7 Seven years after the completion of the inquiry, all documentation shall be destroyed. 7.8 If, at any time, the documentation is requested by any party, the Respondent shall be notified. 7.9 All work of those involved should, to the extent possible, remain confidential. Breaches of confidentiality may be subject to appropriate sanctions. 7.10 The Complainant can appeal a decision not to conduct an inquiry to the Committee on Academic Integrity within five (5) working days of receiving notice that an inquiry is not warranted. 8. PHASE III: INVESTIGATION 8.1 If the Provost determines that t he findings from the inquiry provide sufficient basis for conducting an investigation, the investigation must be initiated within a thirty (calendar) day period after written notification to the Respondent that there will be an investigation. On or before the initiation of the investigation, NDSU will notify all applicable agencies as required by regulations. 8.2 The inve stigation will be conducted by the standing committee of the Faculty Senate, the Committee on Academic Integrity (https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/facultysenate/docs/Bylaws.pdf ). 8.3 The Provost Affairs shall forward the inquiry report to the Committee on Academic Integrity (Investigation Commit tee) which shall investigate the allegations in substantial compliance with all Federal Regulations. 8.4 The Investigation Committee shall comply with the following guidelines: 8.4.1 Respondent must be notified in writing that an investigation is being conducted, must be interviewed by the Investigation Committee, and has the right to call any witnesses or produce any evidence in defense. In addition, the Respondent has the right to have an attorney accompany him/her/them to the interview. If an attorne y for the Respondent is present, the Investigation Committee may request that the University provide lega l counsel to assist it as well. 8.4.2 The Investigation Committee may request, and must use diligent efforts to secure, any evidence considered necessary to conduct a complete investigation of the allegation. Whenever possible, interviews should be conducted of all individuals involved including the Respondent and the Complainant as well as other individuals who might have information regarding key aspects of the allegations. Because of the possible specialized nature of the evidence to be investigated, the Committee may seek advice from expert s within or from outside the University. Complete summaries of these interviews should be prepared and provided to the interviewed person(s) for comment and shall be included as part of the investigation file and furnished to the Respondent. 8.4.3 The In vestigation Committee will deliberate and reach its conclusions and write its final report in executive session. Further, the Investigation Committee must prepare and maintain all documentatio n to substantiate its findings. 8.4.4 The investigation by the Investigation Committee is to remain confidential unless disclosure is required by the North Dakota Open Records Act or by the sponsor's guidelines. 8.5 If it is determined that the allegations of misconduct are groundless, a report with supporting documentation shall be forwarded to the Office of the Provost to be retained appropriately for a period of seven years. 8.6 If the allegations are substantiated by a preponderance (greater than 50%) of the evidence, the Investigation Committee shall forward t he report to the Provost and the President with recommendations for appropriate di sciplinary action (sanctions). 8.7 The Respondent and Complainant shall be given a complete copy of the report. Each will be given ten (10) calendar days to respond to the report and their comments will become part of the record. 8.8 All persons and agencies involved in the investigation shall be notified of the conclusion. A copy of all documents shall be furnished to the Respondent and the Complainant. If the documents are requested by any party, the Respondent shall be notified. 8.9 In the case of a federal grant, a final report (in s ubstantial compliance with all Federal regulations) prepared by the Provost describing policies and procedures under which the investigation was conducted, the nature of the allegations, how information was obtained, all persons interviewed with text or summary of interviews, the findings, the basis for the final decision, and a description of disciplinary action taken by the institution, must be sent to the appropriate agency.3 8.10 It shall be the responsibility of the Provost to communicate the results of the investigation to collaborators, journals, publishers, professional societies, licensing agencies, and sponsoring agencies with whom the accused has had professional contact as appropriate. 8.11 The investigation should ordinarily be completed wit hin 120 calendar days of its initiation. If it cannot be completed within that time, then a request to the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) (or other applicable agency(ies)), will be made by the Provost to extend the time, and documentation for the reaso ns for exceeding this period must be made available in the report. 9. SPECIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 9.1 Normally, the inquiry or investigation will be conducted in such a manner as to protect the privacy/confidentiality of all involved. 9.2 However, if at any stage of the inquiry or investigation, any of the following conditions exist, there must be immediate notification to the sponsoring agency or other affected parties: 9.2.1 There is an immediate health safety risk or immediate need to protect human or animal subjects; 9.2.2 Research activities should be suspended; 9.2.3 There is an immediate need to protect agency funds, equipment, or the integrity of the research process; 9.2.4 There is an immediate need to protect the interests of the person(s) making the allegation or the individuals who are subject to the allegations as well as his/her co -investigators and associates; 9.2.5 It is probably that the alleged incident is going to be reported publicly; 9.2.6 There is reasonable indication of possible violation of civil or criminal law. In this instance, the institution must inform the appropriate sponsoring agency, if necessary, within 24 hours of obtaining that information; or 9.2.7 There is a reasonable belief that the research community or public should be informed. 10. SANCTIONS 10.1 NDSU administration may implement specific sanctions congruent with the misconduct. 10.2 Sanctions resulting from academic misconduct may include, but are not limited to, termination of employment or student status, termination of current research activity, special prior review of future research activities, written reprimand, probation for a specific period of time, and/or suspension of rights and responsibilities. 10.3 In cases of students, recommendations for sanction or disciplinary actions will be forwarded to the Associate Vice Provost for Student Affairs or the Graduate Dean to determi ne appropriate administration of any sanctions. 10.4 In deciding what final actions are appropriate when misconduct is found, NDSU officials should consider: 10.4.1 The seriousness of the misconduct; 10.4.2 The degree to which the misconduct was knowing, intentional, or reckless; 10.4.3 Whether the misconduct was an isolated event or part of a pattern of behavior; 10.4.4 Whether it had a significant impact on the research record, research subjects, other researchers, institutions, or the public we lfare; and 10.4.5 Other relevant circumstances. 11. APPEALS 11.1 Appeals of the Committee on Academic Integrity finding of misconduct will be handled through federal agencies of oversight where applicable or through NDSU's President's Office. 11.2 NDSU appeals must be made directly in writing to the President of NDSU within 30 days of the notice of determination by the Committee on Academic Integrity. 11.3 Review of the appeal is by the President. The President has the option to appoint a technical review committee for advice. 11.4 NDSU may suspend an internal appeal until further determination by the agencies. 11.5 NDSU appeals will be restricted to the evidence presented and will be limited to the University's failure to follow published proc edures or arbitrary or capricious decision making. 11.6 Upon review of the appeal, the determination made by the President of the University is final. 11.7 Grievances and appeals to sanctions and disciplinary actions will be handled accordingly to the applicable polices.

This trust is violated when students engage in academic misconduct, either inadvertently or deliberately. This policy serves as the guideline for cases in which cheating, plagiarism, or other academic misconduct have occurred in an instructional context (e.g., coursework, exams for degree requirements, practical experience, or fieldwork experience). Depending on the nature of the alleged offense, academic misconduct involving graduate or undergraduate research (e.g., thesis, dissertation, honors thesis), may be handled by either this policy or policy 326, ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT . This policy also serves as the guideline for cases in which there is eviden ce of student academic misconduct in more than one instance. Procedures established by an academic college (including the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies) may exceed the minimum standards outlined in this policy. Academic colleges with an approved and published honor commission (or similar mechanism) may employ alternative procedures; however, the standards of expected behavior shall not be less than those in this policy. In all cases, the procedures presented in this policy for tracking academic misconduct must still be followed; see Sections 5.c and 5.d of this policy. 1.Definitions. In this policy, an \"instructional staff member\" is defined as anyone who has primary responsibility for a course, or other instructional context to which thi s policy applies. Examples of instructional staff members include tenured and tenure-track faculty members, professors of practice, teaching assistants who have primary responsibility for a course, teaching fellows, instructors, and lecturers. In this pol icy, a \"student\" is defined as anyone enrolled in undergraduate, professional, or graduate coursework at NDSU. These students include individuals in a non -degree status, such as those taking NDSU courses through a collaborative, consortium, exchange, or ea rly admission program, or in a conditional admit status (e.g., Tri-College, NDUS Collaborative Registration, and Early Entry/dual credit program). 2.Examples of behavior constituting academic misconduct. Academic misconduct (intentional or otherwise) includ es but is not limited to the following: a)Plagiarizing, i.e., submitting work that is, in part or in whole, not entirely one's own, without attributing such portions to their correct sources; i. Cases of apparently unintentional plagiarism or source misuse must be handled on a case - by-case basis and in the context of the instructor's policies. Unintentional plagiarism may constitute academic misconduct. ii. Improper attribution of sources may be a sy mptom of bad writing and not plagiarism. Instructors are encouraged to recognize that citation skills are developed over time and are contextual.APPENDIX 17Db)Receiving, possessing, distributing or using any material or assistance not authorized by the instructional st aff member in the preparation of papers, reports, examinations or any class assignments to be submitted for credit as part of a course or to fulfill other academic requirements; c)Unauthorized collaborating on individual assignments or representing work from unauthorized collaboration as independent work; d)Having others take examinations or complete assignments (e.g., papers, reports, laboratory data, or products) for oneself; e)Stealing or otherwise improperly obtaining copies of an examination or assignm ent before or after its administration, and/or passing it onto other students; f)Unauthorized copying, in part or in whole, of exams or assignments kept by the instructional staff member, including those handed out in class for review purposes; g)Altering or correcting a paper, report, presentation, examination, or any class assignment, in part or in whole, without the instructional staff member's permission, and submitting it for re- evaluation or re-grading; h) Misrepresenting one's attendance or the attendance of others (e.g., by PRS or attendance sheet) in a course or practical experience where credit is given and/or a mandatory attendance policy is in effect; i)Fabricating or falsifying information in research, papers, or reports; j) Aiding or abetting academic misconduct, i.e., knowingly giving assistance not authorized by the instructional staff member to another in the preparation of papers, reports, presentations, examinations, or laboratory data and products; k)Unauthorized copying of another student's work (e.g., data, results in a lab report, or exam); l) Tampering with or destroying materials, (e.g., in order to impair another student's performance); m)Utilizing false or misleading information (e.g., illness or family emergency) to gain extension or exemption on an assignment or test. 3.The university culture of academic honesty. A primary responsibility of the students, instructional staff members, staff members and administrators is to create an atmosphere in which academic honesty, integrity, and f air play are the norm and academic misconduct is minimized. a)Instructional staff members are responsible for providing guidelines concerning academic misconduct at the beginning of each course in each class syllabus, and should use precautionary measures and security to discourage academic misconduct. b)Students are subject to disciplinary action even when not enrolled in the course where the academic misconduct occurred. 4.Fairness. Instructional staff members and administrators are responsible for procedural fairness to any student accused of academic misconduct. A n instructional staff member who suspects that academic misconduct has occurred in his/her class or other instructional context has an initialresponsibility to: a)inform the student involved of his/her suspicion and the suspicion's grounds; b)allow a fair opportunity for the student to respond; c)make a fair and reasonable judgment as to whether any academic misconduct occurred; and d)inform the student of the judgment, penalty (if any), and the student's right to appeal. See also Section 5.c of this polic y. 5.Penalties from instructional staff members for academic misconduct. Instructional staff members have the prerogative of determining the penalty for academic misconduct in their classes and other instructional contexts. a)Penalties may be varied with the gravity of the offense and the circumstances of the particular case. Penalties may include, but are not limited to, failure for a particular assignment, test, or course. b)If an instructional staff member imposes a penalty, the student may not drop the course in question without the permission of the instructional staff member. (The instructional staff member is responsible for notifying the Registrar to prevent the student from dropping the class.) c)If an instructional staff member imposes a penalty, the instructional staff member must complete the Student Academic Misconduct Tracking Form and submit copies to the student, the chair/head of the instructional staff member's primary department, or the program director if the student is enrolled in an interdisciplinary program. It is the chair/head or program director's responsibility to forward copies of the tracking form to the Dean of the college of the student's primary major, the Dean of the instructional staff member's primary college, the Registrar, and the Provost. In the case of graduate student academic misconduct, the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies also must receive a copy of the completed Student Academic Misconduct Tracking Form . d)Within three class days of receiving the Student Academic Misconduct Tracking Form , the information shall be entered into a FERPA compliant Student Academic Misconduct Database. e) In cases of particularly egregious academic misconduct, the Dean of the college of the student's primary major or the Dean of the college where the academic misconduct occurred may recommend suspension or expulsion as outlined in Sections 9 and 10 of this policy. 6.Penalties from instructional staff members for students not enrolled in course. If a student involved in a case of academic misconduct is not enrolled in the course in which the academic misconduct occurred, the instructional staff member teaching that course may recommend a penalty to the Dean of the instructional staff member's primary college. If the student is enrolled in a different college, the Dean will forward the recommendation to the Dean of the college of the student's primary major. a)The Dean of the college of the student's primary major may impose academic warning or probation in the college, according to established college policy.b)Alternatively, the Dean of the college of the student's primary major may recommend suspension or expulsion t o the Academic Standards Committee (http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/vpaa/POLICIES_FOR_NDSU_UNIVERSIY _ACADEMIC_STANDARDS_COMMITTEE-Rev _6_22_10.doc ), as outlined in Sections 9 and 10 of this policy. 7.Penalties for students with multiple instances of academic misconduct. If, when entering an instructional staff member's report into the Student Academic Misconduct Database, it is discovered that the student has a prior record of academic misconduct, the Registrar shall notify the Provost and Dean of the college of the student's primary major about the student's repeated academic misconduct. a)In case of repeat offenses, the Provost and/ or the Dean of the college of the student's primary major may recommend additional penalties up to and including dismissal, suspension or expulsion, as outlined in Sections 9 and 10 of this policy. b)In the case of graduate student academic misconduct, the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies also must be notified. 8.Non-graduate student appeals for penalties from instructional staff members. A student who has received a penalty from an instructional staff member for academic misconduct may appeal the penalty on one or more of the following bases: the penalty was too severe for the offense; the instructional staff member's decision was made in an arbitrary or capricious manner; the instructional staff member's decision was not substantiated by adequate evidence; or the student's rights were violated. a)If the student chooses to appeal the instructional staff member's penalty, the student must initiate the appeal process within fifteen class days after the beginning of the following semest er. For spring or summer courses, the appeal must be initiated within fifteen class days of the start of the fall semester. The student must appeal the penalty in writing. The appeal must be pursued in the following sequence: the instructional staff member, the chair/head of the instructional staff member's primary department, and the Dean of the instructional staff member's primary college. b)If the appeals outlined in Section 8.a. are not granted, the student may request a hearing by the Student Progress Committee in the college where the academic misconduct occurred to appeal the penalty. The student may request that two additional students be appointed to the Student Progress Committee for the hearing: one student shall be a member of the Student Court appointed to the Student Progress Committee by the Chief Justice of the Student Court, and the other student shall be a student senator for that college appointed to the Student Progress Committee by the Student Body President. i. The outcome of the appeal shall be communicated to the Registrar by the Student Progress Committee within three class days after the Student Progress Committee has made its final decision. The decision of the Student Progress Committee is final. ii. If the S tudent Progress Committee decides that no academic misconduct has occurred, then the Registrar shall delete all relevant information relating to the case from the Student Academic Misconduct Database. Otherwise, the Registrar shall enter the decision of the Student Progress Committee into the Student Academic Misconduct Database.9.Suspension or expulsion at the university level of non-graduate students. In cases of particularly egregious academic misconduct, a student may be suspended or expelled for academic misconduct in accordance with the following procedure: a)If the Dean of the college of the student's primary major or the Dean of the college where the academic misconduct occurred decides that suspension or expulsion is warranted, that Dean shall recommend suspension or expulsion to the Academic Standards Committee. At the same time, the Dean who recommends suspension or expulsion also shall notify the student of this action and inform the student of the hearing and response options described in Sections 9.b. and 9.c. of this policy. b)The student has five class days after receiving the Dean 's notification to request a hearing from the Student Progress Committee (or Honor Commission or similar body) in the college of the Dean who has recommended suspension or expulsion. i. Such hearings shall be held in accordance with college policy. ii. The Academic Standards Committee shall take no action on the case before a hearing is concluded. iii. The Student Progress Committee (or Honor Commission or similar body) shall forward its decision and appropriate hearing information to the student, th e Dean who recommended suspension or expulsion, the Dean of the college of the student's primary major, and the Academic Standards Committee. c)The student has five class days after receiving notification to respond to the Dean 's recommendation and/or the hearing outcome in a written statement submitted to the Academic Standards Committee. d) If the Academic Standards Committee decides that suspension or expulsion is warranted, the committee chair shall recommend suspension or expulsion to the Provost. At the same time, the committee chair also shall notify the student of its decision and inform the student that he/she has the right to respond to the recommendation, as described in Section 9.e. of this policy. e) The student has five class days after receiving the Academic Standards Committee's notification to respond to the committee's recommendation in a written statement to the Provost. f) If the Provost decides that suspension or expulsion is warranted, he/she shall impose suspension or expulsion. At the same time, the Provost shall notify the student of his/her decision and the terms of the decision, and inform the student that he/she has the right to appeal the penalty, as described in Section 9.g. of this policy. At the same time, the Provost also shall notify the Registrar and President of the university of the action and its terms. g)The student may file a written appeal of this penalty with the President of the University within thirty calendar days of receiving the notice of the decision. The President's decision normally will be made within thirty calendar days after receiving the appeal. The President's decision on the matter is final. h) The Office of the President shall notify the following parties of the results of the final decision on suspension or expulsion: the student, the chair/head of the student's primary major department, the Dean who recommended suspension or expulsion, the Dean of the college ofthe student's primary major, the Academic Standards Committee, the Provost, and the Registrar. 10. Procedures for cases involving graduate students. Accusations involving academic misconduct of graduate students will follow the procedure d escribed in Sections 4 -7 above, with the following exceptions. Appeals of penalties imposed by instructional staff member must be filed in accordance with the policy described in the NDSU Graduate Bulletin. Also, the Dean of the college of the student's pr imary major may recommend an additional penalty (including academic warning, academic probation, dismissal, suspension, or expulsion) to the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies . If the student is enrolled in a graduate interdisciplinary program or is a non -degree student, the associate Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies will review the case and make a recommendation to the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies. The imposition of penalties shall be in accordance with the policy described in the NDSU Graduate Bulletin. a) The Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies will provide the student with written notice of the following: i. additional disc iplinary action taken, if any; ii. description of the graduate student appeal process, as outlined in the NDSU Graduate Bulletin; iii. the date by which an appeal must be filed by the student, should the student choose to file an appeal. b) If an appeal is filed, the Dean of the College of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies will notify the student of the result following the completion of the appeal process. c) The following parties shall be notified if the student is suspended or expelled: the student, the chair/head of the student's primary major department, the Dean who recommended suspension or expulsion, the Dean of the college of the student's primary major, the Provost, and the Registrar. 11. Procedures for cases involving individuals who are not NDSU students. If a person who is not an NDSU student (according to the definition in Section 1 of this policy) is involved in academic misconduct, the instructional staff member shall send a written s tatement describing the academic misconduct to the Provost, Vice Provost for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management , Registrar, and Director of Admission for appropriate action. Appropriate action may include, but is not limited to, holds being placed on admission or readmission to the university, and notification being sent to the individual's home institution. 12. Rescission of degrees. A degree previously awarded may be rescinded if it is determined that the graduate's actions taken to obtain the degree involved academic misconduct. The degree conferring college reserves the right to recommend to the Provost the rescission of any wrongfully obtained degree(s). a) Written notice of the concerns and recommendation to rescind the graduate's degree(s) shall be sent via certified mail and email with return receipt to the graduate, with a hold placed on the student's record. The graduate will have 30 days after the notice was received to respond in writing or request a hearing with the conferring college's Stude nt Progress Committee for undergraduate degree holder or the Graduate Council for graduate level degree holders. A recommendation by the Committee or Council to the Provost whether to rescind the degree(s) shall be made within 30 days after a response is received or hearing is completed. b) A decision by the Provost shall be made within 30 calendar days after receiving the recommendation.

GRADE APPEALS BOARD PROCEDURES AND PREREQUISITES FOR APPEAL: 1. The Board may be utilized only after the student has exhausted all possible appeal routes within the college offering the course involved. Each individual college will be expected to specify such appeal routes, but the following guidelines should be adhered to as closely as possible and will apply in the absence of any specialized proced ures. The academic freedom of instructors is acknowledged in this policy and as such, the evidence for overturning a grade assigned by an instructor must be overwhelming and clearly demonstrate that the instructor used inappropriate or irrelevant factors in determining a course grade. Situations in which a student might consider an appeal i nclude but are not limited to the following: perceived violations of the grading policy, as stated in the course syllabus other violations of NDSU policy pertaining to student grading influence of i rrelevant factors such as race, sex, or personal animosit y erroneous grading (e.g. mathematical error) inequitable grading medical or other hardship that 1) could justif y either a course grade of \"incomplete\" or exemptions from specific grading components in the grade computation , and 2) was communicated with t he instructor in a timely manner when the issue(s) arose . Grade assigned as a result of Policy 335 : Code of Academic Responsibility and Conduct may not be appealed using this policy and its processes. a) A student who disputes a n assigned grade may initiate a request for a change of a grade with the instructor within fifteen (15) instructional days of the first day of the semester immediately following the semester in which the grade was awarded. For Spring Semester courses, the request must be made within fifteen (15) instructional days of the start of Fall Semester. An appeal is deemed formally initiated when the student presents the Grade Appeal Form to the instructor . The Grade Appeal should also include the following as supplementary material: the course syllabus including grading procedures the grade originally assigned and the requested grade change the justification for the proposed grade change based on the specific disputed criteri on (e.g. an assignment, project, or exam grade) and the grad ing system outlined in the course syllabus. The instructor must date and initial the form upon receipt . Within five (5) instructional days, the instructor shall inform the student, via NDSU email, of his/her decision, record the steps taken to resolve th e appeal and the decision on the Grade Appeal Form , date and sign the Form . If the appeal is approved, the form along with a memo and/or Grade Reporting Form indicating the new grade shall be returned to Registration and Records. If the appeal is denied by the instructor, the Form is returned to the student to proceed to the next level if desired . b) If there is an unsatisfactory decision at the instructor level , the student may present the appeal to the department chair/head within five (5) instructional days . The chair/head should return his/her decision on the appeal to the student . If the instructor is also the department chair/ head or dean, he or she need only be consulted in the capacity of instructor and the appeal may be continued at the college level . c) If an unsatisfactory decision is rendered at the department level, the student may proceed to the college dean within five (5) instructional days . d) At each stage, the individual considering the appeal shall inform the student and instructor of his/her decision within five (5) instructional days , record the steps taken to resolve the appeal and the decision on the Grade Appeal Form , and date and sign the Form. e) Both the instructor and the student shall have the right at any time during the proceedings to call a meeting of all persons involved in submitting and considering the appeal and, optionally, to invite the Board to send an observer to that meeting. f) In the event that the instructor is on leave from the University, the instructor may designate another faculty member from within the department to represent his/her interest in the grade appeal. If the instructor is no longer employed by North Dakota State University, or is not available to designate a substitute, the department chair/ head shall represent the absent faculty. If the department head cannot act impartially, a substitute shall be designated by the dean. 2. In the event of an unsatisfactory d ecision at the college level , the student may submit a formal written appeal to the Grade Appeals Board Chair. Such an appeal shall be made within fifteen (15) instructional days after conclusion of the college proceedings as stated above. 3. A college dean or a department chair/ head, with approval of the college dean, may change a grade without the instructor's approval i n extraordinary circumstances . Such circumstances include avoiding a clear injustice or mistake (e.g., a clear mathematical error, vi olation of policy, or instructor refusal to respond to inquiries about the grade ). In such cases, a note of record explaining the basis for the decision and the new grade shall be filed with the Registrar. An instructor can appeal such a grade change to th e Grade Appeals Board pursuant to this Policy. Colleges can adopt procedures to implement this subsection. 4. The Grade Appeals Board Chair will handle appeals that proceed to that level . 5. In case of student appeal to the Grade Appeals Board , the Chair will send a copy of the appeal document s to the instructor within ten (10) instructional days. The instructor will have fifteen (15) instructional days to respond directly to the Board Chair with any additional information regarding the student's appeal. 6. The Board Chair will then distribute copies of the appeal document and the instructor's response to all Board members and the instructor within five (5) instructional days. If a Board member is unable to participate in the proceedings, his or her alter nate will act for the member. 7. Each Board member (or alternate) must inform the Board Chair in writing within five (5) instructional days indicating whether there is a need to hold a meeting to discuss the appeal. If at least two -thirds of the members indicate that the student has not made a legitimate case for appeal , the appeal is denied and the student is notified, through NDSU email, within five (5) instructional days of the Board's decision. Otherwise, the Chair will schedule a meeti ng of the Board within ten (10) instructional days. 8. A quorum for the meeting will consist of at least 50% of the faculty members and at least 50% of the student members. At this meeting, the Board will raise any questions unanswered by the appeal an d instructor's response. The Board will then vote to decide whether to hold a hearing based on the evidence presented by the student and instructor . A hearing will be scheduled within fifteen (15) instructional days if a majority of members present vote to hold a hearing. If the appeal is denied, the Board Chair may provide a brief explanation for the decision. 9. If the Board decides to hear the appeal, it shall provide the instructor and student with a copy of any written statement provided to the Board by the other party. 10. If an appeal is made by the instructor of the course against the grade change instituted by the chair/head or the dean, the instructor will have recourse to the same procedures outlined for student appeal in 337.7.8.9. HEARING P ROCEDURES 1. General Provisions a) If the Board decides to hear an appeal, it shall designate from among its total membership a panel of seven members to hear the appeal. Four members of the panel shall be chosen by lot by the Board Chair from the facu lty membership of the Board, and two additional members of the panel shall by chosen by lot by the Board Chair from the student membership of the Board. The seventh member of the panel shall be the Board Chair, who shall serve as a non -voting moderator of the hearing panel. In order to avoid any conflict of interest, a board member who believes that he/she may not be able to hear a case fairly shall recuse him self/herself and shall be replaced by his/her alternate. Both the student and the instructor shall be informed of the members slated to serve at the hearing. T he student and the instructor shall each have one peremptory challenge to remove a board member from service on the hearing panel. A challenged board member shall be replaced by his/her alternate . In the event that a challenged board member is an alternate, another member of the board shall be chosen by lot to serve on the hearing panel. The word \"Board\" shall be used hereafter in these hearing procedures to describe the seven -member hearing panel so elected, or the full Board, in the event it decided to hear an appeal of a hearing panel decision. b) All hearings are normally open only to those people who are part of the proceedings, unless otherwise arranged by prior mutual written agreement bet ween the student, instructor, and Board Chair. Because the hearing involves non -directory academic record information, as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, it is not open to the public and the content may not be further disc losed with out explicit written consent of the student involved. c) The student, the instructor, and the Board, each shall have the right to be assisted during Board procedures by an advisor or other counsel who may observe the proceedings and advise his/h er party. Unless allowed by the Board Chair, the advisor/counsel will not be permitted to address the Board or witnesses. 2. Evidence. Because this is an educational hearing, formal rules of evidence do not apply. Every effort will be made to allow all r easonable and relevant information to be presented for the Board's consideration. a) The Board shall allow an initial presentation by the student and then by the instructor involved (or by the instructor and then by the student, in case of instructor appe al), after which it may call on such other witnesses as it deems necessary. In order to be able to accomplish this, the Board shall have the authority to compel the appearance or testimony of essential witnesses from the NDSU academic community. b) Hears ay evidence is permitted; the members of the Board may consider such evidence and assign it any weight appropriate by each individual Board member. c) An absolute right of cross -examination is not granted under this policy.

Remediation is a privilege and should only be offered to students with regular course attendance and participation. Remediation is defined as any change in grade based on the established grading criteria and process that applies to all students. Remediation will be tailored to the individual student and may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following in conjunction with academic advising: re-examination, additional course work, independent study, and campus tutoring. If remediation is offered, it is the responsibility of the instructor to ensure the student demonstrates competence in the course material. Prior to offering remediation, the course instructor must notify the Senior Asso ciate Dean with the student\u0092s name and pr oposed plan of remediation. The Senior Associate Dean will be responsible for tracking remediation opportunities offered to all professional students. Students will only be allowed to remediate one course per semester. If students do not successfully complete a professional pharmacy course (i.e. grade less than a C), and remediation is not offered, they may repeat the course. Withdrawal (for reasons other than extenuating conditions*) from a professional pharmacy course with a grade less than a C is considered the same as a failure. Failure to complete all Co-Curriculum semester requirements is considered a professional pharmacy course failure. Students are limited to a total number of three (3) course failures and/or course remediation. A fourth occurrence of receiving a grade less than a C (or withdrawal due to a grade less than a C) or course remediation in a professional pharmacy course, didactic or experiential, will result in termination from the pharmacy program. For example the established standard would result in dismissal from the professional pharmacy program if a student had the following results Remediation of 2 courses, failure of 1 course, and failure of 1 APPE. Compliance with the University Class Attendance Policy 333 is still required by instructors. Appeals to this policy may be submitted to the Pharmacy Academic Affairs and Student Progress Committee which may grant exceptions due to extenuating circumstances. *All extenuating circumstances must be approved by the Pharmacy Academic Affairs and Student Progress Committee before the withdrawal takes place. Approved: 9/21/2011, Policy 3.03 Right to Terminate Enrollment The College of Health Professionsreserves the right to terminate the enrollment of any student at any time, if the student demonstrates that he or she is unsuited for a professional career and its inherent responsibilities and obligations. Circumstances that may lead to student termination will include, but not be limited to, violation of state or federal statutes or regulations. Approved: 10/27/93 Housekeeping: 4/29/15 Source: Faculty Meeting Substance Misuse Testing Policy The NDSU College of Health Professions is committed to ensuring safe, healthy learning environments, including both didactic and experiential learning environments, for all of its students. The use of illicit drugs, as well as the overt misuse of alcohol and/or legally prescribed medications (including, but not limited to, mood altering medications) compromise learning environments and are prohibited under College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy and University Policy 155. It is beneficial for all College of Health Professions stakeholders (including its students, faculty, staff, clinical partners, and the patients and families we serve) to establish a testing policy process to ensure the safety and health of these learning environments, as well as to ensure an equitable due process for students who are alleged to partake in substance misuse. Bases for Testing The College of Health Professions reserves the right to require any student enrolled in one of its pre- professional or professional programs and/or enrolled in any course housed within the College to undergo testing for substance misuse. All testing is coordinated and monitored through the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Faculty Development (ADSAFD). All testing must be direct observation, 10 panel (or higher) tests, and must be conducted at a WADA-accredited or SAMHSA-certified laboratory. Per College Policy 3.12: Student File Contents, all test results shall be maintained in a secure location in the Office of the ADSAFD, and may be included in the Student's Personal File. The default method of analysis will be urinalysis, although the ADSAFD reserves the right to require alternative methods of analysis (for example, blood analysis or hair analysis) where appropriate. Alternative methods (if required) will be disclosed in writing when notifying the student about the need to be tested. Nonrandom Testing Nonrandom testing for substance misuse may occur as a requirement for entry into clinical sites (per site policies or program-specific experiential education policies), or to fulfill the requirements of sanctions imposed under College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Reasonable Suspicion Testing Incidents or events involving suspected substance misuse by students shall be reported to the ADSAFD using the Reasonable Suspicion Reporting Form. Reasonable suspicion shall be determined using objective evidence (photos, legal documents, or other documentation), reports made by credible sources (law enforcement, clinical site staff, NDSU faculty and staff, etc.), or a combination of these sources. Because it is a violation of University Policy 155 and College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy to misuse alcohol or prescription medications, or to use illicit drugs, and testing may exonerate the student of an alleged policy violation should the allegation be made falsely, the ADSAFD may exercise discretion in determining what evidence is of sufficient credibility to require testing. A descriptive summary of the evidence will be provided to the student at the time the student is informed of the need to submit to testing. Random Testing The College of Health Professions may implement a random substance misuse testing program. Should a random substance misuse testing program be implemented, the parameters of the program must be made freely available on the College of Health Profession's website, and students must be provided notice of the policy at least 6 months prior to its implementation. No more than 5 percent of the active College of Health APPENDIX 17IProfessions student body may be randomly selected for testing in any academic semester. No student will be randomly identified for testing more than once in a single academic year. The random selection of students will be implemented using a computer generated random number generating process, with interval (or other non-weighted) sampling. A summary of that selection process shall be provided to the Dean of the College of Health Professions on an annual basis. Testing Process Students who are required to undergo testing will be notified in writing via NDSU email. Upon receiving a request for testing, students are responsible for providing a 10 (or larger) panel, direct observation, drug screen from a reputable, appropriated licensed vendor within 12 business hours of the date and time of the request. The student identified for testing is solely responsible for obtaining his/her own appointment for testing, his/her transportation to the appointment, and payingthe costs of these tests.An original copy of the test results must be delivered tothe Office of the ADSAFDat the end of the 12 business hour window. Test results that show evidence of a diluted sample will not be accepted, and will not result in additional time in which to submit test results. Ramifications for Positive Test Results or Failure to Test in a Timely Manner Students whose test results are positive are subject to sanctions outlined in College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Once sanctions are assigned, a student's rights of due process are also outlined in College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. Students who fail to submit an original copy of their test results within the 12 business hour window face additional sanctions under College Policy 3.01: Student Conduct Policy. More specifically, students who fail to provide the required test results within the 12 business hour window will be sanctioned under the presumption that the test results for the substance misuse in question are positive. Testing Alternatives Students whose religious, cultural or other practices prohibit them from undergoing a specific type of drug test may request that the ADSAFD require an alternative test, so long as the alternative test is of equal or greater accuracy and precision than the original test required by the ADSAFD. All parameters identified previously apply to the alternative test. In the event that no such test exists, or in the event that students are unable to justify the need for an alternative test, students may be found in violation of College Policy 3.11: Student Technical Standards.
