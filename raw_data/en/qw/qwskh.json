It was public funding in various forms - research grants, direct funding, advance purchase orders, etc. - that drove these advances rather than the traditional intellectual property system. Despite this, firms exercised control over the vaccines and drugs in such a way that lower-income countries have not had access to them. Instead, they are forced to try to develop their own vaccines based on public knowledge, delaying access for years. Canada has had to pay billions for vaccines but still has no security of supply for when the next pandemic or health crisis hits.
