Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2022, Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background An unprecedented number of people around the world are experiencing forced displacement due to natural or man-made events. More than 50% of refugees worldwide are children or adolescents. In addition to the challenges of settling in a new country, many have witnessed or experienced traumatic events. Therefore, refugee children and adolescents are at risk of developing mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, and require appropriate and eective support within communities. Objectives To assess the eectiveness and acceptability of community-based interventions (RCTs only) in comparison with controls (no treatment, waiting list, alternative treatment) for preventing and treating mental health problems (major depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress) and improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries. Search methods Databases searches included the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (all available years), CENTRAL/CDSR (2021, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trials registries to 21 February 2021. We checked reference lists of included study reports. Selection criteria Studies of any design were eligible as long as they included child or adolescent refugees and evaluated a community-based mental health intervention in a high-income country. At a second stage, we selected randomised controlled trials. Data collection and analysis For randomised controlled trials, we extracted data relating to the study and participant characteristics, and outcome data relating to the results of the trial. For studies using other evaluation methods, we extracted data relating to the study and participant characteristics. W derived evidence on the eicacy and availability of interventions from the randomised controlled trials only. Data were synthesised narratively.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.1Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Main results We screened 5005 records and sought full-text manuscripts of 62 relevant records. Three randomised controlled trials were included in this review. Key concerns in the risk of bias assessments included a lack of clarity about the randomisation process, potential for bias is outcome measurement, and risk of bias in the selection of results. Primary outcomes There was no evidence of an eect of community-based interventions when compared with a waiting list for symptoms of post-traumatic stress (mean dierence (MD) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.78 to 3.86: 1 study; low-certainty evidence), symptoms of depression (MD 0.26, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.67: 1 study; low-certainty evidence), and psychological distress (MD 10.5, 95% CI 47.94 to 26.94; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). There were no data on adverse events. Secondary outcomes Three trials reported on short-term changes in child behaviour, using dierent measures, and found no evidence of an eect of the intervention versus a waiting list (low to very low certainty). None of the trials reported on quality of life or well-being, participation and functioning, or participant satisfaction. Authors' conclusions There is insuicient evidence to determine the eicacy and acceptability of community-based mental health interventions for refugee children and adolescents. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Mental health support in the community for refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries Refugee children and adolescents who have settled in high-income countries are at risk of mental health problems due to the many challenges they face before, during, and aN\u00dfXter migration. Key message The evidence to date is not of suicient quantity or quality to recommend what interventions should be implemented in practice. It is necessary for existing mental health support programmes and interventions for child refugees and asylum seekers to be evaluated so that they can add to the evidence on what works to support mental health in this population. What did we want to find out? We aimed to assess the evidence for mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment taking place in the community for refugee children and adolescents living in high-income countries. Some programmes or interventions may focus on mental health promotion (to improve mental health) through community-building and social support, while others may focus on the treatment of mental health problems with individualised specialist care. What did we do? We searched for studies in online databases and registries on 23 February 2021. Studies of any design were eligible as long as they included child or adolescent refugees aged 18 years or younger and evaluated a community-based mental health intervention in a high-income country. What did we find? We included 38 studies with a wide range of study designs, participant characteristics, and interventions. Three studies used a randomised controlled trial design where the treatments people received were decided at random; these usually give the most reliable evidence about treatment eects. We used these studies to assess the eectiveness of interventions and the acceptability as indicated by the occurrence of adverse events. What were the limitations of the evidence? There were important limitations relating to the quality of the included trials. There was no evidence on the acceptability of interventions. Data on eectiveness, relating to symptoms of mental health problems, psychological distress, and behaviour, showed no evidence of a dierence in eectiveness between the intervention group and the waiting list control group (where the intervention was not delivered until aN\u00dfXter participants in the intervention group had completed the treatment) for any of the three studies.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition An unprecedented number of people around the world are experiencing forced displacement due to natural or man-made events such as the Syrian conflict, which has contributed to the largest forced movement of people across the globe since World War II. By the end of 2017, there were more than 65 million forcibly displaced individuals, of whom 25.4 million were refugees (UNHCR 2017 ). The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees defines refugees as people who have a well-founded fear of persecution due to their religion, race, political beliefs, nationality, membership in a social group, or sexual identity, who cannot rely on their country of nationality to protect them ( UN General Assembly 1951 ). According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), children are among the most severely aected victims in populations forcibly uprooted by conflict, due to their vulnerability ( UNICEF 2016 ). Children and adolescents under 18 years of age constitute more than 50% of the refugee population ( USA for UNHCR 2018 ). The refugee experience is typically divided into two phases: pre- migratory and post-migratory. Pre-migratory experiences may include witnessing or experiencing violence, torture, murder, physical and emotional trauma, or a combination of these to the individual or family. It also includes the oN\u00dfXten long and hazardous journey to the resettlement or destination country, which may involve arduous travel, refugee camps, and detention centres. The post-migratory phase may present challenges such as linguistic and cultural barriers, poverty, discrimination, and adapting to a new and foreign environment. Factors relating to the pre-migratory phase \u2014 in particular witnessing violence and experiencing traumatic events \u2014 have been associated with mental health problems in children and adolescents, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ( Ellis 2008 ; Fazel 2012 ). Evidence suggests that mental health problems in refugee children and adolescents increase with the number of violent or traumatic events they have experienced in their country of origin ( Ellis 2008 ; Im 2018 ). In the post- migratory phase, risk factors and protective factors relating to stressors of arrival and settlement in the host country have been identified. These include individual-level factors relating to indicators of vulnerability (such as being of female gender or having a single parent ( Fazel 2012 )), as well as family and societal factors (such as level of financial and social support ( Fazel 2012 ), and discrimination ( Ellis 2008 ; Fazel 2012 )). Furthermore, children are impacted by mental health problems of the main caregivers, who may experience stresses related to trauma, migration, and resettlement ( Davidson 2004 ; Fazel 2012 ). A number of studies and reviews have shown a higher prevalence of mental health problems among refugee children and adolescents arriving in high-income resettlement countries, compared to the general population ( Barghadouch 2018 ; Close 2016 ; Fazel 2005 ; Jakobsen 2014 ; Steel 2009 ). Estimates of the prevalence of mental health problems in this population dier widely due to methodological dierences across studies as well as the diversity of experiences ( Bogic 2015 ). Studies of high-income countries showed PTSD prevalence rates ranging from 10% to 25%, while those of low-income countries showed prevalence rates as high as 75% (Fazel 2015 ). Moreover, one review of over 40 studies on refugeechildren in high-income countries suggested PTSD rates ranged from 40% to 63%, and depression rates from 25% to 50% ( Reavell 2017 ). The measurement of symptoms of depression and anxiety in more recent studies has made the extent of mental health suering among child and adolescent refugees more visible ( Ziaian 2012 ). Description of the intervention The World Health Organization (WHO) defines mental health as being \"a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community\" ( WHO 2018 ). Mental health literature has oN\u00dfXten adapted a binary model, in which people are either with or without a diagnosis of a mental health problem. Various authors have proposed that it is more helpful and accurate to consider mental health on a continuum ( Iasiello 2020 ). Symptom severity of diagnosed mental health problems varies between people and over time, and those without a diagnosis of a mental health problem may, at dierent times, find themselves on dierent points of a spectrum from enjoying excellent mental health to experiencing a lack of good mental health. We considered interventions for diagnosed mental health problems and for those who may experience symptoms of emotional suering (psychological distress) which can aect their day-to-day lives, such as sadness, fatigue, anger, irritability, restlessness, or delusions, as well as prevention for those who have no symptoms and interventions that promote positive mental health across all these groups among refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries. In this review we focused on community-based interventions, which may have taken place in schools, faith-based organisations, neighbourhoods, or other community settings. These interventions may have addressed experiences of traumatic events (pre- migration) or address factors relating to resettlement, such as learning a new language, sociocultural adjustment, and peer relationships, or both ( Vostanis 2016 ). While the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) guidelines on mental health and psychosocial support in emergency settings were originally written for low- and middle-income countries (where IASC agencies commonly work), the overall framework may also apply to high-income country settings. Therefore, we used the IASC pyramid approach to categorise the interventions ( IASC 2007 ). We examined interventions that addressed any one or more of the four pyramid layers, as follows (see also Types of interventions ). 1. Social considerations in basic services and security. 2. Community and family support. 3. Focused, non-specialised care. 4. Specialised services. 5. Multi-modal, multi-layered interventions. While all the pyramid layers are important and should ideally be implemented simultaneously, we included any interventions that addressed at least one of the pyramid layers. The lower layers (1, 2), which emphasise community foundations, may include interventions such as cultural and recreational activities and peer support (e.g. sports development, art/dance/ drama therapy, creative expression, psychosocial and educational support). They build communication, educational, and vocational skills for children and adolescents to support integration into Community-based interventions for improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.5Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews society, promote positive mental health, and in turn prevent mental health problems associated with acculturative stress. For example, the Global Refugee Sponsorship Initiative, launched in 2016, has helped several high-income countries around the world to introduce community-based sponsorship programmes, contributing to a rise in community groups directly engaging in refugee resettlement eorts ( refugeesponsorship.org/ ). The upper layers (3, 4), which emphasise professional care, may include non-specialised interventions such as psychological first- aid for assessing and addressing needs and concerns. Specialised interventions that may be used for the treatment of distress or diagnosed mental disorders include cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and other psychological therapies. These interventions are used in the treatment of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems. Last, interventions may have addressed more than one IASC pyramid layer and incorporated both preventive and treatment measures, which may have been delivered with the involvement of various community workers and professional mental health workers, in a combination of formats (community, group, individual) and settings (layer 5). How the intervention might work These various interventions are based on their dierent theoretical models describing specific prevention and treatment mechanisms/ processes. 1. Social considerations in basic services and security interventions aim to reach as many children as possible in a participatory, safe, and socially/culturally appropriate way. These interventions use local social supports and community mobilisation to advocate for the delivery of basic services (food, shelter, water, basic healthcare) in ways that promote mental health. Whichever form the interventions may take, they address societal and community-level determinants of health and a common theme is the promotion of participation by the community. 2. Community and family support interventions aim to help children cope with disruption in family and community structures/networks due to loss or separation. They may improve social functioning, facilitate social and language skills, and strengthen relationships with family/communities. These interventions target the family or community rather than the individual and involve building communication, educational, and vocational skills for children to support integration into society and in turn prevent mental health problems associated with acculturative stress and resettlement. 3. Focused, non-specialised care interventions aim to maintain or enhance mental health within general social and primary health services. For example, Mental Health First Aid training teaches community members to recognise people in need of help, provide initial support, and refer to specialist services ( Morgan 2018 ). An emerging method of psychological treatment is one that uses a common elements treatment approach, which incorporates treatments to address a range of mental disorders ( Fazel 2018a ). The mechanism of action of focused psychosocial support intervention might involve an improvement in general functioning which in turn contributes to decreasing psychological symptoms ( Purgato 2020 ). Many of these interventions take place in a school environment, with thegreatest evidence base for those that focus on verbal processing of previous traumatic events ( Tyrer 2014 ); for example, a classroom-based skills and psycho-education intervention that focuses on trauma and loss, and the traumatic stress and grief responses that they can give rise to. 4. Specialised services involve psychological therapies that can eect change via a number of mechanisms, including exposure or emotional processing (or both), cognitive processing or interpretation (or both), and meaning making. For example, CBT is an evidence-based approach (incorporating a range of techniques) used to change thoughts, feelings, and behaviours to improve mood and functioning. It has consistently ranked among the most eective interventions for traumatised refugee youth ( Cohen 2000 ). CBT for depression is based on the premise that one's mood is associated with patterns of thought and that CBT can help an individual to recognise counterproductive thought patterns and replace them with positive ones ( Beck 1979 ; WHO 2016 ). For anxiety, CBT helps address negative patterns that stem from the way one views the world and themselves ( James 2015 ). 5. Multi-modal, multi-tiered interventions may operate through a number of dierent mechanisms depending on the pyramid layers they address ( Description of the intervention ). An example of this is the multi-tiered Trauma-Systems Therapy for Refugees (TST-R), which extends beyond mental health problems and addresses other domains of well-being relevant to refugee children and adolescents, such as acculturative and resettlement stresses ( Abdi 2018 ). It utilises a socio-ecological approach, which involves addressing children's mental health needs within the context of the family and community (Bronfenbrenner 1979 ). The lower tiers emphasise promotion of positive mental health through community-building and social support, while the upper tiers focus on treatment of mental health problems with individualised specialist care. Why it is important to do this review In December 2018, the UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health was convened to promote evidence-based approaches for the health of the world's populations on the move ( Abubakar 2018 ). The Commission highlighted the unmet needs of refugees and urged for worldwide investments in health services for non-communicable diseases, including mental health ( Miliband 2018 ). It called for interventions that extend beyond the health sector to target the social and environmental determinants that aect mental health and well-being, particularly in childhood and adolescence ( Patel 2018 ). Given the influence of childhood experiences on the life course, the promotion of positive mental health and the treatment of mental health problems in childhood and adolescence can shape future health and well-being ( Kessler 2005 ). The purpose of this review was to examine and describe the current evidence base on the eectiveness of community-based interventions for improving the mental health of refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries. We are aware of systematic reviews of interventions for similar health outcomes, but in dierent populations. One Cochrane Review on a range of common mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries aected by humanitarian crises included 33 studies with 3523 participants who had been Community-based interventions for improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.6Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews exposed to a range of multifaceted stressors ( Purgato 2018 ). The study authors found low-quality evidence of a beneficial eect of psychological therapies in reducing PTSD, and depressive and anxiety symptoms in adults, and very low-quality evidence in children and adolescents. One Cochrane Review on the beneficial and adverse eects of psychological, social, and welfare interventions for torture survivors included nine studies with 507 participants ( Patel 2014 ). The studies provided very low- quality evidence for narrative expression therapy and CBT having medium-sized benefits in lowering distress and PTSD symptoms. Although informative, these reviews were not focused on child and adolescent refugees specifically. One Cochrane Review of primary-level worker interventions for adults and children in low- and middle-income countries found 95 trials, with promising results shown for a range of mental health outcomes ( van Ginneken 2021 ). The systematic review which most closely resembles our population and interventions of interest was conducted by Tyrer and colleagues ( Tyrer 2014 ). Searches performed up to January 2013 identified 21 studies for inclusion (1800 participants), including 14 studies from high-income countries. The review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies of school- and community-based interventions aimed at improving mental health in refugee and asylum-seeking children and adolescents up to 17 years of age. We found one review focused on refugee children and adolescents in high-income settings, but it lacked a systematic approach and included only preventive interventions ( Fazel 2018b ). Resettlement poses challenges for refugee children and adolescents and their families, which are distinct from stressors experienced in the home country or during the migration journey. Studies from high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries will therefore tend to include populations with dierent experiences impacting on mental health. This, and the variation between countries and world regions in terms of healthcare systems and resources available, means that dierent interventions will be more or less relevant and appropriate in dierent settings. It may also mean that the eicacy of interventions diers between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries. This Cochrane Review adds to the evidence base in several ways. First, it provides an up-to-date evidence synthesis. Second, we assessed the eicacy and acceptability of interventions, using RCTs only to facilitate the synthesis of results, by outcome, across studies. Third, our review focused on child and adolescent refugees resettled in high-income countries only. With increasingly complex population needs and tight budgets to address mental health of refugee children and adolescents, there is a need for robust evidence synthesis to inform commissioning of services. This review is likely to be of interest to researchers and policy-makers in high-income countries seeking to design, implement, and evaluate mental health and well-being interventions for child and adolescent refugees in high-income countries. O B J E C T I V E S To assess the eectiveness and acceptability of community- based interventions (RCTs only) in comparison with controls (notreatment, waiting list, alternative treatment) for preventing and treating mental health problems (major depression, anxiety, post- traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress) and improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries. We had initially planned to include a description of non- randomised studies in this Cochrane Review, which is reflected in our literature search strategy and selection criteria. However, given that the main objective was to assess the eectiveness of interventions, the focus on of non-randomised studies did not seem appropriate. See also Dierences between protocol and review section. M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies We included RCTs and cluster-RCTs. Cross-over RCTs were eligible for inclusion but we used only data from the first phase (i.e. before providing the intervention to the control group). Non-randomised studies were eligible for inclusion but no data on eectiveness and acceptability were extracted (see Dierences between protocol and review ). Types of participants Age We included children or adolescents aged 18 years or younger. If we identified studies that included children in an overlapping age range (e.g. participants aged between 15 and 21 years), we contacted the study authors to access individual participant data for children and adolescents that meet our criteria. If individual participant data were unavailable, we excluded that study. If 75% of included participants were children, we included the study. Sex We included participants of any sex or gender. Ethnicity We included participants of any ethnicity. Diagnosis We included studies with participants who were refugees or asylum seekers, with or without diagnosed mental health problems. Diagnosed mental health problems Studies evaluating treatment interventions may have included participants diagnosed with major depression, anxiety, PTSD, or other mental health problems. These were eligible for inclusion in this review. Symptoms of mental health problems Studies with participants with symptoms that did not meet the threshold for diagnosis of a mental health problem, for example, mild or subthreshold depression, were included. These participants may experience symptoms of psychological distress such as sadness, fatigue, anger, irritability, restlessness, or delusions, which Community-based interventions for improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Participants may have been selected on the basis of their refugee/asylum seeker status only or because they were thought to be vulnerable to mental health problems, for example, because of experience of trauma. These studies were eligible for inclusion in our review. Comorbidities We included studies that involved participants with any physical or psychiatric comorbidities. Setting We included interventions delivered in a community setting in high-income countries. According to McLeroy and colleagues, 'community-based' means the intervention was implemented in the participants' community ( McLeroy 2003 ). This includes community institutions such as neighbourhoods, schools, churches, work sites, homes, and voluntary agencies. Such settings provide opportunities to reach the target group using existing social structures with which community members engage. Interventions in the community that can be more easily accessed by refugee children and their families may help to overcome financial, language, or cultural barriers associated with accessing mainstream mental health services. We did not include any such interventions conducted in a clinical setting. We also excluded any parent-focused interventions. According to the UNHCR, there are currently 25 countries worldwide with resettlement programmes, the majority of which are high-income countries ( UNHCR 2011 ). High-income countries with non-UNHCR resettlement programmes were also considered. Based on gross national income per capita, the World Bank classifies countries into four income groups: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high. Types of interventions Recognising the importance of preventing and treating mental health problems in childhood and adolescence within the context of families and communities, we focussed on community-based interventions delivered to children and adolescents of refugee background in high-income countries. We used the IASC pyramid approach to categorise the interventions. Therefore, we included interventions that addressed any one or more of the four IASC pyramid layers: social considerations in basic services and security; community and family support; focused, non-specialised care; and specialised services. Experimental interventions 1. Social considerations in basic services and security. These consist of basic services and security that are delivered in ways that are participatory, safe, and culturally appropriate. They support methods of coping.2. Community and family support. These interventions consist of care and support provided by caregivers, community members, and friends for family and community resilience. 3. Focused, non-specialised care. These interventions consist of more focused support interventions to the individual, family, or group. They are used to maintain or enhance mental health and psychosocial well-being. 4. Specialised services. These consist of professional care for children experiencing significant distress or severe mental disorders, whose needs exceed primary health services. These interventions are used in the treatment of PTSD, anxiety and depressive disorders, and other conditions. An example is CBT . 5. Multi-modal, multi-layered. These consist of interventions that address more than one of the IASC pyramid layers. Comparator interventions 1. No treatment. 2. Psychological placebo/attention placebo control. This included any intervention or sham treatment which may have been regarded as active treatment by participants but was considered inactive by the researchers. 3. Waiting list. The intervention in the control group was not delivered until aN\u00dfXter participants in the intervention group had completed the treatment. 4. Treatment as usual/standard care (e.g. regular classes/school programme, tutoring). Types of outcome measures Studies that meet the above inclusion criteria were included regardless of whether they reported on the following outcomes. Primary outcomes 1. Eicacy of the intervention; continuous measures of symptom severity using validated scales for each of the following conditions: a. PTSD (e.g. the clinician-administered Children's PTSD Inventory (CPTSD-I) Saigh 2000 )); b. anxiety disorders (e.g. the self-reported State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) ( Spielberger 1973 )); c. depression (e.g. the self-reported Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) ( Kovacks 1989 )); d. Psychosocial Distress Screener (CPDS) ( Jordans 2008 Adverse events (intervention acceptability); counts of suicide, self-harm, or other adverse events. Secondary outcomes 1. Quality of life or well-being (e.g. the self-administered or parent/teacher-administered Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) ( Varni 2001 )). 2. Externalising and internalising behaviour problems (e.g. total scores of the parent-completed Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) ( Achenbach 1983 )). 3. Participation and functioning as measured by engagement in education, community activity (e.g. the clinician-rated Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) ( Shaer 1983 )). 4. Participant satisfaction with the intervention (any measure). Community-based interventions for improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.8Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We considered symptom severity, quality of life or well- being, behaviour problems, social skills, and participation and functioning to be outcomes relating to the eicacy of the intervention. We adopted the following definition of treatment acceptability: \"A multi-faceted construct that reflects the extent to which people delivering or receiving a healthcare intervention consider it to be appropriate, based on anticipated or experienced cognitive and emotional responses to the intervention\" ( satisfaction' measure two such facets of acceptability. Adverse events can be considered an extremely undesirable response to an intervention. Participant satisfaction reflects a person's experience with the intervention, with low satisfaction potentially leading to lower engagement with the intervention. Timing of outcome assessment We collected baseline and endpoint data, or change from baseline data, for each trial. To accommodate trials with varying lengths, we planned to categorise endpoint data as follows: short-term (up to six months), medium-term (seven to 12 months), long-term (more than 12 months). If multiple data points were reported within one of our categories, we extracted data for the latest data point within a category. Hierarchy of outcome measures For primary outcomes, if data from several commonly used rating scales were reported, we gave preference to a self-reported scale (i.e. completed by the participant) and extract these data for our synthesis. Search methods for identification of studies Electronic searches An information specialist with the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group searched the following databases, using relevant subject headings (controlled vocabularies) and search syntax, appropriate to each resource. Multiple searches were conducted for this review between August 2020 and February 2021. All search strategies are listed in Appendix 1 . 1.

Searching other resources Reference lists We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies missed from the original electronic searches (e.g. unpublished or in-press citations). Correspondence We contacted trialists and subject experts for information on unpublished or ongoing studies, and to request additional trial data. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies Two review authors (of FS, DC, LV, EU, HT , JH) independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion using Covidence soN\u00dfXtware. We retrieved the full-text study reports/publications and two review authors (FS, LV, EU, or DC) independently screened them, identified studies for inclusion, and identified and recorded reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. If the full text was not available, we requested a copy of the article from the authors. We resolved disagreement through discussion or, if required, we consulted a third review author (MP or CB). We identified and excluded duplicate records and collated multiple reports that related to the same study so that each study, rather than each report, was the unit of interest in the review. We recorded the selection process in suicient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram and Characteristics of excluded studies table. Data extraction and management We used a data collection form to extract study characteristics and outcome data. We pilot-tested the form on one study in the review. Two review authors (FS, LV, or EU) independently extracted the following study characteristics and outcome data from included studies. 1. General information: author(s), type of source (journal, book, thesis, other), name of the source, year of study, author contact details. 2. Methods: study design, total duration of study, number of study centres and location, study setting, withdrawals, and date of study. 3. Participants: number, mean age, age range, gender, country of origin, country of settlement, refugee status (refugee/asylum seeker), severity of condition, diagnostic criteria, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria, number of dropouts for any reason. 4. Interventions: intervention, comparison/control, components of the intervention, setting (e.g. one-to-one, group, classroom), location (e.g. community centre, school), number of sessions, duration of sessions, target of the intervention (mental health promotion, or prevention or treatment of diagnosed mental health problems), level of the intervention (basic services and security, community and family support, focused, non- specialist care, specialised services, multi-modal or multi- layered interventions).

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.9Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 5. Outcomes: outcomes, data at baseline and endpoint for all outcomes specified in the protocol ( Soltan 2020 ), time points of data collection measured from baseline, measurement tools used. 6. Notes: funding for study, and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors. We noted in the Characteristics of included studies table if outcome data were not reported in a usable way. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author (MP or CB). One review author (EU) transferred data into the Review Manager Web ( Review Manager Web 2020 ). We double-checked that data were entered correctly by comparing the data presented in the systematic review with the study reports. A second review author (FS) spot-checked study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report. Main planned comparisons 1. Community-based intervention versus no treatment. 2. Community-based intervention versus waiting list. 3. Community-based intervention versus treatment as usual. 4. Community-based intervention versus psychological placebo. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies To assess risk of bias in RCTs, we used Cochrane's RoB 2 tool ( Sterne 2019 ). Two review authors (of FS, LV, EU, DM, DC) independently assessed the risk of bias for the primary outcomes (eicacy of the treatment and adverse events) reported in the summary of findings table. We resolved any disagreements by discussion or by involving another review author (CB or MP). We were interested in assessing risk of bias for the eect of assignment to the intervention, rather than the eect of adherence to the intervention. We considered bias relating to the following domains. 1. Randomisation process. 2. Deviations from intended interventions. 3. Missing outcome data. 4. Outcome measurement. 5. Selection of the reported result. We reported answers to signalling questions for each domain, as well as the risk of bias judgement category. We used the free text box to present supporting information for each response. For each outcome, we reported an overall judgement about the risk of bias. A study judged at high risk of bias overall had at least one domain rated at high risk of bias, or some concerns for multiple domains which substantially lowered our confidence in the result. An overall judgement of low risk of bias was obtained if a study was at low risk of bias for all five domains for the outcome of interest. We conducted risk of bias assessments for cluster-RCTs and cross- over RCTs using the specific RoB 2 guidance available for these RCT designs. We created separate forms in MicrosoN\u00dfXt Word for parallel trials, cluster-RCTs, and cross-over RCTs to facilitate completion of the risk of bias assessments.We reported risk of bias assessment summaries for each outcome. Detailed reports are available from the review authors upon request. Measures of treatment eect Continuous outcomes Where trials used the same continuous outcome measure for comparison, we pooled data by calculating the mean dierence (MD). When trials used dierent measures to assess the same outcome, we pooled data with standardised mean dierence (SMD) and calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To facilitate the interpretation of results in terms of their clinical relevance, we considered whether eects were small (0.2 to less than 0.5), medium (0.5 to 0.8), or large (greater than 0.8) ( Cohen 1988 ). We also re-expressed SMDs in terms of units of a commonly used outcome measure according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019 ). The measure used depended on the outcome, for example, the CDI for symptoms of depression. An SMD of zero means that the intervention and control groups have equivalent treatment eects. We anticipated that, for most measures, a lower score would indicate greater improvement. For example, a lower score on depression symptom instruments indicates an improvement in symptoms. In these cases, an SMD less than zero indicates that the intervention has a greater eect than the control. An SMD greater than zero indicates that the intervention has a smaller eect than the control. Interpretation of the SMD is reversed in cases where a greater continuous score indicates greater improvement. If continuous outcomes were reported in a 'change from baseline' format rather than at endpoint, we combined 'change from baseline' data and endpoint data in one meta-analysis where possible using MDs. If multiple measures were used for the same outcome and it was therefore not possible to combine data in one meta-analysis, we imputed standard deviations (SDs) for 'change from baseline' data by calculating the correlation coeicient, as specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Sch\u00fcnemann 2017a ). However, we did not use these methods as no meta-analyses were conducted. Dichotomous outcomes We planned to analyse dichotomous outcomes by calculating a risk ratio (RR) for each comparison. In addition, we planned to calculate the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), with 95% CIs, for all dichotomous outcomes to facilitate interpretation; this is the expected number of people who need to receive the intervention rather than the comparator for one additional person to achieve a beneficial outcome ( Higgins 2019 ). If one trial used both continuous and dichotomous variables for the same outcome, we would have given preference to the continuous outcome. Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager Web ( Review Manager Web 2020 ). Unit of analysis issues Cluster-randomised controlled trials Some interventions were performed in school settings whereby randomisation took place in clusters (e.g. at a class or school level). Community-based interventions for improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.10Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We extracted data from cluster-RCTs as long as proper adjustment for the intracluster correlation had either been conducted by the trial author or the paper reported suicient data for an approximate adjustment, in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019 ). Eective sample sizes were calculated using a conservative intraclass correlation coeicient (ICC) of 0.2, based on estimates from two systematic reviews of school-based programmes for children and adolescents (Shackleton 2016 ; Walsh 2015 ). Cross-over trials For cross-over designs, we only used data collected up to the first cross-over point of the study to avoid carry-over eects. Studies with multiple treatment groups For studies comparing multiple relevant interventions with a single control group, we planned to split data from the control group to achieve pair-wise comparisons. If studies used multiple active control groups, we planned to combine data from these groups to allow comparison with the treatment group. If studies used multiple inactive control groups (treatment as usual, waiting list, no treatment, psychological placebo), we planned to combine the control groups to compare to the treatment groups. Dealing with missing data We contacted investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data where possible (e.g. when a study was identified as abstract only). We documented all correspondence with study authors and reported which study authors responded in the full review. If a study did not provide the summary data required for meta-analysis (e.g. SDs), we planned to derive them using calculations provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019 ). If it was not possible to calculate SDs, we did not use these data. The primary analysis was based on observed case data. If studies used imputation methods to calculate missing data, we reported this and considered the impact of imputation in the risk of bias assessment. Assessment of heterogeneity We planned to create forest plots, allowing readers to visually inspect the data. We would have formally tested statistical heterogeneity using the Chi 2 test, which provides evidence of variation in eect estimates beyond that of chance. Because the Chi 2 test has low power to assess heterogeneity when a small number of participants or trials are included, we conservatively set the P value at 0.1 ( Deeks 2017 ). We would also have quantified heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic, which calculates the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than to chance ( Higgins 2002 ). We used conventional criteria for interpreting I 2 values based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019 ): 0% to 40%: might not be important; 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.We would have explored heterogeneity indicated by an I 2 statistic of 50% and above, considering the magnitude and direction of treatment eects and the characteristics of any studies which represented outliers. The I 2 values would have been interpreted in conjunction with the CI for their result, the Chi 2 P values, and visual inspection of the forest plots. Assessment of reporting biases To minimise reporting bias, we conducted comprehensive searches, contacted study authors, and placed no restrictions on publication type or language. In the event that there were more than 10 included studies, we would have assessed the possibility of publication bias or small-study eects on primary outcomes by using funnel plots. Data synthesis We anticipated studies to represent a mix of study designs, populations, and interventions. For RCTs, we planned to combine data for relevant outcomes in a meta-analysis if we judged the data to be suiciently homogeneous for a meaningful interpretation of the results. If we could not meaningfully combine data, we planned to narratively describe results by outcome. We would have used random-eects models to account for the expected heterogeneity between studies. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Providing data were available, we planned to conduct the following subgroup analyses for the primary outcomes (RCTs only). 1. Intervention setting (e.g. school, neighbourhood, voluntary agency). The setting may have an impact on the outcomes, on trial retention, and on the delivery of the intervention. 2. Level of intervention ( IASC 2007 ). We planned to compare subgroups of basic services and security interventions, community and family support, focused non-specialised care, and specialist services. The individual-level eicacy and acceptability of interventions may dier depending on their target level. Sensitivity analysis Providing data had been available, we would have conduct sensitivity analyses for the primary outcomes including high- quality RCTs only. An overall judgement of low risk of bias according to RoB 2 assessments (i.e. low risk of bias for all domains) would be considered high-quality for the purpose of these analyses. Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence We used the GRADE approach to create a summary of findings table of the evidence from RCTs. We did this using GRADEpro soN\u00dfXtware to import data from Review Manager Web ( Review Manager Web 2020 ), including the outcomes listed below and sample sizes, eect estimates, and 95% CIs of the eect estimates. Summary of findings tables provide outcome-specific information concerning the overall quality of evidence from studies included in the comparison, the magnitude eect of the community-based interventions examined, and the sum of available data on the outcomes we included. As outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , we abided by the standard Community-based interventions for improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.11Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews methods for the preparation and presentation of results ( Higgins 2019 ). We planned to include four continuous outcomes of symptom severity (treatment eicacy) and one outcome for treatment acceptability in the summary of findings table, as follows. 1. PTSD. 2. Anxiety disorders. 3. Depression. 4. Psychological distress. 5. Adverse eects (e.g. self-harm, suicide). In the summary of findings table, we reported and assessed short-term data (up to six months' follow-up) only. We described the specific GRADE domains (e.g. risk of bias, indirectness,inconsistency, imprecision, publication bias) as well as the GRADE levels of evidence (high, moderate, low, very low).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Three of the 38 included studies were RCTs ( Baker 2006 ; Ooi 2016 ; Walg 2020 ). For these studies, we extracted outcome data in addition to information on the characteristics of the studies and participants. We performed risk of bias assessments for these RCTs. A description of non-randomised studies is available in Appendix 3 . We excluded 24 full-text articles. One report was of an RCT with a sample of refugees aged between 13 and 21 years ( Pfeier 2018 ). We requested data for children only, but these were not received in time and the study is awaiting classification. Five studies, with study protocols published between 2019 and 2021, are ongoing ( Durbeej 2021 ; Rosner 2020 ; 2019 ; Warner 2020 ). Durbeej 2021 is due to end in March 2022. Recruitment is ongoing for Rosner 2020 ; the end date is not yet known. It is not known when Sarkadi 2020 is due to end, but a feasibility study (randomised pilot trial) was conducted from April to June 2019. It is not known when Stiles 2019 is due to end. Warner 2020 completed the results in September 2021. These data will be included in the update of the review. Methodology Study design We included three RCTs with 83 participants ( Baker 2006 ; Ooi 2016 ; Walg 2020 ). were cluster-RCTs ( Ooi 2016 2020 and one a cross-over RCT ( Baker 2006 ). Geographical location The included studies were conducted in Australia ( Baker 2006 ; Ooi 2016 ), and Germany ( Walg 2020 ). Sponsorship One study reported funding and included a PhD fund and governmental support ( Ooi 2016 ). Participants Participants were teenagers, with two studies reporting a mean age between 12 and 14 years ( Baker 2006 ; Ooi 2016 ), and one study including participants aged 15 to 18 years ( Walg 2020 ). Two studies included a mix of males and females, and one study only included males ( Walg 2020 ). One study did not report participants' country of origin ( Baker 2006 ). The other two studies included participants from a range of countries. Participants in one study were predominantly from Afghanistan and Syria ( Walg 2020 ), and in the other study they predominantly originated from sub-Saharan Africa ( Ooi 2016 ). The study authors' location was the same as the participants' country of settlement for all three included studies. One study had refugee status as an inclusion criteria ( Baker 2006 ). The other two studies did not specify whether participants were refugees, asylum seekers, or a mix. Participants in one study were unaccompanied minors ( Walg 2020 ). The third study had self- reported exposure to war or violence as a criterium for inclusion in the study ( Ooi 2016 ).One study included participants with a PTSD diagnosis ( Ooi 2016 ), while the other two studies did not specifically report on the severity of mental health problems at baseline. Interventions Type of intervention and target According to the IASC pyramid categories we used, interventions were classified as focused, non-specialist care ( Baker 2006 ; Ooi 2016 ), and Walg 2020 categorised 'music therapy' intervention prevention ( Baker 2006 ). We considered the 'Teaching Recovery Techniques' intervention to be treatment, with participants experiencing mild-to-moderate symptoms of PTSD ( Ooi 2016 ). The Stabilization Training intervention evaluated in the third trial appeared to be more in line with treatment than prevention, although it was unclear whether participating adolescents were diagnosed with a condition such as PTSD prior to taking part ( Walg 2020 ). Setting Two studies delivered interventions in schools ( Baker 2006 ; Ooi 2016 ), and one study delivered interventions in accommodation for unaccompanied minors ( Walg 2020 ). Format All three active interventions were delivered in a group format. One intervention involved 69-minute sessions ( Walg 2020 ), the second consisted of 10 sessions of 30 to 40 minutes each ( Baker 2006 ), and the third consisted of eight one-hour sessions ( Ooi 2016 ). Comparators All three RCTs compared a community-based intervention to a waiting list ( Baker 2006 ; Ooi 2016 ; Walg 2020 ). The study authors of one study mentioned that their waiting list had similarities with a 'treatment as usual' control group, as pedagogical experts provide support during the trial period ( Walg 2020 ). Outcomes Primary outcomes Eicacy of the intervention Two RCTs reported on our primary outcomes: symptoms of PTSD, symptoms of depression, and psychological distress. One trial reported on symptoms of PTSD measured with the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13) three months aN\u00dfXter the intervention ( Ooi 2016 ). The same trial reported on symptoms of depression aN\u00dfXter three months using the Depression Self-Rating Scale (DSRS) for children. One trial measured psychological distress immediately aN\u00dfXter the last intervention session using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) ( Walg 2020 ). Adverse events (intervention acceptability) None of the RCTs reported data on adverse events such as counts of suicide, self-harm, or other adverse events. Secondary outcomes Quality of life or well-being None of the RCTs reported data on quality of life or well-being.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.14Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Externalising and internalising behaviour problems All three included RCTs reported on child behaviour. In one trial, parents completed the CBCL aN\u00dfXter the last intervention session ( Walg 2020 trial used subscales for internalising and externalising behaviours of the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) completed at five weeks post-intervention ( Baker 2006 ). The third trial reported on internalising and externalising behaviours at three months post-intervention using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-37 (HSCL-37A), which was developed for self- completion by unaccompanied refugee adolescents ( Ooi 2016 ). Participation and functioning None of the RCTs reported data on participation and functioning. Participant satisfaction None of the RCTs reported data on participant satisfaction. To our knowledge and based on an examination of online trial registrations and trial methods sections, outcomes that were not reported in the included RCTs were not measured. Excluded studies Twenty-four studies were excluded upon screening of full-text articles. Five studies evaluated interventions not of interest to this review, for example because they were not aimed at refugees and asylum seekers or not focussed on mental health promotion, prevention, or treatment ( Betancourt 2020 ; Brar-Josan 2019 ; Mattenschlager 2016 ; Mooren 2011 ; Neurohr 2019 ). Nine studies did not consider mental health outcomes ( Cumming 2009 ; Dhillon 2020 ; Harris 2009 ; Marsh 2012 ; Naidoo 2009 ; Rosso 2016 ; Rousseau 2006 ; Sonn 2013 ; Weekes 2011 ). These studies for example focussed on literacy skills ( Naidoo 2009 ) or social connections ( Marsh 2012 ). Ten studies evaluated interventions delivered in a clinical setting rather than community-based interventions ( Bohnacker 2017 ; 2020 ; Neuner 2019 ; Peltonen 2015 ; Ruf 2006 ; Ruf 2010 ; Ugurlu 2016 ; Unterhitzenberger 2015 ). Thirty-five non-randomised studies, which met the inclusion criteria, were initially included in our review. We decided at a later stage not to include information for these studies in the main section of the review, and descriptions of these studies were instead added to Appendix 3 . Studies awaiting classification One report was of an RCT with a sample of refugees aged between 13 and 21 years ( Pfeier 2018 ). Requested data for children only were received aN\u00dfXter writing this review and will be considered at review update. Ongoing studies Five studies, with study protocols published between 2019 and 2021, are ongoing ( Durbeej 2021 ; Rosner 2020 ; Sarkadi 2020 ; Stiles 2019 ; Warner 2020 ). Risk of bias in included studies Risk of bias was assessed for the available outcomes: symptoms of PTSD ( Risk of bias table for Analysis 1.1 ), symptoms of depression (Risk of bias table for Analysis 1.2 ), psychological distress ( Risk of bias table for Analysis 1.3 ), and child behaviour ( Risk of bias tablefor Analysis 1.4 ; Risk of bias table for Analysis 1.6 ; Risk of bias table for Analysis 1.5 ). The RoB 2 tool was accessed starting on 18 October 2021. Detailed risk of bias assessment data with consensus responses to signalling questions can be obtained from the authors. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder One cluster-RCT reported symptoms of PTSD ( Ooi 2016 ). Overall, there were 'some concerns' relating to risk of bias for this outcome. Risk of bias was judged as low for all domains except the risk of bias in the selection of the reported result, for which there were some concerns. The trial was registered online aN\u00dfXter enrolment had started and it was unclear whether the trial registration was published before analyses had started. Symptoms of depression One RCT reported symptoms of depression ( Ooi 2016 ). As for the assessment of the PTSD outcome, there was 'some concern' about risk of bias in the selection of the reported result, due to retrospective trial registration and the absence of a published protocol. Risk of bias for the other domains was judged as low and the overall risk of bias assessment was 'some concerns' . Psychological distress One trial reported on psychological distress ( Walg 2020 ). This outcome was judged at high risk of bias overall. There were some concerns about risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, because the authors did not provide details regarding the allocation sequence. The outcome was at high risk of bias relating to measurement of the outcome. Participants completed the outcome assessments and were not blinded due to the nature of the intervention. Given that the control group was a waiting list, in other words no intervention, it is likely that participants would complete outcome assessments dierently depending on whether they received an intervention or not. Child behaviour Three trials reported child behaviour, using dierent measures and time points. Overall risk of bias judgements were some concerns for one trial ( Ooi 2016 ), and high risk of bias for the other two ( Baker 2006 ; Walg 2020 ). There were some concerns about the lack of detail on descriptions of the randomisation procedure and allocation sequence ( Baker 2006 ; Walg 2020 ). Risk of bias relating to measurement of the outcome was low in one trial ( Ooi 2016 ), and high in the other two (Baker 2006 ; Walg 2020 ). In Baker 2006 and Walg 2020 , outcome assessors were closely involved with the study or intervention delivery (or both). Therefore, knowledge of the allocation of participants may have influenced measurements. There were some concerns about selection of reported results due to the absence of published trial protocols and prospectively registered trial registrations in two of the trials ( Baker 2006 ; Ooi 2016 ).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews The three included RCTs reported data on the eicacy of the interventions relating to symptoms of PTSD, symptoms of depression, psychological distress, and child behaviour. For our other outcomes of interest, no data were reported. Community-based intervention versus no treatment We identified no RCTs comparing community-based intervention versus no treatment. Community-based intervention versus waiting list Three trials compared community-based intervention versus waiting list ( Baker 2006 ; Ooi 2016 ; Walg 2020 ). Primary outcomes Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder There was no evidence of a dierence in symptoms of PTSD at three months post-treatment between the intervention and waiting list groups in one cluster-RCT with 82 participants (eective sample size 63) (MD 1.46, 95% CI 6.78 to 3.86; Analysis 1.1 ; Ooi 2016 ). Symptoms of anxiety The trials did not report data for symptoms of anxiety. Symptoms of depression There was no evidence of a dierence in symptoms of depression at three months post-treatment dier between the intervention and waiting list groups in one RCT with an eective sample size of 63 participants (MD 0.26, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.67; Analysis 1.2 ; Ooi 2016 ). Psychological distress There was no evidence of a dierence in symptoms of psychological distress post-treatment between the intervention and waiting list groups in one RCT with 33 participants (eective sample size 16) (MD 10.5, 95% CI 47.94 to 26.94; Analysis 1.3 ; Walg 2020 ). Adverse events The trials did not report data for adverse events. Secondary outcomes Quality of life or well-being The trials did not report data for quality of life or well-being. Externalising and internalising behaviour problems Three trials reported child behaviour, with two trials reporting on internalising and externalising behaviours separately ( Baker 2006 ; Ooi 2016 ). There was no evidence of a dierence between intervention and waiting list groups in child behaviour scores immediately post- treatment in one RCT with 33 participants (MD 8.7, 95% CI 27.71 to 10.31; Analysis 1.4 ; Walg 2020 ). Externalising behaviour scores did not dier between intervention and waiting list groups five weeks post-treatment (MD 0.22, 95% CI 3.44 to 3.0; Baker 2006 or ). Internalising behaviour scores did not dier between intervention and waiting list groups five weeks post-treatment (MD 1.59, 95%CI 1.26 to 4.44; Baker 2006 ) or three months post-treatment (MD 1.23, 95% CI 5.61 to 3.15; Ooi 2016 ) (Analysis 1.6 ). Participation and functioning The trials did not report data for participation and functioning. Participant satisfaction The trials did not report data for participant satisfaction. Community-based intervention versus treatment as usual We identified no RCTs comparing community-based intervention versus treatment as usual. Community-based intervention versus psychological placebo We identified no RCTs comparing community-based intervention versus psychological placebo. D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results Based on the three RCTs included in the narrative synthesis of results of this review, we can conclude there is no evidence for the eectiveness or acceptability of community-based interventions for child and adolescent refugees and asylum seekers in high- income countries. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low for the primary outcomes of symptoms of PTSD, symptoms of depression, and psychological distress. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low for the secondary outcome of child behaviour. There was no evidence for the primary outcomes of anxiety symptom severity and adverse events, neither for the secondary outcomes of quality of life or wellbeing, participation and functioning, and participant satisfaction. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence While community-based interventions may be eective for mental health in various populations, we found no evidence to suggest that such interventions could promote mental health, or prevent or treat mental health conditions among refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries. Some of the largest gaps in the evidence include the absence of RCTs that are statistically powered to detect moderate eects, evaluations of interventions for the treatment of diagnosed mental health conditions, and evaluations including outcomes relating to the acceptability of interventions. We identified 35 non-randomised studies relevant to this topic (Appendix 3 ). Although these are not the most appropriate studies to draw conclusions on the eectiveness of interventions, they comprise a much wider range of study designs, settings, and interventions. Intervention settings not represented in RCTs included refugee shelters and camps, community centres, arrival centres for refugees and asylum seekers, universities, and the workplace. Interventions providing community and family support and multi-modal interventions were evaluated in non-randomised studies but not in the included RCTs. Quality of the evidence Our confidence in the findings of this review was low for symptoms of PTSD and depression and for child behaviour at three months Community-based interventions for improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.16Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews post-treatment. Our confidence was very low for the other outcomes for which data were available: psychosocial distress and child behaviour post-treatment and five weeks post-treatment (Summary of findings 1 ). Evidence was downgraded for risk of bias relating to outcome measurement, inconsistency (only one trial was available for each outcome), and imprecision. Two included RCTs had fewer than 20 participants per study arm, limiting statistical power to show any dierences between study arms ( Baker 2006 ; Walg 2020 ). On average, mean scores of participants did not indicate clinical levels of mental health-related symptoms. To demonstrate eectiveness of an intervention among participants with subclinical symptoms, who can be expected to make relatively small gains from an intervention in terms of symptom severity, greater sample sizes are needed. Potential biases in the review process Even though we conducted extensive searches, our search of grey literature was limited and focussed on academic sources of evidence. We may have missed evaluations of mental health interventions published elsewhere. We planned to synthesise evidence on adverse events such as counts of suicide, self-harm, or other adverse events as an indicator of intervention acceptability. However, no data were available from the included RCTs. It is likely that non-randomised studies would oer an insight into the acceptability of interventions, with a broader range of measures extending beyond counts of adverse events. Although not within the scope of our review, a future review in this field could focus on evidence for the acceptability of interventions in non-randomised studies. One RCT published data for both children and adolescents. We did not manage to receive the children-only data in time, which means this evidence was not included in our review ( Pfeier 2018 ). We were unable to assess the risk of publication bias due to the limited number of RCTs included. It is possible that trials that showed no eect, or even a negative eect, have been conducted but not published. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews Results of this review are consistent with those of a Cochrane systematic overview aimed at mapping the characteristics and methodological quality of existing systematic reviews on mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of common mental disorders among refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced people. The overview highlighted a research gap in mental health interventions especially for children ( Upho 2020 ), confirmed by the low number of trials included in the present review. In terms of eicacy, our review failed to identify a strong and clinically significant eect of community-based interventions in comparison with control conditions. These results are aligned with those of one Cochrane systematic review of psychological therapies in humanitarian settings in low- and middle-income countries (Purgato 2018 ). This review included both participants resettled or born in low- and middle-income countries, and found only asmall set of trials of very low quality on children and adolescents, with a non-significant trend in favour of CBT in lowering PTSD symptoms at endpoint and no data on major depression or anxiety (Purgato 2018 ). Similarly, the Cochrane Review published by Patel and colleagues, which was focused on torture survivors, did not identify substantial dierences between psychological therapies and controls in terms of immediate eects on PTSD symptoms, distress, or quality of life ( Patel 2014 ). One systematic review on group-based interventions for refugee minors and young adults (aged 21 years or younger) identified a general positive eect of interventions for decreasing psychological symptoms. However, this review included only a few RCTs of low quality, and mixed qualitative and quantitative studies either in high-income countries and in low- and middle-income countries with small sample sizes (1119 participants) ( Hutchinson 2022 ). One review focused on the mental health of refugee children and adolescents resettled in high-income countries and published in 2018 found a small evidence base for interventions for refugee children, limiting the conclusions that could be drawn for preventive interventions, but also for specific treatments (Fazel 2018b ). For example, interventions developed to specifically address the sequelae of exposure to potentially traumatic events \u2014 most commonly PTSD and depression \u2014 are delivered as individual intervention strategies to treat mental disorders, which for refugee children are beset with additional stressors such as poverty, transportation, linguistic and cultural barriers, and lack of parental support. For this reason, interventions including or accounting for the social determinants of mental health would be particularly important to address mental health problems within a socio-ecological lens ( Lund 2018 ; Purgato 2017 ). A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice Based on the limited evidence identified in this review, we are unable to recommend avenues for practice. Evidence from global mental health may oer insights into community-based mental health interventions that may be eective and acceptable. For example, interventions using transdiagnostic approaches and treatment and prevention provided by primary care workers seem promising in settings with limited resources ( van Ginneken 2021 ). However, these populations are likely to dier in terms of mental health needs and settings dier in terms of existing healthcare structures and available resources. It would be valuable for policy-makers and those implementing community-based interventions for the improvement of mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries to seek collaborations with academics to evaluate the interventions. Implications for research There are important challenges in the conduct of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate mental health interventions in this population. Refugee children and adolescents who have recently arrived in the host country, and are arguably most in need of mental health support, oN\u00dfXten live in temporary accommodation. They may not be able to take part in an intervention delivered in the host country language without help from an interpreter.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.17Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews The therapeutic alliance can be diicult to establish ( Demazure 2021 ). Children and adolescents who have had a perilous journey and witnessed traumatic events may be reluctant to take part in clinical trials and they can have a negative perception of mental health services and consider that this is not a priority ( Demazure 2021 ). All of these factors complicate trial recruitment and follow- up. However, this systematic review has shown there is a pressing need for methodologically sound, statistically powered trials with relevant outcomes. Non-randomised trials cannot unequivocally establish the eectiveness of mental health interventions. However, they could prove valuable in exploring the challenges relating to the uptake and acceptability of interventions in this population. Qualitative studies in particular may be able to inform the design and implementation of interventions, so that they are delivered in a way that is sensitive to the needs of child and adolescent refugees. RCTs in this field of research can be improved by more careful trial design and more transparent reporting. For example, the main aim of the intervention, whether mental health promotion, prevention, or treatment, should be clear from the published manuscripts. The IASC pyramid approach we adopted for this review can be used to correctly describe the aim and target of interventions, so that results can be compared between studies (IASC 2007 ). Several authors of this review have sought to clarify the distinction between health promotion, prevention, and treatment in global mental health ( Purgato 2020 ). Reporting, and therefore the applicability of results, could be improved further by clearly defining the study population. For example, we have found that the distinction between migrants and refugees is not always clear and the baseline severity of symptoms or existing diagnoses are oN\u00dfXten not reported. The five ongoing RCTs included in this review and the one study awaiting classification have the potential to deliver important and high-quality evidence. Three of these trials will evaluate the Teaching Recovery Techniques intervention for symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder ( Durbeej 2021 ; Sarkadi 2020 ; Warner 2020 ). Hopefully an update of this systematic review will be able to include a meta-analysis of these trials.

This register contains over 40,000 reference records (reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) for anxiety and depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, self-harm and other mental disorders within the scope of this group. The CCMDCTR is a partially studies- based register with more than 50% of the reference records tagged to c12,600 individually PICO-coded study records. Reports of trials for inclusion in the register were collated from (weekly) generic searches of key bibliographic databases to June 2016, which included MEDLINE (1950-), and PsycINFO (1967-), quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review-specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials were also sourced from international trial registries, drug companies, the hand-searching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Details of CCMD's core search strategies (used to identify RCTs) can be found on the group's website. Electronic searches CCMDCTR-Studies and References For this review, an information specialist with the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group cross-searched the CCMDCTR using the following terms ( population only): Community-based interventions for improving mental health in refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The rationale of maintaining a comprehensive specialised register was reviewed when the editorial group moved from the University of Bristol to the University of York in June 2016. At this time, the Group decided to archive the CCMDCTR and return to searching the medical and psychological literature directly, on a review-by-review basis.] Appendix 3. Description of 35 non-randomised studies identified through the literature search Study design We found non-randomised controlled trials ( Demott 2017 ; Ehntholt 2005 ; Fazel 2009 ; Quinlan 2016 ; Scheiber 2019 ; St\u00e6hr 2001 ); quasi- randomised trials ( 2021 ); and retrospective studies ( Birman 2008 ; Samec 2006 ); pre-post intervention studies (Boose 2019 ; Dura-Vila 2013 ; Ellis 2013 ; Fox 2005 ; Garo 2019 ; Grasser 2019 ; Hurn 2018 ; Kowitt 2016 ; Mohlen 2005 ; Mom 2019 ; O'Shea 2000 ; Rowe 2017 ; Sarkadi 2018 ; Unterhitzenberger 2019 ); qualitative studies ( Akthar 2019 ; Bujorbarua 2021 ; Crawford 2020 ; de Freitas 2020 ; Lampa 2021 ; Momartin 2018 ); case-control studies ( Barrett 2000 ); and case studies ( Crawford 2017 ; Jackson 2006 ; Millar 2019 ; Unterhitzenberger 2016 ). There were six qualitative studies ( Akthar 2019 ; Bujorbarua 2021 ; Crawford 2020 ; Freitas 2020 ; Lampa 2021 ; Momartin 2018 ). One study used phenomenology as a theoretical framework ( Akthar 2019 ). Methods for data collection included interviews ( Akthar 2019 ; Bujorbarua 2021 ; Crawford 2020 ; Lampa 2021 ; Momartin 2018 ); field notes and observations ( Bujorbarua 2021 ; de Freitas 2020 ; de Freitas 2020 ); and focus groups ( de Freitas 2020 ). Methods for analyses included thematic analysis ( Crawford 2020 ; de Freitas 2020 ; Momartin 2018 ); and content analysis ( Lampa 2021 ). Four quantitative studies included a qualitative component such as a process evaluation of the intervention or programme ( Garo 2019 ; Hurn 2018 ; Kowitt 2016 ; Sarkadi 2018 ). Geographical location Six studies were conducted in the UK ( Akthar 2019 ; Dura-Vila 2013 ; Ehntholt 2005 ; Fazel 2009 ; Hurn 2018 ; O'Shea 2000 ); nine in North America ( Birman 2008 ; Boose 2019 ; Bujorbarua 2021 ; de Freitas 2020 ; Ellis 2013 ; Fox 2005 ; Grasser 2019 ; Kowitt 2016 ; Rowe 2017 ); seven in Australia ( Barrett 2000 ; Crawford 2017 ; Crawford 2020 ; Jackson 2006 ; Mom 2019 ; Momartin 2018 ; Quinlan 2016 ); three in Germany ( Mohlen 2005 ; Unterhitzenberger 2016 ; Unterhitzenberger 2019 ); three in Sweden ( Lampa 2021 ; Samec 2006 ; Sarkadi in Greece ( Foka 2021 ; Millar 2019 ); one in Austria ( Scheiber 2019 ); one in Finland ( Garo 2019 ); one in Denmark ( St\u00e6hr 2001 ); and one in Norway ( Demott 2017 ). Sponsorship A total of 14 studies received funding ( Birman 2008 ; de Freitas 2020 ; Demott 2017 ; Dura-Vila 2013 ; Ellis 2013 ; Fazel 2009 ; Garo 2019 ; Grasser 2019 ; Lampa 2021 ; Mohlen 2005 ; Momartin 2018 ; O'Shea 2000 ; Sarkadi 2018 ; Unterhitzenberger 2019 ); while four studies received no funding ( Crawford 2017 ; Crawford 2020 ; Millar 2019 ; Unterhitzenberger 2016 ); and 16 studies did not report on funding ( Akthar 2019 ; Barrett 2000 ; Boose 2019 ; Bujorbarua 2021 ; Ehntholt 2005 ; Foka 2021 ; Fox 2005 ; Hurn 2018 ; Jackson 2006 ; Kowitt 2016 ; Mom 2019 ; Quinlan 2016 ; Rowe 2017 ; Samec 2006 ; Scheiber 2019 ; St\u00e6hr 2001 ). Participants Age Four studies included children under 14 years old ( Bujorbarua 2021 ; Hurn 2018 ; Jackson 2006 ; O'Shea 2000 ). Five studies included adolescents aged 14 years and older ( Barrett 2000 ; Samec 2006 ; Sarkadi 2018 ; Scheiber 2019 ; Unterhitzenberger 2019 ). Other studies included children and adolescents with a range of ages ( Crawford 2017 ; de Freitas 2020 ; Foka 2021 ; Fox 2005 ; Garo 2019 ; Grasser 2019 ; Kowitt 2016 ; Millar 2019 ; Mohlen 2005 ; Momartin 2018 ; St\u00e6hr 2001 ). One study reported neither the age range nor the mean age ( Lampa 2021 ).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Sex There were three all-male studies ( Demott 2017 ; Scheiber studies Barrett 2000 ; Lampa 2021 ; Unterhitzenberger 2016 ). Other studies included males and females and one study did not report sex ( Samec 2006 ). Country of origin Most studies had participants originating from multiple countries across Central/Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. There were seven studies where all the participants had the same country of origin ( Barrett 2000 ; Bujorbarua 2021 ; Ellis 2013 ; Grasser 2019 ; Kowitt 2016 ; St\u00e6hr 2001 ; Unterhitzenberger 2016 ). Seven studies did not report the participants' countries of origin ( de Freitas 2020 ; Foka 2021 ; Jackson 2006 ; Lampa 2021 ; Mom 2019 ; Rowe 2017 ; Sarkadi 2018 ). Country of settlement For nearly all the included studies, the study authors' geographic location was the same as the participants' country of settlement, except for one study in which the study authors' geographic location was the UK while the participants' country of settlement was Greece ( Foka 2021 ). Refugee status All the studies included participants who were either refugees or asylum-seekers. Three studies did not specifically report on refugee status (Fox 2005 ; Momartin 2018 ; Samec 2006 ). Severity of condition Sixteen studies did not specifically report on the severity of the condition ( Akthar 2019 ; Barrett 2000 ; Boose 2019 ; Crawford 2017 ; Crawford 2020 ; de Freitas 2020 ; Ellis 2013 ; Fazel 2009 ; Fox 2005 ; Garo 2019 ; Kowitt 2016 ; Lampa 2021 ; Millar 2019 ; Quinlan 2016 ; Samec 2006 ; Scheiber 2019 ). Four studies reported that all or most of the participants had witnessed or experienced traumatic events ( Demott 2017 ; Mom 2019 ; Momartin 2018 ; Rowe 2017 ). Ten studies included participants with a post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis ( Birman 2008 ; Bujorbarua 2021 ; Grasser 2019 ; Hurn 2018 ; Jackson 2006 ; Mohlen 2005 ; O'Shea 2000 ; Pfeier 2017 ; Unterhitzenberger 2016 ; Unterhitzenberger 2019 ). Five studies used a sample in which some participants experienced trauma-related symptoms or psychological distress ( Dura-Vila 2013 ; Foka 2021 ; Hurn 2018 ; Sarkadi 2018 ; St\u00e6hr 2001 ). Interventions Type of intervention According to the IASC pyramid categories we used, eight studies classified interventions as community and family support ( Akthar 2019 ; Bujorbarua 2021 ; Crawford 2020 ; Dura-Vila 2013 ; Grasser 2019 ; Jackson 2006 ; Mom 2019 ; O'Shea 2000 ). Ten studies included focused, non- specialist care ( Crawford ; Demott 2017 ; 2005 ; 2021 ; Fox 2005 ; Millar 2019 ; Mohlen 2005 ; Quinlan 2016 ; Samec 2006 ; St\u00e6hr 2001 ). Twelve studies included specialised services ( Barrett 2000 ; Birman 2008 ; Boose 2019 ; Garo 2019 ; Kowitt 2016 ; Lampa 2021 ; Momartin 2018 ; Rowe 2017 ; Sarkadi 2018 ; Scheiber 2019 ; Unterhitzenberger 2019 ; Unterhitzenberger 2016 ). Four studies implemented multi-modal interventions ( de Freitas 2020 ; Ellis 2013 ; Fazel 2009 ; Hurn 2018 ). Target Many studies did not clearly specify the target of the intervention as promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health problems. Some of these mentioned 'treatment' without including participants diagnosed with a mental health problem. We categorised eight studies as prevention or treatment (or both) based on author descriptions of the intervention ( Akthar 2019 ; Barrett 2000 ; Birman 2008 ; Dura-Vila 2013 ; Fazel 2009 ; Garo 2019 ; Rowe 2017 ; Sarkadi 2018 ). We categorised five studies as prevention ( Crawford 2017 ; de Freitas 2020 ; Mom 2019 ; Scheiber 2019 ; St\u00e6hr 2001 ), and one as mental health promotion ( Crawford 2020 ). Five studies evaluated either mental health prevention or promotion interventions ( Ellis 2013 ; Foka 2021 ; Jackson 2006 ; Kowitt 2016 ; Millar 2019 ). Seventeen studies evaluated a mental health treatment ( Baker 2006 ; Boose 2019 ; Bujorbarua 2021 ; Demott 2017 ; Ehntholt 2005 ; Grasser ; Fox 2005 ; Hurn 2018 ; Lampa 2021 ; Mohlen 2005 ; Momartin 2018 ; O'Shea 2000 ; Quinlan 2016 ; Rowe 2017 ; Samec 2006 ; Unterhitzenberger 2016 ; Unterhitzenberger 2019 ). Setting Most included studies were conducted in school settings ( Barrett 2000 ; Boose 2019 ; Crawford 2017 ; Crawford 2020 ; Dura-Vila 2013 ; Ehntholt 2005 ; Ellis 2013 ; Fazel 2009 ; Fox 2005 ; Jackson 2006 ; Kowitt 2016 ; Mom 2019 ; Momartin 2018 ; O'Shea 2000 ; Quinlan 2016 ; Rowe 2017 ; Samec 2006 ; Sarkadi 2018 ). Eight studies were conducted in temporary refugee shelters, camps, or accommodations ( de Freitas 2020 ; Foka 2021 ; Millar 2019 ; Mohlen 2005 ; Sarkadi 2018 ; Scheiber 2019 ; St\u00e6hr 2001 ; Unterhitzenberger 2016 ). Other settings included community centres ( Birman 2021 ; Hurn 2018 ; Lampa 2021 ), refugees asylum 2017 ; Garo workplace ( Akthar 2019 ).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Format Most interventions were group-based ( Akthar 2019 ; Barrett 2000 ; Bujorbarua 2021 ; Crawford 2017 ; Crawford 2020 ; de Freitas 2020 ; Demott 2017 ; Ehntholt 2005 ; Ellis 2013 ; Foka 2021 ; Fox 2005 ; Garo 2019 ; Grasser 2019 ; Hurn 2018 ; Jackson 2006 ; Mom 2019 ; Momartin 2018 ; Pfeier 2017 ; Quinlan 2016 ; Samec 2006 ; Scheiber 2019 ; St\u00e6hr 2001 ; Unterhitzenberger 2019 ). Four studies evaluated interventions delivered to individual participants in face-to-face sessions ( Boose 2019 ; Dura-Vila 2013 ; Kowitt 2016 ; Unterhitzenberger 2016 ). Eight studies evaluated an intervention with a mix of individual and group sessions ( Birman 2008 ; Fazel 2009 ; Lampa 2021 ; Millar 2019 ; Mohlen 2005 ; O'Shea 2000 ; Rowe 2017 ; Sarkadi 2018 ). Number or duration of sessions Five studies did not report the number of sessions ( Akthar 2019 ; Crawford 2020 ; Jackson 2006 ; Momartin 2018 ; St\u00e6hr 2001 ). In four other studies, the number and duration of sessions was variable and based on individual need ( Birman 2008 ; Dura-Vila 2013 ; Fazel 2009 ; O'Shea 2000 ). In eight studies, the intervention consisted of four to six sessions, lasting between one and three hours per session ( Ehntholt 2005 ; Foka 2021 ; ; Sarkadi 2018 ; Scheiber 2019 ). In nine studies, the intervention consisted of eight to 10 sessions, lasting between 30 and 90 minutes per session ( Barrett 2000 ; Boose 2019 ; Bujorbarua 2021 ; Crawford 2017 ; Demott 2017 ; Fox 2005 ; Garo 2019 ; Quinlan 2016 ; Samec 2006 ). Nine interventions consisted of more than 10 sessions, oN\u00dfXten running weekly for a longer period of time, up to one year ( de Freitas 2020 ; Ellis 2013 ; Grasser 2019 ; Kowitt 2016 ; Mohlen 2005 ; Mom 2019 ; Rowe 2017 ; Unterhitzenberger 2016 ; Unterhitzenberger 2019 ). Where reported, sessions lasted between 50 minutes and three hours ( de Freitas 2020 ; Grasser 2019 ; Mohlen 2005 ; Mom 2019 ; Rowe 2017 ; Unterhitzenberger 2019 ). Comparators Studies with a control group used either a waiting list ( Barrett 2000 ; Ehntholt 2005 ; Foka 2021 treatment ( 2017 ; Fazel 2009 ; Quinlan 2016 ; St\u00e6hr 2001 ) as a comparator.

External sources National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), UK EU contributions to the protocol were funded from Cochrane Infrastructure funding to the Common Mental Disorders Cochrane Review Group. EU received an NIHR ESP Incentive Award to complete this priority review (NIHR150877; GBP 8000). D I F F E R E N C E S B E T W E E N P R O T O C O L A N D R E V I E W We made the following changes from the published protocol ( Soltan 2020 ). 1. We stated in the protocol that a description of all types of study designs, including non-randomised studies, would be included as part of objective 2 (\"to comprehensively summarise evidence from non-randomised quantitative and qualitative studies on community-based interventions for mental health promotion and preventing and treating mental disorders among refugee children and adolescents in high-income countries\"). However, this was found to be confusing as data on the eicacy of interventions were drawn from randomised studies only. Therefore, we removed methods and results relating to objective 2 to the appendix ( Appendix 3 ), and we briefly described non-randomised studies in the discussion section. 2. We made small changes to the text of the methods section to clarify that no outcome data were extracted for non-randomised studies. 3. We had planned to search grey literature and international trial registries, but we did not have the resources available to conduct these searches. 4. We planned to conduct risk of bias assessments for all included studies. However, as we did not extract outcome data for non- randomised studies, it was not thought meaningful to conduct risk of bias assessments for these studies. As such, we only conducted risk of bias assessments for the three included RCTs. 5. We did not conduct subgroup analyses or sensitivity analyses as suicient data were not available. 6. We stated in the protocol that risk of bias assessments would only be completed for the primary outcomes. However, because one included trial only reported on a secondary outcome, we decided to complete risk of bias assessments for all relevant outcomes in the three trials. 7. We planned to conduct meta-analyses if the obtained data would justify this approach. However, the included trials diered substantially in terms of the participants, target of the intervention (promotion, prevent, or treatment), and the working mechanisms of the intervention. Therefore, we decided that a narrative synthesis was most appropriate.
