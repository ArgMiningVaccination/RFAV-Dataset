It is a \"holistic\" medicine in that it sees the symptoms of the body and mind as a totality. Symptoms of ill health are seen as expressions of the healing process within the whole person, and that the whole person needs treatment, not just the isolated symptoms of a defined illness. The substances used are extremely diluted and \"activated\" in such a way that there are no biological side effects. What is homeopathy? Homeopathy is a system of medicine developed by a German physician that has been used successfully for over 200 years throughout the world. The earliest hospitals and medical schools in the United States used homeopathy. Samuel Hahnemann was a medical doctor practicing in 1796 who did not agree with the current medical practice of his day - large amounts of toxic drugs, bleeding, etc. He discovered that his sensitive patients responded well to diluted forms of medicinal herbs, activated by succussing each dilution The name homeopathy is derived from the Greek word homoios (like) and pathos (disease or suffering). One main tenant of homeopathy is that \"Like cures like'. When a person is ill, his symptoms are noted by a homeopath who then gives small doses of a remedy that, if given to a healthy person (a proving) , would produce similar symptoms. How does it work? Homeopathy is based on natural laws of quantum physics that are increasingly well understood and well documented. The Law of Similars is the core concept - the client's symptoms are carefully matched with the action of the remedy. The remedy's action was found both through traditional wisdom of a substance's healing power and by \"provings\" which are experiments to determine the remedy's effect on people. Why is homeopathy considered a deeper healing? What is unique and most useful about Homeopathy is that it stimulates healing and balance on a deeper level. It is capable of releasing us from the effect of negative influences such as physical insults (vaccination, trauma), emotional upsets, or behaviors when we are stuck in the same way of trying to do things. Homeopathy can help us get unstuck from old patterns and open us up to new ones (more) (more) Hahnemann noticed in his practice that many of his patients suffered from the same acute diseases (bronchitis, indigestion, earaches, etc.) over and over again. This led to his understanding that people had a susceptibility to certain types of illness, which he called their constitution. This susceptibility can be inherited or acquired through poor lifestyle habits, upbringing, or diet. Homeopathy understands that it is not the disease that needs to be treated, but the person. It is not the external factor that is the true cause of disease, but the person's susceptibility to what is happening in their environment. Many people may be exposed to a virus, but only some will develop a cold or flu. Some people will be able to handle a stressful situation well, while others will be unable to function. What will the homeopathic consultation and treatment be like? The homeopathic consultation takes longer and requires different information than other medical visits. You will be asked about a number of issues - your physical symptoms, sleep, mental or emotional traumas, what makes you feel better or worse, how you are affected by the environment, dreams, fears, food desires/aversions, and family history. This information is used to find a matching remedy. Response to remedy is variable for each person and depends on the depth and length of their illness, whether there has been suppression from medications, their vitality, etc. Generally positive changes will be noted in several weeks or months, but deeper cure takes time. What is a homeopathic remedy? A homeopathic remedy can be made from anything - plant, ani mal, mineral, chemical, but are highly diluted so there are no side effects. The energy of the remedy stimulates the body to heal itself, so tiny doses are used. These remedies are prepared in a very specific manner and many of the products on the market today that advertise themselves as homeopathic may not be true homeopathic products. Is homeopathy gentle? Homeopathy has been used in people of all ages from pregnancy to old age with excellent results. It is so gentle that, in fact, some people may not notice how well it has worked. "}
