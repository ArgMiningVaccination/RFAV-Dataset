Related Applications and Grant Support This application claims the benefit of priority of provisional application US61/585,769, of identical title, filed January 12, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. This invention was made with government support under grant no.AI084140 of the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention. Background of the Invention E3 ubiquitin ligases (of which over 600 are known in humans)1 confer substrate specificity for ubiquitination and are more attractive therapeutic targets than general proteasome inhibitors3 ,4 due to their specificity for certain protein substrates. Although the development of ligands of E3 ligase has proven challenging, in part due to the fact that they must disrupt protein-protein interactions5 recent developments have provided specific ligands WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 which bind to these ligases. Protein-protein interaction interactions are notoriously difficult to target using small molecules due to their large contact surfaces and the shallow grooves or flat interfaces involved. Conversely, most small molecule drugs bind enzymes or receptors in tight and well-defined pockets.6 Since the discovery of nutlins, the first small molecule E3 ligase inhibitors,7 additional compounds have been reported that target Inhibitors of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs),8 ' 9 sCFM et30,1 0 and SCFcdc4;1 1 however, the field remains underdeveloped. One E3 ligase with exciting therapeutic potential is the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, the substrate recognition subunit of the E3 ligase complex VCB, which also consists of elongins B and C, Cul2 and Rbxl.1 2 The primary substrate of VHL is Hypoxia Inducible Factor l a (HIF-la), a transcription factor that upregulates genes such as the pro-angiogenic growth factor VEGF and the red blood cell inducing cytokine erythropoietin in response to low oxygen levels. While HIF-la is constitutively expressed, its intracellular levels are kept very low under normoxic conditions via its hydroxylation by prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins and subsequent VHL-mediated ubiquitination (Figure I). Using rational design, we have generated the first small molecule ligands of Von Hippel Lindau (VHL), the substrate recognition subunit of the E3 ligase VCB, an important target in cancer, chronic anemia and ischemia.2 We have also obtained crystal structures of VHL with our most potent ligand, 15, confirming that the compound mimics the binding mode of the transcription factor HIF-la, the major substrate of VHL. From earlier biochemical and structural studies of a hydroxylated HIF peptide bound to VHL, it became clear that hydroxyproline played an important role in mediating this protein:protein interaction. As a consequence of that work, the present inventors developed a hydroxylated HIF peptide:VHL fluorescence polarization (FP) binding assay assayed >120 compounds possessing the central hydroxyproline residue flanked by non- peptidic moieties. Further to that research, the inventors now have developed co-crystal structures of VHL complexed with seven of the top compounds. Analysis of these ligand bound structures is driving the design/synthesis of the next generation of VHL ligands, which are linked with protein binding moieties to produce bifunctional compounds according to the present invention.. 2 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 A principal rationale for the present invention is the need for a small molecule E3 ligase ligand for our PROTAC (Proteolysis Targeting brings targeted proteins/polypeptides to E3 ligases for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In several proof-of-concept experiments, the present inventors demonstrated the utility of this approach using the short peptide sequence from HIF that binds VHL. In order to make a more 'drug-like' PROTAC, the inventors have replaced the HIF peptide with a 'small molecule' VHL ligand, thus providing means to recruit proteins to E3 ligases for ubiquitination and degradation, to the endpoint of providing therapies based upon this protein degradation. Objects of the Invention It is an object of the invention to provide compounds which function to recruit endogenous proteins to E3 Ubiquitin Ligase for degradation. It is an additional object of the invention to provide compounds which modulate protein degradation in a patient or subject and can be used for treating disease states or conditions which are modulated through the degraded protein. It is another object of the invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions based upon the above-described modulators, especially including inhibitors for therapeutic treatment of a patient or subject, preferably including a human patient or subject. It is also an object of the invention to provide methods for determining protein binding moieties which bind to proteins of interest. It is yet another object of the invention to provide methods for identifying endogenous proteins in a biological system, especially including a human system, which bind to protein binding moieties in compounds according to the present invention. It is still another object of the invention to provide methods for identifying the effects of the degradation of proteins of interest in a biological system using compounds according to the present invention. 3 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 It is still another aspect of the invention to provide methods for treating patients where the degradation of a targeted protein will produce an intended therapeutic effect. It is another object of the invention to provide compounds and compositions which may be used in a first medical application. It is yet another aspect of the invention to provide compounds and/or compositons which are used for treating patients where the degradation of a targeted protein will produce an intended therapeutic effect. Any one or more of these and/or other objects of the invention may be readily gleaned from a routine scrutiny of the description of the invention which follows. Brief Description of the Figures Figure I shows (A) H IF-la accumulation leads to the transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in the hypoxic response, such as erythropoietin and VEGF.

In another embodiment, the present invention provides a library of compounds. The library comprises more than one compound wherein each composition has a formula of A-B, wherein A is a ubiquitin pathway protein binding moiety (preferably, an E3 ubiquitin ligase moiety as otherwise disclosed herein) and B is a protein binding member of a molecular library, wherein A is coupled (preferably, through a linker moiety) to B, and wherein the ubiquitin pathway protein binding moiety recognizes an ubiquitin pathway protein, in particular, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In a particular embodiment, the library contains a specific ubiquitination recognition peptide of VHL for an E3 ubiquitin pathway protein binding moiety as otherwise disclosed herein) with random target protein binding elements (e.g., a chemical compound library).

In still another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of screening a library of the present invention to identify a compound containing a targeting moiety, which recognizes a target protein associated with a predetermined function of a cell.

The method comprises administering a bifunctional composition comprising an ubiquitin pathway protein binding moiety and a targeting moiety, preferably linked through a linker moiety, as otherwise described herein, wherein the ubiquitin pathway protein binding moiety is coupled to the targeting moiety and wherein the ubiquitin pathway protein binding moiety recognizes a ubiquitin pathway protein (e.g., an ubiquitin ligase, preferably an E3 ubiquitin ligase) and the targeting moiety recognizes the target protein such that degradation of the target protein will occur when the target protein is placed in proximity to the ubiquitin ligase, thus resulting in degradation/inhibition of the effects of the target protein and the control of protein levels. The control of protein levels afforded by the present invention provides treatment of a disease state or condition, which is modulated through the target protein by lowering the level o f that protein in the cells of a patient.

Detailed Description of the Invention The following terms are used to describe the present invention. In instances where a term is not specifically defined herein, that term is given an art-recognized meaning by those of ordinary skill applying that term in context to its use in describing the present invention. Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise (such as in the case of a group containing a number of carbon atoms in which case each carbon atom number falling within the range is provided), between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the invention. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included in the smaller ranges is also encompassed within the invention, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either both of those included limits are also included in the invention. The term \"compound\", as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to any specific chemical compound disclosed herein and includes tautomers, regioisomers, geometric isomers, and where including optical isomers (enantiomers) and other stereoisomers (diastereomers) thereof, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives (including prodrug forms) thereof where applicable, in context. Within its use in context, the term compound generally refers to a single compound, but also may include other compounds such as stereoisomers, regioisomers and/or optical isomers (including racemic mixtures) as well as specific enantiomers or enantiomerically enriched mixtures of disclosed compounds. The term also refers, in context to prodrug forms of compounds which have been modified to facilitate the administration and delivery of compounds to a site of activity. It is noted that in describing the present compounds, numerous substituents and variables associated with same, among others, are described. It is understood by those of ordinary skill that molecules which are described herein are stable 53 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 compounds as generally described hereunder. When the bond is shown, both a double bond and single bond are represented within the context of the compound shown. The term \"patient\" or \"subject\" is used throughout the specification to describe an animal, preferably a human or a domesticated animal, to whom treatment, including prophylactic treatment, with the compositions according to the present invention is provided. For treatment of those infections, conditions or disease states which are specific for a specific animal such as a human patient, the term patient refers to that specific animal, including a domesticated animal such as a dog or cat or a farm animal such as a horse, cow, sheep, etc. In general, in the present invention, the term patient refers to a human patient unless otherwise stated or implied from the context of the use of the term. The term \"effective\" is used to describe an amount of a compound, composition or component which, when used within the context of its intended use, effects an intended result. The term effective subsumes all other effective amount or effective concentration terms, which are otherwise described or used in the present application. The term target enzyme(s) binding site of ubiquitin ligase moieties in the bifunctional (chimeric) compounds according to the present invention. VCB E3 is a protein that in combination with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme causes the attachment of ubiquitin to on a target protein; the E3 ubiquitin ligase targets specific protein by the proteasome. Thus, E3 ubiquitin ligase or in complex with an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme is responsible for the transfer of ubiquitin to targeted proteins. In general, the ubiquitin ligase is involved in polyubiquitination such that a second ubiquitin is attached to the first, a third is attached to the second, and so forth. Polyubiquitination marks proteins for degradation by the proteasome. However, there are some ubiquitination events that are limited to mono-ubiquitination, in which only a single ubiquitin is added by the ubiquitin ligase to a substrate molecule. Mono-ubiquitinated proteins are not targeted to the proteasome for degradation, but may instead be altered in their cellular location or function, for example, via binding other proteins that have domains capable of binding ubiquitin. Further complicating matters, different lysines on ubiquitin can 54 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 be targeted by an E3 to make chains. The most common lysine is Lys48 on the ubiquitin chain. This is the lysine used to make polyubiquitin, which is recognized by the proteasome. The term \"protein target moiety\" or PTM is used to describe a small molecule which binds to a target protein or other protein or polypeptide of interest and places/presents that protein or polypeptide in proximity to an ubiquitin ligase such that degradation of the protein or polypeptide by ubiquitin ligase may occur. Non-limiting examples of small molecule target protein binding moieties include Hsp90 inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors, compounds targeting Human BET Bromodomain-containing proteins, HDAC inhibitors, human lysine methyltransferase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, immunosuppressive compounds, and compounds targeting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), among numerous others. The compositions described below exemplify some of the members o f these nine types of small molecule target protein. Protein target moieties according to the present invention include, for example, Haloalkane halogenase inhibitors, Hsp90 inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, MDM2 inhibitors, compounds Human BET Bromodomain-containing proteins, HDAC inhibitors, human lysine methyltransferase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, immunosuppressive compounds, and compounds targeting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The compositions described below exemplify some of the members of these types of small molecule target protein binding moieties. Such small molecule target protein binding moieties also include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, enantiomers, solvates and polymorphs of these compositions, as well as other small molecules that may target a protein of interest.

The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at varying intervals of time. Oral compositions will generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They may be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets.

Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Liposomal suspensions may also be pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For example, liposome formulations may be prepared by dissolving appropriate an inorganic solvent that is then evaporated, leaving behind a thin film of dried lipid on the surface of the container. An aqueous solution of the active compound are then introduced into the container. The container is then swirled by hand to free lipid material from the sides of the container and to disperse lipid aggregates, thereby forming the liposomal suspension. General Synthetic Approaches 108 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 Generic scheme for the synthesis of ULM derivatives is described here. Briefly, the compounds according to the present invention are synthesized pursuant to the general solution phase synthetic scheme (presented hereinbelow) and/or general scheme I, which is directed to phase synthesis of compounds according to the present invention. Initially a hydroxyl-protected carboxy substituted (and protected) pyrrolidine compound is reacted with a carboxylic acid containing reagent, which introduces a carbonyl group at the amine o f the pyrollidine ring to form an amide group. Alternatively, the pyrrolidine amine may be protected and the carboxylic acid moiety may be condensed with a nucleophilic group on a right hand fragment to provide an amide on the right hand portion of the pyrrolidine moiety. The left and right hand fragments to be condensed onto, respectively, the amine and carboxylic acid group of the pyrrolidine moiety are preferably prepared prior to condensing onto the pyrrolidine group, but other approaches may be taken to introduce groups onto the pyrrolidine group. The individual components which are combined to produce a ULM group can be prepared using blocking groups at preferred functional groups on the ULM group which can be removed so as to react with and covalently link a linker group which is prepared to accommodate a PTM moiety to which is already bound a protein binding moiety, or PTM group or may be further reacted to form a covalent bound with a PTM group, which may also may comprise a ULM' group as otherwise described herein. Thus, a carboxylic acid containing left hand fragment may be condensed onto the amine group o f the pyrroline, thus forming an amide group with an R 1 left hand fragment as depicted below. Onto the carboxyl group, any number of nucleophilic (preferably, amine containing) right hand fragments (pre-synthesized) may be condensed onto the carboxyl group to provide an amide group with an R 2 right fragment as depicted below. Formation of the pre-synthesized groups to condense onto the amine and/or the carboxyl moiety of the pyrrolidine proceeds in a facile manner. Virtually any compound can be synthesized readily using this approach. The solid phase synthetic method can also be used and employs similar methods used in the solution phase synthesis, the major difference being that the hydroxyl group may be bound to a solid support as the other steps of the synthesis occur. The general synthetic methods are applicable to virtually all of the compounds of the present invention with facile modifications being made consistent with the state of chemical synthetic art as used directly or adapted from the specific teachings of the examples which follow. 109 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 Scheme I Solution Phase Synthesis of UML Derivatives According to the Present Invention OtBu!

Using these methods combinatorial compounds are created either by solution-phase synthesis or by producing compounds bound covalently to solid-phase particles. Once their moieties are identified they may be modified using appropriate groups (electrophilic and/or nucleophilic), and condensed onto linker groups to produce bifunctional compounds according to the present invention. Solid Phase Methods Solid Phase Methods rely on the teachings of Fruchtel, et al. 1996, A n g e w . C h e m . I n t. E d. Engl. 35, 17-42; which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein). Solid-phase synthesis makes it easier to conduct multistep reactions and to drive reactions to completion, because excess reagents can be added and then easily washed away after each reaction step. Another key factor in favor of solid-phase synthesis is that it makes it possible to use split synthesis, a technique developed in 1982. Split synthesis produces large support-bound libraries in which each solid-phase particle holds a single compound, or soluble libraries produced by cleavage of compounds from the solid support. For example in a split synthesis method if you have 3 compound addition steps with 10 compounds used at each step i.e. 10 containers for those compounds. This will generate IO 3 compounds. Also, if you consider all the reaction steps included in a synthesis 1 0 ,0 0 0 compounds made via a solid phase methods using a three-step chemistry may only require about 2 2 containers for the chemistry and about 6 6 liquid handling steps relative to the 10,000 containers and 30,000 liquid handling steps. When you combine these advantages of solid phase synthesis with split synthesis, a significant level of synergy is achieved. Solution Phase Methods Solution phase chemistry is favored by many for library construction due to the wider range of organic reactions available for solution-phase synthesis, the technology used traditionally by most synthetic organic chemists, and products in solution can be more easily identified in standard drug target assays and characterized. A problem for solution-phase 111 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 synthesis of one molecule at a time is the final purification that can be both expensive and slow. Chromatography is commonly a first resort since it usually works. In addition, the problems associated with solution chemistry are compounded when attempting to make tens of thousands of compounds to generate a library or a 'book' for a library. In the generation of libraries of compounds numerous methods have been devised resulting in the wide spread use of large libraries of chemicals to readily allow the discovery of potential drug candidates. The generation of chemical libraries that are free in solution is typically the goal of most of the pharmaceutical industry. This aim is due to the nature of many of the drug targets and the associated assays. Also the construction and utility of chemical libraries is typically facilitated but the generation of master plates of compounds in solution to form the basis of the chemical library. Thus the general advantages of the solid phase synthesis methods are typically not fully realized in the context of the current drug discovery efforts. The main reason for this is the interest not in binding of the compound to the drug target but to demonstrate that the activity of the drug target is altered, which typically requires compound free in solution. Further concerns with libraries of compounds on a solid phase arise from concerns of the potential influence of the linker and steric effects on the compounds bound to the solid phase. Thus methods for the discovery of compounds, which bind to target molecules is known in the art. Also, the optimization of the initially discovered compound is well known in the art where the affinity is improved by generation of a pool of related compound via a more selective combinatorial chemistry approach. The present invention provides a mechanism to overcome these problems in drug and small molecule discovery. Addition of the Ubiquitin Ligase Binding Moiety (ULM) At this point in the compound discovery path for the subject invention, the target protein-binding element of the compounds of the invention has been identified. These optimal binding molecules are then subjected to further chemistry to add the ubiquitin ligase binding moiety (ULM), pursuant to the disclosure of the present application. 112 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 An alternative approach to the discovery of the target protein-binding moiety is based on solution phase screening. In such an example compounds (available either via synthesis, natural products or from companies such as obtained and added to the target protein of interest and then subjected to size exclusion to remove the unbound compounds. The protein bound fraction is then subjected to GC/MS to identify the molecules. In this way the solution phase screening is made rapid and facile for compounds in solution.. There are numerous additional ways to determine ligand binding, including, for example, detecting changes in the Tm of the protein upon the ligand binding, among others. Screening for Target Protein Binding Elements Initially a target protein is selected, for example, an enzyme or protein involved in a particular biological process. Target protein for the subject invention come from numerous fields where small molecules are used to achieve modulation of a biological system in eukaryotic organisms. Examples of such fields are antivirals, antimicrobials, anti-parasitics, or other drug targets in a human patient, which may be rather diverse, etc. The target protein is then either purified from a natural source in order to provide sufficient material for the screen or expressed via recombinant methods to provide sufficient material for the screens. The target protein is then either labeled directly with a detectable species such as a radioactive, electrochemiluminescent, and chemiluminescent or fluorescent label or with an indirectly detectable species such as an enzyme, or particle. Alternatively an antibody or equivalent with binding activity to the target protein is labeled. The next step is to provide a library of compounds for screening. A library of from 1,000 to 1,000,000 is typical of the size that is screened. These are available from a series of companies, which are well known in the art. These libraries of compounds are used to screen for the binding of the target protein. Ideally compounds are bought still bound to the solid phase or are screened for binding directly to immobilized target protein using methods as described below for screening. 113 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 It is also possible to generate a chemical library of various potential binding molecules bound to a solid phase following conventional methods to give rise to differing potential compounds. The optimal methods for the construction of the chemical library is to employ the methods of split synthesis coupled to the solid phase (as outlined above). The library is generated using a series of solid phase chemistries such as to give rise to various compilations that form the basis of a library. The library is screened in the form of a library or in the form of the compilations. Typically one would take the products from the split synthesis and pool the solid phase and use this as the basis for the screen. To the pool of beads used as the solid phase for the synthesis, a mixture of buffer, detergents, salts and blocking agents such as serum albumin or other proteins are added. This buffer addition step is used to block the beads or solid phase in such a way that any significant non-specific binding of the selected target protein does not occur. Following this blocking step the beads are washed and followed by the addition of the target protein either labeled or not. The beads or solid phase are then incubated to allow the binding of the target protein binding elements to the target protein. Following the incubation of the target molecule to the beads or solid phase the beads are washed and then the binding of the labeled target protein detected directly. In an alternative format, if the target protein is labeled with an indirectly detectable label such as an enzyme, the beads are then placed in to a substrate reaction solution to detect the presence of the enzyme label. In the case of an enzyme label, substrates for these detection methods are based on insoluble chromogenic products. In the case where the target protein is not labeled and an antibody or equivalent is available, the beads are subjected to another binding reaction where the antibody or equivalent, is labeled either directly or indirectly as suggested for the labeling of the target protein. It is also possible at this step to not use a labeled antibody or equivalent and to add a further step where the labeled antibody or equivalent is used. These additional steps can be detected using the same standard methods known in the art as suggested for the directly labeled target protein. Following these steps a series of beads are identified and these beads are selected from the bead population and subject to analysis to determine the structure of the binding molecule that is able to bind the target protein as in this example. This is achieved by the use of GC/MS or via molecular tags used during the construction of the library as described earlier. Alternatively, a pool which was positive is re-made generating a series of sub pools 114 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 for screening and further re-synthesis and dividing out of the various pooled compounds until a single compound is presented in a single well for analysis allowing the determination o f the active compound. This method can be repeated and/or adapted for identifying peptide target binding moieties (PTM) for virtually any target protein. Screening for Binding Molecules from Chemical Libraries The step of screening for specific molecules is made easy in the invention as only binding activity is desired and not specific modulation of the target protein as is required in traditional drug discovery. One can buy a library of compounds for screening. A library of from 1,000 to 1,000,000 is typical of the size that might be screened. These are available from a number o f companies. These libraries of compounds are used to screen for the binding of the target protein. Ideally, compounds are purchased still bound to the solid phase or are screened for binding directly to immobilized target protein using methods as described below for screening. It is also possible to generate a library of from 1,000 to 100,000 compounds contained on a solid phase using split synthesis methods as described earlier. The library may be constructed using a series of chemical methods resulting in pools of the solid phase used during synthesis, which form the basis of the entries which make up the library. In addition at the final chemical coupling step used to construct the various entries the solid phase pools are stored in sub-pools in the libraries. These so called entries and sub-pools form the basis for screening as they contain not only pools of compounds but also a known chemical-coupling step used in synthesis. The library can then be screened using two approaches. In both cases the solid phase from the chemical library to be screened is subjected incubation with assay buffers with blocking agents such as for example; proteins (i.e. BSA, gelatin), polyvinylpyrrolidone, ficoll, heparin, detergents (i.e. SDS, Tween, NP40, Triton X-100). This incubation step is to block the non-specific binding sites on the solid phase used in the generation of the library and 115 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 allow the determination of specific binding events. This initial incubation is an art recognized step in various binding assays such as ELISA, southerns, westerns etc. Following this incubation with blocking agents the protein of interest is then added to a buffer which typically has the same composition as that during the blocking step but can also be modified using lower or no additional blocking agents with the exception of the detergents which are typically always present during a binding reaction. In one of the screening methods the entries following the blocking step are then subjected to binding with the purified target protein. The solid phase from this incubation is then washed and subjected to a second binding step with a labeled reagent which binds to the tag sequence added to the receptor sub-unit during the recombinant engineering for the expression of the receptor sub-unit. Typically an antibody to this tag recognizes the tag sequence; examples that are in common use are the myc, flag, arid his epitopes. Following the incubation with the tag specific binding species the presence of the labeled binding species is detected by the presence of the label that is typically an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or peroxidase. The detection step typically makes use of an insoluble chromogenic substrate that is readily detected by eye or by image analysis systems. In an alternative method soluble substrates can also be used and screened using ELISA plate readers, eye or other spectrophotometric methods. In its simplest form the various entries from the library are screened by eye to look for beads that have developed a color due to the enzymatic action on the chromogenic substrate. These colored beads indicate that the receptor subunit is binding to one of the compounds within the group of entries the next step is to determine if these so called positive group of entries contain specific binding or if binding is just to the tag binding reagent or some non-specific activation of the chromogenic substrate. To achieve this, the positive entries are screened with out the specific binding step to the receptor sub-unit. If these positive entries now become negative or show significantly reduced signals interms of positive solid phases with in the mixture then these are considered to be real positive hits in the screen. These real positive entries are then subjected to re-synthesis. In this re-synthesis the initial chemical steps to create the specific binding molecule is unknown only the last chemical coupling step in the compound synthesis is know, as this formed the last chemical step which constructed the group of entries. During the re-synthesis of the positive chapter the chemical step prior to the last chemical coupling is carried out as in the initial synthesis but the solid phase is not pooled and split for the final 116 WO 2013/106643PCT/US2013/021136 chemical coupling but are maintained as separate pools then subjected to the chemical coupling step know for that chapter. This resynthesis results in the formation of a new series of solid phase compound pools which have the last two chemical coupling steps known. This new series of solid phase compound pools are screened as in the initial screen and positive pools are checked as previously for the binding specificity to identity positive pools. The positive pool(s) now allow the re-synthesis of the pool(s) with the last two steps for the generation of the compound, which specifically binds to the receptor subunit. The positive pools are then subjected to the same cycle of re-synthesis and screening as just described but with the last two chemical coupling steps know the pools are maintained individually prior to the last know step. In this way the synthesis of the specific compound able to bind to the receptor sub-unit is deconvoluted from the chemical library and identified. In an alternative method the positive solid phase is removed from the screen and collected. These are then subjected to the cleavage reaction, which removed the specific chemistry from the solid phase followed by the analysis of the various chemical species using GC to separate the individual compounds followed by MS to determine the molecular weight. This information coupled with the synthesis methods used is used to determine the compound identity. After the determination of these various candidate specific binding molecules they are then re-synthesized and subjected to the binding assay to check if these are the specific compounds that resulted in the positive solid phases. Screening of the Ubiquitin Ligase Binding Moiety This screening effort following methods and protocols known in the art allows the identification of compounds according to the present invention that bind to ubiquitin ligase. These compounds, already identified here, form the basis for the development of compounds of the invention. These compounds are then subjected to further chemistry based on the use of the linker group used in the development of the solid phase chemistry. To this linker group the various ubiquitin ligase binding moieties and/or protein binding moieties are added, generally through condensation reactions or other reactions to couple a ligand to a ubiquitin ligase binding moiety or a protein binding moiety. These reactions are well known in the art. Derivatization of linker groups is well-known in the art and can consist of providing a nucleophilic group (e.g., an alcohol, amine, thiol or other nucleophilic group) or an electrophilic group (e.g., ester, carboxylic acid, acyl halide, halogen, etc.) at either or both 117 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 ends of the linker group which may be used to condense an appropriately modified ULM group and/or PTM group onto the linker to produce a covalent bond. This final step of chemistry generates the compounds of the invention. The compounds of the invention are then subject to analysis to determine which of the compounds from the chemical library screen with which of the individual ubiquitin ligase binding moiety element is able to function most effectively in the targeted ubiquitination and/or degradation of the target protein. The ubiquitin ligase binding moiety may be determined by the methods as otherwise described in the examples section hereinbelow. In addition, the compounds of the invention can be tested in a mammalian tissue culture system where the target protein either intact or as an engineered fragment is expressed. In such a mammalian tissue culture system, the compounds effect on the target protein's level is determined by making use of the tag sequence which can be engineered into the recombinant expression of the target protein during the construction of the mammalian tissue culture test system. The tag sequence is used to determine the levels of the target protein during the incubation with the potential compounds screened and synthesized as described above. This assay for the tag sequence can take the form of a western blot or via an ELISA, for example. Other tags, which are valuable to use are those based on the green fluorescent protein, which allows the analysis of protein levels in living cells and/or organisms. The compounds that show the optimal activity in the test systems will then form the basis for the next stage of drug development. In this next stage these selected compounds are subjected to the recognized drug development path. The drug development path determines the potential value of the compounds by evaluating a series of factors including bioavailability; toxicology, pharmacology and efficacy in animal models before the compounds are considered for human testing. Protein Level Control This invention also relates to a method for the control of protein levels with a cell. This is based on the use of compounds of the invention, which are known to interact with a specific target protein such that degradation of a target protein in v iv o will result in the control of the amount of protein in a biological system, prerferably to a particular therapeutic benefit. 118 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 The following examples are used to assist in describing the present invention, but should not be seen as limiting the present invention in any way. Examples First Set The inventors initially hypothesized that small molecule inhibitors of the VHL/HIF- Ia interaction could be rationally designed using hydroxyproline (Hyp) as a starting point, since residue Hyp564 on HIF-Ia makes key interactions with VHL 14 and is crucial for HIF- Ia binding1 5 . The inventors used the de-novo design software BOMB to guide the selection of plausible hydroxyproline analogs . 1 6 1 and 2 were synthesized to test a promising design featuring an isoxazole moiety positioned to interact with a crystallographic water observed in the structure o f YHL bound to the HIF peptide (549-582)1 4 and a benzyl group stacked along the side chain of Tyr98. Their ability to bind to VHL was measured by the competition o f a fluorescent HIF-Ia peptide using fluorescence polarization (FP ) were able to displace the fluorescent peptide albeit at high concentrations (Table I A). While the smaller 3 was unable to fully displace the fluorescent peptide, the observed binding to VHL through the use of WaterLOGSY and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR. As no binding was observed with hydroxyproline alone, this suggested that the inventors identified a minimal pharmacophore (see Figure 2). Table I A. Binding of Initial Ligands to VHL OH NHR R IC 50 ( ) 3 SEM () I*,117 1 0 2 *^0 1 2 0 .1 7.1 3 CH 3 >250 N/A a Average ICso values were determined from three independent trials, each in triplicate. Encouraged by these initial results, the inventors sought to increase the affinity of our VHL ligands by modifying the benzylamine moiety of I while maintaining the methyl- isoxazole fragment. In order to generate analogs rapidly, we developed a solid phase 119 WO 2013/106643 PCT/US2013/021136 synthesis that involved the attachment of Fmoc-Hyp-OAllyl to Wang resin . 18 Fmoc deprotection, coupling with 3-methyl-5-isoxazoleacetic acid followed by allyl ester deprotection and coupling with various amines and subsequent cleavage with trifluoroacetic acid led to the rapid generation of VHL ligands (Scheme I ) . 19'20 These ligands were then tested for their ability to bind VHL using the HIF peptide FP displacement assay. Incorporation of various halogenated benzylamines showed that para substitution yielded the highest affinity and that there were only slight differences of affinity between chlorides and bromides, although the corresponding fluoride was less potent. We also found that substitution with electron withdrawing groups such as esters, nitro groups, nitriles, and ketones led to more potent ligands than substitution with the electron donating methoxy and /-butyl substituents. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that Argl 07 is flexible and could accommodate bulkier groups at the para position. Therefore, we considered larger heterocyclic substituents at the para position of the benzylamine moiety and synthesized 15, which was found to bind with a 4.1 IC 5 0 value (Table 2, below). Fluorescence Polarization Assay Ability of VHL ligands to compete for the H IFla binding site on VCB was determined through a fluorescence polarization competition assay as described in the literature (Buckley et al. JACS, 2012,134,4465^1468).
