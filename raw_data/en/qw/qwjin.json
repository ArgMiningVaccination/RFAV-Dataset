But this myth bust might make you rethink your next detox. Myth: \"I need to detox my body with a juice cleanse or detox diet.\" Fact: Your liver and kidneys are already working hard to detoxify your body daily. There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that juice cleanses or detox diets are necessary or effective for cleansing your body of toxins.

Detox diets could limit you from getting the nutrients your body needs daily. Have you ever tried a detox or cleanse that worked? Tell us about it "}
