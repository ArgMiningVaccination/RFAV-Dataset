Thus, 32 CFR 191.1 refers to title 32, part 191, section 1. ---------------------------- [[Page v]] EXPLANATION The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows: Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1 Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1 Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1 The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume. LEGAL STATUS The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule. To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2004), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. [[Page vi]] Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. OBSOLETE PROVISIONS Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949- 1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume. An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within that volume. The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register. A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles. REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

For purposes of this part, such term does not include any individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser and whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents such individual from performing the duties of the job in question, or whose employment, by reason of such current alcohol or drug abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or to the safety of others. As used in this paragraph: (a) Physical or mental impairment.

Specific guidance on off-base housing and fair housing enforcement is as follows: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Copies of all DoD issuances listed in this part may be obtained, at cost, from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) National Housing Policy. Federal law prohibits discrimination in housing in the United States against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, handicap, or familial status. (1) Title VIII of P.L. 90-284 contains the following: (i) The fair housing provisions. (ii) Outlines the responsibilities of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with regard to Public Law 90-284. (iii) Requires all Executive Departments and Agencies to administer housing and urban development programs and activities under their jurisdiction in a manner that shall reflect ``affirmatively'' the furthering of title VIII. (2) Title IX of Public Law 90-284 makes it a crime to intimidate willfully or interfere with any person by force or threat because of that person's activities in support of fair housing. (3) Title 42 U.S.C. 1982 prohibits discrimination in housing in the United States. This statute protects DoD personnel. (4) Public Law 100-430 amends title VIII of Public Law 90-284 by revising the procedures for the enforcement of fair housing requirements and adding protected classes of individuals. (5) Title VIII of Public Law 90-284, as amended by Public Law 100- 430, does not limit the applicability of any reasonable local, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. Additionally, provisions of such title VIII regarding familial status do not apply with respect to housing intended for, and solely occupied by, persons 62 years of age or older or intended and operated for occupancy, but at least one person 55 years of age or older. For guidance regarding housing occupied by those 55 years of age or older, use the statutory provision at section 805 b(2)(c), 102 Stat. 1623, of Public Law 100-430. (b) DoD Fair Housing Policy. The Department of Defense intends that Federal fair housing law shall be supported and that DoD personnel shall have equal opportunity for available housing regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, handicap, or familial status. (1) That policy includes the objective of eliminating discrimination against DoD personnel in off-base housing. That objective is not achieved simply by finding a place to live in a particular part of town or in a particular facility for a specific person. (2) The intent is achieved when a person meeting the ordinary standards of character and financial responsibility is able to obtain off-base housing equally as any other person anywhere in the area surrounding a military installation, without suffering discrimination based on race, color, religion, [[Page 21]] sex, age, national origin, handicap or familial status. (i) The accomplishment of this objective shall not be hampered by requiring the submission of a formal complaint of discrimination. A suspected discriminatory act, with or without the filing of a formal complaint, is a valid basis for investigation and, if discrimination is substantiated, imposition of restrictive sanctions. (ii) On substantiation that an agent practiced discrimination, restrictive sanctions shall be imposed for a minimum of 180 days. (iii) The fact that Public Law 90-284, 42 U.S.C. 1982, and Public Law 100-430 may or may not provide a remedy in a given case of discrimination affecting DoD personnel does not relieve a commander of the responsibility to ensure equal treatment and equal opportunity for such personnel or to impose restrictive sanctions against the agent and/ or facility, when appropriate. (iv) Military installations shall develop information programs to apprise Service members of the DoD policy and program for equal opportunity in off-base housing. Commanders should use local community resources, such as civil rights organizations, religious and service groups, and local information media, in support of their programs. [55 FR 6248, Feb. 22, 1990. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 32964, July 18, 1991] Sec. 192.5 Responsibilities. The Secretaries of the Military Departments shall: (a) Ensure nondiscrimination in referring DoD personnel to off-base housing facilities. (b) Continue efforts (as described in DoD 4165.63-M \\2\\ to identify and solicit nondiscriminatory assurances for housing facilities within the commuting area, which are considered to be suitable for occupancy by Service members. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 192.4. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (c) Ensure that an office and staff required by DoD 4165.63-M are available in conjunction with the cognizant staff judge advocate or other legal authority to advise Service members on the following: (1) The procedures in this part. (2) The application of Public Law 90-284, 42 U.S.C. 1982, and Public Law 100-430 in specific situations. (3) The rights of individuals to pursue remedies through civilian channels, without recourse and in addition to the procedures prescribed in this part, including the right to: (i) Make a complaint directly to the Department of HUD and/or to the Department of Justice (DoJ) in the United States. (ii) Bring a private civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. (d) Periodically review off-base housing procedures and policies to ensure effectiveness and compliance with this part. (Appendix A to this part is a checklist to help commanders with this review.) (e) Cooperate with other Government Agencies investigating housing discrimination complaints filed by Service members. (f) Ensure that each Military Service reports any housing discrimination cases and their results in the Annual Military Equal Opportunity Assessment Report required by DoD Instruction 1350.3. [55 FR 6248, Feb. 22, 1990. Redesignated and 56 FR 32964, July 18, 1991] Sec. 192.6 Procedures.

(b) The complaint and investigative report required in section B., appendix B to this part is exempt from formal approval and licensing under DoD 7750.5-M.\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 192.4. [55 FR 6248, Feb. 22, 1990. Redesignated 56 FR 32965, July 18, 1991] Appendix A to Part 192--Checklist for Commanders A. Are all assigned personnel informed of the Equal Opportunity in Off-Base Housing Program requirements before obtaining housing off base? B. Is there an effective information program ensuring equal opportunity in off-base housing information program? [[Page 22]] C. Are community resources being used to support the equal opportunity in off-base housing information program? D. Are housing discrimination complaints being processed within the required time? E. Are complainants being informed in writing of the results of housing discrimination inquiry and/or investigating actions? F. Are housing surveys being conducted periodically to obtain new listings? G. Are restrictive sanctions being imposed immediately for a minimum of 180 days on agents found to be practicing discrimination? H. Are the services of command representatives provided to assist applicants in their search for housing? I. Are HHS personnel and equal opportunity personnel aware of and sensitive to housing problems encountered by DoD personnel? J. Are equal opportunity in off-base housing reports being submitted accurately and on time? Appendix B to Part 192--Procedures and Reports A. Off-Base Housing Procedures DoD personnel seeking off-base housing shall be processed as follows: 1. Seen by an HRS when available (optional for DoD civilian personnel). 2. Provided assistance in seeking temporary and permanent off-base housing, as follows: a. Counseling on the equal opportunity in off-base housing program with particular emphasis placed on reporting any indication of discrimination against DoD personnel in their search for housing. b. Counseling and personal assistance shall include the following services: (1) Offering to check by telephone the availability of selected listings. A record shall be made and retained for future reference of the date, time, and nature of any conversation confirming the availability of a facility. The race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or familial status of the applicant shall not be divulged. Caution must be exercised to ensure that a pattern of ``confirmation only for minorities'' does not develop. (2) Offering the services of a command representative (such as a unit sponsor or other designated person, when available) to accompany and assist the applicant in the search for housing. (3) Explaining various discriminatory methods that may be employed by agents. For instance, an agent may arbitrarily refuse to accept or consider the applicant as a tenant, falsely indicate the unit sought has been rented to another applicant, or refuse to make the unit available under the same terms and conditions as are ordinarily applied to applicants for the facilities. In such instances the following shall apply: (a) The agent shall be queried on the reasons why the unit is not available. After all reasonable steps have been taken to ascertain whether any valid nondiscriminatory reason can be shown for the agent's rejection of the applicant, and if there appears to be no such reason, a reasonable effort shall be made to persuade the agent to make the unit available to the applicant. (b) The incident shall be reported immediately by the command representative and the applicant to the HRS for appropriate command action. B. Complaint Procedures--United States Commanders shall ensure that all DoD personnel are informed of the scope and provisions of the DoD Equal Opportunity in Off-Base Housing Program and advised to report immediately to the HRS (when available) any form of discrimination encountered when seeking housing within a Civilian Community. Incidents should be reported to base agencies or command representatives when an HRS is not available (i.e., equal opportunity officer, unit commander, supervisor). A verbal or written statement of discriminatory policy by an agent is considered to be an act or incident of discrimination, and the investigative procedures outlined in this appendix shall be followed. 1. Inquiry into Complaint. Complaints of off-base housing discrimination must receive prompt attention. An inquiry into the complaint shall begin within 3 working days after receipt of the complaint. The inquiry may be informal, but must be detailed sufficiently to determine if discrimination occurred. Upon receipt of a discrimination complaint, the HRS (if there is no HRS, a command designated representative) shall take the following action: a. Immediately notify the commander. b. Promptly interview the complainant to determine the details and circumstances of the alleged discriminatory act. c. Immediately telephone or visit the facility and/or agent concerned, if the complaint is received shortly after the time of the alleged act and it concerns the change in availability of a vacancy (i.e., ``just rented,'' etc.). Attempt to determine if a vacancy exists without making reference to the complaint received. Request the commander to authorize the use of verifiers, as necessary. (See this appendix, subsection B.2.) d. Advise the complainant of the provisions and procedures in this Instruction and of the right to pursue further actions through HUD, DoJ, and local or State agencies. Coordinate efforts with the Office of Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel to determine [[Page 23]] to what extent legal assistance can be provided to the complainant. Assist the complainant in completing seven signed, dated, and notarized copies of HUD Form 903, ``Housing Discrimination Complaint.'' The fact that a complainant might report an act of alleged discriminatory treatment, but declines completing a HUD Form 903, does not relieve the command of responsibility for making further inquiry and taking such subsequent actions, as may be appropriate. e. Document the complainant's action for future reference and inform the commander of the results of the HRS preliminary inquiry and actions taken. The commander shall take action to assist the complainant in obtaining suitable housing. If, due to previous discriminatory practices in the community, suitable housing cannot be obtained by the complainant in a reasonable amount of time, the complainant and the commander may use this fact to justify a request for priority in obtaining military housing or for humanitarian reassignment. Reassignment action is a last resort and must be justified fully through command personnel channels. 2. Use of Verifiers. Verifiers are authorized to determine if a vacancy exists and whether or not rental or such practices are discriminatory. Verifiers shall not be used only for determining sincerity or normal practices of an agent about whom the HRS has not received a housing discrimination complaint. a. When selecting and using verifiers, the following applies: (1) Verification of the vacancy shall be made expediently after alleged act of discrimination. (2) Verifiers may be volunteers. (The equal opportunity office is a possible source for identifying individuals to be used as verifiers.) (3) The purpose of verification is to isolate the attribute of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, or familial status that is the suspected basis for the alleged discrimination against the complainant. Except for those attributes that are considered to be the source of the discrimination complaint, the verifier should possess attributes that are similar to the complainant. If two verifiers are used, one may possess similar attributes to the complainant. Ideally, two verifiers should be used. b. Instructions provided to the verifiers by HRS personnel should include the following: (1) Explanation of the equal opportunity in off-base housing and off-base housing referral programs. (2) Verifiers are to obtain information only on agent and/or facility operating policies, practices, and procedures for subsequent determination of complaint validity. (3) Verifiers are not to make a verbal or written contract for the housing unit, pay any money, or say they want the housing unit. (4) Verifiers shall be knowledgeable concerning family composition, pets, and housing requirements of the complainant; they shall ask for identical housing requirements. (5) The following information shall be obtained by the verifier, if possible: (a) Concerning the Facility. What is available? Does it meet the requirements of the complainant? Amount of rent or cost of facility? Deposit required? Is an application required? What is the time between filing an application and permission to move in? Are there minority families and/or singles in the facility? Make a note of the presence or absence of a vacancy sign, and any other information deemed appropriate. (b) Concerning the Prospective Tenants/Purchasers. If possible, ascertain criteria and qualifications that must be met (credit rating, salary, marital status, deposit, written application, etc.) and obtain a complete description of all procedures for becoming a tenant/purchaser including all steps from initial inquiry to moving in. Does the agent's subjective impression of the applicant appear to play any part in the decision to rent the unit? (6) The verifier's statement shall be completed immediately after the verification visit, if possible. It shall be accurate, objective, and factual. Include the following in the statement: (a) Date, time of visit, persons contacted, positions of persons contacted. Include any other pertinent information obtained during visit; i.e., length of time employed at facility, in addition to the information in this appendix, subparagraph B.2.b.(5), above.

(c) Sign and date statement. Give full name, address, telephone number (duty or home), race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap or familial status, as relevant to the complaint. 3. Complaint Process. If the basic facts of the HRS preliminary inquiry appear to substantiate the complaint, the commander shall ensure that the following actions begin within 3 working days of receipt of the inquiry report: a. Informal Hearing. Give written notice to the agent explaining the nature of the complaint and the agent's right to request an informal hearing with the commander. The notification shall state specifically the nature of the discrimination complaint and the right of the agent to appear personally at the hearing, to be represented by an attorney, to present evidence, and to call witnesses. The notification also shall state that the agent has 5 days after receipt of the written notice to request a hearing. If no request [[Page 24]] is received within 5 days, the lack of response shall be considered as a waiver of the right to such hearing. The written notification either shall be delivered to the agent personally by a representative of the commander, or shall be sent to the agent by certified mail with return receipt requested. (1) Composition of an Informal Hearing. The informal hearing shall be conducted by the commander or designee at a convenient location. The agent, agent's attorney, the complainant, the complainant's attorney, the equal opportunity officer, the HRS, the Staff Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel, or other designated persons may attend. (2) Record of Hearing. A summary of the hearing shall be made a part of the complaint file. b. Legal Review. A legal review shall be accomplished following the inquiry and informal hearing (if applicable) and before the commander's final decision that the inquiry supports or fails to support the complaint. The summary and other pertinent documents shall be reviewed for content and completeness. A statement that such a review was conducted and signed by the Staff Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel performing the review shall be made a part of the case file. That statement shall include: (1) Any necessary explanatory remarks, including comments on the facts and evidence presented. (2) Information known about pending complaints brought by other parties on the same facility and/or agent. (3) Comments on the civil rights laws relevant to the particular case. 4. Commander's Decision. The responsibility for imposition of restrictive sanctions rests with the commander and cannot be delegated. The commander's decision shall be based on a full and impartial review of all facts and the policies and requirements as stated in this part. The commander's options include the following: a. If the commander determines that more information is required, or for any reason further inquiry is deemed necessary, an officer shall be appointed from sources other than the HRS to conduct a formal inquiry or investigation, as the situation warrants. The officer, if not an attorney, shall be afforded the advice and assistance of a Staff Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel. b. If, in the commander's judgment, the inquiry or investigation fails to support the complaint the case shall be considered closed and the commander shall: (1) Inform the complainant in writing of all actions taken and advise the complainant of rights to pursue further actions to include the following: (a) The right to submit a complaint to the HUD and the DoJ. (b) The right to bring a private civil action in a State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction. (c) The availability of legal assistance from their local Staff Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel in pursuing civil redress. (2) Summarize in the report file the practices giving rise to the complaint, the actions and results of the inquiry or investigation, and if discriminatory practices were found, written assurances from the agent on future facility and/or agent practices. The following statement, completed by the complainant, shall be included, as part of the case file: ``I am (am not) satisfied with the efforts taken by the commander on my behalf to achieve satisfactory resolution of my off-base housing discrimination complaint.'' If the complainant indicates a lack of satisfaction, the reasons must be included in the case file. (3) Inform the agent of the results of the inquiry by command correspondence if an informal hearing was held. Such correspondence should reiterate DoD policy and requirements for equal opportunity in off-base housing. (4) Forward unsubstantiated complaint reports and HUD Form 903 to the HUD and the DoJ if requested by the complainant. (5) Retain a copy of the report file for 2 years for future reference. c. If the inquiry or investigation supports the complainant's charge of discrimination and the discriminatory act is determined by the commander to conflict with DoD policy, the commander shall: (1) Impose restrictive sanctions against the agent and/or facility for a minimum of 180 days. Sanctions shall remain in effect until the requirements in this appendix, subparagraphs B.6.a.(1) or B.6.a.(2), below, are met. Restrictive sanctions shall be imposed when a suspected discriminatory act, despite the absence of a formal complaint, is investigated and found valid. The fact that a validated discrimination complaint and/or incident has been or is scheduled to be forwarded to another Agency (the HUD, the DoJ, etc.) is not cause for withholding sanction action pending the outcome of that Agency's further review or investigation. When imposing a restrictive sanction, the commander shall: (a) Remove the facility listing(s) from HRO files. (b) Impose restrictive sanctions against all facilities owned or operated by the agent concerned. (c) Place the facility on the restrictive sanction list maintained by the HRS. The restrictive sanction list shall be prepared on official letterhead stationery, signed by the commander, and include the authority for and conditions of the restrictive sanctions. (d) Inform the agent concerned by command correspondence that: [[Page 25]] (1) Restrictive sanctions have been imposed. (2) The reasons, nature, and minimum duration of the restrictions. (3) The action required for the removal of sanctions at the conclusion of the minimum period. The notification of restrictive sanctions shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested or delivered to the agent personally by a command representative. (e) Provide all DoD personnel reporting to the HRS with a copy of the restrictive sanction list, and advise members of the Armed Forces that they may not rent, lease, purchase, or reside in any of the listed facilities. Obtain a signed acknowledgment of receipt of the restrictive sanction list from the HRS using a DD Form 1746, ``Application for Assignment to Housing.'' (f) Advise other military installations of the restrictive sanction action taken when the sanctioned facility is located within the commuting area of their military installations. (2) Inform the complainant in writing of all actions taken and advise the complainant that his or her case will receive continuing action to include, if the complainant requests, forwarding the case file to the HUD and/or the DoJ for action. (3) Before forwarding the report to the respective Military Department, prepare a memorandum outlining the following: (a) The base efforts made to obtain housing relief for the complainant. (b) The impact of restrictive sanctions on the off-base housing program and DoD personnel and their dependents. (c) Any other considerations deemed relevant. (4) Include a statement completed by the complainant for the case file. (See this appendix, subparagraph B.4.b.(3), above.) (5) If the act of discrimination falls within existing regulations, forward a copy of the complaint and investigation report directly to the HUD within 180 days after the occurrence of the alleged discriminating act, using HUD Form 903. The original report shall be sent to the appropriate HUD Regional Office or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, 451 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. A copy of the complaint and investigation report shall be forwarded to the Civil Rights Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. (6) When more than one complaint alleging discrimination in the same facility or by the same agent has been received, consolidate the complaints for the inquiry, legal review, and commander's memorandum. d. When a commander receives a complaint alleging further discrimination in a facility or by an agent after a completed case file has been closed, the commander shall forward the summary of the facts on the subsequent complaint, outlined in this enclosure, subparagraph B.4.c.(6), above. Include brief comments indicating the extent to which the new complaint affects the previous action. 5. Followup Actions. After forwarding the report and all required attachments to the HUD and the DoJ, the commander shall take the following actions: a. Cooperate with the HUD, the DoJ, and the local and State agency representatives during their investigation and processing of the case, should those entities seek assistance. b. Periodically determine the status of the case by maintaining liaison with the HUD office concerned. Contact shall be maintained until such time as the case is resolved by the HUD. c. Ensure that the complainant is kept informed directly by the HUD and/or the DoJ. d. Ensure that DoD personnel comply with the restrictive sanctions imposed on the facility and/or the agent. Housing personnel will comply with the following: (1) Military personnel moving into or changing their place of residence in the commuting area of a military installation or activity may not enter into a rental, purchase, or lease arrangement with an agent or a facility that is under restrictive sanction. (2) Implement procedures for ensuring that DoD personnel seeking housing are made aware of, and are counselled on, current restrictive sanctions. (3) Sanctions are not applicable to the DoD personnel who may be residing in a facility when the sanction is imposed or to the extension or renewal of a rental or lease agreement originally entered into before the imposition of the sanction. Relocation of a military tenant within a restricted facility is prohibited without the written approval of the commander. (4) If it is determined that a member of the Armed Forces has intentionally taken residency in a restricted facility contrary to instructions received by Housing Referal personnel, the commander shall take appropriate disciplinary action against that number. (5) Periodically publish a current listing of restricted facilities in the base bulletin (or other appropriate means of internal distribution). Minimally, such publication shall occur when there has been an addition or deletion to the list. 6. Removal of Restrictive Sanction a. A facility and/or agent may be removed from restrictive sanction only if one of the following actions is taken: [[Page 26]] (1) The restrictive sanction may be removed before completion of the 180 day restrictive period if an approved waiver request is obtained from the senior installation commander concerned, or designee. Consideration shall be given to lifting an imposed sanction only in exceptional circumstances and in conjunction with a written assurance of nondiscrimination from the agent concerned. (2) After completion of 180 days on restrictive sanction, if the agent provides written assurance of future nondiscrimination to the HRS. b. The commander shall inform the HRS, the equal opportunity office, and the agent in writing of the removal from restrictive sanction. 7. ``Privacy Act'' and ``Freedom of Information Act'' Inquiries. Requests for information from reports of housing discrimination shall be processed in accordance with 32 CFR parts 285 and 286a. C. Compliant Procedures--Outside the United States Commanders of installations or activities outside the United States shall ensure that all DoD personnel, on reporting to the HRS, are clearly informed of the scope and provisions of the DoD Equal Opportunity in Off-Base Housing Program and advised to report immediately to the HRS any form of discrimination encountered as a tenant, prospective tenant, or purchaser. Incidents reported to base agencies or representatives other than the HRS (i.e., equal opportunity officer, unit commander, supervisor) shall be brought to the immediate attention of the HRS for appropriate action. On receiving a complaint of discrimination, the commander and HRS shall: 1. Consult with the Staff Judge Advocate or other cognizant legal counsel to determine if the laws of the country concerned (or any subdivision thereof) prohibit any of the actions outlined in this appendix, section B., above. 2. Take actions outlined in this appendix, section B, above, except that a HUD Form 903 shall not be completed because reports of cases arising outside the United States are not forwarded to the HUD or the DoJ. Complainants should understand that the fair housing provisions of the P.L. 90-284, ``Civil Rights Act,'' Title 42, United States, 1982, and Public Law 100-430, ``Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,'' September 13, 1988, are not applicable in areas outside the United States. 3. Determine, with legal advice, whether redress for the discriminatory act should be sought from authorities in the host country. Redress shall be based on the laws of the country (or subdivision thereof) concerned. D. Reporting Requirements 1. A copy of each complaint and investigative report that substantiates a housing discrimination shall be submitted to the appropriate Military Department (manpower and reserve affairs and/or the equal opportunity office) not later than 45 days from the date the case is completed. Under normal circumstances, the commander of the installation concerned shall complete the required investigation and processing complaints within 45 days from the date that a housing complaint is filed by a complainant. 2. A copy of complaint and investigative reports that do not substantiate allegations of housing discrimination shall be kept on file at the installation level for a 24-month period beginning from the date the case was completed.

[29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17959, July 5, 1973. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 32965, July 18, 1991] Sec. 195.4 Policy. (a) General. No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program to which this (part) applies. (b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient under any program to which this part applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or national origin: (i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program; (ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program; (iii) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient may not make selections with the purpose of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this part applies, on the ground of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this part. (iv) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program; (v) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program; (vi) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or [[Page 30]] other benefit provided under the program; (vii) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program; (viii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program. (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin. (3) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance. (4)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination. (ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin. (5) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but nevertheless discrimination on the grounds of race, color or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this Directive tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin of the intended beneficiaries, to exclude intended beneficiaries from participation in, to deny them benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this Directive applies, the recipient or other persons subject to this Directive are prohibited from (directly or through contractual or other arrangements) subjecting an individual to discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising; employment, layoff or termination; upgrading, demotion or transfer; rates of pay and/or other forms of compensation; and use of facilities), to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of the beneficiaries. Any action taken by a component pursuant to this provision with respect to a state or local agency subject to Standards for a Merit System of Personnel Administration, 45 CFR part 70, shall be consistent with those standards and shall be coordinated with the U.S. Civil Service Commission. (6) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section. [29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17959, July 5, 1973] Sec. 195.5 Responsibilities. (a) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower) shall be responsible for insuring that the policies of this part are effectuated throughout the Department of Defense. He may review from time to time as he deems necessary the implementation of these policies by the components of the Department of Defense. (b) The Secretary of each Military Department is responsible for implementing this part with respect to programs and activities receiving financial assistance from his Military Department; and the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower) is responsible for similarly implementing this part [[Page 31]] with respect to all other components of the Department of Defense. Each may designate official(s) to fulfill this responsibility in accordance with Sec. 195.2(b). (c) The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower) or, after consultation with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower), the Secretary of each Military Department or other responsible Department official designated by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower) may assign to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government, with the consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of Title VI of the Act and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in Sec. 195.11), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Department and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of Title VI and this part to similar programs and in similar situations. [29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 32965, July 18, 1991] Sec. 195.6 Assurances required. (a) General. (1)(i) Every application for Federal financial assistance to carry out a program to which this part applies, except a program to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. (ii) In the case where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services and benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. In any case in which Federal financial assistance is extended without an application having been made, such extension shall be subject to the same assurances as if an application had been made. The responsible Department official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances for each program, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subguarantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants in the program. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement. (2) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interest therein, which was acquired through a program of Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer, shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved under a program of Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible Department official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the program under which the real property [[Page 32]] is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In the event a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the responsible Department official may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective. In programs receiving Federal financial assistance in the form, or for the acquisition of real property or an interest in real property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under any such property are included as part of the program receiving such assistance, the nondiscrimination requirements of this part shall extend to any facility located wholly or in part in such space. (3) The assurance required in the case of a transfer of surplus personal property shall be inserted in a written agreement by and between the Department of Defense component concerned and the recipient. (b) Continuing State programs. Every application by a State agency to carry out a program involving continuing Federal financial assistance to which this part applies shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (1) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, and (2) provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the responsible Department official to give reasonable assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. In cases of continuing State programs in which applications are not made, the extension of Federal financial assistance shall be subject to the same conditions under this subsection as if applications had been made. (c) Assurances from institutions. (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education, the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students. (2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution unless the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the responsible Department official, that the institution's practices in designated parts or programs of the institution will in no way affect its practices in the program of the institution for which Federal financial assistance is sought, or the beneficiaries of or participants in such program. If in any such case the assistance sought is for the construction of a facility or part of a facility, the assurance shall in any event extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith. (d) Elementary and secondary schools. The requirement of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, with respect to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible official of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part, and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan; in any case of continuing Federal financial assistance the said Department officer may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may [[Page 33]] be specified by him, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purpose of the Act or this part within the earliest practicable time. In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of said order. [29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17960, July 5, 1973] Sec. 195.7 Compliance information. (a) Cooperation and assistance. Each responsible Department official shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part. (b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to the responsible Department official timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the responsible Department official may determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In general, recipients should have available for the Department racial and ethnic data showing the extent to which members of minority groups are beneficiaries of federally assisted programs. In the case of any program under which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations imposed pursuant to this part. (c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit access by the responsible Department official during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other institution or person and this institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information. (d) Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program under which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the responsible Department official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part. [29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17960, July 5, 1973] Sec. 195.8 Conduct of investigations. (a) Periodic compliance reviews. The responsible Department official or his designee(s) shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part. (b) Complaints. Any person who believes himself or any specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may by himself or by a representative file with the responsible Department official a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the responsible Department official. (c) Investigations. The responsible Department official will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination of whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part. (d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, the responsible Department official will so inform the [[Page 34]] recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided in Sec. 195.9. (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the responsible Department official will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing. (e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall not be disclosed except when necessary to carry out the purposes of this part including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder. [29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 38 FR 17960, July 5, 1974. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 32965, July 18, 1991] Sec. 195.9 Procedure for effecting compliance. (a) General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law as determined by the responsible Department official. Such other means may include, but are not limited to (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceedings under State or local law. (b) Noncompliance with Sec. 195.6. If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 195.6 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The component of the Department of Defense concerned shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that the component shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part. (c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section no order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible Department official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding, after opportunity for a hearing (as provided in Sec. 195.10), of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the action has been approved by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to Sec. 195.11, and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary of Defense has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found. (d) Other means authorized by law. No action to affect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible Department official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the action has been approved [[Page 35]] by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower), (3) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (4) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate. [29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 32965, July 18, 1991] Sec. 195.10 Hearings. (a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by Sec. 195.9, reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible Department official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and Sec. 195.11(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available. (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices of the responsible component of the Department of Defense in Washington, D.C., at a time fixed by the responsible Department official unless he determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the component requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the responsible Department official or, at his discretion, before a hearing examiner designated by him. (c) Hearing examiner. The examiner shall be a field grade officer or civilian employee above the grade of GS-12 (or the equivalent) who shall be a person admitted to practice law before a Federal court or the highest court of a State. (d) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the responsible component of the Department shall have the right to be represented by counsel.

Both the responsible Department official and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing. (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made. (f) Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more programs to which this part applies, or noncompliance with [[Page 36]] this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title VI of the Act, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower), the Secretary of a Military Department, or other responsible Department official designated by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower) after consultation with the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Manpower) may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of appropriate procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with Sec. 195.11. [29 FR 19291, Dec. 31, 1964, as amended at 30 FR 133, Jan. 7, 1965. Redesignated and amended at 56 FR 32965, July 18, 1991] Sec. 195.11 Decisions and notices. (a) Decision by person other than the responsible department official. If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner such hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the responsible Department official for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner the applicant or recipient may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the responsible Department official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible Department official may on his own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review the responsible Department official shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the responsible Department official. (b) Decisions on record or review by the responsible department official. Whenever a record is certified to the responsible Department official for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or whenever the responsible Department official conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the responsible Department official shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any. (c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to Sec. 195.10(a), a decision shall be made by the responsible Department official on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any. (d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing officer or responsible Department official shall set forth his ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply. (e) Approval by the Secretary of Defense. Any final decision of a responsible Department official which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Secretary of Defense, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed. (f) Contents of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, under the program involved, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance will thereafter be extended under such program to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in [[Page 37]] default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Department official that it will fully comply with this part. (g) Post-termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this part. (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible Department official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible Department official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility. (3) If the responsible Department official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Department official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this subsection are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

Action taken pursuant to section 602 of the Act is subject to judicial review as provided in section 603 of the Act. Sec. 195.13 Effect on other issuances. All issuances heretofore issued by any officer of the Department of Defense or its components which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this part applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance under such program for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of this part. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof): (a) Executive Orders 10925 and 11114 and issuances thereunder, (b) The ``Standards for a Merit System of Personnel Administration,'' issued jointly by the Secretaries of Defense, of Health, Education, and Welfare, and of Labor, 28 FR 734, or (c) Executive Order 11063 and issuances thereunder, or any other issuances, insofar as such Order or issuances prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this part is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.

Where the use of a counseling test or other instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument or its application. [[Page 50]] (c) Disproportion in classes.

(3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students. (4) Subject to Sec. 196.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity. (5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began. Sec. 196.450 Athletics. (a) General.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex. (d) Adjustment period. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services has delegated authority to the Assistant Secretary for Health, DHHS, to consult with the Secretary of Defense or a designee and to approve and issue joint regulations implementing 10 U.S.C. chapter 55. This delegation was effective April 19, 1976 (41 FR 18698, May 6, 1976). (iii) Department of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation has delegated authority to the Commandant, United States Coast Guard, to consult with the Secretary of Defense or a designee and to approve an issue joint regulations implementing 10 U.S.C., chapter 55. (iv) Office of CHAMPUS (OCHAMPUS). By DoD Directive 5105.46, OCHAMPUS was established as an OSD field activity under the policy guidance and direction of the ASD(HA). The Director, OCHAMPUS, is directed to execute the following responsibilities and functions: (A) Supervise and administer the programs and missions to: (1) Provide technical direction and guidance on organizational, administrative, and operational matters. (2) Conduct studies and research activities in the health care area to assist in formulating policy required to guide OCHAMPUS in carrying out its programs. (3) Enter into agreements through the Department of Defense with respect to the Military Departments or other U.S. Government entities, as required, for the effective performance of CHAMPUS. (4) Supervise and administer OCHAMPUS financial management activities to include: (i) Formulating budget estimates and justifications to be submitted to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Administration) (DASD(A)) for inclusion in the overall budget for the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

(C) Develop for issuance, subject to approval by the ASD(HA), such policies or regulations as required to administer and manage CHAMPUS effectively. (v) Evidence of eligibility. The Department of Defense, through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), is responsible for establishing and maintaining a listing of persons eligible to receive benefits under CHAMPUS. Identification cards or devices bearing information necessary for preliminary evidence of eligibility, subject to verification through the DEERS, shall be issued to eligible persons by the appropriate Uniformed Services (DoD 1341.1-M, ``Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) Program Manual''). (d) Medical benefits program. The CHAMPUS is a program of medical benefits provided by the U.S. Government under public law to specified categories of individuals who are qualified for these benefits by virtue of their relationship to one of the seven Uniformed Services. Although similar in structure in many of its aspects, CHAMPUS is not an insurance program in that it does not involve a contract guaranteeing the indemnification of an insured party against a specified loss in return for a premium paid. Further, CHAMPUS is not subject to those state regulatory bodies or agencies that control the insurance business generally. (e) Program funds. The funds used by CHAMPUS are appropriated funds furnished by the Congress through the annual appropriation acts for the Department of Defense and the DHHS. These funds are further disbursed by agents of the government under contracts negotiated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, under the provisions of the Federal Aquisition Regulation (FAR). These agents (referred to in this part as CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries) receive claims against CHAMPUS and adjudicate the claims under this part and in accordance with administrative procedures and instructions prescribed in their contracts. The funds expended for CHAMPUS benefits are federal funds provided CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries solely to pay CHAMPUS claims, and are not a part of or obtained from the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary's funds related to other programs or insurance coverage. CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries are reimbursed for the adjudication and payment of CHAMPUS claims at a rate (generally fixed-price) prescribed in their contracts. (f) Claims adjudication and processing. The Director, OCHAMPUS, is responsible for making such arrangements as are necessary to adjudicate and process CHAMPUS claims worldwide.

(ii) In-house. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is authorized to adjudicate and process certain CHAMPUS claims in-house at OCHAMPUS, when it is determined to be in the best interests of CHAMPUS subject to applicable considerations set forth in OMB Circular A-76. Such in-house claims processing may involve special or unique claims, or all claims for a specific geographic area. (2) Outside the United States--(i) Special subsidiary office or contracting out. For adjudicating and processing CHAMPUS claims for services or supplies provided outside the United States, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a [[Page 58]] designee, has the option of either setting up a special subsidiary claims paying operation (such as OCHAMPUSEUR) or contracting out as described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. Such claims paying operations are reviewed periodically to determine whether current arrangements continue to be appropriate and the most effective. (ii) Support agreements. In those situations outside the United States that demand special arrangements, the Director, OCHAMPUS, may enter into support agreements through the Department of Defense with any of the Military Departments or other government agency to process CHAMPUS claims in specific geographic locations. Such agreements may be negotiated for such period of time as the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may determine to be necessary to meet identified special demands. (g) Recommendations for change to part. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall establish procedures for receiving and processing recommendations for changes to this part from interested parties. (h) CHAMPUS, claims forms. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is responsible for the development and updating of all CHAMPUS claim forms and any other forms necessary in the administration of CHAMPUS. (i) The CHAMPUS handbook. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or shall develop the CHAMPUS, Handbook. The CHAMPUS Handbook is a general program guide for the use of CHAMPUS beneficiaries and providers and shall be updated, as required. (j) Program integrity. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall oversee all CHAMPUS personnel, fiscal intermediaries, providers, and beneficiaries to ensure compliance with this part. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall accomplish this by means of proper delegation of authority, separation of responsibilities, establishment of reports, performance evaluations, internal and external management and fiscal audits, personal or delegated reviews of CHAMPUS responsibilities, taking affidavits, exchange of information among state and Federal governmental agencies, insurers, providers and associations of providers, and such other means as may be appropriate. Compliance with law and this part shall include compliance with specific contracts and agreements, regardless of form, and general instructions, such as CHAMPUS policies, instructions, procedures, and criteria relating to CHAMPUS operation. (k) Role of CHAMPUS Health Benefits Advisor (HBA). The CHAMPUS HBA is appointed (generally by the commander of a Uniformed Services medical treatment facility) to serve as an advisor to patients and staff in matters involving CHAMPUS. The CHAMPUS HBA may assist beneficiaries or sponsors in applying for CHAMPUS benefits, in the preparation of claims, and in their relations with OCHAMPUS and CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries. However, the CHAMPUS HBA is not responsible for CHAMPUS policies and procedures and has no authority to make benefit determinations or obligate Government funds. Advice given to beneficiaries as to determination of benefits or level of payment is not binding on OCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries. (l) Cooperation and exchange of information with other Federal programs. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall disclose to appropriate officers or employees of the DHHS: (1) Investigation for fraud. The name and address of any physician or other individual actively being investigated for possible fraud in connection with CHAMPUS, and the nature of such suspected fraud. An active investigation exists when there is significant evidence supporting an initial complaint but there is need for further investigation. (2) Unnecessary services. The name and address of any provider of medical services, organization, or other person found, after consultation with an appropriate professional association or appropriate peer review body, to have provided unnecessary services. Such information will be released only for the purpose of conducting an investigation or prosecution, or for the administration of titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, provided that the information will be released only to the agency's enforcement branch and that [[Page 59]] the agency will preserve the confidentiality of the information received and will not disclose such information for other than program purposes. (m) Disclosure of information to the public. Records and information acquired in the administration of CHAMPUS are records of the Department of Defense and may be disclosed in accordance with DoD Directive 5400.7\\3\\, DoD 5400.7-R\\4\\, and DoD 5400.11-R\\5\\ (codified in 32 CFR parts 286 and 286a), constituting the applicable DoD Directives and DoD Regulations implementing the Freedom of Information and the Privacy Acts. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ See footnote 2 to Sec. 199.1(c)(2)(i) \\4\\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 199.1(c)(2)(i) \\5\\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 199.1(c)(2)(i) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (n) Discretionary authority. When it is determined to be in the best interest of CHAMPUS, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is granted discretionary authority to waive any requirements of this part, except that any requirement specifically set forth in 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, or otherwise imposed by law, may not be waived. It is the intent that such discretionay authority be used only under very unusual and limited circumstances and not to deny any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided to him or her by statute or this part. Any such exception granted by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall apply only to the individual circumstance or case involved and will in no way be construed to be precedent-setting. (o) Demonstration projects. (1) Authority. The Director, OCHAMPUS may waive or alter any requirements of this regulation in connection with the conduct of a demonstration project required or authorized by law except for any requirement that may not be waived or altered pursuant to 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, or other applicable law. (2) Procedures. At least 30 days prior to taking effect, OCHAMPUS shall publish a notice describing the demonstration project, the requirements of this regulation being waived or altered under paragraph (o)(1) of this section and the duration of the waiver or alteration. Consistent with the purpose and nature of demonstration projects, these notices are not covered by public comment practices under DoD Directive 5400.9 (32 CFR part 296) or DoD Instruction 6010.8. (3) Definition. For purposes of this section, a ``demonstration project'' is a project of limited duration designed to test a different method for the finance, delivery or administration of health care activities for the uniformed services. Demonstration projects may be required or authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1092, any other statutory provision requiring or authorizing a demonstration project or any other provision of law that authorizes the activity involved in the demonstration project.''. (p) Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program. The Secretary of Defense, or designee, may enter into an agreement (external or internal) providing for the sharing of resources between facilities of the uniformed services and facilities of a civilian health care provider or providers if the Secretary determines that such an agreement would result in the delivery of health care in a more effective, efficient or economical manner. This partnership allows CHAMPUS beneficiaries to receive inpatient and outpatient services through CHAMPUS from civilian personnel providing health care services in military treatment facilities and from uniformed service professional providers in civilian facilities. The policies and procedures by which partnership agreements may be executed are set forth in Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6010.12, ``Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program.'' The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue policies, instructions, procedures, guidelines, standards, or criteria as may be necessary to provide support for implementation of DoDI 6010.12, to promulgate and manage benefit and financial policy issues, and to develop a program evaluation process to ensure the Partnership Program accomplishes the purpose for which it was developed. (1) Partnership agreements. Military treatment facility commanders, based upon the authority provided by their representative Surgeons General of the military departments, are responsible for entering into individual partnership [[Page 60]] agreements only when they have determined specifically that use of the Partnership Program is more economical overall to the Government than referring the need for health care services to the civilian community under the normal operation of the CHAMPUS Program. All such agreements are subject to the review and approval of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, and the appropriate Surgeon General. (i) External Partnership Agreements. The external partnership agreement is an agreement between a military treatment facility Commander and a CHAMPUS-authorized institutional provider, enabling Uniformed Services health care personnel to provide otherwise covered medical care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries in a civilian facility. Authorized costs associated with the use of the facility will be financed through CHAMPUS under normal cost-sharing and reimbursement procedures currently applicable under the basic CHAMPUS. Savings will be realized under this type of agreement by using available military health care personnel to avoid the civilian professional provider charges which would otherwise be billed to CHAMPUS. (ii) Internal Partnership Agreements. The internal partnership agreement is an agreement between a military treatment facility commander and a CHAMPUS-authorized civilian health care provider which enables the use of civilian health care personnel or other resources to provide medical care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries on the premises of a military treatment facility. These internal agreements may be established when a military treatment facility is unable to provide sufficient health care services for CHAMPUS beneficiaries due to shortages of personnel and other required resources. In addition to allowing the military treatment facility to achieve maximum use of available facility space, the internal agreement will result in savings to the Government by using civilian medical specialists to provide inpatient care in Government-owned facilities, thereby avoiding the civilian facility charges which would have otherwise been billed to CHAMPUS. (2) Beneficiary Cost-Sharing. Beneficiary cost-sharing under the Partnership Program is outlined in Sec. 199.4(f)(5) of this part. (3) Reimbusement. Reimbursement under the Partnership Program is outlined in Sec. 199.14(f) of this part. (4) Beneficiary Eligibility and Authorized Providers. Existing requirements of this Regulation remain in effect as concerns beneficiary eligibility and authorized providers. (5) Range of Benefits. Health care services provided CHAMPUS beneficiaries under the terms of the Partnership Program must be consistent with the CHAMPUS range of benefits outlined in this Regulation. The services rendered must be otherwise covered. Charges allowed for professional services provided under the Partnership Program may include costs of support personnel, equipment, and supplies when specifically outlined in the partnership agreement, However, all CHAMPUS coverage and provider requirements must be met. (q) Equality of benefits. All claims submitted for benefits under CHAMPUS shall be adjudicated in a consistent, fair, and equitable manner, without regard to the rank of the sponsor. (r) TRICARE program. Many rules and procedures established in sections of this part are subject to revision in areas where the TRICARE program is implemented. The TRICARE program is the means by which managed care activities designed to improve the delivery and financing of health care services in the Military Health Services System(MHSS) are carried out. Rules and procedures for the TRICARE program are set forth in Sec. 199.17. [51 FR 24008, July 1, 1986, as amended FR 38754, Oct. 19, 1987; 53 FR FR 52094, Oct. 5, 1995] Sec. 199.2 Definitions. (a) General. In an effort to be as specific as possible as to the word and intent of CHAMPUS, the following definitions have been developed. While many of the definitions are general and some assign meaning to relatively common terms within the health insurance environment, others are applicable only to CHAMPUS; however, they all appear in this part solely for the [[Page 61]] purpose of the Program. Except when otherwise specified, the definitions in this section apply generally throughout this part. (b) Specific definitions. Abortion. Abortion means the intentional termination of a pregnancy by artificial means done for a purpose other than that of producing a live birth. A spontaneous, missed or threatened abortion or termination of an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy are not included within the term ``abortion'' as used herein. Absent treatment. Services performed by Christian Science practitioners for a person when the person is physically present. Note: Technically, ``Absent Treatment'' is an obsolete term. The current Christian Science terminology is ``treatment through prayer and spiritual means,'' which is employed by an authorized Christian Science practitioner either with the beneficiary being present or absent. However, to be considered for coverage under CHAMPUS, the beneficiary must be present physically when a Christian Science service is rendered, regardless of the terminology used. Abuse. For the purposes of this part, abuse is defined as any practice that is inconsistent with accepted sound fiscal, business, or professional practice which results in a CHAMPUS claim, unnecessary cost, or CHAMPUS payment for services or supplies that are: (1) Not within the concepts of medically necessary and appropriate care, as defined in this part, or (2) that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care providers. The term ``abuse'' includes deception or misrepresentation by a provider, or any person or entity acting on behalf of a provider in relation to a CHAMPUS claim. Note: Unless a specific action is deemed gross and flagrant, a pattern of inappropriate practice will normally be required to find that abuse has occurred. Also, any practice or action that constitutes fraud, as defined by this part, would also be abuse. Abused dependent. An eligible spouse or child, who meets the criteria in Sec. 199.3 of this part, of a former member who received a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge or was dismissed from a Uniformed Service as a result of a court-martial conviction for an offense involving physical or emotional abuse or was administratively discharged as a result of such an offense, or of a member or former member who has had their entitlement to receive retired pay terminated because of misconduct involving physical or emotional abuse. Accidental injury. Physical bodily injury resulting from an external force, blow or fall, or the ingestion of a foreign body or harmful substance, requiring immediate medical treatment. Accidental injury also includes animal and insect bites and sunstrokes. For the purpose of CHAMPUS, the breaking of a tooth or teeth does not constitute a physical bodily injury. Active duty. Full-time duty in the Uniformed Services of the United States. It includes duty on the active list, full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance while in the active Military Service, at a school designated as a Service school by law or by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned. Active duty member. A person on active duty in a Uniformed Service under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or less. Activities of daily living. Care that consists of providing food (including special diets), clothing, and shelter; personal hygiene services; observation and general monitoring; bowel training or management (unless abnormalities in bowel function are of a severity to result in a need for medical or surgical intervention in the absence of skilled services); safety precautions; general preventive procedures (such as turning to prevent bedsores); passive exercise; companionship; recreation; transportation; and such other elements of personal care that reasonably can be performed by an untrained adult with minimal instruction or supervision. Activities of daily living may also be referred to as ``essentials of daily living''. Acupuncture. The practice of inserting needles into various body parts to pierce specific peripheral nerves for the production of counter-irritation to relieve the discomfort of pain, induce surgical anesthesia, or for other treatment purposes. Note: Acupuncture is not covered by CHAMPUS. [[Page 62]] Adequate Medical Documentation, Medical Treatment Records. Adequate medical documentation contains sufficient information to justify the diagnosis, the treatment plan, and the services and supplies furnished. Under CHAMPUS, it is required that adequate and sufficient clinical records be kept by the health care provider(s) to substantiate that specific care was actually and appropriately furnished, was medically necessary and appropriate (as defined by this part), and to identify the individual(s) who provided the care. All procedures billed must be documented in the records. In determining whether medical records are adequate, the records will be reviewed under the generally acceptable standards such as the applicable Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards, the Peer Review Organization (PRO) standards (and the provider's state or local licensing requirements) and other requirements specified by this part. In general, the documentation requirements for a professional provider are not less in the outpatient setting than the inpatient setting. Adequate Medical Documentation, Mental Health Records. Adequate medical documentation provides the means for measuring the type, frequency, and duration of active treatment mechanisms employed and progress under the treatment plan. Under CHAMPUS, it is required that adequate and sufficient clinical records be kept by the provider to substantiate that specific care was actually and appropriately furnished, was medically or psychologically necessary (as defined by this part), and to identify the individual(s) who provided the care. Each service provided or billed must be documented in the records. In determining whether medical records are adequate, the records will be reviewed under the generally acceptable standards (e.g., the applicable JCAHO standards and the provider's state or local licensing requirements) and other requirements specified by this part. It must be noted that the psychiatric and psychological evaluations, physician orders, the treatment plan, integrated progress notes (and physician progress notes if separate from the integrated progress notes), and the discharge summary are the more critical elements of the mental health record. However, nursing and staff notes, no matter how complete, are not a substitute for the documentation of services by the individual professional provider who furnished treatment to the beneficiary. In general, the documentation requirements of a professional provider are not less in the outpatient setting than the inpatient setting. Furthermore, even though a hospital that provides psychiatric care may be accredited under the JCAHO manual for hospitals rather than the consolidated standards manual, the critical elements of the mental health record listed above are required for CHAMPUS claims. Adjunctive dental care. Dental care which is medically necessary in the treatment of an otherwise covered medical (not dental) condition, is an integral part of the treatment of such medical condition and is essential to the control of the primary medical condition; or, is required in preparation for or as the result of dental trauma which may be or is caused by medically necessary treatment of an injury or disease (iatrogenic). Admission. The formal acceptance by a CHAMPUS authorized institutional provider of a CHAMPUS beneficiary for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment of illness, injury, pregnancy, or mental disorder. Adopted Child. A child taken into one's own family by legal process and treated as one's own child.

All-Inclusive Per Diem Rate. The OCHAMPUS determined rate that encompasses the daily charge for inpatient care and, unless specifically excepted, all other treatment determined necessary and rendered as part of the treatment plan established for a patient, and accepted by OCHAMPUS. Allowable charge. The CHAMPUS-determined level of payment to physicians, other individual professional providers and other providers, based on one of the approved reimbursement methods set forth in Sec. 199.14 of this [[Page 63]] part. Allowable charge also may be referred to as the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable charge. Allowable cost. The CHAMPUS-determined level of payment to hospitals or other insitutions, based on one of the approved reimbursement methods set fourth in Sec. 199.14 of this part. Allowable cost may also be referred to as the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable cost. Ambulance. A specially designed vehicle for transporting the sick or injured that contains a stretcher, linens, first aid supplies, oxygen equipment, and such lifesaving equipment required by state and local law, and that is staffed by personnel trained to provide first aid treatment. Amount in dispute. The amount of money, determined under this part, that CHAMPUS would pay for medical services and supplies involved in an adverse determination being appealed if the appeal were resolved in favor of the appealing party. See Sec. 199.10 for additional information concerning the determination of ``amount in dispute'' under this part. Anesthesia services. The administration of an anesthetic agent by injection or inhalation, the purpose and effect of which is to produce surgical anesthesia characterized by muscular relaxation, loss of sensation, or loss of consciousness when administered by or under the direction of a physician or dentist in connection with otherwise covered surgery or obstetrical care, or shock therapy. Anesthesia services do not include hypnosis or acupuncture. Appealable issue. Disputed questions of fact which, if resolved in favor of the appealing party, would result in the authorization of CHAMPUS benefits, or approval as an authorized provider in accordance with this part. An appealable issue does not exist if no facts are in dispute, if no CHAMPUS benefits would be payable, or if there is no authorized provider, regardless of the resolution of any disputed facts. See Sec. 199.10 for additional information concerning the determination of ``appealable issue'' under this part. Appealing party. Any party to the initial determination who files an appeal of an adverse determination or requests a hearing under the provisions of this part. Appropriate medical care. (i) Services performed in connection with the diagnosis or treatment of disease or injury, pregnancy, mental disorder, or well-baby care which are in keeping with the generally accepted norms for medical practice in the United States; (ii) The authorized individual professional provider rendering the medical care is qualified to perform such medical services by reason of his or her training and education and is licensed or certified by the state where the service is rendered or appropriate national organization or otherwise meets CHAMPUS standards; and (iii) The services are furnished economically. For purposes of this part, ``economically'' means that the services are furnished in the least expensive level of care or medical environment adequate to provide the required medical care regardless of whether or not that level of care is covered by CHAMPUS. Approved teaching programs. For purposes of CHAMPUS, an approved teaching program is a program of graduate medical education which has been duly approved in its respective specialty or subspecialty by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education of the American Medical Association, by the Committee on Hospitals of the Bureau of Professional Education of the American Osteopathic Association, by the Council on Dental Education of the American Dental Association, or by the Council on Podiatry Education of the American Podiatry Association.

An attending physician also may be a teaching physician. Authorized provider. A hospital or institutional provider, physician, or other individual professional provider, or other provider of services or supplies specifically authorized to provide benefits under CHAMPUS in Sec. 199.6 of this part. Automobile liability insurance. Automobile liability insurance means insurance against legal liability for health and medical expenses resulting from personal injuries arising from operation of a motor vehicle. Automobile liability insurance includes: (1) Circumstances in which liability benefits are paid to an injured party only when the insured party's tortious acts are the cause of the injuries; and (2) Uninsured and underinsured coverage, in which there is a third- party tortfeasor who caused the injuries (i.e., benefits are not paid on a no-fault basis), but the insured party is not the tortfeasor.

A service member is a deserter, or in a desertion status, when the Uniformed Service concerned has made an administrative determination to that effect, or the member's period of unauthorized absence has resulted in a court-martial conviction of desertion. Administrative declarations of desertion normally are made when a member has been an unauthorized absentee for over 30 days, but particular circumstances may result in an earlier declaration. Entitlement to CHAMPUS benefits ceases as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following the day the desertion status is declared. Benefits are not to be authorized for treatment received during a period of unauthorized absence that results in a court-martial conviction for desertion. Dependent eligibility for benefits is reestablished when a deserter is returned to military control and continues, even though the member may be in confinement, until any discharge is executed. When a deserter status is later found to have been determined erroneously, the status of deserter is considered never to have existed, and the member's dependents will have been eligible continuously for benefits under CHAMPUS. Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs). Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are a method of dividing hospital patients into clinically coherent groups based on the consumption of resources. Patients are assigned to the groups based on their principal diagnosis (the reason for admission, determined after study), secondary diagnoses, procedures performed, and the patient's age, sex, and discharge status. Diagnostic admission. An admission to a hospital or other authorized institutional provider, or an extension of a stay in such a facility, primarily for the purpose of performing diagnostic tests, examinations, and procedures.

In addition, any authority of the Director may be exercised by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). Director, OCHAMPUS. An authority of the Director, OCHAMPUS includes any person designated by the Director, OCHAMPUS to exercise the authority involved. Director, TRICARE Management Activity. This term includes the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, the official sometimes referred to in this part as the Director, Office of CHAMPUS (or OCHAMPUS), or any designee of the Director, TRICARE Management Activity or the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs who is designated for purposes of an action under this part.

Dual Compensation. Federal Law (5 U.S.C. 5536) prohibits active duty members or civilian employees of the United States Government from receiving additional compensation from the government above their normal pay and allowances. This prohibition applies to CHAMPUS cost-sharing of medical care provided by active duty members or civilian government employees to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. Durable equipment.

Former spouse. A former husband or wife of a Uniformed Service member or former mmeber who meets the criteria as set forth in Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(ii) of this part. Fraud. For purposes of this part, fraud is defined as (1) a deception or misrepresentation by a provider, beneficiary, sponsor, or any person acting on behalf of a provider, sponsor, or beneficiary with the knowledge (or who had reason to know or should have known) that the deception or misrepresentation could result in some unauthorized CHAMPUS benefit to self or some other person, or some unauthorized CHAMPUS payment, or (2) a claim that is false or fictitious, or includes or is supported by any written statement which asserts a material fact which is false or fictitious, or includes or is supported by any written statement that (a) omits a material fact and (b) is false or fictitious as a result of such omission and (c) is a statement in which the person making, presenting, or submitting such statement has a duty to include such material fact. It is presumed that, if a deception or misrepresentation is established and a CHAMPUS claim is filed, the person responsible for the claim had the requisite knowledge. This presumption is rebuttable only by substantial evidence. It is further presumed that the provider of the services is responsible for the actions of all individuals who file a claim on behalf of the provider (for example, billing clerks); this presumption may only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. Freestanding. Not ``institution-affiliated'' or ``institution- based.'' Full-time course of higher education.

Good faith payments. Those payments made to civilian sources of medical care who provided medical care to persons purporting to be eligible beneficiaries but who are determined later to be ineligible for CHAMPUS benefits.

The provision of functional capacity, absent from birth due to congenital anomaly or developmental disorder, which facilitates performance of an activity in the manner, or within the range considered normal, for a human being. Handicap. For the purposes of this part, the term ``handicap'' is synonymous with the term ``disability.'' High-risk pregnancy. A pregnancy is high-risk when the presence of a currently active or previously treated medical, anatomical, physiological illness or condition may create or increase the likelihood of a detrimental effect on the mother, fetus, or newborn and presents a reasonable possibility of the development of complications during labor or delivery. Homebound. A beneficiary's condition is such that there exists a normal inability to leave home and, consequently, leaving home would require considerable and taxing effort. Any absence of an individual from the home attributable to the need to receive health care treatment--including regular absences for the purpose of participating in therapeutic, psychosocial, or medical treatment in an adult day-care program that is licensed or certified by a state, or accredited to furnish adult day-care services in the state shall not disqualify an individual from being considered to be confined to his home. Any other absence of an individual from the home shall not disqualify an individual if the absence is infrequent or of relatively short duration. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any absence for the purpose of attending a religious service shall be deemed to be an absence of infrequent or short duration. Also, absences from the home for non- medical purposes, such as an occasional trip to the barber, a walk around the block or a drive, would not necessarily negate the beneficiary's homebound status if the absences are undertaken on an infrequent basis and are of relatively short duration. Home health discipline. One of six home health disciplines covered under the home health benefit (skilled nursing services, physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, speech-language pathology services, and medical social services). Home health market basket index. An index that reflects changes over time in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services included in home health services. Hospice care. Hospice care is a program which provides an integrated set of services and supplies designed to care for the terminally ill. This type of care emphasizes palliative care and supportive services, such as pain control and home care, rather than cure-oriented services provided in institutions that are otherwise the primary focus under CHAMPUS. The benefit provides coverage for a humane and sensible approach to care during the last days of life for some terminally ill patients. Hospital, acute care (general and special). An institution that meets the criteria as set forth in Sec. 199.6(b)(4)(i) of this part. Hospital, long-term (tuberculosis, chronic care, or rehabilitation).

Responses to general or specific inquiries regarding CHAMPUS benefits are not initial determinations. In-out surgery. Surgery performed in the outpatient department of a hospital or other institutional provider, in a physician's office or the office of another individual professional provider, in a clinic, or in a ``freestanding'' ambulatory surgical center which does not involve a formal inpatient admission for a period of 24 hours or more. Inpatient. A patient who has been admitted to a hospital or other authorized institution for bed occupancy for purposes of receiving necessary medical care, with the reasonable expectation that the patient will remain in the institution at least 24 hours, and with the registration and assignment of an inpatient number or designation. Institutional care in connection with in and out (ambulatory) surgery is not included within the meaning of inpatient whether or not an inpatient number or designation is made by the hospital or other institution. If the patient has been received at the hospital, but death occurs before the actual admission occurs, an inpatient admission exists as if the patient had lived and had been formally admitted. Institution-affiliated. Related to a CHAMPUS-authorized institutional provider through a shared governing body but operating under a separate and distinct license or accreditation. Institution-based.

Special lifesaving techniques and equipment regularly and immediately are available within the unit, and patients are under continuous observation by a nursing staff specially trained and selected for the care of this type patient. The unit is maintained on a continuing rather than an intermittent or temporary basis. It is not a postoperative recovery room nor a postanesthesia room. In some large or highly specialized hospitals, the ICUs may be further refined for special purposes, such as for respiratory conditions, cardiac surgery, coronary care, burn care, or neurosurgery. For the purposes of CHAMPUS, these specialized units would be considered ICUs if they otherwise conformed to the definition of an ICU. Intermittent home health aide and skilled nursing services. Intermittent means: (1) Up to and including 28 hours per week of skilled nursing and home health aide services combined, provided on a less-than-daily basis; [[Page 73]] (2) Up to 35 hours per week of skilled nursing and home health aide services combined that are provided on a less-than-daily basis, subject to review by managed care support contractors on a case-by-case basis, based upon documentation justifying the need for and reasonableness of such additional care; or (3) Up to and including full-time (i.e., eight hours per day) skilled nursing and home health aide services combined which are provided and needed seven days per week for temporary, but not indefinite, periods of time of up to 21 days with allowances for extensions in exceptional circumstances where the need for care in excess of 21 days is finite and predictable. Intern. A graduate of a medical or dental school serving in a hospital in preparation to being licensed to practice medicine or dentistry. Internal Partnership Agreement. The Internal Partnership Agreement is an agreement between a military treatment facility commander and a CHAMPUS-authorized civilian health care provider which enables the use of civilian health care personnel or other resources to provide medical care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries on the premises of a military treatment facility under the Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program. These internal agreements may be established when a military treatment facility is unable to provide sufficient health care services for CHAMPUS beneficiaries due to shortages of personnel and other required resources. Internal Resource Sharing Agreement. A type of Internal Partnership Agreement, established in the context of the TRICARE program by agreement of a military medical treatment facility commander and authorized TRICARE contractor.

Medical. The generally used term which pertains to the diagnosis and treatment of illness, injury, pregnancy, and mental disorders by trained and licensed or certified health professionals. For purposes of CHAMPUS, the term ``medical'' should be understood to include ``medical, psychological, surgical, and obstetrical,'' unless it is specifically stated that a more restrictive meaning is intended. Medical emergency. The sudden and unexpected onset of a medical condition or the acute exacerbation of a chronic condition that is threatening to life, limb, or sight, and requires immediate medical treatment or which manifests painful symptomatology requiring immediate palliative efforts to alleviate suffering. Medical emergencies include heart attacks, cardiovascular accidents, poisoning, convulsions, kidney stones, and such other acute medical conditions as may be determined to be medical emergencies by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. In the case of a pregnancy, a medical emergency must involve a sudden and unexpected medical complication that puts the mother, the baby, or both, at risk. Pain would not, however, qualify a maternity case as an emergency, nor would incipient birth after the 34th week of gestation, unless an otherwise qualifying medical condition is present. Examples of medical emergencies related to pregnancy or delivery are hemorrhage, ruptured membrane with prolapsed cord, placenta previa, abruptio placenta, presence of shock or unconsciousness, suspected heart attack or stroke, or trauma (such as injuries received in an automobile accident).

Member. A person on active duty in a Uniformed Service under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or less. (For CHAMPUS cost-sharing purposes only, a former member who received a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge or was dismissed from a Uniformed Service as a result of a court-martial conviction for an offense involving physical or emotional abuse or was administratively discharged as a result of such an offense is considered a member). Mental disorder. For purposes of the payment of CHAMPUS benefits, a mental disorder is a nervous or mental condition that involves a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that is associated with a painful symptom, such as distress, and that impairs a patient's ability to function in one or more major life activities. Additionally, the mental disorder must be one of those conditions listed in the DSM-III. [[Page 75]] Mental health counselor. An extramedical individual provider who meets the requirements outlined in Sec. 199.6. Mental health therapeutic absence. A therapeutically planned absence from the inpatient setting.

Eligibility for either class of abused dependent results from being either: (1) The spouse (including a former spouse) or child of a member who has received a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or dismissal from a Uniformed Service as a result of a court-martial conviction for an offense involving physical or emotional abuse of the spouse or child, or was administratively discharged as a result of such an offense. Until October 17, 1998, Medical benefits are limited to care related to the physical or emotional abuse and for a period of 12 months following the member's separation from the Uniformed Service. On or after October 17, 1998, medical benefits can include all under the Basic Program and under the Program for Persons with Disabilities for the period that the spouse or child is in receipt of transitional compensation under section 1059 of title 10 U.S.C. (2) The spouse (including a former spouse) or child of a member or former member who while a member and as a result of misconduct involving abuse of the spouse or child has eligibility to receive retired pay on the basis of years of service terminated.

(10) Beginning dates of eligibility for a retiree for: (i) Medical benefits under the Basic Program January 1, 1967. (ii) Retirees and their dependents are not eligible for benefits under the Program for Persons with Disabilities. (d) Dual eligibility. Dual eligibility occurs when a person is entitled to benefits from two sources. For example, when an active duty member is also the dependent of another active duty member, a retiree, or a deceased active duty member or retiree, dual eligibility, that is, entitlement to direct care from the Uniformed Services medical care system and CHAMPUS is the result. Since the active duty status is primary, and it is the intent that all medical care be provided an active duty member through the Uniformed Services medical care system, CHAMPUS eligibility is terminated as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following the day the dual eligibility begins. However, any dependent children in a marriage of two active duty persons or of an active duty member and a retiree, are CHAMPUS eligible in the same manner as dependent children of a marriage involving only one CHAMPUS sponsor. Should a spouse or dependent who has dual eligibility leave active duty status, that person's CHAMPUS eligibility is reinstated as of 12:01 a.m. of the day active duty ends, if he or she otherwise is eligible as a dependent of a CHAMPUS sponsor. Note: No CHAMPUS eligibility arises as the result of the marriage of two active duty members. (e) Eligibility Under the Transitional Assistance Management Program (TAMP).Transitional health care benefits under CHAMPUS are authorized for the applicable time period described, for: (1) Up to thirty (30) days or until again covered by an employer- sponsored health plan, whichever occurs earlier, following release from active duty for: (i) Activated Guard/Reserve and their dependents, (ii) Involuntary stop-loss and their dependents, (iii) Voluntary stop-loss and their dependents, and (iv) Members who accepted Voluntary Separation Incentives (VSI). (2) Sixty (60) days for regular DoD military and their dependents when the sponsor is involuntarily separated with less than six years of active service. Involuntary separation must occur during the five-year period beginning October 1, 1990. (3) One hundred twenty (120) days for regular military and their dependents when the sponsor is involuntarily separated with six or more years of active service. Involuntary separation must occur during the five year period beginning October 1, 1990. Each branch of service will determine eligibility, including dates, for its members and [[Page 91]] their dependents and provide data to DEERS. (f) Changes in status which result in termination of CHAMPUS eligibility. Changes in status which result in a loss of CHAMPUS eligibility as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day the event occurred, unless otherwise indicated, are as follows: (1) Changes in the status of a member. (i) When an active duty member's period of active duty ends, excluding retirement or death. (ii) When an active duty member is placed on desertion status (eligibility is reinstated when the active duty member is removed from desertion status and returned to military control). Note: A member serving a sentence of confinement in conjunction with a sentence of punitive discharge is still considered on active duty until such time as the discharge is executed. (2) Changes in the status of a retiree. (i) When a retiree ceases to be entitled to retired, retainer, or equivalent pay for any reason, the retiree's dependents lose their eligibility unless the dependent is otherwise eligible (e.g., some former spouses, some dependents who are victims of abuse and some incapacitated children as outlined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(2) of this section). (ii) A retiree also loses eligibility when no longer entitled to retired, retainer, or equivalent pay. Note: A retiree who waives his or her retired, retainer or equivalent pay is still considered a retiree for the purposes of CHAMPUS eligibility. (3) Changes in the status of a dependent. (i) Divorce, except for certain classes of former spouses as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and the member or former member's own children (i.e., legitimate, adopted, and judicially determined illegitimate children). Note: An unadopted stepchild loses eligibility as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day the divorce becomes final. (ii) Annulment, except for certain classes of former spouse as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and the member or former member's own children (i.e., legitimate, adopted, and judicially determined illegitimate children). Note: An unadopted stepchild loses eligibility as of 12:01 a.m. of the day following the day the annulment becomes final. (iii) Adoption, except for adoptions occurring after the death of a member or former member. (iv) Marriage of a child, except when the marriage is terminated by death, divorce, or annulment before the child is 21 or 23 if an incapacitated child as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(2) of this section. (v) Marriage of a widow or widower, except for the child of the widow or widower who was the stepchild of the deceased member or former member at the time of death. The stepchild continues CHAMPUS eligibility as other classes of dependent children. (vi) Attainment of entitlement to hospital insurance benefits (Part A) under Medicare except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (f)(3)(vii), (f)(3)(viii), and (f)(3)(ix) of this section. (This also applies to individuals living outside the United States where Medicare benefits are not available.) (vii) Attainment of age 65, except for dependents of active duty members, beneficiaries not entitled to part A of Medicare, beneficiaries entitled to Part A of Medicare who have enrolled in Part B of Medicare, and as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For those who do not retain CHAMPUS, CHAMPUS eligibility is lost at 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the month in which the beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare. Note: If the person is not eligible for Part A of Medicare, he or she must file a Social Security Administration, ``Notice of Disallowance'' certifying to that fact with the Uniformed Service responsible for the issuance of his or her identification card so a new card showing CHAMPUS eligibility can be issued. Individuals entitled only to supplementary medical insurance (Part B) of Medicare, but not Part A, or Part A through the Premium HI provisions (provided for under the 1972 Amendments to the Social Security Act) retain eligibility under CHAMPUS (refer to Sec. 199.8 for additional information when a double coverage situation is involved). (viii) End stage renal disease. All beneficiaries, except dependents of active duty members, lose their CHAMPUS eligibility when Medicare coverage becomes available to a person because of chronic renal disease unless [[Page 92]] the following conditions have been met. CHAMPUS eligibility will continue if: (A) The individual is under 65 years old; (B) The individual became eligible for Medicare under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 426-1(a); (C) The individual is enrolled in Part B of Medicare; and (D) The individual has applied and qualified for continued CHAMPUS eligibility through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). (ix) Individuals with certain disabilities. Each case relating to Medicare eligibility resulting from being disabled requires individual investigation. All beneficiaries except dependents of active duty members lose their CHAMPUS eligibility when Medicare coverage becomes available to a disabled person unless the following conditions have been met. CHAMPUS eligibility will continue if: (A) The individual is under 65 years old; (B) The individual became eligible for Medicare under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 426(b)(2); (C) The individual is enrolled in Part B of Medicare; and (D) The individual has applied and qualified for continued CHAMPUS eligibility through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). (x) Disabled students, that is children age 21 or 22, who are pursuing a full-time course of higher education and who, either during the school year or between semesters, suffer a disabling illness or injury with resultant inability to resume attendance at the institution remain eligible for CHAMPUS medical benefits for 6 months after the disability is removed or until the student passes his or her 23rd birthday, whichever occurs first. However, if recovery occurs before the 23rd birthday and there is resumption of a full-time course of higher education, CHAMPUS benefits can be continued until the 23rd birthday. The normal vacation periods during an established school year do not change the eligibility status of a dependent child 21 or 22 years old in a full time student status. Unless an incapacitating condition existed before, and at the time of, a dependent child's 21st birthday, a dependent child 21 or 22 years old in student status does not have eligibility and may not qualify for eligibility under the requirements related to mental or physical incapacity as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(H)(2) of this section. (g) Reinstatement of CHAMPUS eligibility. Circumstances which result in reinstatement of CHAMPUS eligibility are as follows: (1) End Stage renal disease. Unless CHAMPUS eligibility has been continued under paragraph (f)(3)(viii) of the section, when Medicare eligibility ceases for end-stage renal disease patients, CHAMPUS eligibility resumes if the person is otherwise still eligible. He or she is required to take action to be reinstated as a CHAMPUS beneficiary and to obtain a new identification card. (2) Disability. Some disabilities are permanent, others temporary. Each case must be reviewed individually. Unless CHAMPUS eligibility has been continued under paragraph (f)(3)(ix) of this section, when disability ends and Medicare eligibility ceases, CHAMPUS eligibility resumes if the person is otherwise still eligible. Again, he or she is required to take action to obtain a new CHAMPUS identification card. (h) Determination of eligibility status. Determination of an individual's eligibility as a CHAMPUS beneficiary is the primary responsibility of the Uniformed Service in which the member or former member is, or was, a member, or in the case of dependents of a NATO military member, the Service that sponsors the NATO member. For the purpose of program integrity, the appropriate Uniformed Service shall, upon request of the Director, OCHAMPUS, review the eligibility of a specific person when there is reason to question the eligibility status. In such cases, a report on the results of the review and any action taken will be submitted to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (i) Procedures for determination of eligibility. Procedures for the determination of eligibility are prescribed within the Department of Defense Instruction [[Page 93]] 1000.13 available at local military facilities personnel offices. (j) CHAMPUS procedures for verification of eligibility. (1) Eligibility for CHAMPUS benefits will be verified through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) maintained by the Uniformed Services, except for abused dependents as set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS beneficiary, or parent, or legal representative, when appropriate, to provide the necessary evidence required for entry into the DEERS file to establish CHAMPUS eligibility and to ensure that all changes in status that may affect eligibility be reported immediately to the appropriate Uniformed Service for action. (2) Ineligibility for CHAMPUS benefits may be presumed in the absence of prescribed eligibility evidence in the DEERS file. (3) The Director, OCHAMPUS, shall issue guidelines as necessary to implement the provisions of this section. [64 FR 46135, Aug. 24, 1999, as amended at 66 FR 9654, Feb. 9, 2001; 66 FR FR 32361, May 30, 2003] Sec. 199.4 Basic program benefits. (a) General. The CHAMPUS Basic Program is essentially a supplemental program to the Uniformed Services direct medical care system. The Basic Program is similar to private insurance programs, and is designed to provide financial assistance to CHAMPUS beneficiaries for certain prescribed medical care obtained from civilian sources. (1)(i) Scope of benefits. Subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, or exclusions specified in this part, the CHAMPUS Basic Program will pay for medically necessary services and supplies required in the diagnosis and treatment of illness or injury, including maternity care and well-baby care. Benefits include specified medical services and supplies provided to eligible beneficiaries from authorized civilian sources such as hospitals, other authorized institutional providers, physicians, other authorized individual professional providers, and professional ambulance service, prescription drugs, authorized medical supplies, and rental or purchase of durable medical equipment. (ii) Impact of TRICARE program. The basic program benefits set forth in this section are applicable to the basic CHAMPUS program. In areas in which the TRICARE program is implemented, certain provisions of Sec. 199.17 will apply instead of the provisions of this section. In those areas, the provisions of Sec. 199.17 will take precedence over any provisions of this section with which they conflict. (2) Persons eligible for Basic Program benefits. Persons eligible to receive the Basic Program benefits are set forth in Sec. 199.3 of this part. Any person determined to be an eligible CHAMPUS beneficiary is eligible for Basic Program benefits. (3) Authority to act for CHAMPUS. The authority to make benefit determinations and authorize the disbursement of funds under CHAMPUS is restricted to the Director, OCHAMPUS; designated OCHAMPUS staff; Director, OCHAMPUSEUR; or CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries. No other persons or agents (such as physicians, staff members of hospitals, or CHAMPUS health benefits advisors) have such authority. (4) Status of patient controlling for purposes of cost-sharing. Benefits for covered services and supplies described in this section will be extended either on an inpatient or outpatient cost-sharing basis in accordance with the status of the patient at the time the covered services and supplies were provided, unless otherwise specifically designated (such as for ambulance service or maternity care). For cost- sharing provisions, refer to paragraph (f) of this section. (5) Right to information. As a condition precedent to the provision of benefits hereunder, OCHAMPUS or its CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries shall be entitled to receive information from a physician or hospital or other person, institution, or organization (including a local, state, or U.S. Government agency) providing services or supplies to the beneficiary for which claims or requests for approval for benefits are submitted. Such information and records may relate to the attendance, [[Page 94]] testing, monitoring, or examination or diagnosis of, or treatment rendered, or services and supplies furnished to a beneficiary, and shall be necessary for the accurate and efficient administration of CHAMPUS benefits. Before a determination will be made on a request for preauthorization or claim of benefits, a beneficiary or sponsor must provide particular additional information relevant to the requested determination, when necessary. The recipient of such information shall in every case hold such records confidential except when: (i) Disclosure of such information is authorized specifically by the beneficiary; (ii) Disclosure is necessary to permit authorized governmental officials to investigate and prosecute criminal actions, or (iii) Disclosure is authorized or required specifically under the terms of the Privacy Act or Freedom of Information Act (refer to Sec. 199.1(m) of this part). For the purposes of determining the applicability of and implementing the provisions of Sec. Sec. 199.8, 199.11, and 199.12, or any provision of similar purpose of any other medical benefits coverage or entitlement, OCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries may release, without consent or notice to any beneficiary or sponsor, to any person, organization, government agency, provider, or other entity any information with respect to any beneficiary when such release constitutes a routine use published in the Federal Register in accordance with DoD 5400.11-R (Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a)). Before a person's claim of benefits will be adjudicated, the person must furnish to CHAMPUS information that reasonably may be expected to be in his or her possession and that is necessary to make the benefit determination. Failure to provide the requested information may result in denial of the claim. (6) Physical examinations. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may require a beneficiary to submit to one or more medical (including psychiatric) examinations to determine the beneficiary's entitlement to benefits for which application has been made or for otherwise authorized medically necessary services and supplies required in the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury (including maternity and well-baby care). When a medical examination has been requested, CHAMPUS will withhold payment of any pending claims or preauthorization requests on that particular beneficiary. If the beneficiary refuses to agree to the requested medical examination, or unless prevented by a medical reason acceptable to OCHAMPUS, the examination is not performed within 90 days of initial request, all pending claims for services and supplies will be denied. A denial of payments for services or supplies provided before (and related to) the request for a physical examination is not subject to reconsideration. The medical examination and required beneficiary travel related to performing the requested medical examination will be at the expense of CHAMPUS. The medical examination may be performed by a physician in a Uniformed Services medical facility or by an appropriate civilian physician, as determined and selected by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee who is responsible for making such arrangements as are necessary, including necessary travel arrangements. (7) Claims filing deadline. For all services provided on or after January 1, 1993, to be considered for benefits, all claims submitted for benefits must, except as provided in Sec. 199.7, be filed with the appropriate CHAMPUS contractor no later than one year after the services are provided. Unless the requirement is waived, failure to file a claim within this deadline waives all rights to benefits for such services or supplies. (8) Double coverage and third party recoveries. CHAMPUS claims involving double coverage or the possiblity that the United States can recover all or a part of its expenses from a third party, are specifically subject to the provisions of Sec. 199.8 or Sec. 199.12 of this part as appropriate. (9) Nonavailability Statements within a 40-mile catchment area. In some geographic locations, it is necessary for CHAMPUS beneficiaries not enrolled in TRICARE Prime to determine whether the required inpatient mental health [[Page 95]] care can be provided through a Uniformed Service facility. If the required care cannot be provided, the hospital commander, or a designee, will issue a Nonavailability Statement (NAS) (DD Form 1251). Except for emergencies, as NAS should be issued before inpatient mental health care is obtained from a civilian source. Failure to secure such a statement may waive the beneficiary's rights to benefits under CHAMPUS/TRICARE. (i) Rules applicable to issuance of Nonavailability Statement (NAS) (DD Form 1251). (A) The ASD(HA) is responsible for issuing rules and regulations regarding Nonavailability Statements. (B) For CHAMPUS beneficiaries who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, an NAS is required for services in connection with nonemergency hospital inpatient mental health care if such services are available at a military treatment facility (MTF) located within a 40-mile radius of the residence of the beneficiary, except that a NAS is not required for services otherwise available at an MTF located within a 40-mile radius of the beneficiary's residence when another insurance plan or program provides the beneficiary's primary coverage for the services. This requirement for an NAS does not apply to beneficiaries enrolled in TRICARE Prime, even when those beneficiaries use the point-of-service option under Sec. 199.17(n)(3). (ii) Beneficiary responsibility.A CHAMPUS beneficiary who is not enrolled in TRICARE Prime is responsible for securing information whether or not he or she resides in a geographic area that requires obtaining a Nonavailability Statement. Information concerning current rules and regulations may be obtained from the Offices of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Surgeons General; or a representative of the TRICARE managed care support contractor's staff, or the Director, OCHAMPUS. (iii) Rules in effect at time civilian medical care is provided apply. The applicable rules and regulations regarding Nonavailability Statements in effect at the time the civilian care is rendered apply in determining whether a Nonavailability Statement is required. (iv) Nonavailability Statement (DD Form 1251) must be filed with applicable claim. When a claim is submitted for TRICARE benefits that includes services for which an NAS was issued, a valid NAS authorization must be on the DoD required system. (v) Nonavailability Statement (NAS) and Claims Adjudication. A NAS is valid for the adjudication of CHAMPUS claims for all related care otherwise authorized by this part which is received from a civilian source while the beneficiary resided within the Uniformed Service facility catchment area which issued the NAS. (vi) In the case of any service subject to an NAS requirement under paragraph (a)(9) of this section and also subject to a preadmission (or other pre-service) authorization requirement under Sec. 199.4 or Sec. 199.15, the administrative processes for the NAS and pre-service authorization may be combined. (vii) With the exception of maternity services, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)) may require an NAS prior to TRICARE cost-sharing for additional services from civilian sources if such services are to be provided to a beneficiary who lives within a 40-mile catchment area of an MTF where such services are available and the ASD(HA): (A) Demonstrates that significant costs would be avoided by performing specific procedures at the affected MTF or MTFs; or (B) Determines that a specific procedure must be provided at the affected MTF or MTFs to ensure the proficiency levels of the practitioners at the MTF or MTFs; or (C) Determines that the lack of NAS data would significantly interfere with TRICARE contract administration; and (D) Provides notification of the ASD(HA)'s intent to require an NAS under this authority to covered beneficiaries who receive care at the MTF or MTFs that will be affected by the decision to require an NAS under this authority; and (E) Provides at least 60-day notification to the Committees on Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the ASD(HA)'s intent [[Page 96]] to require an NAS under this authority, the reason for the NAS requirement, and the date that an NAS will be required. (10) [Reserved] (11) Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program. All benefits under the CHAMPUS program are subject to review under the CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program pursuant to Sec. 199.15. (Utilization and quality review of mental health services are also part of the Peer Review Organization program, and are addressed in paragraph (a)(12) of this section.) (12) Utilization review, quality assurance and reauthorization for inpatient mental health services and partial hospitalization. (i) In general. The Director, OCHAMPUS shall provide, either directly or through contract, a program of utilization and quality review for all mental health care services. Among other things, this program shall include mandatory preadmission authorization before nonemergency inpatient mental health services may be provided and mandatory approval of continuation of inpatient services within 72 hours of emergency admissions. This program shall also include requirements for other pretreatment authorization procedures, concurrent review of continuing inpatient and partial hospitalization, retrospective review, and other such procedures as determined appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS. The provisions of paragraph (h) of this section and Sec. 199.15(f) shall apply to this program. The Director, OCHAMPUS, shall establish, pursuant to that Sec. 199.15(f), procedures substantially comparable to requirements of paragraph (h) of this section and Sec. 199.15. If the utilization and quality review program for mental health care services is provided by contract, the contractor(s) need not be the same contractor(s) as are engaged under Sec. 199.15 in connection with the review of other services. (ii) Preadmission authorization. (A) This section generally requires preadmission authorization for all non-emergency inpatient mental health services and prompt continued stay authorization after emergency admissions with the exception noted in paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section. It also requires preadmission authorization for all admissions to a partial hospitalization program, without exception, as the concept of an emergency admission does not pertain to a partial hospitalization level of care. Institutional services for which payment would otherwise be authorized, but which were provided without compliance with preadmission authorization requirements, do not qualify for the same payment that would be provided if the preadmission requirements had been met. (B) In cases of noncompliance with preauthorization requirements, a payment reduction shall be made in accordance with Sec. 199.15(b)(4)(iii). (C) For purposes of paragraph (a)(12)(ii)(B) of this section, a day of services without the appropriate preauthorization is any day of services provided prior to: (1) The receipt of an authorization; or (2) The effective date of an authorization subsequently received. (D) Services for which payment is disallowed under paragraph (a)(12)(ii)(B) of this section may not be billed to the patient (or the patient's family). (E) Preadmission authorization for inpatient mental health services is not required in the following cases: (1) In the case of an emergency. (2) In a case in which benefits are payable for such services under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq.) subject to paragraph (a)(12)(iii) of this section. (3) In a case of inpatient mental health services in which paragraph (a)(12)(ii) of this section applies, the Secretary shall require advance authorization for a continuation of the provision of such services after benefits cease to be payable for such services under such part A. (13) Implementing instructions. The Director, OCHAMPUS shall issue policies, procedures, instructions, guidelines, standards and/or criteria to implement this section. (b) Institutional benefits. (1) General. Services and supplies provided by an institutional provider authorized as set forth in Sec. 199.6 may be cost-shared only [[Page 97]] when such services or supplies: are otherwise authorized by this part; are medically necessary; are ordered, directed, prescribed, or delivered by an OCHAMPUS-authorized individual professional provider as set forth in Sec. 199.6 or by an employee of the authorized institutional provider who is otherwise eligible to be a CHAMPUS authorized individual professional provider; are delivered in accordance with generally accepted norms for clinical practice in the United States; meet established quality standards; and comply with applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, exceptions, or exclusions as otherwise set forth in this part. (i) Billing practices. To be considered for benefits under Sec. 199.4(b), covered services and supplies must be provided and billed for by a hospital or other authorized institutional provider. Such billings must be fully itemized and sufficiently descriptive to permit CHAMPUS to determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. Depending on the individual circumstances, teaching physician services may be considered an institutional benefit in accordance with Sec. 199.4(b) or a professional benefit under Sec. 199.4(c). See paragraph (c)(3)(xiii) of this section for the CHAMPUS requirements regarding teaching physicians. In the case of continuous care, claims shall be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days either by the beneficiary or sponsor or, on a participating basis, directly by the facility on behalf of the beneficiary (refer to Sec. 199.7). (ii) Successive inpatient admissions. Successive inpatient admissions shall be deemed one inpatient confinement for the purpose of computing the active duty dependent's share of the inpatient institutional charges, provided not more than 60 days have elapsed between the successive admissions, except that successive inpatient admissions related to a single maternity episode shall be considered one confinement, regardless of the number of days between admissions. For the purpose of applying benefits, successive admissions will be determined separately for maternity admissions and admissions related to an accidental injury (refer to Sec. 199.4(f)). (iii) Related services and supplies. Covered services and supplies must be rendered in connection with and related directly to a covered diagnosis or definitive set of symptoms requiring otherwise authorized medically necessary treatment. (iv) Inpatient, appropriate level required. For purposes of inpatient care, the level of institutional care for which Basic Program benefits may be extended must be at the appropriate level required to provide the medically necessary treatment except for patients requiring skilled nursing facility care. For patients for whom skilled nursing facility care is adequate, but is not available in the general locality, benefits may be continued in the higher level care facility. General locality means an area that includes all the skilled nursing facilities within 50 miles of the higher level facility, unless the higher level facility can demonstrate that the skilled nursing facilities are inaccessible to its patients. The decision as to whether a skilled nursing facility is within the higher level facility's general locality, or the skilled nursing facility is inaccessible to the higher level facility's patients shall be a CHAMPUS contractor initial determination for the purposes of appeal under Sec. 199.10 of this part. CHAMPUS institutional benefit payments shall be limited to the allowable cost that would have been incurred in the skilled nursing facility, as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. If it is determined that the institutional care can be provided reasonably in the home setting, no CHAMPUS institutional benefits are payable. (v) General or special education not covered. Services and supplies related to the provision of either regular or special education generally are not covered. Such exclusion applies whether a separate charge is made for education or whether it is included as a part of an overall combined daily charge of an institution. In the latter instance, that portion of the overall combined daily charge related to education must be determined, based on the allowable costs of the educational [[Page 98]] component, and deleted from the institution's charges before CHAMPUS benefits can be extended. The only exception is when appropriate education is not available from or not payable by the cognizant public entity. Each case must be referred to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for review and a determination of the applicability of CHAMPUS benefits. (2) Covered hospital services and supplies--(i) Room and board. Includes special diets, laundry services, and other general housekeeping support services (inpatient only). (ii) General staff nursing services. (iii) ICU. Includes specialized units, such as for respiratory conditions, cardiac surgery, coronary care, burn care, or neurosurgery (inpatient only). (iv) Operating room, recovery room. Operating room and recovery room, including other special treatment rooms and equipment, and hyperbaric chamber. (v) Drugs and medicines. Includes sera, biologicals, and pharmaceutical preparations (including insulin) that are listed in the official formularies of the institution or facility at the time of use. (To be considered as an inpatient supply, drugs and medicines must be consumed during the specific period the beneficiary is a registered inpatient. Drugs and medicines prescribed for use outside the hospital, even though prescribed and obtained while still a registered inpatient, will be considered outpatient supplies and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section will apply.) (vi) Durable medical equipment, medical supplies, and dressings. Includes durable medical equipment, medical supplies essential to a surgical procedure (such as artificial heart valve and artificial ball and socket joint), sterile trays, casts, and orthopedic hardware. Use of durable medical equipment is restricted to an inpatient basis. Note: If durable medical equipment is to be used on an outpatient basis or continued in outpatient status after use as an inpatient, benefits will be provided as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section and cost-sharing will be on an outpatient basis (refer to paragraph (a)(4) of this section). (vii) Diagnostic services. Includes clinical laboratory examinations, x-ray examinations, pathological examinations, and machine tests that produce hard-copy results. Also includes CT scanning under certain limited conditions. (viii) Anesthesia. Includes both the anesthetic agent and its administration. (ix) Blood. Includes blood, plasma and its derivatives, including equipment and supplies, and its administration. (x) Radiation therapy. Includes radioisotopes. (xi) Physical therapy. (xii) Oxygen. Includes equipment for its administration. (xiii) Intravenous injections. Includes solution. (xiv) Shock therapy. (xv) Chemotherapy. (xvi) Renal and peritoneal dialysis. (xvii) Psychological evaluation tests. When required by the diagnosis. (xviii) Other medical services. Includes such other medical services as may be authorized by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, provided they are related directly to the diagnosis or definitive set of symptoms and rendered by a member of the institution's medical or professional staff (either salaried or contractual) and billed for by the hospital. (3) Covered services and supplies provided by special medical treatment institutions or facilities, other than hospitals or RTCs--(i) Room and board. Includes special diets, laundry services, and other general housekeeping support services (inpatient only). (ii) General staff nursing services. (iii) Drugs and medicines. Includes sera, biologicals, and pharmaceutical preparations (including insulin) that are listed in the official formularies of the institution or facility at the time of use. (To be considered as an inpatient supply, drugs and medicines must be consumed during the specific period the beneficiary is a registered inpatient. Drugs and medicines prescribed for use outside the authorized institutional provider, even though prescribed and obtained while still a registered inpatient, will be considered outpatient supplies and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section will apply.). (iv) Durable medical equipment, medical supplies, and dressings. Includes durable medical equipment, sterile trays, casts, [[Page 99]] orthopedic hardware and dressings. Use of durable medical equipment is restricted to an inpatent basis. Note: If the durable medical equipment is to be used on an outpatient basis or continued in outpatient status after use as an inpatient, benefits will be provided as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, and cost-sharing will be on an outpatient basis (refer to paragraph (a)(4) of this section). (v) Diagnostic services. Includes clinical laboratory examinations, x-ray examinations, pathological examination, and machine tests that produce hard-copy results. (vi) Blood. Includes blood, plasma and its derivatives, including equipment and supplies, and its administration. (vii) Physical therapy. (viii) Oxygen. Includes equipment for its administration. (ix) Intravenous injections. Includes solution. (x) Shock therapy. (xi) Chemotherapy. (xii) Psychological evaluation tests. When required by the diagnosis. (xiii) Renal and peritoneal dialysis. (xiv) Skilled nursing facility (SNF) services. Covered services in SNFs are the same as provided under Medicare under section 1861(h) and (i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(h) and (i)) and 42 CFR part 409, subparts C and D, except that the Medicare limitation on the number of days of coverage under section 1812(a) and (b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395d(a) and (b)) and 42 CFR 409.61(b) shall not be applicable under TRICARE. Skilled nursing facility care for each spell of illness shall continue to be provided for as long as necessary and appropriate. For a SNF admission to be covered under TRICARE, the beneficiary must have a qualifying hospital stay meaning an inpatient hospital stay of three consecutive days or more, not including the hospital leave day. The beneficiary must enter the SNF within 30 days of leaving the hospital, or within such time as it would be medically appropriate to begin an active course of treatment, where the individual's condition is such that SNF care would not be medically appropriate within 30 days after discharge from a hospital. The skilled services must be for a medical condition that was either treated during the qualifying three-day hospital stay, or started while the beneficiary was already receiving covered SNF care. Additionally, an individual shall be deemed not to have been discharged from a SNF, if within 30 days after discharge from a SNF, the individual is again admitted to a SNF. Adoption by TRICARE of most Medicare coverage standards does not include Medicare coinsurance amounts. Extended care services furnished to an inpatient of a SNF by such SNF (except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(xiv)(C), (b)(3)(xiv)(F), and (b)(3)(xiv)(G) of this section) include: (A) Nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse; (B) Bed and board in connection with the furnishing of such nursing care; (C) Physical or occupational therapy or speech-language pathology services furnished by the SNF or by others under arrangements with them by the facility; (D) Medical social services; (E) Such drugs, biological, supplies, appliances, and equipment, furnished for use in the SNF, as are ordinarily furnished for the care and treatment of inpatients; (F) Medical services provided by an intern or resident-in-training of a hospital with which the facility has such an agreement in effect; and (G) Such other services necessary to the health of the patients as are generally provided by SNFs, or by others under arrangements with them made by the facility. (xv) Other medical services. Other medical services may be authorized by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, provided they are related directly to the diagnosis or definitive set of symptoms and rendered by a member of the institution's medical or professional staff (either salaried or contractual) and billed for by the authorized institutional provider of care. (4) Services and supplies provided by RTCs--(i) Room and board. Includes use of residential facilities such as food service (including special diets), laundry services, supervised reasonable recreational and social activity services, and other general services as considered appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. [[Page 100]] (ii) Patient assessment. Includes the assessment of each child or adolescent accepted by the RTC, including clinical consideration of each of his or her fundamental needs, that is, physical, psychological, chronological age, developmental level, family, educational, social, environmental, and recreational. (iii) Diagnostic services. Includes clinical laboratory examinations, x-ray examinations, pathological examinations, and machine tests that produce hard-copy results. (iv) Psychological evaluation tests. (v) Treatment of mental disorders. Services and supplies that are medically or psychologically necessary to diagnose and treat the mental disorder for which the patient was admitted to the RTC. Covered services and requirements for qualifications of providers are as listed in paragraph (c)(3)(ix) of this section. (vi) Other necessary medical care. Emergency medical services or other authorized medical care may be rendered by the RTC provided it is professionally capable of rendering such services and meets standards required by the Director, OCHAMPUS. It is intended, however, that CHAMPUS payments to an RTC should primarily cover those services and supplies directly related to the treatment of mental disorders that require residential care. (vii) Criteria for determining medical or psychological necessity. In determining the medical or psychological necessity of services and supplies provided by RTCs, the evaluation conducted by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) shall consider the appropriate level of care for the patient, the intensity of services required by the patient, and the availability of that care. In addition to the criteria set forth in this paragraph (b)(4) of this section, additional evaluation standards, consistent with such criteria, may be adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee). RTC services and supplies shall not be considered medically or psychologically necessary unless, at a minimum, all the following criteria are clinically determined in the evaluation to be fully met: (A) Patient has a diagnosable psychiatric disorder. (B) Patient exhibits patterns of disruptive behavior with evidence of disturbances in family functioning or social relationships and persistent psychological and/or emotional disturbances. (C) RTC services involve active clinical treatment under an individualized treatment plan that provides for: (1) Specific level of care, and measurable goals/objectives relevant to each of the problems identified; (2) Skilled interventions by qualified mental health professionals to assist the patient and/or family; (3) Time frames for achieving proposed outcomes; and (4) Evaluation of treatment progress to include timely reviews and updates as appropriate of the patient's treatment plan that reflects alterations in the treatment regimen, the measurable goals/objectives, and the level of care required for each of the patient's problems, and explanations of any failure to achieve the treatment goals/objectives. (D) Unless therapeutically contraindicated, the family and/or guardian must actively participate in the continuing care of the patient either through direct involvement at the facility or geographically distant family therapy. (In the latter case, the treatment center must document that there has been collaboration with the family and/or guardian in all reviews.) (viii) Preauthorization requirement. (A) All admissions to RTC care are elective and must be certified as medically/psychologically necessary prior to admission. The criteria for preauthorization shall be those set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(vii) of this section. In applying those criteria in the context of preadmission authorization review, special emphasis is placed on the development of a specific diagnosis/ treatment plan, consistent with those criteria and reasonably expected to be effective, for that individual patient. (B) The timetable for development of the individualized treatment plan shall be as follows: (1) The plan must be under development at the time of the admission. (2) A preliminary treatment plan must be established within 24 hours of the admission. [[Page 101]] (3) A master treatment plan must be established within ten calendar days of the admission. (C) The elements of the individualized treatment plan must include: (1) The diagnostic evaluation that establishes the necessity for the admission; (2) An assessment regarding the inappropriateness of services at a less intensive level of care; (3) A comprehensive, biopsychosocial assessment and diagnostic formulation; (4) A specific individualized treatment plan that integrates measurable goals/objectives and their required level of care for each of the patient's problems that are a focus of treatment; (5) A specific plan for involvement of family members, unless therapeutically contraindicated; and (6) A discharge plan, including an objective of referring the patient to further services, if needed, at less intensive levels of care within the benefit limited period. (D) Preauthorization requests should be made not fewer than two business days prior to the planned admission. In general, the decision regarding preauthorization shall be made within one business day of receipt of a request for preauthorization, and shall be followed with written confirmation. Preauthorizations are valid for the period of time, appropriate to the type of care involved, stated when the preauthorization is issued. In general, preauthorizations are valid for 30 days. (ix) Concurrent review. Concurrent review of the necessity for continued stay will be conducted no less frequently than every 30 days. The criteria for concurrent review shall be those set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(vii) of this section. In applying those criteria in the context of concurrent review, special emphasis is placed on evaluating the progress being made in the active individualized clinical treatment being provided and on developing appropriate discharge plans. (5) Extent of institutional benefits--(i) Inpatient room accommodations--(A) Semiprivate. The allowable costs for room and board furnished an individual patient are payable for semiprivate accommodations in a hospital or other authorized institution, subject to appropriate cost-sharing provisions (refer to paragraph (f) of this section). A semiprivate accommodation is a room containing at least two beds. Therefore, if a room publicly is designated by the institution as a semiprivate accommodation and contains multiple beds, it qualifies as semiprivate for the purpose of CHAMPUS. (B) Private. A room with one bed that is designated as a private room by the hospital or other authorized institutional provider. The allowable cost of a private room accommodation is covered only under the following conditions: (1) When its use is required medically and when the attending physician certifies that a private room is necessary medically for the proper care and treatment of a patient; or (2) When a patient's medical condition requires isolation; or (3) When a patient (in need of immediate inpatient care but not requiring a private room) is admitted to a hospital or other authorized institution that has semiprivate accommodations, but at the time of admission, such accommodations are occupied; or (4) When a patient is admitted to an acute care hospital (general or special) without semiprivate rooms. (C) Duration of private room stay. The allowable cost of private accommodations is covered under the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section until the patient's condition no longer requires the private room for medical reasons or medical isolation; or, in the case of the patient not requiring a private room, when a semiprivate accommodation becomes available; or, in the case of an acute care hospital (general or special) which does not have semiprivate rooms, for the duration of an otherwise covered inpatient stay. (D) Hospital (except an acute care hospital, general or special) or other authorized institutional provider without semiprivate accommodations. When a beneficiary is admitted to a hospital (except an acute care hospital, general or special) or other institution that has no semiprivate accommodations, for any inpatient day when the patient qualifies for use of a private room (as set forth in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(B) (1) [[Page 102]] and (2) of this section) the allowable cost of private accommodations is covered. For any inpatient day in such a hospital or other authorized institution when the patient does not require medically the private room, the allowable cost of semiprivate accommodations is covered, such allowable costs to be determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (ii) General staff nursing services. General staff nursing services cover all nursing care (other than that provided by private duty nurses) including, but not limited to, general duty nursing, emergency room nursing, recovery room nursing, intensive nursing care, and group nursing arrangements. Only nursing services provided by nursing personnel on the payroll of the hospital or other authorized institution are eligible under paragraph (b) of this section. If a nurse who is not on the payroll of the hospital or other authorized institution is called in specifically to care for a single patient (individual nursing) or more than one patient (group nursing), whether the patient is billed for the nursing services directly or through the hospital or other institution, such services constitute private duty (special) nursing services and are not eligible for benefits under this paragraph (the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(xv) of this section would apply). (iii) ICU. An ICU is a special segregated unit of a hospital in which patients are concentrated, by reason of serious illness, usually without regard to diagnosis. Special lifesaving techniques and equipment are available regularly and immediately within the unit, and patients are under continuous observation by a nursing staff specially trained and selected for the care of this type of patient. The unit is maintained on a continuing, rather than an intermittent or temporary, basis. It is not a postoperative recovery room or a postanesthesia room. In some large or highly specialized hospitals, the ICUs may be refined further for special purposes, such as for respiratory conditions, cardiac surgery, coronary care, burn care, or neurosurgery. For purposes of CHAMPUS, these specialized units would be considered ICUs if they otherwise conformed to the definition of an ICU. (iv) Treatment rooms. Standard treatment rooms include emergency rooms, operating rooms, recovery rooms, special treatment rooms, and hyperbaric chambers and all related necessary medical staff and equipment. To be recognized for purposes of CHAMPUS, treatment rooms must be so designated and maintained by the hospital or other authorized institutions on a continuing basis. A treatment room set up on an intermittent or temporary basis would not be so recognized. (v) Drugs and medicines. Drugs and medicines are included as a supply of a hospital or other authorized institution only under the following conditions: (A) They represent a cost to the facility rendering treatment; (B) They are furnished to a patient receiving treatment, and are related directly to that treatment; and (C) They are ordinarily furnished by the facility for the care and treatment of inpatients. (vi) Durable medical equipment, medical supplies, and dressings. Durable medical equipment, medical supplies, and dressings are included as a supply of a hospital or other authorized institution only under the following conditions: (A) If ordinarily furnished by the facility for the care and treatment of patients; and (B) If specifically related to, and in connection with, the condition for which the patient is being treated; and (C) If ordinarily furnished to a patient for use in the hospital or other authorized institution (except in the case of a temporary or disposable item); and (D) Use of durable medical equipment is limited to those items provided while the patient is an inpatient. If such equipment is provided for use on an outpatient basis, the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section apply. (vii) Transitional use items. Under certain circumstances, a temporary or disposable item may be provided for use beyond an inpatient stay, when such item is necessary medically to permit or facilitate the patient's departure from the hospital or other authorized institution, or which may be required [[Page 103]] until such time as the patient can obtain a continuing supply; or it would be unreasonable or impossible from a medical standpoint to discontinue the patient's use of the item at the time of termination of his or her stay as an inpatient. (viii) Anesthetics and oxygen. Anesthetics and oxygen and their administration are considered a service or supply if furnished by the hospital or other authorized institution, or by others under arrangements made by the facility under which the billing for such services is made through the facility. (6) Inpatient mental health services. Inpatient mental health services are those services furnished by institutional and professional providers for treatment of a nervous or mental disorder (as defined in Sec. 199.2) to a patient admitted to a CHAMPUS-authorized acute care general hospital; a psychiatric hospital; or, unless otherwise exempted, a special institutional provider. (i) Criteria for determining medical or psychological necessity. In determining the medical or psychological necessity of acute inpatient mental health services, the evaluation conducted by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) shall consider the appropriate level of care for the patient, the intensity of services required by the patient, and the availability of that care. The purpose of such acute inpatient care is to stabilize a life-threatening or severely disabling condition within the context of a brief, intensive model of inpatient care in order to permit management of the patient's condition at a less intensive level of care. Such care is appropriate only if the patient requires services of an intensity and nature that are generally recognized as being effectively and safely provided only in an acute inpatient hospital setting. In addition to the criteria set forth in this paragraph (b)(6) of this section, additional evaluation standards, consistent with such criteria, may be adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee). Acute inpatient care shall not be considered necessary unless the patient needs to be observed and assessed on a 24-hour basis by skilled nursing staff, and/or requires continued intervention by a multidisciplinary treatment team; and in addition, at least one of the following criteria is determined to be met: (A) Patient poses a serious risk of harm to self and/or others. (B) Patient is in need of high dosage, intensive medication or somatic and/or psychological treatment, with potentially serious side effects. (C) Patient has acute disturbances of mood, behavior, or thinking. (ii) Emergency admissions. Admission to an acute inpatient hospital setting may be on an emergency or on a non-emergency basis. In order for an admission to qualify as an emergency, the following criteria, in addition to those in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, must be met: (A) The patient must be at immediate risk of serious harm to self and or others based on a psychiatric evaluation performed by a physician (or other qualified mental health professional with hospital admission authority); and (B) The patient requires immediate continuous skilled observation and treatment at the acute psychiatric level of care. (iii) Preauthorization requirements. (A) With the exception noted in paragraph (a)(12)(ii)(E) of this section, all non-emergency admissions to an acute inpatient hospital level of care must be authorized prior to the admission.The criteria for preauthorization shall be those set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. In applying those criteria in the context of preauthorization review, special emphasis is placed on the development of a specific individualized treatment plan, consistent with those criteria and reasonably expected to be effective, for that individual patient. (B) The timetable for development of the individualized treatment plan shall be as follows: (1) The development of the plan must begin immediately upon admission. (2) A preliminary treatment plan must be established within 24 hours of the admission. (3) A master treatment plan must be established within five calendar days of the admission. [[Page 104]] (C) The elements of the individualized treatment plan must include: (1) The diagnostic evaluation that establishes the necessity for the admission; (2) An assessment regarding the inappropriateness of services at a less intensive level of care; (3) A comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and diagnostic formulation; (4) A specific individualized treatment plan that integrates measurable goals/objectives and their required level of care for each of the patient's problems that are a focus of treatment; (5) A specific plan for involvement of family members, unless therapeutically contraindicated; and (6) A discharge plan, including an objective of referring the patient to further services, if needed, at less intensive levels of care within the benefit limit period. (D) The request for preauthorization must be received by the reviewer designated by the Director, OCHAMPUS prior to the planned admission. In general, the decision regarding preauthorization shall be made within one business day of receipt of a request for preauthorization, and shall be followed with written confirmation. In the case of an authorization issued after an admission resulting from approval of a request made prior to the admission, the effective date of the certification shall be the date of the receipt of the request. However, if the request on which the approved authorization is based was made after the admission (and the case was not an emergency admission), the effective date of the authorization shall be the date of approval. (E) Authorization prior to admission is not required in the case of a psychiatric emergency requiring an inpatient acute level of care, but authorization for a continuation of services must be obtained promptly. Admissions resulting from a bona fide psychiatric emergency should be reported within 24 hours of the admission or the next business day after the admission, but must be reported to the Director, OCHAMPUS or a designee, within 72 hours of the admission. In the case of an emergency admission authorization resulting from approval of a request made within 72 hours of the admission, the effective date of the authorization shall be the date of the admission. However, if it is determined that the case was not a bona fide psychiatric emergency admission (but the admission can be authorized as medically or psychologically necessary), the effective date of the authorization shall be the date of the receipt of the request. (iv) Concurrent review. Concurrent review of the necessity for continued stay will be conducted. The criteria for concurrent review shall be those set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. In applying those criteria in the context of concurrent review, special emphasis is placed on evaluating the progress being made in the active clinical treatment being provided and on developing/refining appropriate discharge plans. In general, the decision regarding concurrent review shall be made within one business day of the review, and shall be followed with written confirmation. (7) Emergency inpatient hospital services. In the case of a medical emergency, benefits can be extended for medically necessary inpatient services and supplies provided to a beneficiary by a hospital, including hospitals that do not meet CHAMPUS standards or comply with the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act, or satisfy other conditions herein set forth. In a medical emergency, medically necessary inpatient services and supplies are those that are necessary to prevent the death or serious impairment of the health of the patient, and that, because of the threat to the life or health of the patient, necessitate, the use of the most accessible hospital available and equipped to furnish such services. The availability of benefits depends upon the following three separate findings and continues only as long as the emergency exists, as determined by medical review. If the case qualified as an emergency at the time of admission to an unauthorized institutional provider and the emergency subsequently is determined no longer to exist, benefits will be extended up through the date of notice to the beneficiary and provider that CHAMPUS benefits no longer are payable in that hospital. [[Page 105]] (i) Existence of medical emergency. A determination that a medical emergency existed with regard to the patient's condition; (ii) Immediate admission required. A determination that the condition causing the medical emergency required immediate admission to a hospital to provide the emergency care; and (iii) Closest hospital utilized. A determination that diagnosis or treatment was received at the most accessible (closest) hospital available and equipped to furnish the medically necessary care. (8) RTC day limit. (i) With respect to mental health services provided on or after October 1, 1991, benefits for residential treatment are generally limited to 150 days in a fiscal year or 150 days in an admission (not including days of care prior to October 1, 1991). The RTC benefit limit is separate from the benefit limit for acute inpatient mental health care. (ii) Waiver of the RTC day limit. (A) There is a statutory presumption against the appropriateness of residential treatment services in excess of the 150 day limit. However, the Director, OCHAMPUS, (or designee) may in special cases, after considering the opinion of the peer review designated by the Director (involving a health professional who is not a federal employee) confirming that applicable criteria have been met, waive the RTC benefit limit in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section and authorize payment for care beyond that limit. (B) The criteria for waiver shall be those set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(vii) of this section. In applying those criteria to the context of waiver request reviews, special emphasis is placed on assuring that the record documents that: (1) Active treatment has taken place for the past 150 days and substantial progress has been made according to the plan of treatment. (2) The progress made is insufficient, due to the complexity of the illness, for the patient to be discharged to a less intensive level of care. (3) Specific evidence is presented to explain the factors which interfered with treatment progress during the 150 days of RTC care. (4) The waiver request includes specific timeframes and a specific plan of treatment which will lead to discharge. (C) Where family or social issues complicate transfer to a lower level of intensity, the RTC is responsible for determining and arranging the supportive and adjunctive resources required to permit appropriate transfer. If the RTC fails adequately to meet this responsibility, the existence of such family or social issues shall be an inadequate basis for a waiver of the benefit limit. (D) It is the responsibility of the patient's primary care provider to establish, through actual documentation from the medical record and other sources, that the conditions for waiver exist. (iii) RTC day limits do not apply to services provided under the Program for Persons with Disabilities (Sec. 199.5) or services provided as partial hospitalization care. (9) Acute care day limits. (i) With respect to mental health care services provided on or after October 1, 1991, payment for inpatient acute hospital care is, in general, statutorily limited as follows: (A) Adults, aged 19 and over--30 days in a fiscal year or 30 days in an admission (excluding days provided prior to October 1, 1991). (B) Children and adolescents, aged 18 and under--45 days in a fiscal year or 45 days in an admission (excluding days provided prior to October 1, 1991). (ii) It is the patient's age at the time of admission that determines the number of days available. (iii) Waiver of the acute care day limits. (A) There is a statutory presumption against the appropriateness of inpatient acute services in excess of the day limits set forth in paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section. However, the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) may in special cases, after considering the opinion of the peer review designated by the Director (involving a health professional who is not a federal employee) confirming that applicable criteria have been met, waive the acute inpatient limits described in paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section and authorize payment for care beyond those limits. [[Page 106]] (B) The criteria for waiver of the acute inpatient limit shall be those set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. In applying those criteria in the context of waiver request review, special emphasis is placed on determining whether additional days of acute inpatient mental health care are medically/psychologically necessary to complete necessary elements of the treatment plan prior to implementing appropriate discharge planning. A waiver may also be granted in cases in which a patient exhibits well-documented new symptoms, maladaptive behavior, or medical complications which have appeared in the inpatient setting requiring a significant revision to the treatment plan. (C) The clinician responsible for the patient's care is responsible for documenting that a waiver criterion has been met and must establish an estimated length of stay beyond the date of the inpatient limit. There must be evidence of a coherent and specific plan for assessment, intervention and reassessment that reasonably can be accomplished within the time frame of the additional days of coverage requested under the waiver provision. (D) For patients in care at the time the inpatient limit is reached, a waiver must be requested prior to the limit. For patients being readmitted after having received 30 or 45 days in the fiscal year, the waiver review will be conducted at the time of the preadmission authorization. (iv) Acute care day limits do not apply to services provided under the Program for Persons with Disabilities (Sec. 199.5) or services provided as partial hospitalization care. (10) Psychiatric partial hospitalization services. (i) In general. Partial hospitalization services are those services furnished by a CHAMPUS-authorized partial hospitalization program and authorized mental health providers for the active treatment of a mental disorder. All services must follow a medical model and vest patient care under the general direction of a licensed psychiatrist employed by the partial hospitalization center to ensure medication and physical needs of all the patients are considered. The primary or attending provider must be a CHAMPUS authorized mental health provider, operating within the scope of his/her license. These categories include physicians, clinical psychologists, certified psychiatric nurse specialists, clinical social workers, marriage and family counselors, pastoral counselors and mental health counselors. Partial hospitalization services are covered as a basic program benefit only if they are provided in accordance with paragraph (b)(10) of this section. (ii) Criteria for determining medical or psychological necessity of psychiatric partial hospitalization services. Psychiatric partial hospitalization services will be considered necessary only if all of the following conditions are present: (A) The patient is suffering significant impairment from a mental disorder (as defined in Sec. 199.2) which interferes with age appropriate functioning. (B) The patient is unable to maintain himself or herself in the community, with appropriate support, at a sufficient level of functioning to permit an adequate course of therapy exclusively on an outpatient basis (but is able, with appropriate support, to maintain a basic level of functioning to permit partial hospitalization services and presents no substantial imminent risk of harm to self or others). (C) The patient is in need of crisis stabilization, treatment of partially stabilized mental health disorders, or services as a transition from an inpatient program. (D) The admission into the partial hospitalization program is based on the development of an individualized diagnosis and treatment plan expected to be effective for that patient and permit treatment at a less intensive level. (iii) Preauthorization and concurrent review requirements. All preadmission authorization and concurrent review requirements and procedures applicable to acute mental health inpatient hospital care in paragraphs (a)(12) and (b) of this section are applicable to the partial hospitalization program, except that the criteria for considering medical or psychological necessity shall be those set forth in paragraph (b)(10)(ii) of this section, and no emergency admissions will be recognized. [[Page 107]] (iv) Institutional benefits limited to 60 days. Benefits for institutional services for partial hospitalization are limited to 60 treatment days (whether a full day or partial day program) in a fiscal year or in an admission. This limit may be extended by waiver. (v) Waiver of the 60-day partial hospitalization program limit. The Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) may, in special cases, waive the 60-day partial hospitalization benefit and authorize payment for care beyond the 60-day limit. (A) the criteria for waiver are set forth in paragraph (b)(10)(ii) of this section. In applying these criteria in the context of waiver request review, special emphasis is placed on determining whether additional days of partial hospitalization are medically/psychologically necessary to complete essential elements of the treatment plan prior to discharge. Consideration is also given in cases in which a patient exhibits well-documented new symptoms or maladaptive behaviors which have appeared in the partial hospitalization setting requiring significant revisions to the treatment plan. (B) The clinician responsible for the patient's care is responsible for documenting the need for additional days and must establish an estimated length of stay beyond the date of the 60-day limit. There must be evidence of a coherent and specific plan for assessment, intervention and reassessment that reasonably can be accomplished within the time frame of the additional days of coverage requested under the waiver provisions. (C) For patients in care at the time the partial hospitalization program limit is reached, a waiver must be requested prior to the limit. For patients being preadmitted after having received 60 days in the fiscal year, the waiver review will be conducted at the time of the preadmission authorization. (vi) Services and supplies. The following services and supplies are included in the per diem rate approved for an authorized partial hospitalization program: (A) Board. Includes use of the partial hospital facilities such as food service, supervised therapeutically constructed recreational and social activities, and other general services as considered appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (B) Patient assessment. Includes the assessment of each individual accepted by the facility, and must, at a minimum, consist of a physical examination; psychiatric examination; psychological assessment; assessment of physiological, biological and cognitive processes; developmental assessment; family history and assessment; social history and assessment; educational or vocational history and assessment; environmental assessment; and recreational/activities assessment. Assessments conducted within 30 days prior to admission to a partial program may be used if approved and deemed adequate to permit treatment planning by the partial hospital program. (C) Psychological testing. (D) Treatment services. All services, supplies, equipment and space necessary to fulfill the requirements of each patient's individualized diagnosis and treatment plan (with the exception of the five psychotherapy sessions per week which may be allowed separately for individual or family psychotherapy based upon the provisions of paragraph (b)(10)(vii) of this section). All mental health services must be provided by a CHAMPUS authorized individual professional provider of mental health services. [Exception: PHPs that employ individuals with master's or doctoral level degrees in a mental health discipline who do not meet the licensure, certification and experience requirements for a qualified mental health provider but are actively working toward licensure or certification, may provide services within the all- inclusive per diem rate but the individual must work under the clinical supervision of a fully qualified mental health provider employed by the PHP.] (vii) Social services required. The facility must provide an active social services component which assures the patient appropriate living arrangements after treatment hours, transportation to and from the facility, arrangement of community based support services, referral of suspected child abuse to the appropriate state agencies, and effective after care arrangements, at a minimum. [[Page 108]] (viii) Educational services required. Programs treating children and adolescents must ensure the provision of a state certified educational component which assures that patients do not fall behind in educational placement while receiving partial hospital treatment. CHAMPUS will not fund the cost of educational services separately from the per diem rate. The hours devoted to education do not count toward the therapeutic half or full day program. (ix) Family therapy required. The facility must ensure the provision of an active family therapy treatment component which assures that each patient and family participate at least weekly in family therapy provided by the institution and rendered by a CHAMPUS authorized individual professional provider of mental health services. There is no acceptable substitute for family therapy. An exception to this requirement may be granted on a case-by-case basis by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, only if family therapy is clinically contraindicated. (x) Professional mental health benefits limited. Professional mental health benefits are limited to a maximum of one session (60 minutes individual, 90 minutes family) per authorized treatment day not to exceed five sessions in any calendar week. These may be billed separately from the partial hospitalization per diem rate only when rendered by an attending, CHAMPUS-authorized mental health professional who is not an employee of, or under contract with, the partial hospitalization program for purposes of providing clinical patient care. (xi) Non-mental health related medical services. Separate billing will be allowed for otherwise covered, non-mental health related medical services. (c) Professional services benefit--(1) General. Benefits may be extended for those covered services described in paragraph (c) of this section that are provided in accordance with good medical practice and established standards of quality by physicians or other authorized individual professional providers, as set forth in Sec. 199.6 of this part. Such benefits are subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, exceptions, limitations, or exclusions as maybe otherwise set forth in this or other Sections of this part. Except as otherwise specifically authorized, to be considered for benefits under paragraph (c) of this section, the described services must be rendered by a physician, or prescribed, ordered, and referred medically by a physician to other authorized individual professional providers. Further, except under specifically defined circumstances, there should be an attending physician in any episode of care. (For example, certain services of a clinical psychologist are exempt from this requirement. For these exceptions, refer to Sec. 199.6.) (i) Billing practices. To be considered for benefits under paragraph (c) of this section, covered professional services must be performed personally by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider, who is other than a salaried or contractual staff member of a hospital or other authorized institution, and who ordinarily and customarily bills on a fee-for-service basis for professional services rendered. Such billings must be itemized fully and be sufficiently descriptive to permit CHAMPUS to determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. See paragraph (c)(3)(xiii) of this section for the requirements regarding the special circumstances for teaching physicians. For continuing professional care, claims should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days either by the beneficiary or sponsor, or directly by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider on behalf of a beneficiary (refer to Sec. 199.7). (ii) Services must be related. Covered professional services must be rendered in connection with and directly related to a covered diagnosis or definitive set of symptoms requiring medically necessary treatment. (2) Covered services of physicians and other authorized profession providers. (i) Surgery. Surgery means operative procedures, including related preoperative and postoperative care; reduction of fractures and dislocations; injection and needling procedures of the joints; laser surgery of the the following procedures: dye, with exposure of carotid artery, unilateral Ventriculography Insufflation of uterus and fallopian tubes for determination of tubal patency (Rubin's test of injection of radiopaque medium or for dilation) Introduction of opaque media into the cranial arterial system, preliminary to cerebral arteriography, or into vertebral and subclavian systems Intraspinal introduction of air preliminary to pneumoencephalography Intraspinal introduction of opaque media preliminary to myelography Intraventricular introduction of air preliminary to ventriculography Note: The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall determine such additional procedures that may fall within the intent of this definition of ``surgery.'' (ii) Surgical assistance. (iii) Inpatient medical services. (iv) Outpatient medical services. (v) Psychiatric services. (vi) Consultation services. (vii) Anesthesia services. (viii) Radiation therapy services. (ix) X-ray services. (x) Laboratory and pathological services. (xi) Physical medicine services or physiatry services. (xii) Maternity care. (xiii) Well-child care. (xiv) Other medical care. Other medical care includes, but is not limited to, hemodialysis, inhalation therapy, shock therapy, and chemotherapy. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall determine those additional medical services for which benefits may be extended under this paragraph. Note: A separate professional charge for the oral administration of approved antineoplastic drugs is not covered. (xv) [Reserved] (xvi) Routine eye examinations. Coverage for routine eye examinations is limited to dependents of active duty members, to one examination per calendar year per person, and to services rendered on or after October 1, 1984, except as provided under paragraph (c)(3)(xi) of this section. (3) Extent of professional benefits-- (i) Multiple Surgery. In cases of multiple surgical procedures performed during the same operative session, benefits shall be extended as follows: (A) One hundred (100) percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge for the major surgical procedure (the procedure for which the greatest amount is payable under the applicable reimbursement method); and (B) Fifty (50) percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge for each of the other surgical procedures; (C) Except that: (1) If the multiple surgical procedures involve the fingers or toes, benefits for the first surgical procedure shall be at one hundred (100) percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge; the second procedure at fifty (50) percent; and the third and subsequent procedures at twenty-five (25) percent. (2) If the multiple surgical procedures include an incidental procedure, no benefits shall be allowed for the incidental procedure. (3) If the multiple surgical procedures involve specific procedures identified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, benefits shall be limited as set forth in CHAMPUS instructions. (ii) Different types of inpatient care, concurrent. If a beneficiary receives inpatient medical care during the same admission in which he or she also receives surgical care or maternity care, the beneficiary shall be entitled to the greater of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge for either the inpatient medical care or surgical or maternity care received, as the case may be, but not both; except that the provisions of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) shall not apply if such inpatient medical [[Page 110]] care is for a diagnosed condition requiring inpatient medical care not related to the condition for which surgical care or maternity care is received, and is received from a physician other than the one rendering the surgical care or maternity care. Note: This provision is not meant to imply that when extra time and special effort are required due to postsurgical or postdelivery complications, the attending physician may not request special consideration for a higher than usual charge. (iii) Need for surgical assistance. Surgical assistance is payable only when the complexity of the procedure warrants a surgical assistant (other than the surgical nurse or other such operating room personnel), subject to utilization review. In order for benefits to be extended for surgical assistance service, the primary surgeon may be required to certify in writing to the nonavailability of a qualified intern, resident, or other house physician. When a claim is received for a surgical assistant involving the following circumstances, special review is required to ascertain whether the surgical assistance service meets the medical necessity and other requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. (A) If the surgical assistance occurred in a hospital that has a residency program in a specialty appropriate to the surgery; (B) If the surgery was performed by a team of surgeons; (C) If there were multiple surgical assistants; or (D) If the surgical assistant was a partner of or from the same group of practicing physicians as the attending surgeon. (iv) Aftercare following surgery. Except for those diagnostic procedures classified as surgery in paragraph (c) of this section, and injection and needling procedures involving the joints, the benefit payments made for surgery (regardless of the setting in which it is rendered) include normal aftercare, whether the aftercare is billed for by the physician or other authorized individual professional provider on a global, all-inclusive basis, or billed for separately. (v) Cast and sutures, removal. The benefit payments made for the application of a cast or of sutures normally covers the postoperative care including the removal of the cast or sutures. When the application is made in one geographical location and the removal of the cast or sutures must be done in another geographical location, a separate benefit payment may be provided for the removal. The intent of this provision is to provide a separate benefit only when it is impracticable for the beneficiary to use the services of the provider that applied the cast originally. Benefits are not available for the services of a second provider if those services reasonably could have been rendered by the individual professional provider who applied the cast or sutures initially. (vi) Inpatient care, concurrent. Concurrent inpatient care by more than one individual professional provider is covered if required because of the severity and complexity of the beneficiary's condition or because the beneficiary has multiple conditions that require treatment by providers of different specialities. Any claim for concurrent care must be reviewed before extending benefits in order to ascertain the condition of the beneficiary at the time the concurrent care was rendered. In the absence of such determination, benefits are payable only for inpatient care rendered by one attending physician or other authorized individual professional provider. (vii) Consultants who become the attending surgeon. A consultation performed within 3 days of surgery by the attending physician is considered a preoperative examination. Preoperative examinations are an integral part of the surgery and a separate benefit is not payable for the consultation. If more than 3 days elapse between the consultation and surgery (performed by the same physician), benefits may be extended for the consultation, subject to review. (viii) Anesthesia administered by the attending physician. A separate benefit is not payable for anesthesia administered by the attending physician (surgeon or obstetrician) or dentist, or by the surgical, obstetrical, or dental assistant. (ix) Treatment of mental disorders. CHAMPUS benefits for the treatment [[Page 111]] of mental disorders are payable for beneficiaries who are outpatients or inpatients of CHAMPUS-authorized general or psychiatric hospitals, RTCs, or specialized treatment facilities, as authorized by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. All such services are subject to review for medical or psychological necessity and for quality of care. The Director, OCHAMPUS, reserves the right to require preauthorization of mental health services. Preauthorization may be conducted by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. In order to qualify for CHAMPUS mental health benefits, the patient must be diagnosed by a CHAMPUS- authorized licensed, qualified mental health professional to be suffering from a mental disorder, according to the criteria listed in the most current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders which may be purchased from the American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1400 K Street, NW., suite 1101, Washington, DC 20005. Benefits are limited for certain mental disorders, such as specific developmental disorders. No benefits are payable for ``Conditions Not Attributable to a Mental Disorder,'' or V codes. In order for treatment of a mental disorder to be medically or psychologically necessary, the patient must, as a result of a diagnosed mental disorder, be experiencing both physical or psychological distress and an impairment in his or her ability to function in appropriate occupational, educational or social roles. It is generally the degree to which the patient's ability to function is impaired that determines the level of care (if any) required to treat the patient's condition. (A) Covered diagnostic and therapeutic services. Subject to the requirements and limitations stated, CHAMPUS benefits are payable for the following services when rendered in the diagnosis or treatment of a covered mental disorder by a CHAMPUS-authorized, qualified mental health provider practicing within the scope of his or her license. Qualified mental health providers are: psychiatrists or other physicians; clinical psychologists, certified psychiatric nurse specialists, clinical social workers, and certified marriage and family therapists; and pastoral and mental health counselors under a physician's supervision. No payment will be made for any service listed in paragraph (c)(3)(ix)(A) of this section rendered by an individual who does not meet the criteria of Sec. 199.6 for his or her respective profession, regardless of whether the provider is an independent professional provider or an employee of an authorized professional or institutional provider. (1) Individual psychotherapy, adult or child. A covered individual psychotherapy session is no more than 60 minutes in length. An individual psychotherapy session of up to 120 minutes in length is payable for crisis intervention. (2) Group psychotherapy. A covered group psychotherapy session is no more than 90 minutes in length. (3) Family or conjoint psychotherapy. A covered family or conjoint psychotherapy session is no more than 90 minutes in length. A family or conjoint psychotherapy session of up to 180 minutes in length is payable for crisis intervention. (4) Psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis is covered when provided by a graduate or candidate of a psychoanalytic training institution recognized by the American Psychoanalytic Association and when preauthorized by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (5) Psychological testing and assessment. Psychological testing and assessment is generally limited to six hours of testing in a fiscal year when medically or psychologically necessary and in conjunction with otherwise covered psychotherapy. Testing or assessment in excess of these limits requires review for medical necessity. Benefits will not be provided for the Reitan-Indiana battery when administered to a patient under age five, for self-administered tests administered to patients under age 13, or for psychological testing and assessment as part of an assessment for academic placement. (6) Administration of psychotropic drugs. When prescribed by an authorized provider qualified by licensure to prescribe drugs. (7) Electroconvulsive treatment. When provided in accordance with guidelines issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS. [[Page 112]] (8) Collateral visits. Covered collateral visits are those that are medically or psychologically necessary for the treatment of the patient and, as such, are considered as a psychotherapy session for purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(ix)(B) of this section. (B) Limitations and review requirements--(1) Outpatient psychotherapy. Outpatient psychotherapy generally is limited to a maximum of two psychotherapy sessions per week, in any combination of individual, family, conjoint, collateral, or group sessions. Before benefits can be extended for more than two outpatient psychotherapy sessions per week, professional review of the medical or psychological necessity for and appropriateness of the more intensive therapy is required. (2) Inpatient psychotherapy. Coverage of inpatient psychotherapy is based on medical or psychological necessity for the services identified in the patient's treatment plan. As a general rule, up to five psychotherapy sessions per week are considered appropriate when specified in the treatment as necessary to meet certain measurable/ observable goals and objectives. Additional sessions per week or more than one type of psychotherapy sessions performed on the same day (for example, an individual psychotherapy session and a family psychotherapy session on the same day) could be considered for coverage, depending on the medical or psychological necessity for the services. Benefits for inpatient psychotherapy will end automatically when authorization has been granted for the maximum number of inpatient mental health days in accordance with the limits as described in this section, unless additional coverage is granted by the Director, OCHAMPUS or a designee. (C) Covered ancillary therapies. Includes art, music, dance, occupational, and other ancillary therapies, when included by the attending provider in an approved inpatient, residential treatment plan and under the clinical supervision of a licensed doctoral level mental health professional. These ancillary therapies are not separately reimbursed professional services but are included within the institutional reimbursement. (D) Review of claims for treatment of mental disorder. The Director, OCHAMPUS, shall establish and maintain procedures for review, including professional review, of the services provided for the treatment of mental disorders. (x) Physical and occupational therapy. Assessment and treatment services of a CHAMPUS-authorized physical or occupational therapist may be cost-shared when: (A) The services are prescribed and monitored by a physician; (B) The purpose of the prescription is to reduce the disabling effects of an illness, injury, or neuromuscular disorder; and (C) The prescribed treatment increases, stabilizes, or slows the deterioration of the beneficiary's ability to perform specified purposeful activity in the manner, or within the range considered normal, for a human being. (xi) Well-child care. Benefits routinely are covered for well-child care from birth to under six years of age. These periodic health examinations are designed for prevention, early detection and treatment of disease and consist of screening procedures, immunizations and risk counseling. (A) The following services are covered when required as a part of the specific well-child care program and when rendered by the attending pediatrician, family physician, certified nurse practitioner, or certified physician assistant. (1) Newborn examination, heredity and metabolic screening, and newborn circumcision. (2) Periodic health supervision visits, in accordance with American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, intended to promote the optimal health for infants and children to include the following services: (i) History and physical examination and mental health assessment. (ii) Vision, hearing, and dental screening. (iii) Developmental appraisal to include body measurement. (iv) Immunizations as recommenced by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). (v) Pediatric risk assessment for lead exposure and blood lead level test. [[Page 113]] (vi) Tuberculosis screening. (vii) Blood pressure screening. (viii) Measurement of hemoglobin and hematocrit for anemia. (ix) Urinalysis. (x) Health guidance and counseling, including breastfeeding and nutrition counseling. (B) Additional services or visits required because of specific findings or because the particular circumstances of the individual case are covered if medically necessary and otherwise authorized for benefits under CHAMPUS. (C) The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Health Services Financing, will determine when such services are separately reimbursable apart from the health supervision visit. (xii) [Reserved] (xiii) Physicians in a teaching setting. (A) Teaching physicians. (1) General. The services of teaching physicians may be reimbursed on an allowable charge basis only when the teaching physician has established an attending physician relationship between the teaching physician and the patient or when the teaching physician provides distinct, identifiable, personal services (e.g., services rendered as a consultant, assistant surgeon, etc.). Attending physician services may include both direct patient care services or direct supervision of care provided by a physician in training. In order to be considered an attending physician, the teaching physician must: (i) Review the patient's history and the record of examinations and tests in the institution, and make frequent reviews of the patient's progress; and (ii) Personally examine the patient; and (iiii) Confirm or revise the diagnosis and determine the course of treatment to be followed; and (iv) Either perform the physician's services required by the patient or supervise the treatment so as to assure that appropriate services are provided by physicians in training and that the care meets a proper quality level; and (v) Be present and ready to perform any service performed by an attending physician in a nonteaching setting when a major surgical procedure or a complex or dangerous medical procedure is performed; and (vi) Be personally responsible for the patient's care, at least throughout the period of hospitalization. (2) Direct supervision by an attending physician of care provided by physicians in training. Payment on the basis of allowable charges may be made for the professional services rendered to a beneficiary by his/her attending physician when the attending physician provides personal and identifiable direction to physicians in training who are participating in the care of the patient. It is not necessary that the attending physician be personally present for all services, but the attending physician must be on the provider's premises and available to provide immediate personal assistance and direction if needed. (3) Individual, personal services. A teaching physician may be reimbursed on an allowable charge basis for any individual, identifiable service rendered to a CHAMPUS beneficiary, so long as the service is a covered service and is normally reimbursed separately, and so long as the patient records substantiate the service. (4) Who may bill. The services of a teaching physician must be billed by the institutional provider when the physician is employed by the provider or a related entity or under a contract which provides for payment to the physician by the provider or a related entity. Where the teaching physician has no relationship with the provider (except for standard physician privileges to admit patients) and generally treats patients on a fee-for-service basis in the private sector, the teaching physician may submit claims under his/her own provider number. (B) Physicians in training. Physicians in training in an approved teaching program are considered to be ``students'' and may not be reimbursed directly by CHAMPUS for services rendered to a beneficiary when their services are provided as part of their employment (either salaried or contractual) by a hospital or other institutional provider. Services of physicians in training may be reimbursed on an allowable charge basis only if: (1) The physician in training is fully licensed to practice medicine by the state in which the services are performed, and [[Page 114]] (2) The services are rendered outside the scope and requirements of the approved training program to which the physician in training is assigned. (d) Other benefits--(1) General. Benefits may be extended for the allowable charge of those other covered services and supplies described in paragraph (d) of this section, which are provided in accordance with good medical practice and established standards of quality by those other authorized providers described in Sec. 199.6 of this Regulation. Such benefits are subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, or exclusions as otherwise may be set forth in this or other chapters of this Regulation. To be considered for benefits under paragraph (d) of this section, the described services or supplies must be prescribed and ordered by a physician. Other authorized individual professional providers acting within their scope of licensure may also prescribe and order these services and supplies unless otherwise specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For example, durable medical equipment and cardiorespiratory monitors can only be ordered by a physician. (2) Billing practices. To be considered for benefits under paragraph (d) of this section, covered services and supplies must be provided and billed for by an authorized provider as set forth in Sec. 199.6 of this part. Such billing must be itemized fully and described sufficiently, even when CHAMPUS payment is determined under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, so that CHAMPUS can determine whether benefits are authorized by this part. Except for claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG- based payment system, whenever continuing charges are involved, claims should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days (monthly) either by the beneficiary or sponsor or directly by the provider. For claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, claims may be submitted only after the beneficiary has been discharged or transferred from the hospital. (3) Other covered services and supplies--(i) Blood. If whole blood or plasma (or its derivatives) are provided and billed for by an authorized institution in connection with covered treatment, benefits are extended as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If blood is billed for directly to a beneficiary, benefits may be extended under paragraph (d) in the same manner as a medical supply. (ii) Durable medical equipment--(A) Scope of benefit.Subject to the exceptions in paragraphs (B) and (C) below, only durable medical equipment (DME) which is ordered by a physician for the specific use of the beneficiary, and which complies with the definition of ``Durable Medical Equipment'' in Sec. 199.2 of this part, and which is not otherwise excluded by this Regulation qualifies as a Basic Program benefit. (B) Cardiorespiratory monitor exception. (1) When prescribed by a physician who is otherwise eligible as a CHAMPUS individual professional provider, or who is on active duty with a United States Uniformed Service, an electronic cardiorespiratory monitor, including technical support necessary for the proper use of the monitor, may be cost-shared as durable medical equipment when supervised by the prescribing physician for in-home use by: (i) An infant beneficiary who has had an apparent life-threatening event, as defined in guidelines issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or (ii) An infant beneficiary who is a subsequent or multiple birth biological sibling of a victim of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), or (iii) An infant beneficiary whose birth weight was 1,500 grams or less, or (iv) An infant beneficiary who is a pre-term infant with pathologic apnea, as defined in guidelines issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or (v) Any beneficiary who has a condition or suspected condition designated in guidelines issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for which the in-home use of the cardiorespiratory monitor otherwise meets Basic Program requirements. (2) The following types of services and items may be cost-shared when provided in conjunction with an otherwise authorized cardiorespiratory monitor: (i) Trend-event recorder, including technical support necessary for the proper use of the recorder. [[Page 115]] (ii) Analysis of recorded physiological data associated with monitor alarms. (iii) Professional visits for services otherwise authorized by this part, and for family training on how to respond to an apparent life threatening event. (iv) Diagnostic testing otherwise authorized by this part. (C) Basic mobility equipment exception. A wheelchair, or a CHAMPUS- approved alternative, which is medically necessary to provide basic mobility, including reasonable additional cost for medically necessary modifications to accommodate a particular disability, may be cost-shared as durable medical equipment. (D) Exclusions. DME which is otherwise qualified as a benefit is excluded as a benefit under the following circumstances: (1) DME for a beneficiary who is a patient in a type of facility that ordinarily provides the same type of DME item to its patients at no additional charge in the usual course of providing its services. (2) DME which is available to the beneficiary from a Uniformed Services Medical Treatment Facility. (3) DME with deluxe, luxury, or immaterial features which increase the cost of the item to the government relative to a similar item without those features. (E) Basis for reimbursement. The cost of DME may be shared by the CHAMPUS based upon the price which is most advantageous to the government taking into consideration the anticipated duration of the medically necessary need for the equipment and current price information for the type of item. The cost analysis must include comparison of the total price of the item as a monthly rental charge, a lease-purchase price, and a lump-sum purchase price and a provision for the time value of money at the rate determined by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. (iii) Medical supplies and dressings (consumables). Medical supplies and dressings (consumables) are those that do not withstand prolonged, repeated use. Such items must be related directly to an appropriate and verified covered medical condition of the specific beneficiary for whom the item was purchased and obtained from a medical supply company, a pharmacy, or authorized institutional provider. Examples of covered medical supplies and dressings are disposable syringes for a known diabetic, colostomy sets, irrigation sets, and elastic bandages. An external surgical garment specifically designed for use following a mastectomy is considered a medical supply item. Note: Generally, the allowable charge of a medical supply item will be under $100. Any item over this amount must be reviewed to determine whether it would not qualify as a DME item. If it is, in fact, a medical supply item and does not represent an excessive charge, it can be considered for benefits under paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section. (iv) Oxygen. Oxygen and equipment for its administration are covered. Benefits are limited to providing a tank unit at one location with oxygen limited to a 30-day supply at any one time. Repair and adjustment of CHAMPUS-purchased oxygen equipment also is covered. (v) Ambulance. Civilian ambulance service is covered when medically necessary in connection with otherwise covered services and supplies and a covered medical condition. For the purpose of TRICARE payment, ambulance service is an outpatient service (including in connection with maternity care) with the exception of otherwise covered transfers between hospitals which are cost-shared on an inpatient basis. Ambulance transfers from a hospital based emergency room to another hospital more capable of providing the required care will also be cost-shared on an inpatient basis. Note: The inpatient cost-sharing provisions for ambulance transfers only apply to otherwise covered transfers between hospitals, i.e., acute care, general, and special hospitals; psychiatric hospitals; and long- term hospitals. (A) Ambulance service cannot be used instead of taxi service and is not payable when the patient's condition would have permitted use of regular private transportation; nor is it payable when transport or transfer of a patient is primarily for the purpose of having the patient nearer to home, family, friends, or personal physician. Except as described in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(1) of this section transport [[Page 116]] must be to the closest appropriate facility by the least costly means. (B) Vehicles such as medicabs or ambicabs function primarily as public passenger conveyances transporting patients to and from their medical appointments. No actual medical care is provided to the patients in transit. These types of vehicles do not qualify for benefits for the purpose of CHAMPUS payment. (C) Except as described in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(C)(1)(1) of this section, ambulance services by other than land vehicles (such as a boat or airplane) may be considered only when the pickup point is inaccessible by a land vehicle, or when great distance or other obstacles are involved in transporting the patient to the nearest hospital with appropriate facilities and the patient's medical condition warrants speedy admission or is such that transfer by other means is contraindicated. (1) Advanced life support air ambulance and certified advanced life support attendant are covered services for solid organ and stem cell transplant candidates. (2) Advanced life support air ambulance and certified advanced life support attendant shall be reimbursed subject to standard reimbursement methodologies. (vi) Prescription drugs and medicines. Prescription drugs and medicines that by United States law require a physician's or other authorized individual professional provider's prescription (acting within the scope of their license) and that are ordered or prescribed by a physician or other authorized individual professional provider (except that insulin is covered for a known diabetic, even though a prescription may not be required for its purchase) in connection with an otherwise covered condition or treatment, including Rh immune globulin. (A) Drugs administered by a physician or other authorized individual professional provider as an integral part of a procedure covered under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section (such as chemotherapy) are not covered under this subparagraph inasmuch as the benefit for the institutional services or the professional services in connection with the procedure itself also includes the drug used. (B) CHAMPUS benefits may not be extended for drugs not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for commercial marketing. Drugs grandfathered by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 may be covered under CHAMPUS as if FDA approved. (vii) Prosthetic devices. The purchase of prosthetic devices is limited to those determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS to be necessary because of significant conditions resulting from trauma, congenital anomalies, or disease. (viii) Orthopedic braces and appliances. The purchase of leg braces (including attached shoes), arm braces, back braces, and neck braces is covered, orthopedic shoes, arch supports, shoe inserts, and other supportive devices for the feet, including special-ordered, custom-made built-up shoes or regular shoes subsequently built up, are not covered. (e) Special benefit information--(1) General. There are certain circumstances, conditions, or limitations that impact the extension of benefits and that require special emphasis and explanation. This paragraph (e) sets forth those benefits and limitations recognized to be in this category. The benefits and limitations herein described also are subject to all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, exceptions, and exclusions as set forth in this or other sections of this part, except as otherwise may be provided specifically in this paragraph (e). (2) Abortion. The statute under which CHAMPUS operates prohibits payment for abortions with one single exception--where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. Covered abortion services are limited to medical services and supplies only. Physician certification is required attesting that the abortion was performed because the mother's life would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. Abortions performed for suspected or confirmed fetal abnormality (e.g., anencephalic) or for mental health reasons (e.g., threatened suicide) do not fall within the exceptions permitted within the language of [[Page 117]] the statute and are not authorized for payment under CHAMPUS. Note: Covered abortion services are limited to medical services or supplies only for the single circumstance outlined above and do not include abortion counseling or referral fees. Payment is not allowed for any services involving preparation for, or normal followup to, a noncovered abortion. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue guidelines describing the policy on abortion. (3) Family planning. The scope of the CHAMPUS family planning benefit is as follows: (i) Birth control (such as contraception)--(A) Benefits provided. Benefits are available for services and supplies related to preventing conception, including the following: (1) Surgical inserting, removal, or replacement of intrauterine devices. (2) Measurement for, and purchase of, contraceptive diaphragms (and later remeasurement and replacement). (3) Prescription contraceptives. (4) Surgical sterilization (either male or female). (B) Exclusions. The family planning benefit does not include the following: (1) Prophylactics (condoms). (2) Spermicidal foams, jellies, and sprays not requiring a prescription. (3) Services and supplies related to noncoital reproductive technologies, including but not limited to artificial insemination (including any costs related to donors or semen banks), in-vitro fertilization and gamete intrafallopian transfer. (4) Reversal of a surgical sterilization procedure (male or female). (ii) Genetic testing. Genetic testing essentially is preventive rather than related to active medical treatment of an illness or injury. However, under the family planning benefit, genetic testing is covered when performed in certain high risk situations. For the purpose of CHAMPUS, genetic testing includes to detect developmental abnormalities as well as purely genetic defects. (A) Benefits provided. Benefits may be extended for genetic testing performed on a pregnant beneficiary under the following prescribed circumstances. The tests must be appropriate to the specific risk situation and must meet one of the following criteria: (1) The mother-to-be is 35 years old or older; or (2) The mother- or father-to-be has had a previous child born with a congenital abnormality; or (3) Either the mother- or father-to-be has a family history of congenital abnormalities; or (4) The mother-to-be contracted rubella during the first trimester of the pregnancy; or (5) Such other specific situations as may be determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to fall within the intent of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. (B) Exclusions. It is emphasized that routine or demand genetic testing is not covered. Further, genetic testing does not include the following: (1) Tests performed to establish paternity of a child. (2) Tests to determine the sex of an unborn child. (4) Treatment of substance use disorders. Emergency and inpatient hospital care for complications of alcohol and drug abuse or dependency and detoxification are covered as for any other medical condition. Specific coverage for the treatment of substance use disorders includes detoxification, rehabilitation, and outpatient care provided in authorized substance use disorder rehabilitation facilities. (i) Emergency and inpatient hospital services. Emergency and inpatient hospital services are covered when medically necessary for the active medical treatment of the acute phases of substance abuse withdrawal (detoxification), for stabilization, and for treatment of medical complications of substance use disorders. Emergency and inpatient hospital services are considered medically necessary only when the patient's condition is such that the personnel and facilities of a hospital are required. Stays provided for substance use disorder rehabilitation in a hospital-based rehabilitation facility are covered, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section. Inpatient hospital services also are subject to the provisions regarding the limit on inpatient mental health services. (ii) Authorized substance use disorder treatment. Only those services provided [[Page 118]] by CHAMPUS-authorized institutional providers are covered. Such a provider must be either an authorized hospital, or an organized substance use disorder treatment program in an authorized free-standing or hospital-based substance use disorder rehabilitation facility. Covered services consist of any or all of the services listed below. A qualified mental health provider (physicians, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, psychiatric nurse specialists) (see paragraph (c)(3)(ix) of this section) shall prescribe the particular level of treatment. Each CHAMPUS beneficiary is entitled to three substance use disorder treatment benefit periods in his or her lifetime, unless this limit is waived pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section. (A benefit period begins with the first date of covered treatment and ends 365 days later, regardless of the total services actually used within the benefit period. Unused benefits cannot be carried over to subsequent benefit periods. Emergency and inpatient hospital services (as described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section) do not constitute substance abuse treatment for purposes of establishing the beginning of a benefit period.) (A) Rehabilitative care. Rehabilitative care in a authorized hospital or substance use disorder rehabilitative facility, whether free-standing or hospital-based, is covered on either a residential or partial care (day or night program) basis. Coverage during a single benefit period is limited to no more than inpatient stay (exclusive of stays classified in DRG 433) in hospitals subject to CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system or 21 days in a DRG-exempt facility for rehabilitation care, unless the limit is waived pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section. If the patient is medically in need of chemical detoxification, but does not require the personnel or facilities of a general hospital setting, detoxification services are covered in addition to the rehabilitative care, but in a DRG-exempt facility detoxification services are limited to 7 days unless the limit is waived pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section. The medical necessity for the detoxification must be documented. Any detoxification services provided by the substance use disorder rehabilitation facility must be under general medical supervision. (B) Outpatient care. Outpatient treatment provided by an approved substance use disorder rehabilitation facility, whether free-standing or hospital-based, is covered for up to 60 visits in a benefit period, unless the limit is waived pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section. (C) Family therapy. Family therapy provided by an approved substance use disorder rehabilitation facility, whether free-standing or hospital- based, is covered for up to 15 visits in a benefit period, unless the limit is waived pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section. (iii) Exclusions--(A) Aversion therapy. The programmed use of physical measures, such as electric shock, alcohol, or other drugs as negative reinforcement (aversion therapy) is not covered, even if recommended by a physician. (B) Domiciliary settings. Domiciliary facilities, generally referred to as halfway or quarterway houses, are not authorized providers and charges for services provided by these facilities are not covered. (iv) Confidentialty. Release of any patient identifying information, including that required to adjudicate a claim, must comply with the provisions of section 544 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 290dd-3), which governs the release of medical and other information from the records of patients undergoing treatment of substance abuse. If the patient refuses to authorize the release of medical records which are, in the opinion of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, necessary to determine benefits on a claim for treatment of substance abuse the claim will be denied. (v) Waiver of benefit limits. The specific benefit limits set forth in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) of this section may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS in special cases based on a determination that all of the following criteria are met: (A) Active treatment has taken place during the period of the benefit limit and substantial progress has been made according to the plan of treatment. [[Page 119]] (B) Further progress has been delayed due to the complexity of the illness. (C) Specific evidence has been presented to explain the factors that interfered with further treatment progress during the period of the benefit limit. (D) The waiver request includes specific time frames and a specific plan of treatment which will complete the course of treatment. (5) Transplants. (i) Organ transplants. Basic Program benefits are available for otherwise covered services or supplies in connection with an organ transplant procedure, provided such transplant procedure is in accordance with accepted professional medical standards and is not considered unproven. (A) General. (1) Benefits may be allowed for medically necessary services and supplies related to an organ transplant for: (i) Evaluation of potential candidate's suitability for an organ transplant, whether or not the patient is ultimately accepted as a candidate for transplant. (ii) Pre- and post-transplant inpatient hospital and outpatient services. (iii) Pre- and post-operative services of the transplant team. (iv) Blood and blood products. (v) FDA approved immunosuppression drugs to include off-label uses when determined to be medically necessary for the treatment of the condition for which it is administered, according to accepted standards of medical practice. (vi) Complications of the transplant procedure, including inpatient care, management of infection and rejection episodes. (vii) Periodic evaluation and assessment of the successfully transplanted patient. (viii) The donor acquisition team, including the costs of transportation to the location of the donor organ and transportation of the team and the donated organ to the location of the transplant center. (ix) The maintenance of the viability of the donor organ after all existing legal requirements for excision of the donor organ have been met. (2) TRICARE benefits are payable for recipient costs when the recipient of the transplant is a CHAMPUS beneficiary, whether or not the donor is a CHAMPUS beneficiary. (3) Donor costs are payable when: (i) Both the donor and recipient are CHAMPUS beneficiaries. (ii) The donor is a CHAMPUS beneficiary but the recipient is not. (iii) The donor is the sponsor and the recipient is a CHAMPUS beneficiary. (In such an event, donor costs are paid as a part of the beneficiary and recipient costs.) (iv) The donor is neither a CHAMPUS beneficiary nor a sponsor, if the recipient is a CHAMPUS beneficiary. (Again, in such an event, donor costs are paid as a part of the beneficiary and recipient costs.) (4) If the donor is not a CHAMPUS beneficiary, TRICARE benefits for donor costs are limited to those directly related to the transplant procedure itself and do not include any medical care costs related to other treatment of the donor, including complications. (5) TRICARE benefits will not be allowed for transportation of an organ donor. (B) [Reserved] (ii) Stem cell transplants. TRICARE benefits are payable for beneficiaries whose conditions are considered appropriate for stem cell transplant according to guidelines adopted by the Executive Director, TMA, or a designee. (6) Eyeglasses, spectacles, contact lenses, or other optical devices. Eyeglasses, spectacles, contact lenses, or other optical devices are excluded under the Basic Program except under very limited and specific circumstances. (i) Exception to general exclusion. Benefits for glasses and lenses may be extended only in connection with the following specified eye conditions and circumstances: (A) Eyeglasses or lenses that perform the function of the human lens, lost as a result of intraocular surgery or ocular injury or congenital absence. Note: Notwithstanding the general requirement for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of any surgical implant set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section, intraocular lenses are authorized under [[Page 120]] CHAMPUS if they are either approved for marketing by FDA or are subject to an investigational device exemption. (B) ``Pinhole'' glasses prescribed for use after surgery for detached retina. (C) Lenses prescribed as ``treatment'' instead of surgery for the following conditions: (1) Contract lenses used for treatment of infantile glaucoma. (2) Corneal or scleral lenses prescribed in connection with treatment of keratoconus. (3) Scleral lenses prescribed to retain moisture when normal tearing is not present or is inadequate. (4) Corneal or scleral lenses prescribed to reduce a corneal irregularity other than astigmatism. (ii) Limitations. The specified benefits are limited further to one set of lenses related to one of the qualifying eye conditions set forth in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section. If there is a prescription change requiring a new set of lenses (but still related to the qualifying eye condition), benefits may be extended for a second set of lenses, subject to specific medical review. (7) Transsexualism or such other conditions as gender dysphoria. All services and supplies directly or indirectly related to transsexualism or such other conditions as gender dysphoria are excluded under CHAMPUS. This exclusion includes, but is not limited to, psychotherapy, prescription drugs, and intersex surgery that may be provided in connection with transsexualism or such other conditions as gender dysphoria. There is only one very limited exception to this general exclusion, that is, notwithstanding the definition of congenital anomaly, CHAMPUS benefits may be extended for surgery and related medically necessary services performed to correct sex gender confusion (that is, ambiguous genitalia) which has been documented to be present at birth. (8) Cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery. For the purposes of CHAMPUS, cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery is surgery that can be expected primarily to improve physical appearance or that is performed primarily for psychological purposes or that restores form, but does not correct or improve materially a bodily function. Note: If a surgical procedure primarily restores function, whether or not there is also a concomitant improvement in physical appearance, the surgical procedure does not fall within the provisions set forth in this paragraph (e)(8). (i) Limited benefits under CHAMPUS. Benefits under the Basic Program generally are not available for cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery. However, under certain limited circumstances, benefits for otherwise covered services and supplies may be provided in connection with cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery as follows: (A) Correction of a congenital anomaly; or (B) Restoration of body form following an accidental injury; or (C) Revision of disfiguring and extensive scars resulting from neoplastic surgery. (D) Reconstructive breast surgery following a medically necessary mastectomy performed for the treatment of carcinoma, severe fibrocystic disease, other nonmalignant tumors or traumatic injuries. (E) Penile implants and testicular prostheses for conditions resulting from organic origins (i.e., trauma, radical surgery, disease process, for correction of congenital anomaly, etc.). Also, penile implants for organic impotency. Note: Organic impotence is defined as that which can be reasonably expected to occur following certain diseases, surgical procedures, trauma, injury, or congenital malformation. Impotence does not become organic because of psychological or psychiatric reasons. (F) Generally, benefits are limited to those cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery procedures performed no later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the related accidental injury or surgical trauma occurred, except for authorized postmastectomy breast reconstruction for which there is no time limitation between mastectomy and reconstruction. Also, special consideration for exception will be given to cases involving children who may require a growth period. (ii) General exclusions. (A) For the purposes of CHAMPUS, dental congenital anomalies such as absent tooth buds or malocclusion specifically are [[Page 121]] excluded. Also excluded are any procedures related to transsexualism or such other conditions as gender dysphoria, except as provided in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. (B) Cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery procedures performed primarily for psychological reasons or as a result of the aging process also are excluded. (C) Procedures performed for elective correction of minor dermatological blemishes and marks or minor anatomical anomalies also are excluded. (iii) Noncovered surgery, all related services and supplies excluded. When it is determined that a cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery procedure does not qualify for CHAMPUS benefits, all related services and supplies are excluded, including any institutional costs. (iv) Example of noncovered cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery procedures. The following is a partial list of cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery procedures that do not qualify for benefits under CHAMPUS. This list is for example purposes only and is not to be construed as being all-inclusive. (A) Any procedure performed for personal reasons to improve the appearance of an obvious feature or part of the body that would be considered by an average observer to be normal and acceptable for the patient's age or ethnic or racial background. (B) Cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgical procedures that are justified primarily on the basis of a psychological or psychiatric need. (C) Augmentation mammoplasties. Augmentation mammoplasties, except for breast reconstruction following a covered mastectomy and those specifically authorized in paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section. (D) Face lifts and other procedures related to the aging process. (E) Reduction mammoplasties. Reduction mammoplasties (unless there is medical documentation of intractable pain, not amenable to other forms of treatment, resulting from large, pendulous breasts or unless performed as an integral part of an authorized breast reconstruction procedure under paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section, including reduction of the collateral breast for purposes of ensuring breast symmetry) (F) Panniculectomy; body sculpture procedures. (G) Repair of sagging eyelids (without demonstrated and medically documented significant impairment of vision). (H) Rhinoplasties (without evidence of accidental injury occurring within the previous 6 months that resulted in significant obstruction of breathing). (I) Chemical peeling for facial wrinkles. (J) Dermabrasion of the face. (K) Elective correction of minor dermatological blemishes and marks or minor anatomical anomalies. (L) Revision of scars resulting from surgery or a disease process, except disfiguring and extensive scars resulting from neoplastic surgery. (M) Removal of tattoos. (N) Hair transplants. (O) Electrolysis. (P) Any procedures related to transsexualism or such other conditions as gender dysphoria except as provided in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. (Q) Penile implant procedure for psychological impotency, transsexualism, or such other conditions as gender dysphoria. (R) Insertion of prosthetic testicles for transsexualism, or such other conditions as gender dysphoria. (9) Complications (unfortunate sequelae) resulting from noncovered initial surgery or treatment. Benefits are available for otherwise covered services and supplies required in the treatment of complications resulting from a noncovered incident of treatment (such as nonadjunctive dental care, transsexual surgery, and cosmetic surgery) but only if the later complication represents a separate medical condition such as a systemic infection, cardiac arrest, and acute drug reaction. Benefits may not be extended for any later care or procedures related to the complication that essentially is similar to the initial noncovered care. Examples of complications similar to the initial episode of care (and thus not covered) would be repair of facial scarring resulting from dermabrasion for acne or repair of a prolapsed vagina in [[Page 122]] a biological male who had undergone transsexual surgery. (10) Dental. CHAMPUS does not include a dental benefit. Under very limited circumstances, benefits are available for dental services and supplies when the dental services are adjunctive to otherwise covered medical treatment. (i) Adjunctive dental care: Limited. Adjunctive dental care is limited to those services and supplies provided under the following conditions: (A) Dental care which is medically necessary in the treatment of an otherwise covered medical (not dental) condition, is an integral part of the treatment of such medical condition and is essential to the control of the primary medical condition. The following is a list of conditions for which CHAMPUS benefits are payable under this provision: (1) Intraoral abscesses which extend beyond the dental alveolus. (2) Extraoral abscesses. (3) Cellulitis and osteitis which is clearly exacerbating and directly affecting a medical condition currently under treatment. (4) Removal of teeth and tooth fragments in order to treat and repair facial trauma resulting from an accidental injury. (5) Myofacial Pain Dysfunction Syndrome. (6) Total or complete ankyloglossia. (7) Adjunctive dental and orthodontic support for cleft palate. (8) The prosthetic replacement of either the maxilla or the mandible due to the reduction of body tissues associated with traumatic injury (e.g., impact, gun shot wound), in addition to services related to treating neoplasms or iatrogenic dental trauma. Note: The test of whether dental trauma is covered is whether the trauma is solely dental trauma. Dental trauma, in order to be covered, must be related to, and an integral part of medical trauma; or a result of medically necessary treatment of an injury or disease. (B) Dental care required in preparation for medical treatment of a disease or disorder or required as the result of dental trauma caused by the medically necessary treatment of an injury or disease (iatrogenic). (1) Necessary dental care including prophylaxis and extractions when performed in preparation for or as a result of in-line radiation therapy for oral or facial cancer. (2) Treatment of gingival hyperplasia, with or without periodontal disease, as a direct result of prolonged therapy with Dilantin (diphenylhydantoin) or related compounds. (C) Dental care is limited to the above and similar conditions specifically prescribed by the Director, OCHAMPUS, as meeting the requirements for coverage under the provisions of this section. (ii) General exclusions. (A) Dental care which is routine, preventative, restorative, prosthodontic, periodontic or emergency does not qualify as adjunctive dental care for the purposes of CHAMPUS except when performed in preparation for or as a result of dental trauma caused by medically necessary treatment of an injury or disease. (B) The adding or modifying of bridgework and dentures. (C) Orthodontia, except when directly related to and an integral part of the medical or surgical correction of a cleft palate or when required in preparation for, or as a result of, trauma to the teeth and supporting structures caused by medically necessary treatment of an injury or disease. (iii) Preauthorization required. In order to be covered, adjunctive dental care requires preauthorization from the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, in accordance with paragraph (a)(11) of this section. When adjunctive dental care involves a medical (not dental) emergency (such as facial injuries resulting from an accident), the requirement for preauthorization is waived. Such waiver, however, is limited to the essential adjunctive dental care related to the medical condition requiring the immediate emergency treatment. A complete explanation, with supporting medical documentation, must be submitted with claims for emergency adjunctive dental care. (iv) Covered oral surgery. Notwithstanding the above limitations on dental care, there are certain oral surgical procedures that are performed by both physicians and dentists, and that are [[Page 123]] essentially medical rather than dental care. For the purposes of CHAMPUS, the following procedures, whether performed by a physician or dentist, are considered to be in this category and benefits may be extended for otherwise covered services and supplies without preauthorization: (A) Excision of tumors and cysts of the jaws, cheeks, lips, tongue, and roof and floor of the mouth, when such conditions require a pathological (histological) examination. (B) Surgical procedures required to correct accidental injuries of the jaws, cheeks, lips, tongue, and roof and floor of the mouth. (C) Treatment of oral or facial cancer. (D) Treatment of fractures of facial bones. (E) External (extra-oral) incision and drainage of cellulitis. (F) Surgery of accessory sinuses, salivary glands, or ducts. (G) Reduction of dislocations and the excision of the temporomandibular joints, when surgery is a necessary part of the reduction. (H) Any oral surgical procedure that falls within the cosmetic, reconstructive, or plastic surgery definition is subject to the limitations and requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(8) of this section. Note: Extraction of unerupted or partially erupted, malposed or impacted teeth, with or without the attached follicular or development tissues, is not a covered oral surgery procedure except when the care is indicated in preparation for medical treatment of a disease or disorder or required as a result of dental trauma caused by the necessary medical treatment of an injury or illness. Surgical preparation of the mouth for dentures is not covered by CHAMPUS. (v) Inpatient hospital stay in connection with non-adjunctive, noncovered dental care. Institutional benefits specified in paragraph (b) of this section may be extended for inpatient hospital stays related to noncovered, nonadjunctive dental care when such inpatient stay is medically necessary to safeguard the life of the patient from the effects of dentistry because of the existence of a specific and serious nondental organic impairment currenty under active treatment. (Hemophilia is an example of a condition that could be considered a serious nondental impairment.) Preauthorization by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is required for such inpatient stays to be covered in the same manner as required for adjunctive dental care described in paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of this section. Regardless of whether or not the preauthorization request for the hospital admission is approved and thus qualifies for institutional benefits, the professional service related to the nonadjunctive dental care is not covered. (11) Drug abuse. Under the Basic Program, benefits may be extended for medically necessary prescripion drugs required in the treatment of an illness or injury or in connection with maternity care (refer to paragraph (d) of this section). However, CHAMPUS benefits cannot be authorized to support of maintain an existing or potential drug abuse situation, whether or not the drugs (under other circumstances) are eligible for benefit consideration and whether or not obtained by legal means. (i) Limitations on who can prescribe drugs. CHAMPUS benefits are not available for any drugs prescribed by a member of the beneficiary's family or by a nonfamily member residing in the same household with the beneficiary or sponsor. (ii) Drug maintenance programs excluded. Drug maintenance programs when one addictive drug is substituted for another on a maintenance basis (such as methadone substituted for heroin) are not covered. This exclusion applies even in areas outside the United States where addictive drugs are dispensed legally by physicians on a maintenance dosage level. (iii) Kinds of prescription drugs that are monitored carefully by CHAMPUS for possible abuse situations--(A) Narcotics. Examples are Morphine and Demerol. (B) Nonnarcotic analgesics. (iv) CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary responsibilities. CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries are responsible for implementing utilization control and quality assurance procedures designed to identify possible drug abuse situations. The CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary is directed to screen all drug claims for potential overutilization and irrational prescribing of drugs, and to subject any such cases to extensive review to establish the necessity for the drugs and their appropriateness on the basis of diagnosis or definitive symptoms. (A) When a possible drug abuse situation is identified, all claims for drugs for that specific beneficiary or provider will be suspended pending the results of a review. (B) If the review determines that a drug abuse situation does in fact exist, all drug claims held in suspense will be denied. (C) If the record indicates previously paid drug benefits, the prior claims for that beneficiary or provider will be reopened and the circumstances involved reviewed to determine whether or not drug abuse also existed at the time the earlier claims were adjudicated. If drug abuse is later ascertained, benefit payments made previously will be considered to have been extended in error and the amounts so paid recouped. (D) Inpatient stays primarily for the purpose of obtaining drugs and any other services and supplies related to drug abuse also are excluded. (v) Unethical or illegal provider practices related to drugs. Any such investigation into a possible drug abuse that uncovers unethical or illegal drug dispensing practices on the part of an institution, a pharmacy, or physician will be referred to the professional or investigative agency having jurisdiction. CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries are directed to withhold payment of all CHAMPUS claims for services and supplies rendered by a provider under active investigation for possible unethical or illegal drug dispensing activities. (vi) Detoxification. The above monitoring and control of drug abuse situations shall in no way be construed to deny otherwise covered medical services and supplies related to drug detoxification (including newborn, addicted infants) when medical supervision is required. (12) Custodial care. The statute under which CHAMPUS operates specifically excludes custodial care. Many beneficiaries and sponsors misunderstand what is meant by custodial care, assuming that because custodial care is not covered, it implies the custodial care is not necessary. This is not the case; it only means the care being provided is not a type of care for which CHAMPUS benefits can be extended. (i) Kinds of conditions that can result in custodial care. There is no absolute rule that can be applied. With most conditions, there is a period of active treatment before custodial care, some much more prolonged than others. Examples of potential custodial care cases may be a spinal cord injury resulting in extensive paralysis, a severe cerebral vascular accident, multiple sclerosis in its latter stages, or presenile and senile dementia. These conditions do not result necessarily in custodial care but are indicative of the types of conditions that sometimes do. It is not the condition itself that is controlling, but whether the care being rendered falls within the definition of custodial care (refer to Sec. 199.2 of this part for the definition of ``custodial care''). (ii) Benefits available in connection with a custodial care case. CHAMPUS benefits are not available for services related to a custodial care case, with the following specific exceptions: (A) Prescription drugs and medicines, medical supplies and durable medical equipment. Benefits are payable for otherwise covered prescription drugs and medicines, medical supplies and durable medical equipment. (B) Nursing services, limited. Recognizing that even though the care being received is determined primarily to be custodial, an occasional specific skilled nursing service may be required. When it is determined such skilled nursing services are needed, benefits may be extended for one hour of nursing care per day. (C) Physician services, limited. Recognizing that even though the care being received is determined primarily to be custodial, occasional physician monitoring may be required to maintain the [[Page 125]] patient's condition. When it is determined that a patient is receiving custodial care, benefits may be extended for up to twelve physician visits per calendar year for the custodial condition (not to exceed one per month). Note: CHAMPUS benefits may be extended for additional physician visits related to the treatment of a condition other than the condition for which the patient is receiving custodial care (an example is a broken leg as a result of a fall). (D) Payment for prescription drugs, medical supplies, durable medical equipment and limited skilled nursing and physician services does not affect custodial care determination. The fact that CHAMPUS extends benefits for prescription drugs, medical supplies, durable medical equipment, and limited skilled nursing and physician services in no way affects the custodial care determination if the case otherwise falls within the definition of custodial care. (iii) Exception to custodial care exclusion, admission to a hospital. CHAMPUS benefits may be extended for otherwise covered services or supplies directly related to a medically necessary admission to an acute care general or special hospital (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(i), section 199.6 of this part), if the care is at the appropriate level and meets other requirements of this Regulation. (iv) Reasonable care for which benefits were authorized or reimbursed before June 1, 1977. It is recognized that care for which benefits were authorized or reimbursed before the implementation date of DoD 6010.8-R may be excluded under the custodial care limitations set forth in the Regulation. Therefore, an exception to the custodial care limitations set forth in this part exists whereby reasonable care for which benefits authorized or reimbursed under the Basic Program before June 1, 1977, shall continue to be authorized even though the care would be excluded as a benefit under the custodial care limitations of the DoD 6010.8-R. Continuation of CHAMPUS benefits in such cases is limited as follows: (A) Initial authorization or reimbursement before June 1, 1977. The initial CHAMPUS authorization or reimbursement for the care occurred before June 1, 1977; and, (B) Continued care. The care has been continuous since the initial CHAMPUS authorization or reimbursement; and, (C) Reasonable care. The care is reasonable. CHAMPUS benefits shall be continued for reasonable care up to the same level of benefits and for the same period of eligibility authorized or reimbursed before June 1, 1977. Care that is excessive or otherwise unreasonable will be reduced or eliminated from the continued care authorized under this exception. (13) Domiciliary care. The statute under which CHAMPUS operates also specifically excludes domiciliary care (refer to Sec. 199.2 of this part for the definition of ``Domiciliary Care''). (i) Examples of domiciliary care situations. The following are examples of domiciliary care for which CHAMPUS benefits are not payable. (A) Home care is not available. Institutionalization primarily because parents work, or extension of a hospital stay beyond what is medically necessary because the patient lives alone, are examples of domiciliary care provided because there is no other family member or other person available in the home. (B) Home care is not suitable. Institutionalization of a child because a parent (or parents) is an alcoholic who is not responsible enough to care for the child, or because someone in the home has a contagious disease, are examples of domiciliary care being provided because the home setting is unsuitable. (C) Family unwilling to care for a person in the home. A child who is difficult to manage may be placed in an institution, not because institutional care is medically necessary, but because the family does not want to handle him or her in the home. Such institutionalization would represent domiciliary care, that is, the family being unwilling to assume responsibility for the child. (ii) Benefits available in connection with a domiciliary care case. Should the beneficiary receive otherwise covered medical services or supplies while also being in a domiciliary care situation, CHAMPUS benefits are payable for those medical services or supplies, or both, in the same manner as though the beneficiary resided in his or her own home. Such benefits would be cost- [[Page 126]] shared as though rendered to an outpatient. (iii) General exclusion. Domiciliary care is institutionalization essentially to provide a substitute home--not because it is medically necessary for the beneficiary to be in the institution (although there may be conditions present that have contributed to the fact that domiciliary care is being rendered). CHAMPUS benefits are not payable for any costs or charges related to the provision of domiciliary care. While a substitute home or assistance may be necessary for the beneficiary, domiciliary care does not represent the kind of care for which CHAMPUS benefits can be provided. (14) CT scanning--(i) Approved CT scan services. Benefits may be extended for medically necessary CT scans of the head or other anatomical regions of the body when all of the following conditions are met: (A) The patient is referred for the diagnostic procedure by a physician. (B) The CT scan procedure is consistent with the preliminary diagnosis or symptoms. (C) Other noninvasive and less costly means of diagnosis have been attempted or are not appropriate. (D) The CT scan equipment is licensed or registered by the appropriate state agency responsible for licensing or registering medical equipment that emits ionizing radiation. (E) The CT scan equipment is operated under the general supervision and direction of a physician. (F) The results of the CT scan diagnostic procedure are interpreted by a physician. (ii) Review guidelines and criteria. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will issue specific guidelines and criteria for CHAMPUS coverage of medically necessary head and body part CT scans. (15) Morbid obesity. The CHAMPUS morbid obesity benefit is limited to the gastric bypass, gastric stapling, or gastroplasty method. (i) Conditions for coverage. Payment may be extended for the gastric bypass, gastric stapling, or gastroplasty method only when one of the following conditions is met: (A) The patient is 100 pounds over the ideal weight for height and bone structure and has an associated severe medical condition. These associated medical conditions are diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cholecystitis, narcolepsy, pickwickian syndrome (and other severe respiratory disease), hypothalmic disorders, and severe arthritis of the weight-bearing joints. (B) The patient is 200 percent or more of the ideal weight for height and bone structure. An associated medical condition is not required for this category. (C) The patient has had an intestinal bypass or other surgery for obesity and, because of complications, requires a second surgery (a takedown). The surgeon in many cases, will do a gastric bypass, gastric stapling, or gastroplasty to help the patient avoid regaining the weight that was lost. In this situation, payment is authorized even though the patient's condition technically may not meet the definition of morbid obesity because of the weight that was already lost following the initial surgery. (ii) Exclusions. (A) CHAMPUS payment may not be made for nonsurgical treatment of obesity or morbid obesity, for dietary control, or weight reduction. (B) CHAMPUS payment may not be made for surgical procedures other than the gastric bypass, gastric stapling, or gastroplasty, even if morbid obesity is present. (16) Maternity care. (i) Benefit. The CHAMPUS Basic Program may share the cost of medically necessary services and supplies associated with maternity care which are not otherwise excluded by this part. (ii) Cost-share. Maternity care cost-share shall be determined as follows: (A) Inpatient cost-share formula applies to maternity care ending in childbirth in, or on the way to, a hospital inpatient childbirth unit, and for maternity care ending in a non-birth outcome not otherwise excluded by this part. (B) Ambulatory surgery cost-share formula applies to maternity care ending in childbirth in, or on the way to, a birthing center to which the beneficiary is admitted and from which the beneficiary has received prenatal care, [[Page 127]] or a hospital-based outpatient birthing room. (C) Outpatient cost-share formula applies to maternity care which terminates in a planned childbirth at home. (D) Otherwise covered medical services and supplies directly related to ``Complications of pregnancy,'' as defined in Sec. 199.2 of this part, will be cost-shared on the same basis as the related maternity care for a period not to exceed 42 days following termination of the pregnancy and thereafter cost-shared on the basis of the inpatient or outpatient status of the beneficiary when medically necessary services and supplies are received. (17) Biofeedback Therapy. Biofeedback therapy is a technique by which a person is taught to exercise control over a physiologic process occurring within the body. By using modern biomedical instruments the patient learns how a specific physiologic system within his body operates and how to modify the performance of this particular system. (i) Benefits Provided. CHAMPUS benefits are payable for services and supplies in connection with electrothermal, electromyograph and electrodermal biofeedback therapy when there is documentation that the patient has undergone an appropriate medical evaluation, that their present condition is not responding to or no longer responds to other forms of conventional treatment, and only when provided as treatment for the following conditions: (A) Adjunctive treatment for Raynaud's Syndrome. (B) Adjunctive treatment for muscle re-education of specific muscle groups or for treating pathological muscle abnormalities of spasticity, or incapacitating muscle spasm or weakness. (ii) Limitations. Payable benefits include initial intake evaluation. Treatment following the initial intake evaluation is limited to a maximum of 20 inpatient and outpatient biofeedback treatments per calendar year. (iii) Exclusions. Benefits are excluded for biofeedback therapy for the treatment of ordinary muscle tension states or for psychosomatic conditions. Benefits are also excluded for the rental or purchase of biofeedback equipment. (iv) Provider Requirements. A provider of biofeedback therapy must be a CHAMPUS-authorized provider. (Refer to Sec. 199.6, ``Authorized Providers). If biofeedback treatment is provided by other than a physician, the patient must be referred by a physician. (v) Implementation Guidelines. The Director of OCHAMPUS shall issue guidelines as are necessary to implement the provision of this paragraph. (18) Cardiac rehabilitation. Cardiac rehabilitation is the process by which individuals are restored to their optimal physical, medical, and psychological status, after a cardiac event. Cardiac rehabilitation is often divided into three phases. Phase I begins during inpatient hospitalization and is managed by the patient's personal physician. Phase II is a medically supervised outpatient program which begins following discharge. Phase III is a lifetime maintenance program emphasizing continuation of physical fitness with periodic followup. Each phase includes an exercise component, patient education, and risk factor modification. There may be considerable variation in program components, intensity, and duration. (i) Benefits Provided. CHAMPUS benefits are available on an inpatient or outpatient basis for services and supplies provided in connection with a cardiac rehabilitation program when ordered by a physician and provided as treatment for patients who have experienced the following cardiac events within the preceding twelve (12) months: (A) Myocardial Infarction. (B) Coronary Artery Bypass Graft. (C) Coronary Angioplasty. (D) Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (E) Chronic Stable Angina (see limitations below). (F) Heart valve surgery. (G) Heart or Heart-lung Transplantation. (ii) Limitations. Payable benefits include separate allowance for the initial evaluation and testing. Outpatient treatment following the initial intake evaluation and testing is limited to a maximum of thirty- six (36) sessions per cardiac event, usually provided 3 sessions per week for twelve (12) weeks. [[Page 128]] Patients diagnosed with chronic stable angina are limited to one treatment episode (36 sessions) in a calendar year. (iii) Exclusions. Phase III cardiac rehabilitation lifetime maintenance programs performed at home or in medically unsupervised settings are not covered. (iv) Providers. A provider of cardiac rehabilitation services must be a TRICARE authorized hospital (see Sec. 199.6 (b)(4)(i)) or a freestanding cardiac rehabilitation facility that meets the requirements of Sec. 199.6 (f). All cardiac rehabilitation services must be ordered by a physician. (v) Payment. Payment for outpatient treatment will be based on an all inclusive allowable charge per session. Inpatient treatment will be paid based upon the reimbursement system in place for the hospital where the services are rendered. (vi) Implementation Guidelines. The Director of OCHAMPUS shall issue guidelines as are necessary to implement the provisions of this paragraph. (19) Hospice care. Hospice care is a program which provides an integrated set of services and supplies designed to care for the terminally ill. This type of care emphasizes palliative care and supportive services, such as pain control and home care, rather than cure-oriented services provided in institutions that are otherwise the primary focus under CHAMPUS. The benefit provides coverage for a humane and sensible approach to care during the last days of life for some terminally ill patients. (i) Benefit coverage. CHAMPUS beneficiaries who are terminally ill (that is, a life expectancy of six months or less if the disease runs its normal course) will be eligible for the following services and supplies in lieu of most other CHAMPUS benefits: (A) Physician services. (B) Nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse. (C) Medical social services provided by a social worker who has at least a bachelor's degree from a school accredited or approved by the Council on Social Work Education, and who is working under the direction of a physician. Medical social services include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Assessment of social and emotional factors related to the beneficiary's illness, need for care, response to treatment, and adjustment to care. (2) Assessment of the relationship of the beneficiary's medical and nursing requirements to the individual's home situation, financial resources, and availability of community resources. (3) Appropriate action to obtain available community resources to assist in resolving the beneficiary's problem. (4) Counseling services that are required by the beneficiary. (D) Counseling services provided to the terminally ill individual and the family member or other persons caring for the individual at home. Counseling, including dietary counseling, may be provided both for the purpose of training the individual's family or other care-giver to provide care, and for the purpose of helping the individual and those caring for him or her to adjust to the individual's approaching death. Bereavement counseling, which consists of counseling services provided to the individual's family after the individual's death, is a required hospice service but it is not reimbursable. (E) Home health aide services furnished by qualified aides and homemaker services. Home health aides may provide personal care services. Aides also may perform household services to maintain a safe and sanitary environment in areas of the home used by the patient. Examples of such services are changing the bed or light cleaning and laundering essential to the comfort and cleanliness of the patient. Aide services must be provided under the general supervision of a registered nurse. Homemaker services may include assistance in personal care, maintenance of a safe and healthy environment, and services to enable the individual to carry out the plan of care. Qualifications for home health aides can be found in 42 CFR 484.36. (F) Medical appliances and supplies, including drugs and biologicals. Only drugs that are used primarily for the [[Page 129]] relief of pain and symptom control related to the individual's terminal illness are covered. Appliances may include covered durable medical equipment, as well as other self-help and personal comfort items related to the palliation or management of the patient's condition while he or she is under hospice care. Equipment is provided by the hospice for use in the beneficiary's home while he or she is under hospice care. Medical supplies include those that are part of the written plan of care. Medical appliances and supplies are included within the hospice all- inclusive rates. (G) Physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech-language pathology services provided for purposes of symptom control or to enable the individual to maintain activities of daily living and basic functional skills. (H) Short-term inpatient care provided in a Medicare participating hospice inpatient unit, or a Medicare participating hospital, skilled nursing facility (SNF) or, in the case of respite care, a Medicaid- certified nursing facility that additionally meets the special hospice standards regarding staffing and patient areas. Services provided in an inpatient setting must conform to the written plan of care. Inpatient care may be required for procedures necessary for pain control or acute or chronic symptom management. Inpatient care may also be furnished to provide respite for the individual's family or other persons caring for the individual at home. Respite care is the only type of inpatient care that may be provided in a Medicaid-certified nursing facility. The limitations on custodial care and personal comfort items applicable to other CHAMPUS services are not applicable to hospice care. (ii) Core services. The hospice must ensure that substantially all core services are routinely provided directly by hospice employees; i.e., physician services, nursing care, medical social services, and counseling for individuals and care givers. Refer to paragraphs (e)(19)(i)(A), (e)(19)(i)(B), (e)(19)(i)(C), and (e)(19)(i)(D) of this section. (iii) Non-core services. While non-core services (i.e., home health aide services, medical appliances and supplies, drugs and biologicals, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology and short-term inpatient care) may be provided under arrangements with other agencies or organizations, the hospice must maintain professional management of the patient at all times and in all settings. Refer to paragraphs (e)(19)(i)(E), (e)(19)(i)(F), (e)(19)(i)(G), and (e)(19)(i)(H) of this section. (iv) Availability of services. The hospice must make nursing services, physician services, and drugs and biologicals routinely available on a 24-hour basis. All other covered services must be made available on a 24-hour basis to the extent necessary to meet the needs of individuals for care that is reasonable and necessary for the palliation and management of the terminal illness and related condition. These services must be provided in a manner consistent with accepted standards of practice. (v) Periods of care. Hospice care is divided into distinct periods/ episodes of care. The terminally ill beneficiary may elect to receive hospice benefits for an initial period of 90 days, a subsequent period of 90 days, a second subsequent period of 30 days, and a final period of unlimited duration. (vi) Conditions for coverage. The CHAMPUS beneficiary must meet the following conditions/criteria in order to be eligible for the hospice benefits and services referenced in paragraph (e)(19)(i) of this section. (A) There must be written certification in the medical record that the CHAMPUS beneficiary is terminally ill with a life expectancy of six months or less if the terminal illness runs its normal course. (1) Timing of certification. The hospice must obtain written certification of terminal illness for each of the election periods described in paragraph (e)(19(vi)(B) of this section, even if a single election continues in effect for two, three or four periods. (i) Basic requirement. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(19(vi)(A)(1)(ii) of this section the hospice must obtain the written certification no later than two calendar days after the period begins. (ii) Exception. For the initial 90-day period, if the hospice cannot obtain the [[Page 130]] written certifications within two calendar days, it must obtain oral certifications within two calendar days, and written certifications no later than eight calendar days after the period begins. (2) Sources of certification. Physician certification is required for both initial and subsequent election periods. (i) For the initial 90-day period, the hospice must obtain written certification statements (and oral certification statements if required under paragraph (e)(19(vi)(A)(i)(ii) of this section) from: (A) The individual's attending physician if the individual has an attending physician; and (B) The medical director of the hospice or the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group. (ii) For subsequent periods, the only requirement is certification by one of the physicians listed in paragraph (e)(19)(vi)(A)(2)(i)(B) of this section. (B) The terminally ill beneficiary must elect to receive hospice care for each specified period of time; i.e., the two 90-day periods, a subsequent 30-day period, and a final period of unlimited duration. If the individual is found to be mentally incompetent, his or her representative may file the election statement. Representative means an individual who has been authorized under State law to terminate medical care or to elect or revoke the election of hospice care on behalf of a terminally ill individual who is found to be mentally incompetent. (1) The episodes of care must be used consecutively; i.e., the two 90-day periods first, then the 30-day period, followed by the final period. The periods of care may be elected separately at different times. (2) The initial election will continue through subsequent election periods without a break in care as long as the individual remains in the care of the hospice and does not revoke the election. (3) The effective date of the election may begin on the first day of hospice care or any subsequent day of care, but the effective date cannot be made prior to the date that the election was made. (4) The beneficiary or representative may revoke a hospice election at any time, but in doing so, the remaining days of that particular election period are forfeited and standard CHAMPUS coverage resumes. To revoke the hospice benefit, the beneficiary or representative must file a signed statement of revocation with the hospice. The statement must provide the date that the revocation is to be effective. An individual or representative may not designate an effective date earlier than the date that the revocation is made. (5) If an election of hospice benefits has been revoked, the individual, or his or her representative may at any time file a hospice election for any period of time still available to the individual, in accordance with Sec. 199.4(e)(19)(vi)(B). (6) A CHAMPUS beneficiary may change, once in each election period, the designation of the particular hospice from which he or she elects to receive hospice care. To change the designation of hospice programs the individual or representative must file, with the hospice from which care has been received and with the newly designated hospice, a statement that includes the following information: (i) The name of the hospice from which the individual has received care and the name of the hospice from which he or she plans to receive care. (ii) The date the change is to be effective. (7) Each hospice will design and print its own election statement to include the following information: (i) Identification of the particular hospice that will provide care to the individual. (ii) The individual's or representative's acknowledgment that he or she has been given a full understanding of the palliative rather than curative nature of hospice care, as it relates to the individual's terminal illness. (iii) The individual's or representative's acknowledgment that he or she understands that certain other CHAMPUS services are waived by the election. (iv) The effective date of the election. (v) The signature of the individual or representative, and the date signed. (8) The hospice must notify the CHAMPUS contractor of the initiation, change or revocation of any election. [[Page 131]] (C) The beneficiary must waive all rights to other CHAMPUS payments for the duration of the election period for: (1) Care provided by any hospice program other than the elected hospice unless provided under arrangements made by the elected hospice; and (2) Other CHAMPUS basic program services/benefits related to the treatment of the terminal illness for which hospice care was elected, or to a related condition, or that are equivalent to hospice care, except for services provided by: (i) The designated hospice; (ii) Another hospice under arrangement made by the designated hospice; or (iii) An attending physician who is not employed by or under contract with the hospice program. (3) Basic CHAMPUS coverage will be reinstated upon revocation of the hospice election. (D) A written plan of care must be established by a member of the basic interdisciplinary group assessing the patient's needs. This group must have at least one physician, one registered professional nurse, one social worker, and one pastoral or other counselor. (1) In establishing the initial plan of care the member of the basic interdisciplinary group who assesses the patient's needs must meet or call at least one other group member before writing the initial plan of care. (2) At least one of the persons involved in developing the initial plan must be a nurse or physician. (3) The plan must be established on the same day as the assessment if the day of assessment is to be a covered day of hospice care. (4) The other two members of the basic interdisciplinary group--the attending physician and the medical director or physician designee--must review the initial plan of care and provide their input to the process of establishing the plan of care within two calendar days following the day of assessment. A meeting of group members is not required within this 2-day period. Input may be provided by telephone. (5) Hospice services must be consistent with the plan of care for coverage to be extended. (6) The plan must be reviewed and updated, at intervals specified in the plan, by the attending physician, medical director or physician designee and interdisciplinary group. These reviews must be documented in the medical records. (7) The hospice must designate a registered nurse to coordinate the implementation of the plan of care for each patient. (8) The plan must include an assessment of the individual's needs and identification of the services, including the management of discomfort and symptom relief. It must state in detail the scope and frequency of services needed to meet the patient's and family's needs. (E) Complete medical records and all supporting documentation must be submitted to the CHAMPUS contractor within 30 days of the date of its request. If records are not received within the designated time frame, authorization of the hospice benefit will be denied and any prior payments made will be recouped. A denial issued for this reason is not an initial determination under Sec. 199.10, and is not appealable. (vii) Appeal rights under hospice benefit. A beneficiary or provider is entitled to appeal rights for cases involving a denial of benefits in accordance with the provisions of this part and Sec. 199.10. (20) Case management services. As part of case management for beneficiaries with complex medical or psychological conditions, payment for services or supplies not otherwise covered by the basic CHAMPUS/ TRICARE program may be authorized when they are provided in accordance with Sec. 199.4(i). Waiver of benefit limits/exclusions to the basic CHAMPUS/TRICARE program may be cost shared where it is demonstrated that the absence of such services would result in the exacerbation of an existing extraordinary condition, as defined in Sec. 199.2, to the extent that frequent or extensive services are required; and such services are a cost effective alternative to the Basic CHAMPUS program. (21) Home health services. Home health services are covered when furnished by, or under arrangement with, a home health agency (HHA) that participates [[Page 132]] in the TRICARE program, and provides care on a visiting basis in the beneficiary's home. Covered HHA services are the same as those provided under Medicare under section 1861(m) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(m)) and 42 CFR part 409, subpart E. (i) Benefit coverage. Coverage will be extended for the following home health services subject to the conditions of coverage prescribed in paragraph (e)(21)(ii) of this section: (A) Part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care furnished by a registered nurse or a licensed practical (vocational) nurse under the supervision of a registered nurse; (B) Physical therapy, speech-language pathology, and occupational therapy; (C) Medical social services under the direction of a physician; (D) Part-time or intermittent services of a home health aide who has successfully completed a training program approved by the Director TMA; (E) Medical supplies, a covered osteoporosis drug (as defined in the Social Security Act 1861(kk), but excluding other drugs and biologicals) and durable medical equipment; (F) Medical services provided by an interim or resident-in-training of a hospital, under an approved teaching program of the hospital in the case of an HHA that is affiliated or under common control of a hospital; and (G) Services at hospitals, SNFs or rehabilitation centers when they involve equipment too cumbersome to bring to the home but not including transportation of the individual in connection with any such item or service. (ii) Conditions for Coverage. The following conditions/criteria must be met in order to be eligible for the HHA benefits and services referenced in paragraph (e)(21)(i) of this section: (A) The person for whom the services are provided is an eligible TRICARE beneficiary. (B) The HHA that is providing the services to the beneficiary has in effect a valid agreement to participate in the TRICARE program. (C) Physician certifies the need for home health services because the beneficiary is homebound. (D) The services are provided under a plan of care established and approved by a physician. (1) The plan of care must contain all pertinent diagnoses, including the patient's mental status, the types of services, supplies, and equipment required, the frequency of visits to be made, prognosis, rehabilitation potential, functional limitations, activities permitted, nutritional requirements, all medications and treatments, safety measures to protect against injury, instructions for timely discharge or referral, and any additional items the HHA or physician chooses to include. (2) The orders on the plan of care must specify the type of services to be provided to the beneficiary, both with respect to the professional who will provide them and the nature of the individual services, as well as the frequency of the services. (E) The beneficiary must need skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis or physical therapy or speech-language pathology services, or have continued need for occupational therapy after the need for skilled nursing care, physical therapy, or speech-language pathology services has ceased. (F) The beneficiary must receive, and an HHA must provide, a patient-specific, comprehensive assessment that: (1) Accurately reflects the patient's current health status and includes information that may be used to demonstrate the patient's progress toward achievement of desired outcomes; (2) Identifies the beneficiary's continuing need for home care and meets the beneficiary's medical, nursing, rehabilitative, social, and discharge planning needs. (3) Incorporates the use of the current version of the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) items, using the language and groupings of the OASIS items, as specified by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity. (G) TRICARE is the appropriate payer. (H) The services for which payment is claimed are not otherwise excluded from payment. (I) Any other conditions of coverage/participation that may be required [[Page 133]] under Medicare's HHA benefit; i.e., coverage guidelines as prescribed under Sections 1861(o) and 1891 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(o) and 1395bbb) and 42 CFR Part 484. (22) Pulmonary rehabilitation. TRICARE benefits are payable for beneficiaries whose conditions are considered appropriate for pulmonary rehabilitation according to guidelines adopted by the Executive Director, TMA, or a designee. (f) Beneficiary or sponsor liability-- (1) General. As stated in the introductory paragraph to this section, the Basic Program is essentially a supplemental program to the Uniformed Services direct medical care system. To encourage use of the Uniformed Services direct medical care system wherever its facilities are available and appropriate, the Basic Program benefits are designed so that it is to the financial advantage of a CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor to use the direct medical care system. When medical care is received from civilian sources, a CHAMPUS beneficiary is responsible for payment of certain deductible and cost- sharing amounts in connection with otherwise covered services and supplies. By statute, this joint financial responsibility between the beneficiary or sponsor and CHAMPUS is more favorable for dependents of members than for other classes of beneficiaries. (2) Dependents of members of the Uniformed Services. CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor liability set forth for dependents of members is as follows: (i) Annual fiscal year deductible for outpatient services and supplies. (A) For care rendered all eligible beneficiaries prior to April 1, 1991, or when the active duty sponsor's pay grade is E-4 or below, regardless of the date of care: (1) Individual Deductible: Each beneficiary is liable for the first fifty dollars ($50.00) of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable amount on claims for care provided in the same fiscal year. (2) Family Deductible: The total deductible amount for all members of a family with the same sponsor during one fiscal year shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). (B) For care rendered on or after April 1, 1991, for all CHAMPUS beneficiaries except dependents of active duty sponsors in pay grades E- 4 or below. (1) Individual Deductible: Each beneficiary is liable for the first one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable amount on claims for care provided in the same fiscal year. (2) Family Deductible: The total deductible amount for all members of a family with the same sponsor during one fiscal year shall not exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00). (C) CHAMPUS-approved Ambulatory Surgical Centers or Birthing Centers. No deductible shall be applied to allowable amounts for services or items rendered to active duty for authorized NATO dependents. (D) Allowable Amount does not exceed Deductible Amount. If fiscal year allowable amounts for two or more beneficiary members of a family total less than $100.00 ($300.00 if paragraph (f) (2)(i)(B)(2) of this section applies), but more of the beneficiary members submit a claim for over $50.00 ($150.00 if paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B)(1) of this section applies), neither the family nor the individual deductible will have been met and no CHAMPUS benefits are payable. (E) For any family the outpatient deductible amounts will be applied sequentially as the CHAMPUS claims are processed. (F) If the fiscal year outpatient deductible under either paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) or (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section has been met by a beneficiary or a family through the submission of a claim or claims to a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary in another geographic location from the location where a current claim is being submitted, the beneficiary or sponsor must obtain a deductible certificate from the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary where the applicable beneficiary or famiy fiscal year deductible was met. Such deductible certificate must be attached to the current claim being submitted for benefits. Failure to obtain a deductible certificate under such circumstances will result in a second beneficiary or family fiscal year deductible being applied. However, this second deductible may be reimbursed once [[Page 134]] appropriate documentation, as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(F) of this section, is supplied to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary applying the second deductible. (G) Notwithstanding the dates specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i)(A) and (f)(B)(2)(i) of this section in the case of dependents of active duty members of rank E-5 or above with Persian Gulf Conflict service, dependents of service members who were killed in the Gulf, or who died subsequent to Gulf service, and of members who retired prior to October 1, 1991, after having served in the Gulf War, the deductible shall be the amount specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) of this section for care rendered prior to October 1, 1991, and the amount specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section for care rendered on or after October 1, 1991. (H) The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, may waive the annual individual or family fiscal year deductible for dependents of a Reserve Component member who is called or ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days but less than one year or a National guard member who is called or ordered to full-time federal National guard duty for a period of more than 30 days but less than one year, in support of a contingency operation (as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)). For purposes of this paragraph, a dependent is a lawful husband or wife of the member and a child as defined in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) through (F) and (b)(2)(ii)(H)(1), (2) and (4) of Part 199.3. (ii) Inpatient cost-sharing. Dependents of members of the Uniformed Services are responsible for the payment of the first $25 of the allowable institutional costs incurred with each covered inpatient admission to a hospital or other authorized institutional provider (refer to Sec. 199.6 of the part), or the amount the beneficiary or sponsor would have been charged had the inpatient care been provided in a Uniformed Service hospital, whichever is greater. Note: The Secretary of Defense (after consulting with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Transportation) prescribes the fair charges for inpatient hospital care provided through Uniformed Services medical facilities. This determination is made each fiscal year. (A) Inpatient cost-sharing payable with each separate inpatient admission. A separate cost-sharing amount (as described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) is payable for each inpatient admission to a hospital or other authorized institution, regardless of the purpose of the admission (such as medical or surgical), regardless of the number of times the beneficiary is admitted, and regardless of whether or not the inpatient admissions are for the same or related conditions; except that successive inpatient admissions shall be deemed one inpatient confinement for the purpose of computing the inpatient cost-share payable, provided not more than 60 days have elapsed between the successive admissions. However, notwithstanding this provision, all admissions related to a single maternity episode shall be considered one confinement, regardless of the number of days between admissions (refer to paragraph (b) of this section). (B) Multiple family inpatient admissions. A separate cost-sharing amount is payable for each inpatient admission, regardless of whether or not two or more beneficiary members of a family are admitted at the same time or from the same cause (such as an accident). A separate beneficiary inpatient cost-sharing amount must be applied for each separate admission on each beneficiary member of the family. (C) Newborn patient in his or her own right. When a newborn infant remains as an inpatient in his or her own right (usually after the mother is discharged), the newborn child becomes the beneficiary and patient and the extended inpatient stay becomes a separate inpatient admission. In such a situation, a new, separate inpatient cost-sharing amount is applied. If a multiple birth is involved (such as twins or triplets) and two or more newborn infants become patients in their own right, a separate inpatient cost-sharing amount must be applied to the inpatient stay for each newborn child who has remained as an inpatient in his or her own right. (D) Inpatient cost-sharing for mental health services. For care provided on or after October 1, 1995, the inpatient cost-sharing for mental health services [[Page 135]] is $20 per day for each day of the inpatient admission. This $20 per day cost sharing amount applies to admissions to any hospital for mental health services, any residential treatment facility, any substance abuse rehabilitation facility, and any partial hospitalization program providing mental health or substance use disorder rehabilitation services. (iii) Outpatient cost-sharing. Dependents of members of the Uniformed Services are responsible for payment of 20 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost or charge beyond the annual fiscal year deductible amount (as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section) for otherwise covered services or supplies provided on an outpatient basis by authorized providers. (iv) Ambulatory surgery. Notwithstanding the above provisions pertaining to outpatient cost-sharing, dependents of members of the Uniformed Services are responsible for payment of $25 for surgical care that is authorized and received while in an outpatient status and that has been designated in guidelines issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (v) Psychiatric partial hospitalization services. Institutional and professional services provided under the psychiatric partial hospitalization program authorized by paragraph (b)(10) of this section shall be cost shared as inpatient services. (3) Former members and dependents of former members. CHAMPUS beneficiary liability set forth for former members and dependents of former members is as follows: (i) Annual fiscal year deductible for outpatient services or supplies. The annual fiscal year deductible for otherwise covered outpatient services or supplies provided former members and dependents of former members is the same as the annual fiscal year outpatient deductible applicable to dependents of active duty members of rank E-5 or above (refer to paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section). (ii) Inpatient cost-sharing. Cost-sharing amounts for inpatient services shall be as follows: (A) Services subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. The cost-share shall be the lesser of: an amount calculated by multiplying a per diem amount by the total number of days in the hospital stay except the day of discharge; or 25 percent of the hospital's billed charges. The per diem amount shall be calculated so that, in the aggregate, the total cost-sharing amounts for these beneficiaries is equivalent to 25 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable costs for covered services or supplies provided on an inpatient basis by authorized providers. The per diem amount shall be published annually by OCHAMPUS. (B) Services subject to the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system. The cost-share is dependent upon whether the hospital is paid a hospital-specific per diem or a regional per diem under the provisions of Sec. 199.14(a)(2). With respect to care paid for on the basis of a hospital specific per diem, the cost-share shall be 25% of the hospital- specific per diem amount. For care paid for on the basis of a regional per diem, the cost share shall be the lower of a fixed daily amount or 25% of the hospital's billed charges. The fixed daily amount shall be 25 percent of the per diem adjusted so that total beneficiary cost shares will equal 25 percent of total payments under the mental health per diem payment system. These fixed daily amount shall be updated annually and published in the Federal Register along with the per diems published pursuant to Sec. 199.14(a)(2)(iv)(B). (C) Other services. For services exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system and the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system and services provided by institutions other than hospitals, the cost-share shall be 25% of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charges. (iii) Outpatient cost-sharing. Former members and dependents of former members are responsible for payment of 25 percent of the CHAMPUS- determined allowable costs or charges beyond the annual fiscal year deductible amount (as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section) for otherwise covered services or supplies provided on an outpatient basis by authorized providers. [[Page 136]] (iv) Psychiatric partial hospitalization services. Institutional and professional services provided under the psychiatric partial hospitalization program authorized by paragraph (b)(10) of this section shall be cost shared as inpatient services. (4) Former spouses. CHAMPUS beneficiary liability for former spouses eligible under the provisions set forth in Sec. 199.3 of this part is as follows: (i) Annual fiscal year deductible for outpatient services or supplies. An eligible former spouse is responsible for the payment of the first $150.00 of the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable costs or charges for otherwise covered outpatient services or supplies provided in any one fiscal year. (Except for services received prior to April 1, 1991, the deductible amount is $50.00). The former spouse cannot contribute to, nor benefit from, any family deductible of the member or former member to whom the former spouse was married or of any CHAMPUS-eligible children. (ii) Inpatient cost-sharing. Eligible former spouses are responsible for payment of cost-sharing amounts the same as those required for former members and dependents of former members. (iii) Outpatient cost-sharing. Eligible former spouses are responsible for payment of 25 percent of the CHAMPUS-determined reasonable costs or charges beyond the annual fiscal year deductible amount for otherwise covered services or supplies provided on an outpatient basis by authorized providers. (5) Cost-Sharing under the Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program. Cost-sharing is dependent upon the type of partnership program entered into, whether external or internal. (See paragraph (p) of Sec. 199.1, for general requirements of the Military- Civilian Health Services Partnership Program.) (i) External Partnership Agreement. Authorized costs associated with the use of the civilian facility will be financed through CHAMPUS under the normal cost-sharing and reimbursement procedures applicable under CHAMPUS. (ii) Internal Partnership Agreement. Beneficiary cost-sharing under internal agreements will be the same as charges prescribed for care in military treatment facilities. (6)-(7) [Reserved] (8) Cost-sharing for services provided under special discount arrangements--(i) General rule. With respect to services determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) to be covered by Sec. 199.14(i), the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) has authority to establish, as an exception to the cost-sharing amount normally required pursuant to this section, a different cost-share amount that appropriately reflects the application of the statutory cost-share to the discount arrangement. (ii) Specific applications. The following are examples of applications of the general rule; they are not all inclusive. (A) In the case of services provided by individual health care professionals and other noninstitutional providers, the cost-share shall be the usual percentage of the CHAMPUS allowable charge determined under Sec. 199.14(i). (B) In the case of services provided by institutional providers normally paid on the basis of a pre-set amount (such as DRG-based amount under Sec. 199.14(a)(1) or per-diem amount under Sec. 199.14(a)(2)), if the discount rate is lower than the pre-set rate, the cost-share amount that would apply for a beneficiary other than an active duty dependent pursuant to the normal pre-set rate would be reduced by the same percentage by which the pre-set rate was reduced in setting the discount rate. (9) Waiver of deductible amounts or cost-sharing not allowed--(i) General rule. Because deductible amounts and cost sharing are statutorily mandated, except when specifically authorized by law (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS), a provider may not waive or forgive beneficiary liability for annual deductible amounts or inpatient or outpatient cost sharing, as set forth in this section. (ii) Exception for bad debts. This general rule is not violated in cases in which a provider has made all reasonable attempts to effect collection, without success, and determines in accordance with generally accepted fiscal [[Page 137]] management standards that the beneficiary liability in a particular case is an uncollectible bad debt. (iii) Remedies for noncompliance. Potential remedies for noncompliance with this requirement include: (A) A claim for services regarding which the provider has waived the beneficiary's liability may be disallowed in full, or, alternatively, the amount payable for such a claim may be reduced by the amount of the beneficiary liability waived. (B) Repeated noncompliance with this requirement is a basis for exclusion of a provider. (10) Catastrophic loss protection for basic program benefits. Fiscal year limits, or catastrophic caps, on the amounts beneficiaries are required to pay are established as follows: (i) Dependents of active duty members. The maximum family liability is $1,000 for deductibles and cost-shares based on allowable charges for Basic Program services and supplies received in a fiscal year. (ii) All other beneficiaries. For all other categories of beneficiary families (including those eligible under CHAMPVA) the fiscal year cap is $3,000. (iii) Payment after cap is met. After a family has paid the maximum cost-share and deductible amounts (dependents of active duty members $1,000 and all others $3,000), for a fiscal year, CHAMPUS will pay allowable amounts for remaining covered services through the end of that fiscal year. Note to paragraph (f)(10): Under the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, the cap for beneficiaries other than dependents of active duty members was reduced from $7,500 to $3,000 effective October 30, 2000. Prior to this, the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 reduced this cap from $10,000 to $7,500 on October 1, 1992. The cap remains at $1,000 for dependents of active duty members. (11) Beneficiary or sponsor liability under the Pharmacy Benefits Program. Beneficiary or sponsor liability under the Pharmacy Benefits Program is addressed in Sec. 199.21. (g) Exclusions and limitations. In addition to any definitions, requirements, conditions, or limitations enumerated and described in other sections of this part, the following specifically are excluded from the Basic Program: (1) Not medically or psychologically necessary. Services and supplies that are not medically or psychologically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of a covered illness (including mental disorder) or injury, for the diagnosis and treatment of pregnancy or well-baby care except as provided in the following paragraph. (2) Unnecessary diagnostic tests. X-ray, laboratory, and pathological services and machine diagnostic tests not related to a specific illness or injury or a definitive set of symptoms except for cancer screening mammography and cancer screening papanicolaou (PAP) tests provided under the terms and conditions contained in the guidelines adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS. (3) Institutional level of care. Services and supplies related to inpatient stays in hospitals or other authorized institutions above the appropriate level required to provide necessary medical care. (4) Diagnostic admission. Services and supplies related to an inpatient admission primarily to perform diagnostic tests, examinations, and procedures that could have been and are performed routinely on an outpatient basis. Note: If it is determined that the diagnostic x-ray, laboratory, and pathological services and machine tests performed during such admission were medically necessary and would have been covered if performed on an outpatient basis, CHAMPUS benefits may be extended for such diagnostic procedures only, but cost-sharing will be computed as if performed on an outpatient basis. (5) Unnecessary postpartum inpatient stay, mother or newborn. Postpartum inpatient stay of a mother for purposes of staying with the newborn infant (usually primarily for the purpose of breast feeding the infant) when the infant (but not the mother) requires the extended stay; or continued inpatient stay of a newborn infant primarily for purposes of remaining with the mother when the mother (but not the newborn infant) requires extended postpartum inpatient stay. (6) Therapeutic absences. Therapeutic absences from an inpatient facility, except when such absences are specifically included in a treatment plan approved by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or [[Page 138]] a designee. For cost-sharing provisions refer to Sec. 199.14, paragraph (f)(3). (7) Custodial care. Custodial care except as otherwise specifically provided in paragraphs (e)(12) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section. (8) Domiciliary care. Inpatient stays primarily for domiciliary care purposes. (9) Rest or rest cures. Inpatient stays primarily for rest or rest cures. (10) Amounts above allowable costs or charges. Costs of services and supplies to the extent amounts billed are over the CHAMPUS determined allowable cost or charge, as provided for in Sec. 199.14. (11) No legal obligation to pay, no charge would be made. Services or supplies for which the beneficiary or sponsor has no legal obligation to pay; or for which no charge would be made if the beneficiary or sponsor was not eligible under CHAMPUS; or whenever CHAMPUS is a secondary payer for claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, amounts, when combined with the primary payment, which would be in excess of charges (or the amount the provider is obligated to accept as payment in full, if it is less than the charges). (12) Furnished without charge. Services or supplies furnished without charge. (13) Furnished by local, state, or Federal Government. Services and supplies paid for, or eligible for payment, directly or indirectly by a local, state, or Federal Government, except as provided under CHAMPUS, or by government hospitals serving the general public, or medical care provided by a Uniformed Service medical care facility, or benefits provided under title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) (refer to Sec. 199.8 of this part). (14) Study, grant, or research programs. Services and supplies provided as a part of or under a scientific or medical study, grant, or research program. (15) Unproven drugs, devices, and medical treatments or procedures. By law, CHAMPUS can only cost-share medically necessary supplies and services. Any drug, device, or medical treatment or procedure, the safety and efficacy of which have not been established, as described in this paragraph (g)(15), is unproved and cannot be cost-shared by CHAMPUS. (i) A drug, device, or medical treatment or procedure is unproven: (A) If the drug or device cannot be lawfully marketed without the approval or clearance of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and approval or clearance for marketing has not been given at the time the drug or device is furnished to the patient. Note: Although the use of drugs and medicines not approved by the FDA for commercial marketing, that is for use by humans, (even though permitted for testing on humans) is excluded from coverage as unproven, drugs grandfathered by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 may be covered by CHAMPUS as if FDA approved. Certain cancer drugs, designated as Group C drugs (approved and distributed by the National Cancer Institute) and Treatment Investigational New Drugs (INDs), are not covered under CHAMPUS because they are not approved for commercial marketing by the FDA. However, medical care related to the use of Group C drugs and Treatment INDs can be cost-shared under CHAMPUS when the patient's medical condition warrants their administration and the care is provided in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice. CHAMPUS can also consider coverage of unlabeled or off-label uses of drugs that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs that are used for indications or treatments not included in the approved labeling. Approval for reimbursement of unlabeled or off-label uses requires review for medical necessity, and also requires demonstrations from medical literature, national organizations, or technology assessment bodies that the unlabeled or off-label use of the drug is safe, effective and in accordance with nationally accepted standards of practice in the medical community. (B) If a medical device (as defined by 21 U.S.C. 321(h)) with an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approved by the Food and Drug Administration is categorized by the FDA as experimental/investigational (FDA Category A). Note: CHAMPUS will consider for coverage a device with an FDA- approved IDE categorized by the FDA as non-experimental/investigational (FDA Category B) for CHAMPUS beneficiaries participating in FDA approved clinical trials. Coverage of any such Category B device is dependent on its meeting all other requirements of the laws and rules governing CHAMPUS and [[Page 139]] upon the beneficiary involved meeting the FDA-approved IDE study protocols. (C) Unless reliable evidence shows that any medical treatment or procedure has been the subject of well-controlled studies of clinically meaningful endpoints, which have determined its maximum tolerated dose, its toxicity, its safety, and its efficacy as compared with standard means of treatment or diagnosis. (See the definition of reliable evidence in Sec. 199.2 of this part for the procedures used in determining if a medical treatment or procedure is unproven.) (D) If reliable evidence shows that the consensus among experts regarding the medical treatment or procedure is that further studies or clinical trials are necessary to determine its maximum tolerated doses, its toxicity, its safety, or its effectiveness as compared with the standard means of treatment or diagnosis (see the definition of reliable evidence in Sec. 199.2 for the procedures used in determining if a medical treatment or procedure is unproven). (ii) CHAMPUS benefits for rare diseases are reviewed on a case-by- case basis by the Director, Office of CHAMPUS, or a designee. In reviewing the case, the Director, or a designee, may consult with any or all of the following sources to determine if the proposed therapy is considered safe and effective: (A) Trials published in refereed medical literature. (B) Formal technology assessments. (C) National medical policy organization positions. (D) National professional associations. (E) National expert opinion organizations. (iii) Care excluded. This exclusion from benefits includes all services directly related to the unproven drug, device, or medical treatment or procedure. However, CHAMPUS may cover services or supplies when there is no logical or causal relationship between the unproven drug, device or medical treatment or procedure and the treatment at issue or where such a logical or causal relationship cannot be established with a sufficient degree of certainty. This CHAMPUS coverage is authorized in the following circumstances: (A) Treatment that is not related to the unproven drug, device or medical treatment or procedure; e.g., medically necessary in the absence of the unproven treatment. (B) Treatment which is necessary follow-up to the unproven drug, device or medical treatment or procedure but which might have been necessary in the absence of the unproven treatment. (iv) Examples of unproven drugs, devices or medical treatments or procedures. This paragraph (g)(15)(iv) consists of a partial list of unproven drugs, devices or medical treatment or procedures. These are excluded from CHAMPUS program benefits. This list is not all inclusive. Other unproven drugs, devices or medical treatments or procedures, are similarly excluded, although they do not appear on this partial list. This partial list will be reviewed and updated periodically as new information becomes available. With respect to any procedure included on this partial list, if and when the Director, OCHAMPUS determines that based on reliable evidence (as defined in section 199.2) such procedure has proven medical effectiveness, the Director will initiate action to remove the procedure from this partial list of unproven drugs, devices or medical treatment or procedures. From the date established by the Director as the date the procedure has established proven medical effectiveness until the date the regulatory change is made to remove the procedures from the partial list of unproven drugs, devices or medical treatment or procedures the Director, OCHAMPUS will suspend treatment of the procedure as unproven drugs, devices, or medical treatments or procedures. Following is the non-inclusive, partial list of unproven drugs, devices or medical treatment or procedures, all of which are excluded from CHAMPUS benefits: (A) Radial keratotomy (refractive keratoplasty). (B) Cellular therapy. (C) Histamine therapy.

(69) Institutions. Services and supplies provided by other than a hospital, unless the institution has been approved specifically by OCHAMPUS. Nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, halfway houses, homes for the aged, or institutions of similar purpose are excluded from consideration as approved facilities under the Basic Program. Note: In order to be approved under CHAMPUS, an institution must, in addition to meeting CHAMPUS standards, provide a level of care for which CHAMPUS benefits are payable. (70)-(71) [Reserved] (72) Inpatient mental health services. Effective for care received on or after October 1, 1991, services in excess of 30 days in any fiscal year (or in an admission), in the case of a patient nineteen years of age or older, 45 days in any fiscal year (or in an admission) in the case of a patient under 19 years of age, or 150 days in any fiscal year (or in an admission) in the case of inpatient mental health services provided as residential treatment care, unless coverage for such services is granted by a waiver by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.

For services prior to October 1, 1991, services in excess of 60 days in any calendar year unless additional coverage is granted by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (73) Economic interest in connection with mental health admissions. Inpatient mental health services (including both acute care and RTC services) are excluded for care received when a patient is referred to a provider of such services by a physician (or other health care professional with authority to admit) who has an economic interest in the facility to which the patient is referred, unless a waiver is granted. Requests for waiver shall be considered under the same procedure and based on the same criteria as used for obtaining preadmission authorization (or continued stay authorization for emergency admissions), with the only additional requirement being that the economic interest be disclosed as part of the request. The same reconsideration and appeals procedures that apply to day limit waivers shall also apply to decisions regarding requested waivers of the economic interest exclusion. However, a provider may appeal a reconsidered determination that an economic relationship constitutes an economic interest within the scope of the exclusion to the same extent that a provider may appeal determinations under Sec. 199.15(i)(3). This exclusion does not apply to services under the Program for Persons with Disabilities (Sec. 199.5) or provided as partial hospital care. If a situation arises where a decision is made to exclude CHAMPUS payment solely on the basis of the provider's economic interest, the normal CHAMPUS appeals process will be available. (74) Not specifically listed. Services and supplies not specifically listed as a benefit in this part. This exclusion is not intended to preclude extending benefits for those services or supplies specifically determined to be covered within the intent of this part by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, even though not otherwise listed. Note: The fact that a physician may prescribe, order, recommend, or approve a service or supply does not, of itself, make it medically necessary or make the charge an allowable expense, even though it is not listed specifically as an exclusion. (h) Payment and liability for certain potentially excludable services under the Peer Review Organization program--(1) Applicability. This subsection provides special rules that apply only to services retrospectively determined under the Peer Review organization (PRO) program (operated pursuant to Sec. 199.15) to be potentially excludable (in whole or in part) from the basic program under paragraph (g) of this section. [[Page 146]] Services may be excluded by reason of being not medically necessary (paragraph (g)(1) of this section), at an inappropriate level (paragraph (g)(3) of this section), custodial care (paragraph (g)(7) of this section) or other reason relative to reasonableness, necessity or appropriateness (which services shall throughout the remainder of this subsection, be referred to as ``not medically necessary''). (Also throughout the remainder of the subsection, ``services'' includes items and ``provider'' includes supplier). This paragraph does not apply to coverage determinations made by OCHAMPUS or the fiscal intermediaries which are not based on medical necessity determinations made under the PRO program. (2) Payment for certain potentially excludable expenses. Services determined under the PRO program to be potentially excludable by reason of the exclusions in paragraph (g) of this section for not medically necessary services will not be determined to be excludable if neither the beneficiary to whom the services were provided nor the provider (institutional or individual) who furnished the services knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the services were subject to those exclusions. Payment may be made for such services as if the exclusions did not apply. (3) Liability for certain excludable services. In any case in which items or services are determined excludable by the PRO program by reason of being not medically necessary and payment may not be made under paragraph (h)(2) of this section because the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this section are not met, the beneficiary may not be held liable (and shall be entitled to a full refund from the provider of the amount excluded and any cost share amount already paid) if: (i) The beneficiary did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the services were excludable by reason of being not medically necessary; and (ii) The provider knew or could reasonably have been expected to know that the items or services were excludable by reason of being not medically necessary. (4) Criteria for determining that beneficiary knew or could reasonably have been expected to have known that services were excludable. A beneficiary who receives services excludable by reason of being not medically necessary will be found to have known that the services were excludable if the beneficiary has been given written notice that the services were excludable or that similar or comparable services provided on a previous occasion were excludable and that notice was given by the OCHAMPUS, CHAMPUS PRO or fiscal intermediary, a group or committee responsible for utilization review for the provider, or the provider who provided the services. (5) Criteria for determining that provider knew or could reasonably have been expected to have known that services were excludable. An institutional or individual provider will be found to have known or been reasonably expected to have known that services were excludable under this subsection under any one of the following circumstances: (i) The PRO or fiscal intermediary had informed the provider that the services provided were excludable or that similar or reasonably comparable services were excludable. (ii) The utilization review group or committee for an institutional provider or the beneficiary's attending physician had informed the provider that the services provided were excludable. (iii) The provider had informed the beneficiary that the services were excludable. (iv) The provider had received written materials, including notices, manual issuances, bulletins, guides, directives or other materials, providing notification of PRO screening criteria specific to the condition of the beneficiary. Attending physicians who are members of the medical staff of an institutional provider will be found to have also received written materials provided to the institutional provider. (v) The services that are at issue are the subject of what are generally considered acceptable standards of practice by the local medical community. [[Page 147]] (vi) Preadmission authorization was available but not requested, or concurrent review requirements were not followed. (i) Case management program. (1) In general. Case management, as it applies to this program, provides a collaborative process among the case manager, beneficiary, primary caregiver, professional health care providers and funding sources to meet the medical needs of an individual with an extraordinary condition. It is designed to promote quality and cost-effective outcomes through assessment, planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating the options and services required. Payment for services or supplies limited or not otherwise covered by the basic TRICARE/CHAMPUS program may be authorized when they are provided in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section. Waiver of benefit limits/ exclusions may be cost-shared where it is demonstrated that the absence of such services would result in the exacerbation of an existing extraordinary condition, as defined in Sec. 199.2, to the extent that such services are a cost-effective alternative to the basic TRICARE/ CHAMPUS program. (2) Applicability of case management program. A CHAMPUS eligible beneficiary may participate in the case management program if he/she has an extraordinary condition, which is disabling and requires extensive utilization of TRICARE resources. The medical or psychological condition must also: (i) Be contained in the latest revision of the International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification, or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; (ii) Meet at least one of the following: (A) Demonstrate a prior history of high CHAMPUS costs in the year immediately preceding eligibility for the case management program; or (B) Require clinically appropriate services or supplies from multiple providers to address an extraordinary condition; and (iii) Can be treated more appropriately and cost effectively at a less intensive level of care. (3) Prior authorization required. Services or supplies allowable as a benefit exception under this Section shall be cost-shared only when a beneficiary's entire treatment has received prior authorization through an individual case management program. (4) Cost effective requirement. Treatment must be determined to be cost effective by comparison to alternative treatment that would otherwise be required or when compared to existing reimbursement methodology. Treatment must meet the requirements of appropriate medical care as defined in Sec. 199.2. (5) Limited waiver of exclusions and limitations. Limited waivers of exclusions and limitations normally applicable to the basic program may be granted for specific services or supplies only when a beneficiary's entire treatment has received prior authorization through the individual case management program described in paragraph (i) of this section. The Director, OCHAMPUS may grant a patient-specific waiver of benefit limits for services or supplies in the following categories, subject to the waiver requirements of this section. (i) Durable equipment. The cost of a device or apparatus which does not qualify as Durable Medical Equipment (as defined in Sec. 199.2) or back-up durable medical equipment may be shared when determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS to be cost-effective and clinically appropriate. (ii) Custodial care. The cost of services or supplies rendered to a beneficiary that would otherwise be excluded as custodial care (as defined in Sec. 199.2) may be cost-shared for a maximum lifetime period of 365 days when determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, to be cost effective and clinically appropriate. To qualify for a waiver of benefit limits of custodial care, the patient must meet all eligibility requirements of paragraph (i) of this section, including that the absence of the waived services would result in the exacerbation of an existing extraordinary condition. In addition: (A) The proposed treatment must be cost effective and clinically appropriate as determined by the individual [[Page 148]] case manager. For example, the treatment would be determined to be cost effective by comparison to alternative care that would otherwise be required or when compared to existing reimbursement methodology. (B) For patients receiving care at home, there must be a primary caregiver or the patient is capable of self-support. (iii) Domiciliary care. The cost of services or supplies rendered to be a beneficiary what would otherwise be excluded as domiciliary care (as defined in Sec. 199.2) may be shared when determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS to be cost effective and clinically appropriate. Waivers for domiciliary care are subject to the same requirements as paragraphs (i)(5)(ii) of this section. (iv) In home services. The cost of the following in-home services may be shared when determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS to be cost effective and clinically appropriate: nursing care, physical, occupational, speech therapy, medical social services, intermittent or part-time services of a home health aide, beneficiary transportation required for treatment plan implementation, and training for the beneficiary and primary caregiver sufficient to allow them to assume all feasible responsibility for the care of the beneficiary that will facilitate movement of the beneficiary to the least resource-intensive, clinically appropriate setting. (Qualifications for home health aides shall be based on the standards at 42 CFR 848.36.) (6) Case management acknowledgment. The beneficiary, or representative, and the primary caregiver shall sign a case management acknowledgment as a prerequisite to prior authorization of case management services. The acknowledgment shall include, in part, all of the following provisions: (i) The right to participate fully in the development and ongoing assessment of the treatment; (ii) That all health care services for which TRICARE/CHAMPUS cost sharing is sought shall be authorized by the case manager prior to their delivery; (iii) That there are limitations in scope and duration of the planned case management treatment, including provisions to transition to other arrangements; and (iv) The conditions under which case management services are provided, including the requirement that the services must be cost effective and clinically appropriate; (v) That a beneficiary's participation in the case management program shall be discontinued for any of the following reasons: (A) The loss of TRICARE/CHAMPUS eligibility; (B) A determination that the services or supplies provided are not cost effective or clinically appropriate; (C) The beneficiary, or representative, and/or primary caregiver, terminates participation in writing; (D) The beneficiary and/or primary caregiver's failure to comply with requirements in this paragraph (i); or (E) A determination that the beneficiary's condition no longer meets the requirements of participation as described in paragraph (i) of this section. (7) Other administrative requirements. (i) Qualified providers of services or items not covered under the basic program, or who are not otherwise eligible for TRICARE/CHAMPUS authorized status, may be authorized for a time-limited period when such authorization is essential to implement the planned treatment under case management. Such providers must not be excluded or suspended as a CHAMPUS provider, must hold Medicare or state certification or licensure appropriate to the service, and must agree to participate on all claims related to the case management treatment. (ii) Retrospective requests for authorization of waiver of benefit limits/exclusions will not be considered. Authorization of waiver of benefit limits/exclusions is allowed only after all other options for services or supplies have been considered and either appropriately utilized or determined to be clinically inappropriate and/or not cost- effective. (iii) Experimental or investigational treatment or procedures shall not be cost-shared as an exception to standard benefits under this part. (iv) TRICARE/CHAMPUS case management services may be provided by [[Page 149]] contractors designated by the Director, OCHAMPUS. [51 FR 24008, July 1, 1986] Editorial Notes: For Federal Register citations affecting Sec. 199.4, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and on GPO Access. Sec. 199.5 Program for Persons with Disabilities (PFPWD). (a) General. This PFPWD provides financial assistance for certain CHAMPUS beneficiaries who are moderately or severely mentally retarded, or seriously physically disabled. The PFPWD is not intended to be a stand alone benefit. (1) Purpose. The primary purpose of the PFPWD is to assist in reducing the disabling effects of a PFPWD qualifying condition. (2) Benefit source election. A PFPWD beneficiary (or sponsor or guardian acting on behalf of the beneficiary) may elect to use the provisions of either this section, or the provisions of Sec. 199.4, for a specific service or item which is allowable by both sections. (i) Election limitation. No amount for authorized, or otherwise allowed, PFPWD services or items remaining after the maximum PFPWD benefit dollar amount has been reached in a given month may be cost- shared through the provisions of Sec. 199.4. (ii) Election change. A beneficiary (or sponsor or guardian acting on behalf of the beneficiary) shall have the right to request the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, to allow PFPWD cost-shared services or items otherwise allowable as a benefit of Sec. 199.4, and which were rendered after the catastrophic loss protection provision applicable to Sec. 199.4 was in effect for a given PFPWD beneficiary's sponsor, to be readjudicated according to the provisions of Sec. 199.4. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, shall allow readjudication when the sponsor's family's CHAMPUS benefit year cost-share liability would be reduced by such readjudication. Such requests are subject to the claims filing deadline provisions of Sec. 199.7. The determination regarding readjudication is conclusive and may not be appealed. (3) Application required. A beneficiary shall establish PFPWD eligibility as a prerequisite to authorization or payment of any PFPWD benefits. Subsequent review of the PFPWD qualifying condition to confirm continued eligibility shall be made in accordance with the prognosis for a change in severity such that the condition would not likely continue to be a PFPWD qualifying condition. (4) Benefit authorization. To establish whether a requested service or item is a PFPWD benefit, the beneficiary (or sponsor or guardian acting on the behalf of the beneficiary) shall provide such information about how the requested benefit will contribute to confirming, arresting, or reducing the disabling effects of the qualifying condition as the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, determines necessary for benefit adjudication. (i) Written authorization. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may require written authorization for any PFPWD category or type of service or item as a prerequisite for adjudication of related claims. (ii) Format. An authorization issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, shall specify, such description, dates, amounts, requirements, limitations or information as necessary for exact identification of approved benefits and efficient adjudication of resulting claims. (iii) Valid period. An authorization for a PFPWD service or item shall not exceed twelve consecutive months. (iv) Authorization waiver. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, shall waive the requirement for a written CHAMPUS authorization for rendered PFPWD services or items that, except for the absence of the written CHAMPUS authorization, would be allowable as a PFPWD benefit. (v) Public facility use. A PFPWD beneficiary residing within a State, as defined in Sec. 199.2, must demonstrate that a public facility, as defined in Sec. 199.2, funds, except funds administered under a State plan for medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) is not available or adequate, as defined in Sec. 199.2, to meet the qualifying condition related need. [[Page 150]] (A) Equipment repair or maintenance for beneficiary owned equipment shall be considered not available when the equipment is a type allowable as a benefit. (B) A beneficiary shall not be required to change the provider of public facility funded therapy when public facility funding is depleted during that beneficiary's course of therapy and when such a change is determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, to be clinically contraindicated. When contraindicated, other public facilities for the therapy shall not be considered adequate for the beneficiary. (5) Public facility use certification. Written certification, in accord with information requirements, formats, and procedures established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee that requested PFPWD services or items cannot be obtained from public facilities because the services or items are not available, or if available, are not adequate, is a prerequisite for PFPWD benefit payment. (i) A Military Treatment Facility (MTF) Commander, or designee, may make such certification for a beneficiary residing within a defined geographic area. (ii) An administrator of a public facility, or designee, may make such certification for a beneficiary residing within the service area of that public facility. (iii) The domicile of the beneficiary shall be the basis for the determination of public facility availability when the sponsor and beneficiary are separately domiciled due to the sponsor's move to a new permanent duty station or due to legal custody requirements. (iv) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may determine, on a case- by-case basis, that apparent public facility availability for a requested type of service or item can not be substantiated for a specific beneficiary's request for PFPWD benefits and is not available. (A) A case-specific determination shall be shall be based upon a written statement by the beneficiary (or sponsor or guardian acting on behalf of the beneficiary) which details the circumstances wherein a specific individual representing a specific public facility refused to provide a public facility use certification, and such other information as the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee determines to be material to the determination. (B) A case-specific determination of public facility availability by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, is conclusive, and is not appealable. (v) The requirements of this paragraph (a)(5) notwithstanding, no Public Facility Use Certification is required for medical services and items that are provided under Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in accordance with the Individualized Family Service Plan and that are otherwise allowable under the CHAMPUS Basic Program or the PFPWD. (6) Equipment. (i) An item of equipment shall not be authorized when such authorization would allow concurrent PFPWD cost-sharing of more than one item of the same type of equipment for the same beneficiary. (ii) Reasonable repairs and maintenance shall be allowable for any beneficiary owned equipment otherwise allowable by this section. (7) Implementing instructions. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee shall issue policies, instructions, procedures, guidelines, standards, and criteria necessary to assure the quality and efficiency of services and items furnished as a PFPWD benefit and to otherwise accomplish the purpose of the PFPWD. (i) Other requirements. All provisions of this part, except the provisions of Sec. 199.4, apply to the PFPWD unless otherwise provided by this section. (ii) Continuity of eligibility. A CHAMPUS beneficiary who has an outstanding Program for the Handicapped (PFTH) benefit authorization during the 30 calendar day period immediately prior to the effective date of the Program for Persons with Disabilities (PFPWD) shall be deemed to have a PFPWD qualifying condition for the duration of the period during which the beneficiary is otherwise eligible for PFPWD and the beneficiary continues to meet the applicable PFTH qualifying condition criteria. (b) Eligibility--(1) Spouse or child. PFPWD benefits are limited to a CHAMPUS eligible child or spouse, but not a former spouse, except as provided [[Page 151]] in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, of: (i) Active duty sponsor. An active duty member of one of the Uniformed Services as determined in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 199.3; or (ii) Former member sponsor. After November 13, 1986, a former member of a Uniformed Service, when the qualifying condition is the result of, or has been exacerbated by, an injury or illness resulting from physical or emotional abuse; or (iii) Deceased sponsor. A CHAMPUS beneficiary remains eligible for benefits under the PFPWD: (A) For a period of three calendar years from the date an active duty sponsor dies; or (B) Through midnight of the beneficiary's twenty-first birthday when the beneficiary is receiving PFPWD benefits at the time the active duty sponsor dies and the sponsor was eligible, at the time of death, for receipt of hostile-fire pay or died as a result of a disease or injury incurred while eligible for such pay. (2) Loss of PFPWD eligibility. Eligibility for PFPWD benefits ceases as of 12.:01 a.m. of the day following the day that: (i) The sponsor ceases to be an active duty member for any reason other than death; or (ii) Eligibility based upon the abused dependent provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section expires; or (iii) Eligibility based upon the deceased sponsor provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section expires; or (iv) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, determines that the beneficiary no longer has a qualifying condition. (3) Qualifying condition--(i) Mental retardation.

Drugs and medicines which do not meet the benefit requirements of Sec. 199.4 are excluded. (17) Therapeutic absences. Therapeutic absences from an inpatient facility are excluded. (e) Cost-share liability--(1) No deductible.PFPWD benefits are not subject to a deductible amount. (2)(i) Sponsor cost-share liability. Regardless of the number of PFPWD eligible family members, the sponsor's cost share for allowed PFPWD benefits in a given month is according to the following table: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Monthly Member's pay grade share ------------------------------------------------------------------------ E-1 E-6........................................................... 100 200 O-10.......................................................... 250 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (ii) The sponsor's cost-share will be applied, up to the amount given in the table in paragraph (e)(2)(i), to the first allowed charges in any given month. The government's share will be paid, up to the maximum amount(s) specified in paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section for allowed charges after the sponsor's cost-share has been applied. (3) Government cost-share liability: member who sponsors one PFPWD beneficiary. The total government share of the cost of all PFPWD benefits provided in a given month to a beneficiary who is the sponsor's only PFPWD eligible family member may not exceed $1,000 after application of the allowable payment methodology. Any amount remaining after the Government's maximum share has been reached is the responsibility of the active duty sponsor. (4) Government cost-share liability: member who sponsors more than one PFPWD beneficiary. The total government share of the cost of all PFPWD allowable benefits provided in a given month to a beneficiarywho is one of two or more PFPWD eligible family members of the same sponsor shall be determined as follows: (i) Maximum benefit limit determination for the first PFPWD eligible beneficiary. The $1,000 maximum monthly government PFPWD benefit amount shall apply only to the beneficiary incurring the least amount of allowable PFPWD expense in a given month, after application of the allowable payment methodology. If two or more PFPWD eligible beneficiaries have the same amount of allowable PFPWD expenses in a given month, the $1,000 maximum benefit in that month shall apply to only one PFPWD eligible beneficiary. (ii) Maximum benefit limit determination for the remaining PFPWD eligible beneficiaries. After application of the Government's cost-share specified in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, the government shall cost-share the entire remaining amount for all allowable services and items received in that month by the remaining PFPWD eligible beneficiaries. (f) Benefit payment--(1) Equipment. The allowable amount for equipment shall be calculated in the same manner as durable medical equipment allowable through Sec. 199.4. (2) Transportation. The allowable amount for transportation is limited to the actual cost of the standard published fare plus any standard surcharge made to accommodate any person with a similar disability or to the actual cost of specialized medical transportation when nonspecialized transport cannot accommodate the beneficiary's disability related needs, or when specialized transport is more economical than nonspecialized transport. When transport is by private vehicle, the allowable amount is limited to the Federal government employee mileage reimbursement rate in effect on the trip date. (3) Proration of equipment expense. The PFPWD beneficiary (or sponsor or guardian acting on the beneficiary's behalf) may, only at the time of the request for authorization of equipment, specify that the allowable cost of the [[Page 154]] equipment be prorated. Equipment expense proration permits the allowable cost of an item of PFPWD authorized equipment to be apportioned so that no portion of the allowable cost exceeds the monthly benefit limit and allows each apportioned amount to be separately authorized as a benefit during subsequent contiguous months. (i) Maximum period. The maximum number of contiguous months during which a prorated amount may be authorized for cost-share shall be the lesser of: (A) The number of months calculated by dividing the initial allowable cost for the item of equipment by $1,000 and doubling the resulting quotient; or (B) The number of months of useful equipment life for the requesting beneficiary, as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee. (ii) Cost-share. A cost-share is applicable in any month in which a prorated amount is authorized, subject to the cost-share provisions for a sponsor with two or more PFPWD eligible beneficiaries. (iii) Termination. Prorated payments shall be terminated as of the first day of the month following the death of a beneficiary or as of the effective date of a beneficiary's loss of PFPWD eligibility for any other reason. (4) For-profit institutional care provider. Institutional care provided by a for-profit entity may be allowed only when the care for a specific PFPWD beneficiary: (i) Is contracted for by a public facility, as defined in Sec. 199.2, as a part of a publicly funded long-term inpatient care program; and (ii) Is provided based upon the PFPWD beneficiary's being eligible for the publicly funded program which has contracted for the care; and (iii) Is authorized by the public facility as a part of a publicly funded program; and (iv) Would cause a cost-share liability in the absence of CHAMPUS eligibility; and (v) Produces a PFPWD beneficiary cost-share liability that does not exceed the maximum charge by the provider to the public facility for the contracted level of care. (g) Implementing instructions. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue CHAMPUS policies, instructions, procedures, guidelines, standards, and criteria as may be necessary to implement the intent of this section. [62 FR 35093, June 30, 1997, as amended at 62 FR 42904, Aug. 11, 1997; 66 FR 67 FR 18827, Apr. 17, 2002] Sec. 199.6 Authorized providers. (a) General. This section sets forth general policies and procedures that are the basis for the CHAMPUS cost-sharing of medical services and supplies provided by institutions, individuals, or other types of providers. Providers seeking payment from the Federal Government through programs such as CHAMPUS have a duty to familiarize themselves with, and comply with, the program requirements. (1) Listing of provider does not guarantee payment of benefits. The fact that a type of provider is listed in this section is not to be construed to mean that CHAMPUS will automatically pay a claim for services or supplies provided by such a provider. The provider who actually furnishes the service(s) must, in fact, meet all licensing and other requirements established by this part to be an authorized provider; the provider must not be the subject of sanction under Sec. 199.9; and, cost-sharing of the services must not otherwise be prohibited by this part. In addition, the patient must in fact be an eligible beneficiary and the services or supplies billed must be authorized and medically necessary, regardless of the standing of the provider. (2) Outside the United States or emergency situations within the United States. Outside the United States or within the United States and Puerto Rico in emergency situations, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, after review of the facts, may provide payment to or on behalf of a beneficiary who receives otherwise covered services or supplies from a provider of service that does not meet the standards described in this part. Note: Only the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the Secretary of Transportation, or their [[Page 155]] designees, may authorize (in emergency situations) payment to civilian facilities in the United States that are not in compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. For the purpose of the Civil Rights Act only, the United States includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Wake Island, Canal Zone, and the territories and possessions of the United States. (3) Dual Compensation/Conflict of Interest. Title 5, United States Code, section 5536 prohibits medical personnel who are active duty Uniformed Service members or civilian employees of the Government from receiving additional Government compensation above their normal pay and allowances for medical care furnished. In addition, Uniformed Service members and civilian employees of the Government are generally prohibited by law and agency regulations and policies from participating in apparent or actual conflict of interest situations in which a potential for personal gain exists or in which there is an appearance of impropriety or incompatibility with the performance of their official duties or responsibilities. The Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Transportation have a responsibility, when disbursing appropriated funds in the payment of CHAMPUS benefits, to ensure that the laws and regulations are not violated. Therefore, active duty Uniformed Service members (including a reserve member while on active duty and civilian employees of the United States Government shall not be authorized to be CHAMPUS providers. While individual employees of the Government may be able to demonstrate that the furnishing of care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries may not be incompatible with their official duties and responsibilities, the processing of millions of CHAMPUS claims each year does not enable Program administrators to efficiently review the status of the provider on each claim to ensure that no conflict of interest or dual compensation situation exists. The problem is further complicated given the numerous interagency agreements (for example, resource sharing arrangements between the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration in the provision of health care) and other unique arrangements which exist at individual treatment facilities around the country. While an individual provider may be prevented from being an authorized CHAMPUS provider even though no conflict of interest or dual compensation situation exists, it is essential for CHAMPUS to have an easily administered, uniform rule which will ensure compliance with the existing laws and regulations. Therefore, a provider who is an active duty Uniformed Service member or civilian employee of the Government shall not be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. In addition, a provider shall certify on each CHAMPUS claim that he/she is not an active duty Uniformed Service member or civilian employee of the Government. (4) [Reserved] (5) Utilization review and quality assurance. Providers approved as authorized CHAMPUS providers have certain obligations to provide services and supplies under CHAMPUS which are (i) furnished at the appropriate level and only when and to the extent medically necessary under the criteria of this part; (ii) of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of health care; and, (iii) supported by adequate medical documentation as may be reasonably required under this part by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, to evidence the medical necessity and quality of services furnished, as well as the appropriateness of the level of care. Therefore, the authorization of CHAMPUS benefits is contingent upon the services and supplies furnished by any provider being subject to pre-payment or post-payment utilization and quality assurance review under professionally recognized standards, norms, and criteria, as well as any standards or criteria issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pursuant to this part. (Refer to Sec. Sec. 199.4, 199.5, and 199.7 of this part.) (6) Exclusion of beneficiary liability. In connection with certain utilization review, quality assurance and preauthorization requirements of section 199.4 of this part, providers may not hold patients liable for payment for certain services for which CHAMPUS payment is disallowed. With respect to such services, providers [[Page 156]] may not seek payment from the patient or the patient's family. Any such effort to seek payment is a basis for termination of the provider's authorized status. (7) Provider required. In order to be considered for benefits, all services and supplies shall be rendered by, prescribed by, or furnished at the direction of, or on the order of a CHAMPUS-authorized provider practicing within the scope of his or her license. (8) Participating providers. A CHAMPUS-authorized provider is a participating provider, as defined in Sec. 199.2 under the following circumstances: (i) Mandatory participation. (A) An institutional provider in Sec. 199.6(b), in order to be an authorized provider under TRICARE, must be a participating provider for all claims. (B) A SNR or a HHA, in order to be an authorized provider under TRICARE, must enter into a participation agreement with TRICARE for all claims. (C) Corporate services providers authorized as CHAMPUS providers under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section must enter into a participation agreement as provided by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee. (ii) Voluntary participation--(A) Total claims participation: The participating provider program. A CHAMPUS-authorized provider that is not required to participate by this part may become a participating provider by entering into an agreement or memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, which includes, but is not limited to, the provisions of paragraph (a)(13) of this section. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may include in a participating provider agreement/MOU provisions that establish between CHAMPUS and a class, category, type, or specific provider, uniform procedures and conditions which encourage provider participation while improving beneficiary access to benefits and contributing to CHAMPUS efficiency. Such provisions shall be otherwise allowed by this part or by DoD Directive or DoD Instruction specifically pertaining to CHAMPUS claims participation. Participating provider program provisions may be incorporated into an agreement/MOU to establish a specific CHAMPUS- provider relationship, such as a preferred provider arrangement. (B) Claim-specific participation. A CHAMPUS-authorized provider that is not required to participate and that has not entered into a participation agreement pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii)(A) of this section may elect to be a participating provider on a claim-by-claim basis by indicating ``accept assignment'' on each claim form for which participation is elected. (iii) Claim-by-claim participation. Individual providers that are not participating providers pursuant to paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section may elect to participate on a claim-by-claim basis. They may do so by signing the appropriate space on the claims form and submitting it to the appropriate TRICARE contractor on behalf of the beneficiary. (9) Limitation to authorized institutional provider designation. Authorized institutional provider status granted to a specific institutional provider applicant does not extend to any institution- affiliated provider, as defined in Sec. 199.2, of that specific applicant. (10) Authorized provider. A hospital or institutional provider, physician, or other individual professional provider, or other provider of services or supplies specifically authorized in this chapter to provide benefits under CHAMPUS. In addition, to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider, any hospital which is a CHAMPUS participating provider under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, shall be a participating provider for all care, services, or supplies furnished to an active duty member of the uniformed services for which the active duty member is entitled under 10 U.S.C. 1074(c). As a participating provider for active duty members, the CHAMPUS authorized hospital shall provide such care, services, and supplies in accordance with the payment rules of Sec. 199.16 of this part. The failure of any CHAMPUS participating hospital to be a participating provider for any active duty member subjects the hospital to termination of the hospital's status as a CHAMPUS authorized provider for failure to meet the qualifications established by this part. [[Page 157]] (11) Balance billing limits. (i) In general. Individual providers including providers salaried or under contract by an institutional provider and other providers who are not participating providers may not balance bill a beneficiary an amount that exceeds the applicable balance billing limit. The balance billing limit shall be the same percentage as the Medicare limiting charge percentage for nonparticipating practitioners and suppliers. (ii) Waiver. The balance billing limit may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS on a case-by-case basis if requested by a CHAMPUS beneficiary. A decision by the Director, OCHAMPUS to waive or not waive the limit in any particular case is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of Sec. 199.10. (iii) Compliance. Failure to comply with the balance billing limit shall be considered abuse and/or fraud and grounds of exclusion or suspension of the provider under Sec. 199.9. (12) Medical records. CHAMPUS-authorized provider organizations and individuals providing clinical services shall maintain adequate clinical records to substantiate that specific care was actually furnished, was medically necessary, and appropriate, and identify(ies) the individual(s) who provided the care. This applies whether the care is inpatient or outpatient. The minimum requirements for medical record documentation are set forth by all of the following: (i) The cognizant state licensing authority; (ii) The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, or the appropriate Qualified Accreditation Organization as defined in Sec. 199.2; (iii) Standards of practice established by national medical organizations; and (iv) This part. (13) Participation agreements. A participation agreement otherwise required by this part shall include, in part, all of the following provisions requiring that the provider shall: (i) Not charge a beneficiary for the following: (A) Services for which the provider is entitled to payment from CHAMPUS; (B) Services for which the beneficiary would be entitled to have CHAMPUS payment made had the provider complied with certain procedural requirements. (C) Services not medically necessary and appropriate for the clinical management of the presenting illness, injury, disorder or maternity; (D) Services for which a beneficiary would be entitled to payment but for a reduction or denial in payment as a result of quality review; and (E) Services rendered during a period in which the provider was not in compliance with one or more conditions of authorization; (ii) Comply with the applicable provisions of this part and related CHAMPUS administrative policy; (iii) Accept the CHAMPUS determined allowable payment combined with the cost-share, deductible, and other health insurance amounts payable by, or on behalf of, the beneficiary, as full payment for CHAMPUS allowed services; (iv) Collect from the CHAMPUS beneficiary those amounts that the beneficiary has a liability to pay for the CHAMPUS deductible and cost- share; (v) Permit access by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, to the clinical record of any CHAMPUS beneficiary, to the financial and organizational records of the provider, and to reports of evaluations and inspections conducted by state, private agencies or organizations; (vi) Provide the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, prompt written notification of the provider's employment of an individual who, at any time during the twelve months preceding such employment, was employed in a managerial, accounting, auditing, or similar capacity by an agency or organization which is responsible, directly or indirectly for decisions regarding Department of Defense payments to the provider; (vii) Cooperate fully with a designated utilization and clinical quality management organization which has a contract with the Department of Defense for the geographic area in which the provider renders services; (viii) Obtain written authorization before rendering designated services or [[Page 158]] items for which CHAMPUS cost-share may be expected; (ix) Maintain clinical and other records related to individuals for whom CHAMPUS payment was made for services rendered by the provider, or otherwise under arrangement, for a period of 60 months from the date of service; (x) Maintain contemporaneous clinical records that substantiate the clinical rationale for each course of treatment, periodic evaluation of the efficacy of treatment, and the outcome at completion or discontinuation of treatment; (xi) Refer CHAMPUS beneficiaries only to providers with which the referring provider does not have an economic interest, as defined in Sec. 199.2; and (xii) Limit services furnished under arrangement to those for which receipt of payment by the CHAMPUS authorized provider discharges the payment liability of the beneficiary. (14) Implementing instructions. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue CHAMPUS policies, instructions, procedures, and guidelines, as may be necesssary to implement the intent of this section. (15) Exclusion. Regardless of any provision in this section, a provider who is suspended, excluded, or terminated under Sec. 199.9 of this part is specifically excluded as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (b) Institutional providers--(1) General. Institutional providers are those providers who bill for services in the name of an organizational entity (such as hospital and skilled nursing facility), rather than in the name of a person. The term ``institutional provider'' does not include professional corporations or associations qualifying as a domestic corporation under Sec. 301.7701-5 of the Internal Revenue Service Regulations nor does it include other corporations that provide principally professional services. Institutional providers may provide medical services and supplies on either an inpatient or outpatient basis. (i) Preauthorization. Preauthorization may be required by the Director, OCHAMPUS for any health care service for which payment is sought under CHAMPUS. (See Sec. Sec. 199.4 and 199.15 for further information on preauthorization requirements.) (ii) Billing practices. (A) Each institutional billing, including those institutions subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based reimbursement method or a CHAMPUS-determined all-inclusive rate reimbursement method, must be itemized fully and sufficiently descriptive for the CHAMPUS to make a determination of benefits. (B) Institutional claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based reimbursement method or a CHAMPUS-determined all-inclusive rate reimbursement method, may be submitted only after the beneficiary has been discharged or transferred from the institutional provider's facility or program. (C) Institutional claims for Residential Treatment Centers and all other institutional providers, except those listed in (B) above, should be submitted to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary at least every 30 days. (2) Nondiscrimination policy. Except as provided below, payment may not be made for inpatient or outpatient care provided and billed by an institutional provider found by the Federal Government to practice discrimination in the admission of patients to its services on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Reimbursement may not be made to a beneficiary who pays for care provided by such a facility and submits a claim for reimbursement. In the following circumstances, the Secretary of Defense, or a designee, may authorize payment for care obtained in an ineligible facility: (i) Emergency care. Emergency inpatient or outpatient care. (ii) Care rendered before finding of a violation. Care initiated before a finding of a violation and which continues after such violation when it is determined that a change in the treatment facility would be detrimental to the health of the patient, and the attending physician so certifies. (iii) Other facility not available. Care provided in an ineligible facility because an eligible facility is not available within a reasonable distance. (3) Procedures for qualifying as a CHAMPUS-approved institutional provider. General and special hospitals otherwise meeting the qualifications [[Page 159]] outlined in paragraphs (b)(4) (i), (ii), and (iii), of this section are not required to request CHAMPUS approval formally. (i) JCAH accreditation status. Each CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary shall keep informed as to the current JCAH accreditation status of all hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in its area; and the provider's status under Medicare, particularly with regard to compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d(1)). The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall specifically approve all other authorized institutional providers providing services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. At the discretion of the Director, OCHAMPUS, any facility that is certified and participating as a provider of services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare), may be deemed to meet CHAMPUS requirements. The facility must be providing a type and level of service that is authorized by this part. (ii) Required to comply with criteria. Facilities seeking CHAMPUS approval will be expected to comply with appropriate criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. They also are required to complete and submit CHAMPUS Form 200, ``Required Information, Facility Determination Instructions,'' and provide such additional information as may be requested by OCHAMPUS. An onsite evaluation, either scheduled or unscheduled, may be conducted at the discretion of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. The final determination regarding approval, reapproval, or disapproval of a facility will be provided in writing to the facility and the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary. (iii) Notice of peer review rights. All health care facilities subject to the DRG-based payment system shall provide CHAMPUS beneficiaries, upon admission, with information about peer review including their appeal rights. The notices shall be in a form specified by the Director, OCHAMPUS. (iv) Surveying of facilities. The surveying of newly established institutional providers and the periodic resurveying of all authorized institutional providers is a continuing process conducted by OCHAMPUS. (v) Institutions not in compliance with CHAMPUS standards. If a determination is made that an institution is not in compliance with one or more of the standards applicable to its specific category of institution, CHAMPUS shall take immediate steps to bring about compliance or terminate the approval as an authorized institution in accordance with Sec. 199.9(f)(2). (vi) Participation agreements required for some hospitals which are not Medicare-participating. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (B)(3), a hospital which is subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system but which is not a Medicare-particpating hospital must request and sign an agreement with OCHAMPUS. By signing the agreement, the hospital agrees to participate on all CHAMPUS inpatient claims and accept the requirements for a participating provider as contained in paragraph (a)(8) of Sec. 199.6. Failure to sign such an agreement shall disqualify such hospital as a CHAMPUS-approved institutional provider. (4) Categories of institutional providers. The following categories of institutional providers may be reimbursed by CHAMPUS for services provided CHAMPUS beneficiaries subject to any and all definitions, conditions, limitation, and exclusions specified or enumerated in this part. (i) Hospitals, acute care, general and special. An institution that provides inpatient services, that also may provide outpatient services (including clinical and ambulatory surgical services), and that: (A) Is engaged primarily in providing to inpatients, by or under the supervision of physicians, diagnostic and therapeutic services for the medical or surgical diagnosis and treatment of illness, injury, or bodily malfunction (including maternity). (B) Maintains clinical records on all inpatients (and outpatients if the facility operates an outpatient department or emergency room). (C) Has bylaws in effect with respect to its operations and medical staff. (D) Has a requirement that every patient be under the care of a physician. (E) Provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered [[Page 160]] professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse on duty at all times. (F) Has in effect a hospital utilization review plan that is operational and functioning. (G) In the case of an institution in a state in which state or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals, the hospital: (1) Is licensed pursuant to such law, or (2) Is approved by the agency of such state or locality responsible for licensing hospitals as meeting the standards established for such licensing. (H) Has in effect an operating plan and budget. (I) Is accredited by the JCAH or meets such other requirements as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Transportation, or the Secretary of Defense finds necessary in the interest of the health and safety of patients who are admitted to and furnished services in the institution. (ii) Organ transplant centers. To obtain TRICARE approval as an organ transplant center, the center must be a Medicare approved transplant center or meet the criteria as established by the Executive Director, TMA, or a designee. (iii) Organ transplant consortia. TRICARE shall approve individual pediatric organ transplant centers that meet the criteria established by the Executive Director, TMA, or a designee. (iv) Hospitals, psychiatric. A psychiatric hospital is an institution which is engaged primarily in providing services to inpatients for the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. (A) There are two major categories of psychiatric hospitals: (1) The private psychiatric hospital category includes both proprietary and the not-for-profit nongovernmental institutions. (2) The second category is those psychiatric hospitals that are controlled, financed, and operated by departments or agencies of the local, state, or Federal Government and always are operated on a not- for-profit basis. (B) In order for the services of a psychiatric hospital to be covered, the hospital shall comply with the provisions outlined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. All psychiatric hospitals shall be accredited under the JCAHO Accreditation Manual for Hospitals (AMH) standards in order for their services to be cost-shared under CHAMPUS. In the case of those psychiatric hospitals that are not JCAHO-accredited because they have not been in operation a sufficient period of time to be eligible to request an accreditation survey by the JCAHO, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may grant temporary approval if the hospital is certified and participating under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare, Part A). This temporary approval expires 12 months from the date on which the psychiatric hospital first becomes eligible to request an accreditation survey by the JCAHO. (C) Factors to be considered in determining whether CHAMPUS will cost-share care provided in a psychiatric hospital include, but are not limited to, the following considerations: (1) Is the prognosis of the patient such that care provided will lead to resolution or remission of the mental illness to the degree that the patient is of no danger to others, can perform routine daily activities, and can be expected to function reasonably outside the inpatient setting? (2) Can the services being provided be provided more economically in another facility or on an outpatient basis? (3) Are the charges reasonable? (4) Is the care primarily custodial or domiciliary? (Custodial or domiciliary care of the permanently mentally ill or retarded is not a benefit under the Basic Program.) (D) Although psychiatric hospitals are accredited under the JCAHO AMH standards, their medical records must be maintained in accordance with the JCAHO Consolidated Standard Manual for Child, Adolescent, and Adult Psychiatric, Alcoholism, and Drug Abuse Facilities and Facilities Serving the Mentally Retarded, along with the requirements set forth in Sec. 199.7(b)(3). The hospital is responsible for assuring that patient services and all treatment [[Page 161]] are accurately documented and completed in a timely manner. (v) Hospitals, long-term (tuberculosis, chronic care, or rehabilitation). To be considered a long-term hospital, an institution for patients that have tuberculosis or chronic diseases must be an institution (or distinct part of an institution) primarily engaged in providing by or under the supervision of a physician appropriate medical or surgical services for the diagnosis and active treatment of the illness or condition in which the institution specializes. (A) In order for the service of long-term hospitals to be covered, the hospital must comply with the provisions outlined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. In addition, in order for services provided by such hospitals to be covered by CHAMPUS, they must be primarily for the treatment of the presenting illness. (B) Custodial or domiciliary care is not coverable under CHAMPUS, even if rendered in an otherwise authorized long-term hospital. (C) The controlling factor in determining whether a beneficiary's stay in a long-term hospital is coverable by CHAMPUS is the level of professional care, supervision, and skilled nursing care that the beneficiary requires, in addition to the diagnosis, type of condition, or degree of functional limitations. The type and level of medical services required or rendered is controlling for purposes of extending CHAMPUS benefits; not the type of provider or condition of the beneficiary. (vi) Skilled nursing facility. A skilled nursing facility is an institution (or a distinct part of an institution) that is engaged primarily in providing to inpatients medically necessary skilled nursing care, which is other than a nursing home or intermediate facility, and which: (A) Has policies that are developed with the advice of (and with provisions for review on a periodic basis by) a group of professionals, including one or more physicians and one or more registered nurses, to govern the skilled nursing care and related medical services it provides. (B) Has a physician, a registered nurse, or a medical staff responsible for the execution of such policies. (C) Has a requirement that the medical care of each patient must be under the supervision of a physician, and provides for having a physician available to furnish necessary medical care in case of an emergency. (D) Maintains clinical records on all patients. (E) Provides 24-hour skilled nursing service that is sufficient to meet nursing needs in accordance with the policies developed as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iv)(A) of this section, and has at least one registered professional nurse employed full-time. (F) Provides appropriate methods and procedures for the dispensing and administering of drugs and biologicals. (G) Has in effect a utilization review plan that is operational and functioning. (H) In the case of an institution in a state in which state or applicable local law provides for the licensing of this type facility, the institution: (1) Is licensed pursuant to such law, or (2) Is approved by the agency of such state or locality responsible for licensing such institutions as meeting the standards established for such licensing. (I) Has in effect an operating plan and budget. (J) Meets such provisions of the most current edition of the Life Safety Code \\8\\ as are applicable to nursing facilities; except that if the Secretary of Health and Human Services has waived, for such periods, as deemed appropriate, specific provisions of such code which, if rigidly applied, would result in unreasonable hardship upon a nursing facility. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ Compiled and published by the National Fire Protection Association, Batterymarch Park, Quincy, Massachusetts 02269. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (K) Is an authorized provider under the Medicare program, and meets the requirements of Title 18 of the social Security Act, sections 1819(a), (b), (c), and (d) (42 U.S.C. 1395i-3(a)-(d)). [[Page 162]] (vii) Residential treatment centers. This paragraph (b)(4)(vii) establishes standards and requirements for residential treatment centers (RTCs). (A) Organization and administration. (1) Definition. A Residential Treatment Center (RTC) is a facility or a distinct part of a facility that provides to beneficiaries under 21 years of age a medically supervised, interdisciplinary program of mental health treatment. An RTC is appropriate for patients whose predominant symptom presentation is essentially stabilized, although not resolved, and who have persistent dysfunction in major life areas. The extent and pervasiveness of the patient's problems require a protected and highly structured therapeutic environment. Residential treatment is differentiated from: (i) Acute psychiatric care, which requires medical treatment and 24- hour availability of a full range of diagnostic and therapeutic services to establish and implement an effective plan of care which will reverse life-threatening and/or severely incapacitating symptoms; (ii) Partial hospitalization, which provides a less than 24-hour- per-day, seven-day-per-week treatment program for patients who continue to exhibit psychiatric problems but can function with support in some of the major life areas; (iii) A group home, which is a professionally directed living arrangement with the availability of psychiatric consultation and treatment for patients with significant family dysfunction and/or chronic but stable psychiatric disturbances; (iv) Therapeutic school, which is an educational program supplemented by psychological and psychiatric services; (v) Facilities that treat patients with a primary diagnosis of chemical abuse or dependence; and (vi) Facilities providing care for patients with a primary diagnosis of mental retardation or developmental disability.

In the case of any misrepresentations, whether by inaccurate information being provided or material facts withheld, authorized provider status will be denied or terminated, and the facility will be ineligible for consideration for authorized provider status for a two year period. (xv) Home health agencies (HHAs). HHAs must be Medicare approved and meet all Medicare conditions of participation under sections 1861(o) and 1891 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(o) and 1395bbb) and 42 CFR part 484 in relation to TRICARE beneficiaries in order to receive payment under the TRICARE program. An HHA may be found to be out of compliance with a particular Medicare condition of participation and still participate in the TRICARE program as long as the HHA is allowed continued participation in Medicare while the condition of noncompliance is being corrected. An HHA is a public or private organization, or a subdivision of such an agency or organization, that meets the following requirements: (A) Engaged in providing skilled nursing services and other therapeutic services, such as physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, or occupational therapy, medical services, and home health aide services.

(2) Be allowed to charge the beneficiary for items or services requested by the beneficiary in addition to those that are covered under the TRICARE HHA prospective payment system. (F) Abide by the following consolidated billing requirements: (1) The HHA must submit all TRICARE claims for all services, excluding durable medical equipment (DME), while the beneficiary is under the home health plan without regard to whether or not the item or service was furnished by the HHA, by others under arrangement with the HHA, or under any other contracting or consulting arrangement. (2) Separate payment will be made for DME items and services provided under the home health benefit which are under the DME fee schedule. DME is excluded from the consolidated billing requirements.

(G) Meet such other requirements as the Secretary of Health and Human Services and/or Secretary of Defense may find necessary in the interest of the health and safety of the individuals who are provided care and services by such agency or organization. (c) Individual professional providers of care--(1) General--(i) Purpose. This individual professional provider class is established to accommodate individuals who are recognized by 10 U.S.C. 1079(a) as authorized to assess or diagnose illness, injury, or bodily malfunction as a prerequisite for CHAMPUS cost-share of otherwise allowable related preventive or treatment services or supplies, and to accommodate such other qualified individuals who the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may authorize to render otherwise allowable services essential to the efficient implementation of a plan-of-care established and managed by a 10 U.S.C. 1079(a) authorized professional. (ii) Professional corporation affiliation or association membership permitted. Paragraph (c) of this section applies to those individual health care professionals who have formed a professional corporation or association pursuant to applicable state laws. Such a professional corporation or association may file claims on behalf of a CHAMPUS- authorized individual professional provider and be the payee for any payment resulting from such claims when the CHAMPUS-authorized individual certifies to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, in writing that the professional corporation or association is acting on the authorized individual's behalf. (iii) Scope of practice limitation. For CHAMPUS cost-sharing to be authorized, otherwise allowable services provided by a CHAMPUS- authorized individual professional provider shall be within the scope of the individual's license as regulated by the applicable state practice act of the state where the individual rendered the service to the CHAMPUS beneficiary or shall be within the scope of the test which was the basis for the individual's qualifying certification. (iv) Employee status exclusion. An individual employed directly, or indirectly by contract, by an individual or entity to render professional services otherwise allowable by this part is excluded from provider status as established by this paragraph (c) for the duration of each employment. (v) Training status exclusion. Individual health care professionals who are allowed to render health care services only under direct and ongoing supervision as training to be credited towards earning a clinical academic degree or other clinical credential required for the individual to practice independently are excluded from provider status as established by this paragraph (c) for the duration of such training. (2) Conditions of authorization--(i) Professional license requirement. The individual must be currently licensed to render professional health care services in each state in which the individual renders services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. Such license is required when a specific state provides, but does not require, license for a specific category of individual professional provider. The license must be at full clinical practice level to meet this requirement. A temporary license at the full clinical practice level is acceptable. (ii) Professional certification requirement. When a state does not license a specific category of individual professional, certification by a Qualified Accreditation Organization, as defined in Sec. 199.2, is required. Certification must be at full clinical practice level. A temporary certification at the full clinical practice level is acceptable. (iii) Education, training and experience requirement. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may establish for each category or type of provider allowed by this paragraph (c) specific education, training, and experience requirements as necessary to promote the delivery of services by fully qualified individuals. (iv) Physician referral and supervision. When physician referral and supervision is a prerequisite for CHAMPUS cost-sharing of the services of a provider authorized under this paragraph (c), such referral and supervision [[Page 185]] means that the physicians must actually see the patient to evaluate and diagnose the condition to be treated prior to referring the beneficiary to another provider and that the referring physician provides ongoing oversight of the course of referral related treatment throughout the period during which the beneficiary is being treated in response to the referral. Written contemporaneous documentation of the referring physician's basis for referral and ongoing communication between the referring and treating provider regarding the oversight of the treatment rendered as a result of the referral must meet all requirements for medical records established by this part. Referring physician supervision does not require physical location on the premises of the treating provider or at the site of treatment. (v) Subject to section 1079(a) of title 10, U.S.C., chapter 55, a physician or other health care practitioner who is eligible to receive reimbursement for services provided under Medicare (as defined in section 1086(d)(3)(C) of title 10 U.S.C., chapter 55) shall be considered approved to provide medical care authorized under section 1079 and section 1086 of title 10, U.S.C., chapter 55 unless the administering Secretaries have information indicating Medicare, TRICARE, or other Federal health care program integrity violations by the physician or other health care practitioner. That is, TRICARE shall accept Medicare certification of providers who have a like class of providers under TRICARE without further authorization unless that provider is under sanctions as stated herein. Providers without a like class (i.e., chiropractors) under TRICARE shall be denied. (3) Types of providers. Subject to the standards of participation provisions of this part, the following individual professional providers of medical care are authorized to provide services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries: (i) Physicians. (A) Doctors of Medicine (M.D.). (B) Doctors of Osteopathy (D.O.). (ii) Dentists.

The certified marriage and family therapist must enter into a participation agreement with the Office of CHAMPUS within which the certified marriage and family therapist agrees to all provisions specified above. (6) As of the effective date of termination, the certified marriage and family therapist will no longer be recognized as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS. Subsequent to termination, the certified marriage and family therapist may only be reinstated as an authorized CHAMPUS extramedical provider by entering into a new participation agreement as a certified marriage and family therapist. (B) Pastoral counselors. For the purposes of CHAMPUS, a pastoral counselor is an individual who meets the following requirements: (1) Recognized graduate professional education with the minimum of an earned master's degree from a regionally accredited educational institution in an appropriate behavioral science field, mental health discipline; and (2) The following experience: (i) Either 200 hours of approved supervision in the practice of pastoral counseling, ordinarily to be completed in a 2- to 3-year period, of which at least 100 hours must be in individual supervision.

Such communication will be made at the end of the treatment, or more frequently, as required by the referring physician (refer to Sec. 199.7). (5) Because of the similarity of the requirements for licensure, certification, experience, and education, a pastoral counselor may elect to be authorized under CHAMPUS as a certified marriage and family therapist, and as such, be subject to all previously defined criteria for the certified marriage and family therapist category, to include acceptance of the CHAMPUS determined allowable charge as payment in full, except for applicable deductibles and cost-shares (i.e., balance billing of a beneficiary above the allowable charge is prohibited; may not bill beneficiary for noncovered care). The pastoral counselor must also agree to enter into the same participation agreement as a certified marriage and family therapist with the Office of CHAMPUS within which the pastoral counselor agrees to all provisions including licensure, national association membership and conditions upon termination, outlined above for certified marriage and family therapist. Note: No dual status will be recognized by the Office of CHAMPUS. Pastoral counselors must elect to become one of the categories of extramedical CHAMPUS provides specified above. Once authorized as either a pastoral counselor, or a certified marriage and family therapist, claims review and reimbursement will be in accordance with the criteria established for the elected provider category. (C) Mental health counselor.

Such communication will be made at the end of the treatment, or more frequently, as required by the referring physician (refer to Sec. 199.7). (D) The following additional information applies to each of the above categories of extramedical individual providers: (1) These providers must also be licensed or certified to practice as a certified marriage and family therapist, pastoral counselor or mental health counselor by the jurisdiction where practicing. In jurisdictions that do not provide for licensure or certification, the provider must be certified by or eligible for full clinical membership in the appropriate national professional association that sets standards for the specific profession. (2) Grace period for therapists or counselors in states where licensure/certification is optional. CHAMPUS is providing a grace period for those therapists or counselors who did not obtain optional licensure/certification in their jurisdiction, not realizing it was a CHAMPUS requirement for authorization. The exemption by state law for pastoral counselors may have misled this group into thinking licensure was not required. The same situation may have occurred with the other therapist or counselor categories where licensure was either not mandated by the state or was provided under a more general category such as ``professional counselors.'' This grace period pertains only to the licensure/certification requirement, applies only to therapists or counselors who are already approved as of October 29, 1990, and only in those areas where the licensure/certification is optional. Any therapist or counselor who is not licensed/certified in the state in which he/she is practicing by [[Page 190]] August 1, 1991, will be terminated under the provisions of Sec. 199.9. This grace period does not change any of the other existing requirements which remain in effect. During this grace period, membership or proof of eligibility for full clinical membership in a recognized professional association is required for those therapists or counselors who are not licensed or certified by the state. The following organizations are recognized for therapists or counselors at the level indicated: Full clinical member of the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy; membership at the fellow or diplomate level of the American Association of Pastoral Counselors; and membership in the National Academy of Certified Clinical Mental Health Counselors. Acceptable proof of eligibility for membership is a letter from the appropriate certifying organization. This opportunity for delayed certification/ licensure is limited to the counselor or therapist category only as the language in all of the other provider categories has been consistent and unmodified from the time each of the other provider categories were added. The grace period does not apply in those states where licensure is mandatory. (E) Christian Science practitioners and Christian Science nurses. CHAMPUS cost-shares the services of Christian Science practitioners and nurses. In order to bill as such, practitioners or nurses must be listed or be eligible for listing in the Christian Science Journal \\1\\ at the time the service is provided. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Copies of this journal can be obtained through the Christian Science Publishing Company, 1 Norway Street, Boston, MA 02115-3122 or the Christian Science Publishing Society, P.O. Box 11369, Des Moines, IA 50340. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (d) Other providers. Certain medical supplies and services of an ancillary or supplemental nature are coverable by CHAMPUS, subject to certain controls. This category of provider includes the following: (1) Independent laboratory. Laboratory services of independent laboratories may be cost-shared if the laboratory is approved for participation under Medicare and certified by the Medicare Bureau, Health Care Financing Administration.

Such exclusion or suspension shall be accomplished according to the provisions of Sec. 199.9. (f) Corporate services providers--(1) General. (i) This corporate services provider class is established to accommodate individuals who would meet the criteria for status as a CHAMPUS authorized individual professional provider as established by paragraph (c) of this section but for the fact that they are employed directly or contractually by a corporation or foundation that provides principally professional services which are within the scope of the CHAMPUS benefit. (ii) Payment for otherwise allowable services may be made to a CHAMPUS-authorized corporate services provider subject to the applicable requirements, exclusions and limitations of this part.

(viii) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, shall determine the appropriate procedural category of a qualified organization and may change the category based upon the provider's CHAMPUS claim characteristics. The category determination of the Director, OCHAMPUS, designee, is conclusive and may not be appealed. (2) Conditions of authorization. An applicant must meet the following conditions to be eligible for authorization as a CHAMPUS corporate services provider: (i) Be a corporation or a foundation, but not a professional corporation or professional association; and (ii) Be institution-affiliated or freestanding as defined in Sec. 199.2; and (iii) Provide: (A) Services and related supplies of a type rendered by CHAMPUS individual professional providers or diagnostic technical services and related supplies of a type which requires direct patient contact and a technologist who is licensed by the state in which the procedure is rendered or who is certified by a Qualified Accreditation Organization as defined in Sec. 199.2; and (B) A level of care which does not necessitate that the beneficiary be provided with on-site sleeping accommodations and food in conjunction with the delivery of services; and (iv) Complies with all applicable organizational and individual licensing or certification requirements that are extant in the state, county, municipality, or other political jurisdiction in which the provider renders services; and (v) Be approved for Medicare payment when determined to be substantially comparable under the provisions of paragraph (f)(1)(iv)(D) of this section or, when Medicare approved status is not required, be accredited by a qualified accreditation organization, as defined in Sec. 199.2; and (vi) Has entered into a participation agreement approved by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, which at least complies with the minimum participation agreement requirements of this section.

[51 FR 24008, July 1, 1986] Editorial Note: For Federal Register citations affecting Sec. 199.6, see the List of Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and on GPO Access. Sec. 199.7 Claims submission, review, and payment. (a) General. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is responsible for ensuring that benefits under CHAMPUS are paid only to the extent described in this part. Before benefits [[Page 193]] can be paid, an appropriate claim must be submitted that includes sufficient information as to beneficiary identification, the medical services and supplies provided, and double coverage information, to permit proper, accurate, and timely adjudication of the claim by the CHAMPUS contractor or OCHAMPUS. Providers must be able to document that the care or service shown on the claim was rendered. This section sets forth minimum medical record requirements for verification of services. Subject to such definitions, conditions, limitations, exclusions, and requirements as may be set forth in this part, the following are the CHAMPUS claim filing requirements: (1) CHAMPUS identification card required. A patient shall present his or her applicable CHAMPUS identification card (that is, Uniformed Services identification card) to the authorized provider of care that identifies the patient as an eligible CHAMPUS beneficiary (refer to Sec. 199.3 of this part). (2) Claim required. No benefit may be extended under the Basic Program or Program for Persons with Disabilities (PFPWD) without the submission of a complete and properly executed appropriate claim form. (3) Responsibility for perfecting claim. It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor or the authorized provider acting on behalf of the CHAMPUS beneficiary to perfect a claim for submission to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary. Neither a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary nor OCHAMPUS is authorized to prepare a claim on behalf of a CHAMPUS beneficiary. (4) Obtaining appropriate claim form. CHAMPUS provides specific CHAMPUS forms appropriate for making a claim for benefits for various types of medical services and supplies (such as hospital, physician, or prescription drugs). Claim forms may be obtained from the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary who processes claims for the beneficiary's state of residence, from the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or from CHAMPUS health benefits advisors (HBAs) located at all Uniformed Services medical facilities. (5) Prepayment not required. A CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor is not required to pay for the medical services or supplies before submitting a claim for benefits. (6) Deductible certificate. If the fiscal year outpatient deductible, as defined in Sec. 199.4(f)(2) has been met by a beneficiary or a family through the submission of a claim or claims to a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary in a geographic location different from the location where a current claim is being submitted, the beneficiary or sponsor must obtain a deductible certificate from the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary where the applicable individual or family fiscal year deductible was met. Such deductible certificate must be attached to the current claim being submitted for benefits. Failure to obtain a deductible certificate under such circumstances will result in a second individual or family fiscal year deductible being applied. However, this second deductible may be reimbursed once appropriate documentation, as described in this paragraph is supplied to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary applying the second deductible (refer to Sec. 199.4 (f)(2)(i)(F)). (7) Nonavailability Statement (DD Form 1251). In some geographic locations or under certain circumstances, it is necessary for a CHAMPUS beneficiary to determine whether the required medical care can be provided through a Uniformed Services facility. If the required medical care cannot be provided by the Uniformed Services facility, a Nonavailability Statement will be issued. When requried (except for emergencies), this Nonavailability Statement must be issued before medical care is obtained from civilian sources. Failure to secure such a statement will waive the beneficiary's rights to benefits under CHAMPUS, subject to appeal to the appropriate hospital commander (or higher medical authority). (i) Rules applicable to issuance of Nonavailability Statement. The ASD(HA) may issue a DoD Instruction to prescribe rules for the issuance of Nonavailability Statement. (ii) Beneficiary responsibility. The beneficiary shall ascertain whether or not he or she resides in a geographic area that requires obtaining a Nonavailability Statement. Information concerning current rules may be obtained [[Page 194]] from the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary concerned, a CHAMPUS HBA or the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (iii) Rules in effect at time civilian care is provided apply. The applicable rules regarding Nonavailability Statements in effect at the time the civilian care is rendered apply in determining whether a Nonavailability Statement is required. (iv) Nonavailability Statement must be filed with applicable claim. When a claim is submitted for CHAMPUS benefits that includes services for which a Nonavailability Statement is required, such statement must be submitted along with the claim form. (b) Information required to adjudicate a CHAMPUS claim. Claims received that are not completed fully and that do not provide the following minimum information may be returned. If enough space is not available on the appropriate claim form, the required information must be attached separately and include the patient's name and address, be dated, and signed. (1) Patient's identification information. The following patient identification information must be completed on every CHAMPUS claim form submitted for benefits before a claim will be adjudicated and processed: (i) Patient's full name. (ii) Patient's residence address. (iii) Patient's date of birth. (iv) Patient's relationship to sponsor. Note: If name of patient is different from sponsor, explain (for example, stepchild or illegitimate child). (v) Patient's identification number (from DD Form 1173). (vi) Patient's identification card effective date and expiration date (from DD Form 1173). (vii) Sponsor's full name. (viii) Sponsor's service or social security number. (ix) Sponsor's grade. (x) Sponsor's organization and duty station. Home port for ships; home address for retiree. (xi) Sponsor's branch of service or deceased or retiree's former branch of service. (xii) Sponsor's current status. Active duty, retired, or deceased. (2) Patient treatment information. The following patient treatment information routinely is required relative to the medical services and supplies for which a claim for benefits is being made before a claim will be adjudicated and processed: (i) Diagnosis. All applicable diagnoses are required; standard nomenclature is acceptable. In the absence of a diagnosis, a narrative description of the definitive set of symptoms for which the medical care was rendered must be provided. (ii) Source of care. Full name of source of care (such as hospital or physician) providing the specific medical services being claimed. (iii) Full address of source of care. This address must be where the care actually was provided, not a billing address. (iv) Attending physician. Name of attending physician (or other authorized individual professional provider). (v) Referring physician. Name and address of ordering, prescribing, or referring physician. (vi) Status of patient. Status of patient at the time the medical services and supplies were rendered (that is, inpatient or outpatient). (vii) Dates of service. Specific and inclusive dates of service. (viii) Inpatient stay. Source and dates of related inpatient stay (if applicable). (ix) Physicians or other authorized individual professional providers. The claims must give the name of the individual actually rendering the care, along with the individual's professional status (e.g., M.D., Ph.D., R.N., etc.) and provider number, if the individual signing the claim is not the provider who actually rendered the service. The following information must also be included: (A) Date each service was rendered. (B) Procedure code or narrative description of each procedure or service for each date of service. (C) Individual charge for each item of service or each supply for each date. (D) Detailed description of any unusual complicating circumstances related to the medical care provided that the physician or other individual professional provider may choose to submit separately. (x) Hospitals or other authorized institutional providers. For care provided by [[Page 195]] hospitals (or other authorized institutional providers), the following information also must be provided before a claim will be adjudicated and processed: (A) An itemized billing showing each item of service or supply provided for each day covered by the claim. Note: The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may approve, in writing, an alternative billing procedure for RTCs or other special institutions, in which case the itemized billing requirement may be waived. The particular facility will be aware of such approved alternate billing procedure. (B) Any absences from a hospital or other authorized institution during a period for which inpatient benefits are being claimed must be identified specifically as to date or dates and provide details on the purpose of the absence. Failure to provide such information will result in denial of benefits and, in an ongoing case, termination of benefits for the inpatient stay at least back to the date of the absence. (C) For hospitals subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system (see paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(D) of Sec. 199.14), the following information is also required: (1) The principal diagnosis (the diagnosis established, after study, to be chiefly responsible for causing the patient's admission to the hospital). (2) All secondary diagnoses. (3) All significant procedures performed. (4) The discharge status of the beneficiary. (5) The hospital's Medicare provider number. (6) The source of the admission. (D) Claims submitted by hospitals (or other authorized institutional providers) must include the name of the individual actually rendering the care, along with the individual's professional status (e.g., M.D., Ph.D., R.N., etc.). (xi) Prescription drugs and medicines (and insulin). For prescription drugs and medicines (and insulin, whether or not a prescription is required) receipted bills must be attached and the following additional information provided: (A) Name of drug. Note: When the physician or pharmacist so requests, the name of the drugs may be submitted to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary directly by the physician or pharmacist. (B) Strength of drug. (C) Name and address of pharmacy where drug was purchased. (D) Prescription number of drug being claimed. (xii) Other authorized providers. For items from other authorized providers (such as medical supplies), an explanation as to the medical need must be attached to the appropriate claim form. For purchases of durable equipment under the PFPWD, it is necessary also to attach a copy of the preauthorization. (xiii) Nonparticipating providers. When the beneficiary or sponsor submits the claim to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary (that is, the provider elects not to participate), an itemized bill from the provider to the beneficiary or sponsor must be attached to the CHAMPUS claim form. (3) Medical records/medical documentation. Medical records are of vital importance in the care and treatment of the patient. Medical records serve as a basis for planning of patient care and for the ongoing evaluation of the patient's treatment and progress. Accurate and timely completion of orders, notes, etc., enable different members of a health care team and subsequent health care providers to have access to relevant data concerning the patient. Appropriate medical records must be maintained in order to accommodate utilization review and to substantiate that billed services were actually rendered. (i) All care rendered and billed must be appropriately documented in writing. Failure to document the care billed will result in the claim or specific services on the claim being denied CHAMPUS cost-sharing. (ii) A pattern of failure to adequately document medical care will result in episodes of care being denied CHAMPUS cost-sharing. (iii) Cursory notes of a generalized nature that do not identify the specific treatment and the patient's response to the treatment are not acceptable. (iv) The documentation of medical records must be legible and prepared as soon as possible after the care is rendered. Entries should be made when the [[Page 196]] treatment described is given or the observations to be documented are made. The following are documentation requirements and specific time frames for entry into the medical records: (A) General requirements for acute medical/surgical services: (1) Admission evaluation report within 24 hours of admission. (2) Completed history and physical examination report within 72 hours of admission. (3) Registered nursing notes at the end of each shift. (4) Daily physician notes. (B) Requirements specific to mental health services: (1) Psychiatric admission evaluation report within 24 hours of admission. (2) History and physical examination within 24 hours of admission; complete report documented within 72 hours for acute and residential programs and within 3 working days for partial programs. (3) Individual and family therapy notes within 24 hours of procedure for acute, detoxification and Residential Treatment Center (RTC) programs and within 48 hours for partial programs. (4) Preliminary treatment plan within 24 hours of admission. (5) Master treatment plan within 5 calendar days of admission for acute care, 10 days for RTC care, 5 days for full-day partial programs and within 7 days for half-day partial programs. (6) Family assessment report within 72 hours of admission for acute care and 7 days for RTC and partial programs. (7) Nursing assessment report within 24 hours of admission. (8) Nursing notes at the end of each shift for acute and detoxification programs; every ten visits for partial hospitalization; and at least once a week for RTCs. (9) Daily physician notes for intensive treatment, detoxification, and rapid stabilization programs; twice per week for acute programs; and once per week for RTC and partial programs. (10) Group therapy notes once per week. (11) Ancillary service notes once per week. Note: A pattern of failure to meet the above criteria may result in provider sanctions prescribed under Sec. 199.9. (4) Double coverage information. When the CHAMPUS beneficiary is eligible for medical benefits coverage through another plan, insurance, or program, either private or Government, the following information must be provided: (i) Name of other coverage. Full name and address of double coverage plan, insurance, or program (such as Blue Cross, Medicare, commercial insurance, and state program). (ii) Source of double coverage. Source of double coverage (such as employment, including retirement, private purchase, membership in a group, and law). (iii) Employer information. If source of double coverage is employment, give name and address of employer. (iv) Identification number. Identification number or group number of other coverage. (5) Right to additional information. (i) As a condition precedent to the cost-sharing of benefits under this part or pursuant to a review or audit, whether the review or audit is prospective, concurrent, or retroactive, OCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS contractors may request, and shall be entitled to receive, information from a physician or hospital or other person, institution, or organization (including a local, state, or Federal Government agency) providing services or supplies to the beneficiary for whom claims or requests for approval for benefits are submitted. Such information and records may relate to the attendance, testing, monitoring, examination, diagnosis, treatment, or services and supplies furnished to a beneficiary and, as such, shall be necessary for the accurate and efficient administration of CHAMPUS benefits. This may include requests for copies of all medical records or documentation related to the episode of care. In addition, before a determination on a request for preauthorization or claim of benefits is made, a beneficiary, or sponsor, shall provide additional information relevant to the requested determination, when necessary. The recipient of such information shall hold such records confidential except when: (A) Disclosure of such information is authorized specifically by the beneficiary; [[Page 197]] (B) Disclosure is necessary to permit authorized governmental officials to investigate and prosecute criminal actions; or (C) Disclosure is authorized or required specifically under the terms of DoD Directive 5400.7 and 5400.11, the Freedom of Information Act, and the Privacy Act (refer to paragraph (m) of Sec. 199.1 of this part). (ii) For the purposes of determining the applicability of and implementing the provisions of Sec. Sec. 199.8 and 199.9, or any provision of similar purpose of any other medical benefits coverage or entitlement, OCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries, without consent or notice to any beneficiary or sponsor, may release to or obtain from any insurance company or other organization, governmental agency, provider, or person, any information with respect to any beneficiary when such release constitutes a routine use duly published in the Federal Register in accordance with the Privacy Act. (iii) Before a beneficiary's claim of benefits is adjudicated, the beneficiary or the provider(s) must furnish to CHAMPUS that information which is necessary to make the benefit determination. Failure to provide the requested information will result in denial of the claim. A beneficiary, by submitting a CHAMPUS claim(s) (either a participating or nonparticipating claim), is deemed to have given consent to the release of any and all medical records or documentation pertaining to the claims and the episode of care. (c) Signature on CHAMPUS Claim Form--(1) Beneficiary signature. CHAMPUS claim forms must be signed by the beneficiary except under the conditions identified in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section. The parent or guardian may sign for any beneficiary under 18 years. (i) Certification of identity. This signature certifies that the patient identification information provided is correct. (ii) Certification of medical care provided. This signature certifies that the specific medical care for which benefits are being claimed actually were rendered to the beneficiary on the dates indicated. (iii) Authorization to obtain or release information. Before requesting additional information necessary to process a claim or releasing medical information, the signature of the beneficiary who is 18 years old or older must be recorded on or obtained on the CHAMPUS claim form or on a separate release form. The signature of the beneficiary, parent, or guardian will be requested when the beneficiary is under 18 years. Note: If the care was rendered to a minor and a custodial parent or legal guardian requests information prior to the minor turning 18 years of age, medical records may still be released pursuant to the signature of the parent or guardian, and claims information may still be released to the parent or guardian in response to the request, even though the beneficiary has turned 18 between the time of the request and the response. However, any follow-up request or subsequent request from the parent or guardian, after the beneficiary turns 18 years of age, will necessitate the authorization of the beneficiary (or the beneficiary's legal guardian as appointed by a cognizant court), before records and information can be released to the parent or guardian. (iv) Certification of accuracy and authorization to release double coverage information. This signature certifies to the accuracy of the double coverage information and authorizes the release of any information related to double coverage. (Refer to Sec. 199.8 of this part). (v) Exceptions to beneficiary signature requirement. (A) Except as required by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, the signature of a spouse, parent, or guardian will be accepted on a claim submitted for a beneficiary who is 18 years old or older. (B) When the institutional provider obtains the signature of the beneficiary (or the signature of the parent or guardian when the beneficiary is under 18 years) on a CHAMPUS claim form at admission, the following participating claims may be submitted without the beneficiary's signature. (1) Claims for laboratory and diagnostic tests and test interpretations from radiologists, pathologists, neurologists, and cardiologists. (2) Claims from anesthesiologists. (C) Claims filed by providers using CHAMPUS-approved signature-on- file and claims submission procedures. [[Page 198]] (2) Provider's signature. A participating provider (see paragraph (a)(8) of Sec. 199.6) is required to sign the CHAMPUS claim form. (i) Certification. A participating provider's signature on a CHAMPUS claim form: (A) Certifies that the specific medical care listed on the claim form was, in fact, rendered to the specific beneficiary for which benefits are being claimed, on the specific date or dates indicated, at the level indicated and by the provider signing the claim unless the claim otherwise indicates another individual provided the care. For example, if the claim is signed by a psychiatrist and the care billed was rendered by a psychologist or licensed social worker, the claim must indicate both the name and profession of the individual who rendered the care. (B) Certifies that the provider has agreed to participate (providing this agreement has been indicated on the claim form) and that the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost will constitute the full charge or cost for the medical care listed on the specific claim form; and further agrees to accept the amount paid by CHAMPUS or the CHAMPUS payment combined with the cost-shared amount paid by, or on behalf of the beneficiary, as full payment for the covered medical services or supplies. (1) Thus, neither CHAMPUS nor the sponsor is responsible for any additional charges, whether or not the CHAMPUS-determined charge or cost is less than the billed amount. (2) Any provider who signs and submits a CHAMPUS claim form and then violates this agreement by billing the beneficiary or sponsor for any difference between the CHAMPUS-determined charge or cost and the amount billed is acting in bad faith and is subject to penalties including withdrawal of CHAMPUS approval as a CHAMPUS provider by administrative action of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, and possible legal action on the part of CHAMPUS, either directly or as a part of a beneficiary action, to recover monies improperly obtained from CHAMPUS beneficiaries or sponsors (refer to Sec. 199.6 of this part.) (ii) Physician or other authorized individual professional provider. A physician or other authorized individual professional provider is liable for any signature submitted on his or her behalf. Further, a facsimile signature is not acceptable unless such facsimile signature is on file with, and has been authorized specifically by, the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary serving the state where the physician or other authorized individual professional provider practices. (iii) Hospital or other authorized institutional provider. The provider signature on a claim form for institutional services must be that of an authorized representative of the hospital or other authorized institutional provider, whose signature is on file with and approved by the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary. (d) Claims filing deadline. For all services provided on or after January 1, 1993, to be considered for benefits, all claims submitted for benefits must, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, be filed with the appropriate CHAMPUS contractor no later than one year after the services are provided. Unless the requirement is waived, failure to file a claim within this deadline waives all rights to benefits for such services or supplies. (1) Claims returned for additional information. When a claim is submitted initially within the claim filing time limit, but is returned in whole or in part for additional information to be considered for benefits, the returned claim, along with the requested information, must be resubmitted and received by the appropriate CHAMPUS contractor no later than the later of: (i) One year after the services are provided; or (ii) 90 days from the date the claim was returned to the provider or beneficiary. (2) Exception to claims filing deadline. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may grant exceptions to the claims filing deadline requirements. (i) Types of exception. (A) Retroactive eligibility. Retroactive CHAMPUS eligibility determinations. (B) Administrative error. Administrative error (that is, misrepresentation, mistake, or other accountable action) [[Page 199]] of an officer or employee of OCHAMPUS (including OCHAMPUSEUR) or a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary, performing functions under CHAMPUS and acting within the scope of that official's authority. (C) Mental incompetency. Mental incompetency of the beneficiary or guardian or sponsor, in the case of a minor child (which includes inability to communicate, even if it is the result of a physical disability). (D) Delays by other health insurance. When not attributable to the beneficiary, delays in adjudication by other health insurance companies when double coverage coordination is required before the CHAMPUS benefit determination. (E) Other waiver authority. The Director, OCHAMPUS may waive the claims filing deadline in other circumstances in which the Director determines that the waiver is necessary in order to ensure adequate access for CHAMPUS beneficiaries to health care services. (ii) Request for exception to claims filing deadline. Beneficiaries who wish to request an exception to the claims filing deadline may submit such a request to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary having jurisdiction over the location in which the service was rendered, or as otherwise designated by the Director, OCHAMPUS. (A) Such requests for an exception must include a complete explanation of the circumstances of the late filing, together with all available documentation supporting the request, and the specific claim denied for late filing. (B) Each request for an exception to the claims filing deadline is reviewed individually and considered on its own merits. (e) Other claims filing requirements. Notwithstanding the claims filing deadline described in paragraph (d) of this section, to lessen any potential adverse impact on a CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor that could result from a retroactive denial, the following additional claims filing procedures are recommended or required. (1) Continuing care. Except for claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG- based payment system, whenever medical services and supplies are being rendered on a continuing basis, an appropriate claim or claims should be submitted every 30 days (monthly) whether submitted directly by the beneficiary or sponsor or by the provider on behalf of the beneficiary. Such claims may be submitted more frequently if the beneficiary or provider so elects. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, also may require more frequent claims submission based on dollars. Examples of care that may be rendered on a continuing basis are outpatient physical therapy, private duty (special) nursing, or inpatient stays. For claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, claims may be submitted only after the beneficiary has been discharged or transferred from the hospital. (2) Inpatient mental health services. Under most circumstances, the 60-day inpatient mental health limit applies to the first 60 days of care paid in a calendar year. The patient will be notified when the first 30 days of inpatient mental health benefits have been paid. The beneficiary is responsible for assuring that all claims for care are submitted sequentially and on a regular basis. Once payment has been made for care determined to be medically appropriate and a program benefit, the decision will not be reopened solely on the basis that previous inpatient mental health care had been rendered but not yet billed during the same calendar year by a different provider. (3) Claims involving the services of marriage and family counselors, pastoral counselors, and mental health counselors. CHAMPUS requires that marriage and family counselors, pastoral counselors, and mental health counselors make a written report to the referrring physician concerning the CHAMPUS beneficiary's progress. Therefore, each claim for reimbursement for services of marriage and family counselors, pastoral counselors, and mental health counselors must include certification to the effect that a written communication has been made or will be made to the referring physician at the end of treatment, or more frequently, as required by the referring physician. (f) Preauthorization. When specifically required in other sections of this part, preauthorization requires the following: [[Page 200]] (1) Preauthorization must be granted before benefits can be extended. In those situations requiring preauthorization, the request for such preauthorization shall be submitted and approved before benefits may be extended, except as provided in Sec. 199.4(a)(11). If a claim for services or supplies is submitted without the required preauthorization, no benefits shall be paid, unless the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, has granted an exception to the requirement for preauthorization. (i) Specifically preauthorized services. An approved preauthorization specifies the exact services or supplies for which authorization is being given. In a preauthorization situation, benefits cannot be extended for services or supplies provided beyond the specific authorization. (ii) Time limit on preauthorization. Approved preauthorizations are valid for specific periods of time, appropriate for the circumstances presented and specified at the time the preauthorization is approved. In general, preauthorizations are valid for 30 days. If the preauthorized service or supplies are not obtained or commenced within the specified time limit, a new preauthorization is required before benefits may be extended. For organ and stem cell transplants, the preauthorization shall remain in effect as long as the beneficiary continues to meet the specific transplant criteria set forth in the TRICARE/CHAMPUS Policy Manual, or until the approved transplant occurs. (2) Treatment plan. Each preauthorization request shall be accompanied by a proposed medical treatment plan (for inpatient stays under the Basic Program) which shall include generally a diagnosis; a detailed summary of complete history and physical; a detailed statement of the problem; the proposed treatment modality, including anticipated length of time the proposed modality will be required; any available test results; consultant's reports; and the prognosis. When the preauthorization request involves transfer from a hospital to another inpatient facility, medical records related to the inpatient stay also must be provided. (3) Claims for services and supplies that have been preauthorized. Whenever a claim is submitted for benefits under CHAMPUS involving preauthorized services and supplies, the date of the approved preauthorization must be indicated on the claim form and a copy of the written preauthorization must be attached to the appropriate CHAMPUS claim. (4) Advance payment prohibited. No CHAMPUS payment shall be made for otherwise authorized services or items not yet rendered or delivered to the beneficiary. (g) Claims review. It is the responsibility of the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary (or OCHAMPUS, including OCHAMPUSEUR) to review each CHAMPUS claim submitted for benefit consideration to ensure compliance with all applicable definitions, conditions, limitations, or exclusions specified or enumerated in this part. It is also required that before any CHAMPUS benefits may be extended, claims for medical services and supplies will be subject to utilization review and quality assurance standards, norms, and criteria issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee (see paragraph (a)(1)(v) of Sec. 199.14 for review standards for claims subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system). (h) Benefit payments. CHAMPUS benefit payments are made either directly to the beneficiary or sponsor or to the provider, depending on the manner in which the CHAMPUS claim is submitted. (1) Benefit payments made to beneficiary or sponsor. When the CHAMPUS beneficiary or sponsor signs and submits a specific claim form directly to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary (or OCHAMPUS, including OCHAMPUSEUR), any CHAMPUS benefit payments due as a result of that specific claim submission will be made in the name of, and mailed to, the beneficiary or sponsor. In such circumstances, the beneficiary or sponsor is responsible to the provider for any amounts billed. (2) Benefit payments made to participating provider. When the authorized provider elects to participate by signing a CHAMPUS claim form, indicating [[Page 201]] participation in the appropriate space on the claim form, and submitting a specific claim on behalf of the beneficiary to the appropriate CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary, any CHAMPUS benefit payments due as a result of that claim submission will be made in the name of and mailed to the participating provider. Thus, by signing the claim form, the authorized provider agrees to abide by the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost, whether or not lower than the amount billed. Therefore, the beneficiary or sponsor is responsible only for any required deductible amount and any cost-sharing portion of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost as may be required under the terms and conditions set forth in Sec. Sec. 199.4 and 199.5 of this part. (3) CEOB. When a CHAMPUS claim is adjudicated, a CEOB is sent to the beneficiary or sponsor. A copy of the CEOB also is sent to the provider if the claim was submitted on a participating basis. The CEOB form provides, at a minimum, the following information: (i) Name and address of beneficiary. (ii) Name and address of provider. (iii) Services or supplies covered by claim for which CEOB applies. (iv) Dates services or supplies provided. (v) Amount billed; CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost; and amount of CHAMPUS payment. (vi) To whom payment, if any, was made. (vii) Reasons for any denial. (viii) Recourse available to beneficiary for review of claim decision (refer to Sec. 199.10 of this part). Note: The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may authorize a CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary to waive a CEOB to protect the privacy of a CHAMPUS beneficiary. (4) Benefit under $1. If the CHAMPUS benefit is determined to be under $1, payment is waived. (i) Extension of the Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan to areas outside the United States. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA) may, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1076a(h), extend the Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan to areas other than those areas specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for the eligible beneficiaries of members of the Uniformed Services. In extending the program outside the Continental United States, the ASD(HA), or designee, is authorized to establish program elements, methods of administration and payment rates and procedures to providers that are different from those in effect under this section in the Continental United States to the extent the ASD(HA), or designee, determines necessary for the effective and efficient operation of the plan outside the Continental United States. This includes provisions for preauthorization of care if the needed services are not available in a Uniformed Service overseas dental treatment facility and payment by the Department of certain cost- shares and other portions of a provider's billed charges. Other differences may occur based on limitations in the availability and capabilities of the Uniformed Services overseas dental treatment facility and a particular nation's civilian sector providers in certain areas. Otherwise, rules pertaining to services covered under the plan and quality of care standards for providers shall be comparable to those in effect under this section in the Continental United States and available military guidelines. In addition, all provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1076a shall remain in effect. (j) General assignment of benefits not recognized. CHAMPUS does not recognize any general assignment of CHAMPUS benefits to another person. All CHAMPUS benefits are payable as described in this and other Sections of this part. [51 FR 24008, July 1, 1986, as amended at 52 FR 33007, Sept. 1, 1987; 53 FR 68 FR 44881, July 31, 2003] Sec. 199.8 Double coverage. (a) Introduction. (1) In enacting TRICARE legislation, Congress clearly has intended that TRICARE be the secondary payer to all health benefit, insurance and third-party payer plans. 10 U.S.C. 1079(j)(1) specifically provides that a benefit may not be paid under a plan (CHAMPUS) covered by this section in the case of a person enrolled in, [[Page 202]] or covered by, any other insurance, medical service, or health plan, including any plan offered by a third-party payer (as defined in 10 U.S.C. 1095(h)(1)) to the extent that the benefit is also a benefit under the other plan, except in the case of a plan administered under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.). (2) The provision in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is made applicable specifically to retired members, dependents, and survivors by 10 U.S.C. 1086(g). The underlying intent, in addition to preventing waste of Federal resources, is to ensure that TRICARE beneficiaries receive maximum benefits while ensuring that the combined payments of TRICARE and other health and insurance plans do not exceed the total charges. (b) Double coverage plan. A double coverage plan is one of the following: (1) Insurance plan. An insurance plan is any plan or program that is designed to provide compensation or coverage for expenses incurred by a beneficiary for medical services and supplies. It includes plans or programs for which the beneficiary pays a premium to an issuing agent as well as those plans or programs to which the beneficiary is entitled as a result of employment or membership in, or association with, an organization or group. (2) Medical service or health plan. A medical service or health plan is any plan or program of an organized health care group, corporation, or other entity for the provision of health care to an individual from plan providers, both professional and institutional. It includes plans or programs for which the beneficiary pays a premium to an issuing agent as well as those plans or programs to which the beneficiary is entitled as a result of employment or membership in, or association with, an organization or group. (3) Third-party payer. A third-party payer means an entity that provides an insurance, medical service, or health plan by contract or agreement, including an automobile liability insurance or no-fault insurance carrier and a workers' compensation program or plan, and any other plan or program (e.g., homeowners insurance, etc.) that is designed to provide compensation or coverage for expenses incurred by a beneficiary for medical services or supplies. For purposes of the definition of ``third-party payer,'' an insurance, medical service or health plan includes a preferred provider organization, an insurance plan described as Medicare supplemental insurance, and a personal injury protection plan or medical payments benefit plan for personal injuries resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle. (4) Exceptions. Double coverage plans do not include: (i) Plans administered under title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid); (ii) Coverage specifically designed to supplement CHAMPUS benefits (a health insurance policy or other health benefit plan that meets the definition and criteria under supplemental insurance plan as set forth in Sec. 199.2(b)); (iii) Entitlement to receive care from Uniformed Services medical care facilities; (iv) Certain Federal Government programs, as prescribed by the Director, OCHAMPUS, that are designed to provide benefits to a distinct beneficiary population and for which entitlement does not derive from either premium payment of monetary contribution (for example, the Indian Health Service); or (v) State Victims of Crime Compensation Programs. (c) Application of double coverage provisions. CHAMPUS claims submitted for otherwise covered services or supplies and which involve double coverage shall be adjudicated as follows: (1) TRICARE last pay. For any claim that involves a double coverage plan as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, TRICARE shall be last pay except as may be authorized by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. That is, TRICARE benefits may not be extended until all other double coverage plans have adjudicated the claim. (2) TRICARE advance payment. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, may authorize payment of a claim in advance of adjudication of the claim by a double coverage plan and recover, under Sec. 199.12, [[Page 203]] the TRICARE costs of health care incurred on behalf of the covered beneficiary under the following conditions: (i) The claim is submitted for health care services furnished to a covered beneficiary; and, (ii) The claim is identified as involving services for which a third-party payer, other than a primary medical insurer, may be liable. (3) Primary medical insurer. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a ``primary medical insurer'' is an insurance plan, medical service or health plan, or a third-party payer under this section, the primary or sole purpose of which is to provide or pay for health care services, supplies, or equipment. The term ``primary medical insurer'' does not include automobile liability insurance, no-fault insurance, workers' compensation program or plan, homeowners insurance, or any other similar third-party payer as may be designated by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, in any policy guidance or instructions issued in implementation of this Part. (4) Waiver of benefits. A CHAMPUS beneficiary may not elect to waive benefits under a double coverage plan and use CHAMPUS. Whenever double coverage exists, the provisions of this Section shall be applied. (5) Lack of payment by double coverage plan. Amounts that have been denied by a double coverage plan simply because a claim was not filed timely or because the beneficiary failed to meet some other requirement of coverage cannot be paid. If a statement from the double coverage plan as to how much that plan would have paid had the claim met the plan's requirements is provided to the CHAMPUS contractor, the claim can be processed as if the double coverage plan actually paid the amount shown on the statement. If no such statement is received, no payment from CHAMPUS is authorized. (6) Lack of payment by double coverage plan. Amounts that have been denied by a double coverage plan simply because a claim was not filed timely or because the beneficiary failed to meet some other requirement of coverage cannot be paid. If a statement from the double coverage plan as to how much that plan would have paid had the claim met the plan's requirements is provided to the CHAMPUS contractor, the claim can be processed as if the double coverage plan actually paid the amount shown on the statement. If no such statement is received, no payment from CHAMPUS is authorized. (d) Special considerations. (1) CHAMPUS and Medicare--(i) General rule. In any case in which a beneficiary eligible for both Medicare and CHAMPUS receives medical or dental care for which payment may be made under Medicare and CHAMPUS, Medicare is always the primary payer. For dependents of active duty members, payment will be determined in accordance to paragraph (c) of this section. For all other beneficiaries eligible for Medicare, the amount payable by CHAMPUS shall be the amount of the actual out-of-pocket costs incurred by the beneficiary for that care over the sum of the amount paid for that care under Medicare and the total of all amounts paid or payable by third party payers other than Medicare. (ii) Payment limit. The total CHAMPUS amount payable for care under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section may not exceed the total amount that would be paid under CHAMPUS if payment for that care was made solely under CHAMPUS. (iii) Application of general rule. In applying the general rule under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the first determination will be whether payment may be made under Medicare. For this purpose, Medicare exclusions, conditions, and limitations will be based for the determination. (A) For items or services or portions or segments of items or services for which payment may be made under Medicare, the CHAMPUS payment will be the amount of the beneficiary's actual out of pocket liability, minus the amount payable by Medicare, also minus amount payable by other third party payers, subject to the limit under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. (B) For items or services or segments of items or services for which no payment may be made under Medicare, the CHAMPUS payment will be the same as it would be for a CHAMPUS eligible [[Page 204]] retiree, dependent, or survivor beneficiary who is not Medicare eligible. (iv) Examples of applications of general rule. The following examples are illustrative. They are not all-inclusive. (A) In the case of a Medicare-eligible beneficiary receiving typical physician office visit services, Medicare payment generally will be made. CHAMPUS payment will be determined consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. (B) In the case of a Medicare-eligible beneficiary residing and receiving medical care overseas, Medicare payment generally may not be made. CHAMPUS payment will be determined consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section. (C) In the case of a Medicare-eligible beneficiary receiving skilled nursing facility services a portion of which is payable by Medicare (such as during the first 100 days) and a portion of which is not payable by Medicare (such as after 100 days), CHAMPUS payment for the first portion will be determined consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section and for the second portion consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section. (v) Application of catastrophic cap. Only in cases in which CHAMPUS payment is determined consistent with paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, actual beneficiary out of pocket liability remaining after CHAMPUS payments will be counted for purposes of the annual catastrophic loss protection, set forth under Sec. 199.4(f)(10). When a family has met the cap, CHAMPUS will pay allowable amounts for remaining covered services through the end of that fiscal year. (vi) Effect of enrollment in Medicare+Choice plan. In the case of a beneficiary enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan who receives items or services for which payment may be made under both the Medicare+Choice plan and CHAMPUS, a claim for the beneficiary's normal out-of-pocket costs under the Medicare+Choice plan may be submitted for CHAMPUS payment. However, consistent with paragraph (c)(4) of this section, out- of-pocket costs do not include costs associated with unauthorized out- of-system care or care otherwise obtained under circumstances that result in a denial or limitation of coverage for care that would have been covered or fully covered had the beneficiary met applicable requirements and procedures. In such cases, the CHAMPUS amount payable is limited to the amount that would have been paid if the beneficiary had received care covered by the Medicare+Choice plan. (vii) Effect of other double coverage plans, including medigap plans. CHAMPUS is second payer to other third-party payers of health insurance, including Medicare supplemental plans. (viii) Effect of employer-provided insurance. In the case of individuals with health insurance due to their current employment status, the employer insurance plan shall be first payer, Medicare shall be the second payer, and CHAMPUS shall be the tertiary payer. (2) CHAMPUS and Medicaid. Medicaid is not a double coverage plan. In any double coverage situation involving Medicaid, CHAMPUS is always the primary payer. (3) TRICARE and Workers' Compensation. TRICARE benefits are not payable for a work-related illness or injury that is covered under a workers' compensation program. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, however, the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, may authorize payment of a claim involving a work-related illness or injury covered under a workers' compensation program in advance of adjudication and payment of the workers' compensation claim and then recover, under Sec. 199.12, the TRICARE costs of health care incurred on behalf of the covered beneficiary. (4) Program for persons with disabilities (PFPWD). A PFPWD eligible beneficiary (or sponsor or guardian acting on behalf of the beneficiary) does not have the option of waiving the full use of public facilities which are determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, to be available and adequate to meet a disability related need for which a PFPWD benefit was requested. Benefits eligible for payment under a State plan for medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) are never considered to be [[Page 205]] available in the adjudication of PFPWD benefits. (5) The requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this section notwithstanding, CHAMPUS is primary payer for services and items that are provided under Part C of the IDEA that are medically or psychologically necessary in accordance with the Individualized Family Service Plan and that are otherwise allowable under the CHAMPUS Basic Program or the Program for Persons with Disabilities. (e) Implementing instructions. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue such instructions, procedures, or guidelines, as necessary, to implement the intent of this section. [51 FR 24008, July 1, 1986, as amended at 62 FR 35097, June 30, 1997; 62 FR FR 32361, May 30, 2003] Sec. 199.9 Administrative remedies for fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest. (a) General. (1) This section sets forth provisions for invoking administrative remedies under CHAMPUS in situations involving fraud, abuse, or conflict of interest. The remedies impact institutional providers, professional providers, and beneficiaries (including parents, guardians, or other representatives of beneficiaries), and cover situations involving criminal fraud, civil fraud, administrative determinations of conflicts of interest or dual compensation, and administrative determinations of fraud or abuse. The administrative actions, remedies, and procedures may differ based upon whether the initial findings were made by a court of law, another agency, or the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee). (2) This section also sets forth provisions for invoking administrative remedies in situations requiring administrative action to enforce provisions of law, regulation, and policy in the administration of CHAMPUS and to ensure quality of care for CHAMPUS beneficiaries. Examples of such situations may include a case in which it is discovered that a provider fails to meet requirements under this part to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider; a case in which the provider ceases to be qualified as a CHAMPUS provider because of suspension or revocation of the provider's license by a local licensing authority; or a case in which a provider meets the minimum requirements under this part but, nonetheless, it is determined that it is in the best interest of the CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries that the provider should not be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (3) The administrative remedies set forth in this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or sanctions authorized by law or regulation. For example, administrative action under this section may be taken in a particular case even if the same case will be or has been processed under the administrative procedures established by the Department of Defense to implement the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act. (4) Providers seeking payment from the Federal Government through programs such as CHAMPUS have a duty to familiarize themselves with, and comply with, the program requirements. (5) CHAMPUS contractors and peer review organizations have a responsibility to apply provisions of this regulation in the discharge of their duties, and to report all known situations involving fraud, abuse, or conflict of interest. Failure to report known situations involving fraud, abuse, or conflict of interest will result in the withholding of administrative payments or other contractual remedies as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (b) Abuse. The term ``abuse'' generally describes incidents and practices which may directly or indirectly cause financial loss to the Government under CHAMPUS or to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. For the definition of abuse, see Sec. 199.2 of this part. The type of abuse to which CHAMPUS is most vulnerable is the CHAMPUS claim involving the overutilization of medical and health care services. To avoid abuse situations, providers have certain obligations to provide services and supplies under CHAMPUS which are: Furnished at the appropriate level and only when [[Page 206]] and to the extent medically necessary as determined under the provisions of this part; of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards of health care; and, supported by adequate medical documentation as may reasonably be required under this part by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to evidence the medical necessity and quality of services furnished, as well as the appropriateness of the level of care. A provider's failure to comply with these obligations can result in sanctions being imposed by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, under this section. Even when administrative remedies are not initiated under this section, abuse situations under CHAMPUS are a sufficient basis for denying all or any part of CHAMPUS cost-sharing of individual claims. The types of abuse or possible abuse situations under CHAMPUS include, but are not limited, to the following: (1) A pattern of waiver of beneficiary (patient) cost-share or deductible. Note: In a case of a legitimate bad debt write-off of patient cost- share or deductible, the provider's record should include documentation as to what efforts were made to collect the debt, when the debt was written off, why the debt was written off, and the amount of the debt written off. (2) Improper billing practices. Examples include, charging CHAMPUS beneficiaries rates for services and supplies that are in excess of those charges routinely charged by the provider to the general public, commercial health insurance carriers, or other federal health benefit entitlement programs for the same or similar services. (This includes dual fee schedules--one for CHAMPUS beneficiaries and one for other patients or third-party payers. This also includes billing other third- party payers the same as CHAMPUS is billed but accepting less than the billed amount as reimbursement. However, a formal discount arrangement such as through a preferred provider organization, may not necessarily constitute an improper billing practice.) (3) A pattern of claims for services which are not medically necessary or, if medically necessary, not to the extent rendered. For example, a battery of diagnostic tests are given when, based on the diagnosis, fewer tests were needed. (4) Care of inferior quality. For example, consistently furnishing medical or mental health services that do not meet accepted standards of care. (5) Failure to maintain adequate medical or financial records. (6) Refusal to furnish or allow the Government (for example, OCHAMPUS) or Government contractors access to records related to CHAMPUS claims. (7) Billing substantially in excess of customary or reasonable charges unless it is determined by OCHAMPUS that the excess charges are justified by unusual circumstances or medical complications requiring additional time, effort, or expense in localities when it is accepted medical practice to make an extra charge in such cases. (8) Unauthorized use of the term ``Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS)'' in private business. While the use of the term ``CHAMPUS'' is not prohibited by federal statute, misrepresentation or deception by use of the term ``CHAMPUS'' to imply an official connection with the Government or to defraud CHAMPUS beneficiaries may be a violation of federal statute. Regardless of whether the actual use of the term ``CHAMPUS'' may be actionable under federal statute, the unauthorized or deceptive use of the term ``CHAMPUS'' in private business will be considered abuse for purposes of this Section. (c) Fraud. For the definition of fraud, see Sec. 199.2 of this part. Examples of situations which, for the purpose of this part, are presumed to be fraud include, but are not limited to: (1) Submitting CHAMPUS claims (including billings by providers when the claim is submitted by the beneficiary) for services, supplies, or equipment not furnished to, or used by, CHAMPUS beneficiaries. For example, billing or claiming services when the provider was on call (other than an authorized standby charge) and did not provide any specific medical care to the beneficiary; providing services to an ineligible person and billing or submitting a claim for the services in the name of an eligible CHAMPUS beneficiary; billing [[Page 207]] or submitting a CHAMPUS claim for an office visit for a missed appointment; or billing or submitting a CHAMPUS claim for individual psychotherapy when a medical visit was the only service provided. (2) Billing or submitting a CHAMPUS claim for costs for noncovered or nonchargeable services, supplies, or equipment disguised as covered items. Some examples are: (i) Billings or CHAMPUS claims for services which would be covered except for the frequency or duration of the services, such as billing or submitting a claim for two one-hour psychotherapy sessions furnished on separate days when the actual service furnished was a two-hour therapy session on a single day, (ii) spreading the billing or claims for services over a time period that reduces the apparent frequency to a level that may be cost-shared by CHAMPUS, (iii) charging to CHAMPUS, directly or indirectly, costs not incurred or not reasonably allowable to the services billed or claimed under CHAMPUS, for example, costs attributable to nonprogram activities, other enterprises, or the personal expenses of principals, or (iv) billing or submitting claim on a fee-for-service basis when in fact a personal service to a specific patient was not performed and the service rendered is part of the overall management of, for example, the laboratory or x-ray department. (3) Breach of a provider participation agreement which results in the beneficiary (including parent, guardian, or other representative) being billed for amounts which exceed the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost. (4) Billings or CHAMPUS claims for supplies or equipment which are clearly unsuitable for the patient's needs or are so lacking in quality or sufficiency for the purpose as to be virtually worthless. (5) Billings or CHAMPUS claims which involve flagrant and persistent overutilization of services without proper regard for results, the patient's ailments, condition, medical needs, or the physician's orders. (6) Misrepresentations of dates, frequency, duration, or description of services rendered, or of the identity of the recipient of the services or the individual who rendered the services. (7) Submitting falsified or altered CHAMPUS claims or medical or mental health patient records which misrepresent the type, frequency, or duration of services or supplies or misrepresent the name(s) of the individual(s) who provided the services or supplies. (8) Duplicate billings or CHAMPUS claims. This includes billing or submitting CHAMPUS claims more than once for the same services, billing or submitting claims both to CHAMPUS and the beneficiary for the same services, or billing or submitting claims both to CHAMPUS and other third-parties (such as other health insurance or government agencies) for the same services, without making full disclosure of material facts or immediate, voluntary repayment or notification to CHAMPUS upon receipt of payments which combined exceed the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge of the services involved. (9) Misrepresentation by a provider of his or her credentials or concealing information or business practices which bear on the provider's qualifications for authorized CHAMPUS provider status. For example, a provider representing that he or she has a qualifying doctorate in clinical psychology when the degree is not from a regionally accredited university. (10) Reciprocal billing. Billing or claiming services which were furnished by another provider or furnished by the billing provider in a capacity other than as billed or claimed. For example, practices such as the following: (i) One provider performing services for another provider and the latter bills as though he had actually performed the services (e.g., a weekend fill-in); (ii) providing service as an institutional employee and billing as a professional provider for the services; (iii) billing for professional services when the services were provided by another individual who was an institutional employee; (iv) billing for professional services at a higher provider profile than would be paid for the person actually furnishing the services, (for example, bills reflecting that an M.D. or Ph.D. performed the services when services were actually furnished by a licensed social worker, psychiatric [[Page 208]] nurse, or marriage and family counselor); or (v) an authorized provider billing for services which were actually furnished by an unauthorized or sanctioned provider. (11) Submitting CHAMPUS claims at a rate higher than a rate established between CHAMPUS and the provider, if such a rate has been established. For example, billing or claiming a rate in excess of the provider's most favored rate limitation specified in a residential treatment center agreement. (12) Arrangements by providers with employees, independent contractors, suppliers, or others which appear to be designed primarily to overcharge the CHAMPUS through various means (such as commissions, fee-splitting, and kickbacks) used to divert or conceal improper or unnecessary costs or profits. (13) Agreements or arrangements between the supplier and recipient (recipient could be either a provider or beneficiary, including the parent, guardian, or other representative of the beneficiary) that result in billings or claims which include unnecessary costs or charges to CHAMPUS. (d) Conflict of Interest. (1) Conflict of interest includes any situation where an active duty member of the Uniformed Services (including a reserve member while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training) or civilian employee of the United States Government, through an official federal position has the apparent or actual opportunity to exert, directly or indirectly, any influence on the referral of CHAMPUS beneficiaries to himself/herself or others with some potential for personal gain or the appearance of impropriety. Although individuals under contract to the Uniformed Services are not considered ``employees,'' such individuals are subject to conflict of interest provisions by express terms of their contracts and, for purposes of this part, may be considered to be involved in conflict of interest situations as a result of their contract positions. In any situation involving potential conflict of interest of a Uniformed Service employee, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may refer the case to the Uniformed Service concerned for appropriate review and action. If such a referral is made, a report of the results of findings and action taken shall be made to the Director, OCHAMPUS, by the Uniformed Service having jurisdiction within 90 days of receiving the referral. (2) CHAMPUS cost-sharing shall be denied on any claim where a conflict of interest situation is found to exist. This denial of cost- sharing applies whether the claim is submitted by the individual who provided the care, the institutional provider in which the care was furnished, or the beneficiary. (e) Dual Compensation. (1) Federal law (5 U.S.C. 5536) prohibits active duty members of the Uniformed Services or employees (including part-time or intermittent) appointed in the civil service of the United States Government from receiving additional compensation from the Government above their normal pay and allowances. This prohibition applies to CHAMPUS payments for care furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by active duty members of the Uniformed Services or civilian employees of the Government. (2) CHAMPUS cost-sharing of a claim shall be denied where the services or supplies were provided by an active duty member of the Uniformed Services or a civilian employee of the Government. This denial of CHAMPUS payment applies whether the claim for reimbursement is filed by the individual who provided the care, the institutional provider in which the care was furnished, or by the beneficiary. Note: Physicians of the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) may be assigned to areas where there is a shortage of medical providers. Although these physicians would be prohibited from accepting CHAMPUS payments as individuals if they are employees of the United States Government, the private organizations to which they may be assigned may be eligible for payment, as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (3) The prohibition against dual compensation does not apply to individuals under contract to the Uniformed Services or the Government. (f) Administrative Remedies. Administrative remedies available under CHAMPUS in this section are set forth below. [[Page 209]] (1) Provider exclusion or suspension. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall have the authority to exclude or suspend an otherwise authorized CHAMPUS provider from the program based on any criminal conviction or civil judgment involving fraud by the provider; fraud or abuse under CHAMPUS by the provider; exclusion or suspension of the provider by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or local licensing authority; participation in a conflict of interest situation by the provider; or, when it is in the best interests of the program or CHAMPUS beneficiaries to exclude or suspend a provider under CHAMPUS. In all cases, the exclusion or suspension of a provider shall be effective 15 calendar days from the date on the written initial determination issued under paragraph (h)(2) of this section. (i) Criminal conviction or civil judgment involving fraud by a provider--(A) Criminal conviction involving CHAMPUS fraud. A provider convicted by a Federal, state, foreign, or other court of competent jurisdiction of a crime involving CHAMPUS fraud, whether the crime is a felony or misdemeanor, shall be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS for a period of time as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. The CHAMPUS exclusion or suspension applies whether or not the provider, as a result of the conviction, receives probation or the sentence is suspended or deferred, and whether or not the conviction or sentence is under appeal. Note: Under the above paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) of this section, an entity may be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS whenever the entity is found to have a person, convicted of a crime involving CHAMPUS fraud, who has a direct or indirect ownership or control interest (see Sec. 199.2) of 5 percent or more in the entity, or is an officer, director, agent or managing employee of the entity. The entity will have an opportunity to provide evidence to show that the ownership or control relationship has ceased. While an entity will not be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS for employing a provider who has been sanctioned under this Section, the entity will be denied CHAMPUS payment for any services furnished by the sanctioned employee. As an authorized CHAMPUS provider, the entity is responsible for ensuring that all CHAMPUS claims involve services furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by employees who meet all requirements under CHAMPUS for provider status. (B) Criminal conviction involving fraud of other Federal programs. Any provider convicted by a Federal, state, or other court of competent jurisdiction of a crime involving another Federal health care or benefit program (such as plans administered under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, Federal Workmen's Compensation, and the Federal Employees Program (FEP) for employee health insurance), whether the crime is a felony or misdemeanor, shall be excluded from CHAMPUS for a period of time as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. The CHAMPUS exclusion or suspension applies whether or not the provider, as a result of the conviction, receives probation or the sentence is suspended or deferred, and whether or not the conviction or sentence is under appeal. (C) Criminal conviction involving fraud of non-Federal programs. Any provider convicted by a Federal, state, foreign, or other court of competent jurisdiction of a crime involving any non-Federal health benefit program or private insurance involving health benefits may be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS for a period of time as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (D) Civil fraud involving CHAMPUS. If a judgment involving civil fraud has been entered (whether or not it is appealed) against a provider in a civil action involving CHAMPUS benefits (whether or not other Federal programs are involved), the provider shall be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS for a period determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (E) Civil fraud involving other programs. If a judgment involving civil fraud has been entered against a provider (whether or not it has been appealed) in a civil action involving other public or private health care programs or health insurance, the provider may be excluded or suspended for a period of time determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (ii) Administrative determination of fraud or abuse under CHAMPUS. If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, [[Page 210]] determines that a provider has committed fraud or abuse as defined in this part, the provider shall be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS for a period of time determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee. (iii) Administrative determination that the provider has been excluded or suspended by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or local licensing authority. Any provider who is excluded or suspended by any other Federal health care program (for example, Medicare), shall be excluded or suspended under CHAMPUS. A provider who has his/her credentials revoked through a Veterans Administration or Military Department credentials review process and who is excluded, suspended, terminated, retired, or separated, shall also be excluded or suspended under CHAMPUS. The period of time of exclusion or suspension shall be determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. (iv) Administrative determination that the provider has participated in a conflict of interest situation. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may exclude or suspend any provider who has knowingly been involved in a conflict of interest situation under CHAMPUS. The period of time of exclusion or suspension shall be determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. For purposes of this administrative determination, it will be presumed that a CHAMPUS provider knowingly participated in a conflict of interest situation if the provider employs, in the treatment of a CHAMPUS beneficiary (resulting in a CHAMPUS claim), any medical personnel who are active duty members of the Uniformed Services or civilian employees of the Government. The burden of proof to rebut this presumption rests with the CHAMPUS provider. Two exceptions will be recognized to the presumption that a conflict of interest exists. First, indirect CHAMPUS payments may be made to private organizations to which physicians of the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) are assigned. Second, any off-duty Government medical personnel employed in an emergency room of an acute care hospital will be presumed not to have had the opportunity to exert, directly or indirectly, any influence on the referral of CHAMPUS beneficiaries; therefore, CHAMPUS payments may be made to the employing hospital provided the medical care was not furnished directly by the off-duty Government medical personnel in violation of dual compensation provisions. (v) Administrative determination that it is in the best interests of the CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries to exclude or suspend a provider-- (A) Unethical or improper practices or unprofessional conduct. (1) In most instances, unethical or improper practices or unprofessional conduct by a provider will be program abuse and subject the provider to exclusion or suspension for abuse. However, in some cases such practices and conduct may provide an independent basis for exclusion or suspension of the provider by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (2) Such exclusions or suspensions may be based on findings or recommendations of state licensure boards, boards of quality assurance, other regulatory agencies, state medical societies, peer review organizations, or other professional associations. (B) In any other case in which the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee), determines that exclusion or suspension of a provider is in the best interests of CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may exclude or suspend any provider if it is determined that the authorization of that particular provider under CHAMPUS poses an unreasonable potential for fraud, abuse, or professional misconduct. Any documented misconduct by the provider reflecting on the business or professional competence or integrity of the provider may be considered. Situations in which the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may take administrative action under this Section to protect CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries include, but are not limited to, a case in which it is determined that a provider poses an unreasonable potential cost to the Government to monitor the provider for fraud or abuse and to avoid the issuance of erroneous payments; or [[Page 211]] that the provider poses an unreasonable potential harm to the financial or health status of CHAMPUS beneficiaries; or that the provider poses any other unreasonable threat to the interests of CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries. One example of such circumstances involves a provider who, for his/her entire practice or for most of his/her practice, provides or bills for tratment that is not a CHAMPUS benefit, resulting in CHAMPUS frequently and repeatedly denying claims as non-covered services. This may occur when a professional provider furnishes sex therapy (a therapy which may be recognized by the provider's licensing authority but which is excluded from CHAMPUS coverage) and repeatedly submits CHAMPUS claims for the services. (2) Provider termination. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall terminate the provider status of any provider determined not to meet the qualifications established by this part to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (i) Effective date of termination. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the termination shall be retroactive to the date on which the provider did not meet the requirements of this part. (A) The retroactive effective date of termination shall not be limited due to the passage of time, erroneous payment of claims, or any other events which may be cited as a basis for CHAMPUS recognition of the provider notwithstanding the fact that the provider does not meet program qualifications. Unless specific provision is made in this part to ``grandfather'' or authorize a provider who does not otherwise meet the qualifications established by this part, all unqualified providers shall be terminated. (B) Any claims cost-shared or paid under CHAMPUS for services or supplies furnished by the provider on or after the effective date of termination, even when the effective date is retroactive, shall be deemed an erroneous payment unless specific exception is provided in this part. All erroneous payments are subject to collection under Sec. 199.11 of this part. (C) If an institution is terminated as an authorized CHAMPUS provider, the institution shall immediately give written notice of the termination to any CHAMPUS beneficiary (or their parent, guardian, or other representative) admitted to, or receiving care at, the institution on or after the effective date of the termination. In addition, when an institution is terminated with an effective date of termination after the date of the initial determination terminating the provider, any beneficiary admitted to the institution prior to the effective date of termination (or their parent, guardian, or other representative) shall be notified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, by certified mail of the termination, and that CHAMPUS cost-sharing of the beneficiary's care in the institution will cease as of the effective date of the termination. However, any beneficiary admitted to the institution prior to any grace period extended to the institution under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section shall be advised that, if the beneficiary's care otherwise qualifies for CHAMPUS coverage, CHAMPUS cost-sharing of the care in the institution will continue in order to provide a reasonable period of transition of care; however the transitional period of CHAMPUS cost-sharing shall not exceed the last day of the month following the month in which the institution's status as a CHAMPUS provider is terminated. (This authorized CHAMPUS cost- sharing of the inpatient care received during the transition period is an exception to the general rule that CHAMPUS payment for care furnished after the effective date of termination of the provider's status shall be deemed to be an erroneous payment.) If a major violation under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section is involved, in order to ensure immediate action is taken to transfer beneficiaries to an approved provider, CHAMPUS cost-sharing shall not be authorized after the effective date of termination of the provider's status. (ii) Institutions not in compliance with CHAMPUS standards. If it is determined that an institution is not in compliance with one or more of the standards applicable to its specific category of institution under this part, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall take immediate steps to [[Page 212]] bring about compliance or terminate the status of the provider as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (A) Minor violations. An institution determined to be in violation of one or more of the standards shall be advised by certified mail of the nature of the discrepancy or discrepancies and will be given a grace period of 30 days to effect appropriate corrections. The grace period may be extended at the discretion of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, but in no event shall the extension exceed 90 days. (1) CHAMPUS will not cost-share a claim for any beneficiary admitted during the grace period. (2) Any beneficiary admitted to the institution prior to the grace period (or the beneficiary's parent, guardian, or other representative) will be notified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, in writing, of the minor violations and the grace period granted the institution to correct the violations. The beneficiary will also be advised that, if the beneficiary's care otherwise meets all requirements for CHAMPUS coverage, CHAMPUS cost-sharing will continue during the grace period. (3) If the institution submits written notice before the end of the grace period that corrective action has been taken and if the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, determines that the corrective action has eliminated the minor violations, the provider will be advised that the institution is restored to full status as an authorized CHAMPUS provider as of 12:01 a.m. on the day written notice of correction was received by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or the day on which acceptable corrective action was completed in the judgment of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. Any beneficiary admitted to the institution prior to the grace period will be notified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, of the corrective action and that the provider continues to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. CHAMPUS cost-sharing for any beneficiary admitted to the institution during the grace period shall be allowed only for care received after 12:01 a.m. on the day written notice of correction was received by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or the day on which acceptable corrective action was completed in the judgment of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (4) If the institution has failed to give notification in writing before the end of the grace period that corrective action has been completed or, in the judgment of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, the institution has not completed acceptable corrective action during the grace period, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may initiate action to terminate the provider as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (B) Major violations. If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, determines that an institution is in violation of standards detrimental to life, safety, or health, or substantially in violation of approved treatment programs, immediate action shall be taken to terminate the institution as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. The institution shall be notified by telegram, certified mail, or express mail of the termination under this subparagraph, effective on receipt of the notice. The notice shall include a brief statement of the nature of violations resulting in the termination and advise the institution that an initial determination formalizing the administrative action of termination will be issued pursuant to paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section within 15 days. (3) Beneficiary sanctions. (i) With entitlement to CHAMPUS benefits based on public law, an eligible beneficiary will not be suspended or excluded from CHAMPUS. However, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may take action deemed appropriate and reasonable to protect the Government from those beneficiaries (including sponsors, parents, guardians, or representatives of beneficiaries) who have submitted false claims. (ii) Pursuant to Sec. 199.11 of this part, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may recover erroneous payments on claims involving fraud or false or misleading statements. Remedies for recovery of the erroneous payments include the use of offset against future CHAMPUS payments. (iii) Under policies adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, individuals who, based on reliable information, have previously submitted [[Page 213]] fraudulent or false CHAMPUS claims, may be required to comply with any procedures (e.g., partial or total pre-payment audit or review, restriction to a designated primary care provider, etc.) which the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, deems appropriate to ensure that their future medical care and CHAMPUS claims (including the medical care and CHAMPUS claims submitted by or for members of their family) are valid. (g) Period of exclusion, suspension, or termination--(1) Exclusions or suspensions. Except as otherwise required by paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall determine the period of exclusion or suspension for a provider using the factors set forth in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section. (i) Exclusion or suspension of a provider based on the provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or a local licensing authority. If the administrative action under CHAMPUS is based solely on the provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency, state, or local licensing authority, the period of exclusion or suspension under CHAMPUS shall be for the same length of time of exclusion or suspension imposed by the other agency, state, or local licensing authority. The provider may request reinstatement as an authorized CHAMPUS provider if reinstatement is achieved under the other program prior to the end of the period of exclusion or suspension. If the administrative action under CHAMPUS is not based solely on the provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency, state, or local licensing authority, the minimum period of exclusion or suspension shall be for the same period of exclusion or suspension imposed by the other agency, state, or local licensing authority. (ii) Factors to be considered in determining the period of exclusion or suspension of providers under CHAMPUS. In determining the period of exclusion or suspension of a provider, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may consider any or all of the following: (A) When the case concerns all or any part of the same issues which have been the subject of criminal conviction or civil judgment involving fraud by a provider: (1) The period(s) of sentence, probation, and other sanction imposed by court order against the provider may be presumed reasonable and adopted as the administrative period of exclusion or suspension under CHAMPUS, unless aggravating or mitigating factors exist. (2) If any aggravating factors exist, then cause exists for the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to consider the factors set forth in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, in imposing a period of administrative exclusion or suspension in excess of the period(s) of sentence, probation, and/or other sanctions imposed by court order. Examples of aggravating factors include, but are not limited to: (i) An administrative determination by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, that the basis for administrative exclusion or suspension includes an act(s) of fraud or abuse under CHAMPUS in addition to, or unrelated to, an act(s) of fraud included in the court conviction or civil judgment. (ii) The fraudulent act(s) involved in the criminal conviction or civil judgment, or similar acts, were committed over a significant period of time; that is, one year or more. (iii) The act(s) of fraud or abuse had an adverse physical, mental, or financial impact on one or more CHAMPUS beneficiaries. (iv) The loss or potential loss to CHAMPUS is over $5,000. The entire amount of loss or potential loss to CHAMPUS due to acts of fraud and abuse will be considered, in addition to the amount of loss involved in the court conviction or civil judgment, regardless of whether full or partial restitution has been made to CHAMPUS. (v) The provider has a prior court record, criminal or civil, or administrative record or finding of fraud or abuse. (3) If any mitigating factors exist, then cause may exist for the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to reduce a period of administrative exclusion or suspension from any period(s) imposed by court conviction or civil judgment. [[Page 214]] Only the existence of either of the following two factors may be considered in mitigation: (i) The criminal conviction or civil judgment only involved three or fewer misdemeanor offenses, and the total of the estimated losses incurred (including any loss from act(s) not involved in the conviction or judgment) is less than $1,000, regardless of whether full or partial restitution has been made. (ii) The criminal or civil court proceedings establish that the provider had a mental, emotional or physical condition, prior to or contemporaneous with the commission of the act(s), that reduced the provider's criminal or civil culpability. (B) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may consider the following factors in determining a reasonable period of exclusion or suspension of a provider under CHAMPUS: (1) The nature of the claims and the circumstances under which they were presented; (2) The degree of culpability; (3) History of prior offenses (including whether claims were submitted while the provider was either excluded or suspended pursuant to prior administrative action); (4) Number of claims involved; (5) Dollar amount of claims involved; (6) Whether, if a crime was involved, it was a felony or misdemeanor; (7) If patients were injured financially, mentally, or physically; the number of patients; and the seriousness of the injury(ies); (8) The previous record of the provider under CHAMPUS; (9) Whether restitution has been made or arrangements for repayment accepted by the Government; (10) Whether the provider has resolved the conflict of interest situations or implemented procedures acceptable to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, which will prevent conflict of interest in the future; and, (11) Such other factors as may be deemed appropriate. (2) Terminations. When a provider's status as an authorized CHAMPUS provider is ended, other than through exclusion or suspension, the termination is based on a finding that the provider does not meet the qualifications to be an authorized provider, as set forth in this part. Therefore, the period of termination in all cases will be indefinite and will end only after the provider has successfully met the established qualifications for authorized provider status under CHAMPUS and has been reinstated under CHAMPUS. Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the following guidelines control the termination of authorized CHAMPUS provider status for a provider whose license to practice (or, in the case of an institutional provider, to operate) has been temporarily or permanently suspended or revoked by the jurisdiction issuing the license. (i) Termination of the provider under CHAMPUS shall continue even if the provider obtains a license to practice in a second jurisdiction during the period of suspension or revocation of the provider's license by the original licensing jurisdiction. A provider who has licenses to practice in two or more jurisdictions and has one or more license(s) suspended or revoked will also be terminated as a CHAMPUS provider. (A) Professional providers shall remain terminated from the CHAMPUS until the jurisdiction(s) suspending or revoking the provider's license(s) to practice restores it or removes the impediment to restoration. (B) Institutional providers shall remain terminated under CHAMPUS until their license is restored. In the event the facility is sold, transferred, or reorganized as a new legal entity, and a license issued under a new name or to a different legal entity, the new entity must submit an application to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (ii) If the CHAMPUS provider status is terminated due to the loss of the provider's license, the effective date shall be retroactive to the date the provider lost the license; however, in the case of a professional provider who has licenses in two or more jurisdictions and submitted claims from a jurisdiction from which he/she had a valid license, the effective date of the termination will be 15 calendar days from the date of the written initial determination of termination for purposes of claims from the jurisdiction in which the provider still has a valid license. [[Page 215]] (h) Procedures for initiating and implementing the administrative remedies--(1) Temporary suspension of claims processing. (i) In general, temporary suspension of claims processing may be invoked to protect the interests of the Government for a period reasonably necessary to complete investigation or appropriate criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings. The temporary suspension only delays the ultimate payment of otherwise appropriate claims. When claims processing involving a participating provider is temporarily suspended, the participation agreement remains in full force and the provider cannot repudiate the agreement because of the delay in the final disposition of the claim(s). Once it has been determined appropriate to end the temporary suspension of claims processing, CHAMPUS claims which were the subject of the suspension and which are otherwise determined to be in compliance with the requirements of law and regulation, will be processed to completion and payment unless such action is deemed inappropriate as a result of criminal, civil, or administrative remedies ultimately invoked in the case. (ii) When adequate evidence exists to determine that a provider or beneficiary is submitting fraudulent or false claims or claims involving practices that may be fraud or abuse as defined by this part, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may suspend CHAMPUS claims processing (in whole or in part) for claims submitted by the beneficiary or any CHAMPUS claims involving care furnished by the provider. The temporary suspension of claims processing for care furnished by a provider may be invoked against all such claims, whether or not the claims are submitted by the beneficiary or by the provider as a participating CHAMPUS provider. In cases involving a provider, notice of the suspension of claims processing may also be given to the beneficiary community either directly or indirectly through notice to appropriate military facilities, health benefit advisors, and the information or news media. (A) Adequate evidence is any information sufficient to support the reasonable belief that a particular act or omission has occurred. (B) Indictment or any other initiation of criminal charges, filing of a complaint for civil fraud, issuance of an administrative complaint under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, or issuance of an initial determination under this part for submitting fraudulent or false claims or claims involving practices that may be fraud or abuse as defined by this part, shall constitute adequate evidence for invoking temporary suspension of claims processing. (iii) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may suspend CHAMPUS claims processing without first notifying the provider or beneficiary of the intent to suspend payments. Following a decision to invoke a temporary suspension, however, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue written notice advising the provider or beneficiary that: (A) A temporary suspension of claims processing has been ordered and a statement of the basis of the decision to suspend payment. Unless the suspension is based on any of the actions set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the notice shall describe the suspected acts or omissions in terms sufficient to place the provider or beneficiary on notice without disclosing the Government's evidence. (B) Within 30 days (or, upon written request received by OCHAMPUS during the 30 days and for good cause shown, within 60 days) from the date of the notice, the provider or beneficiary may: (1) Submit to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, in writing, information (including documentary evidence) and argument in opposition to the suspension, provided the additional specific information raises a genuine dispute over the material facts, or (2) Submit a written request to present in person evidence or argument to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. All such presentations shall be made at the Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) in Aurora, Colorado, at the provider's or beneficiary's own expense. [[Page 216]] (C) Additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts may be conducted unless: (1) The suspension is based on any of the actions set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, or, (2) A determination is made, on the basis of the advice of the responsible Government official (e.g., an official of the Department of Justice, the designated Reviewing Official under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, etc.), that the substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal or administrative proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced. (iv) If the beneficiary or provider submits, either in writing or in person, additional information or argument in opposition to the suspension, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue a suspending official's decision which modifies, terminates, or leaves in force the suspension of claims processing. However, a decision to terminate or modify the suspension shall be without prejudice to the subsequent imposition of suspension of claims processing, imposition of sanctions under this Sec. 199.9, the recovery of erroneous payments under Sec. 199.11 of this part, or any other administrative or legal action authorized by law or regulation. The suspending official's decision shall be in writing as follows: (A) A written decision based on all the information in the administrative record, including any submission by the beneficiary or provider, shall be final in a case: (1) Based on any of the actions set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, (2) In which the beneficiary's or provider's submission does not raise a genuine dispute over material facts, or (3) In which additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of advice of a responsible Government official that the substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal or administrative proceedings would be prejudiced. (B) In a case in which additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed material facts, the suspending official's decision shall advise the beneficiary or provider that the case has been referred for handling as a hearing under Sec. 199.10 of this part. (v) A suspension of claims processing may be modified or terminated for reasons such as: (A) Newly discovered evidence; (B) Elimination of any of the causes for which the suspension was invoked; or (C) Other reasons the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, deems appropriate. (vi) A suspension of claims processing shall be for a temporary period pending the completion of investigation and any ensuing legal or administrative proceedings, unless sooner terminated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or as provided in this subparagraph. (A) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall be terminated unless the Government official responsible for initiation of the legal or administrative action requests its extension, in which case it may be extended for an additional 6 months. In no event may a suspension extend beyond 18 months, unless legal or administrative proceedings have been initiated during that period. (B) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall notify the Government official responsible for initiation of the legal or administrative action of the proposed termination of the suspension, at least 30 days before the 12-month period expires, to give the official an opportunity to request an extension. (2) Notice of proposed administrative sanction. (i) A provider shall be notified in writing of the proposed action to exclude, suspend, or terminate the provider's status as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (A) The notice shall state which sanction will be taken and the effective date of that sanction as determined in accordance with the provisions of this part. (B) The notice shall inform the provider of the situation(s), circumstance(s), or action(s) which form the basis for the proposed sanction and reference the paragraph of this part [[Page 217]] under which the administrative action is being taken. (C) The notice will be sent to the provider's last known business or office address (or home address if there is no known business address.) (D) The notice shall offer the provider an opportunity to respond within 30 days (or, upon written request received by OCHAMPUS during the 30 days and for good cause shown, within 60 days) from the date on the notice with either: (1) Documentary evidence and written argument contesting the proposed action; or, (2) A written request to present in person evidence or argument to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. All such presentations shall be made at the Office of the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) in Aurora, Colorado, at the provider's own expense. (3) Initial determination. (i) If, after the provider has exhausted, or failed to comply with, the procedures specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, decides to invoke an administrative remedy of exclusion, suspension, or termination of a provider under CHAMPUS, written notice of the decision will be sent to the provider by certified mail. Except in those cases where the sanction has a retroactive effective date, the written notice shall be dated no later than 15 days before the decision becomes effective. For terminations under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the initial determination may be issued without first implementing or exhausting the procedures specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. (ii) The initial determination shall include: (A) A statement of the sanction being invoked; (B) A statement of the effective date of the sanction; (C) A statement of the facts, circumstances, or actions which form the basis for the sanction and a discussion of any information submitted by the provider relevant to the sanction; (D) A statement of the factors considered in determining the period of sanction; (E) The earliest date on which a request for reinstatement under CHAMPUS will be accepted; (F) The requirements and procedures for reinstatement; and, (G) Notice of the available hearing upon request of the sanctioned provider. (4) Reinstatement procedures--(i) Restitution. (A) There is no entitlement under CHAMPUS for payment (cost-sharing) of any claim that involves either criminal or civil fraud as defined by law, or fraud or abuse or conflict of interest as defined by this part. In addition, except as specifically provided in this part, there is no entitlement under CHAMPUS for payment (cost-sharing) of any claim for services or supplies furnished by a provider who does not meet the requirements to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. In any of the situations described above, CHAMPUS payment shall be denied whether the claim is submitted by the provider as a participating claim or by the beneficiary for reimbursement. If an erroneous payment has been issued in any such case, collection of the payment will be processed under Sec. 199.11 of this part. (B) If the Government has made erroneous payments to a provider because of claims involving fraud, abuse, or conflicts of interest, restitution of the erroneous payments shall be made before a request for reinstatement as a CHAMPUS authorized provider will be considered. Without restitution or resolution of the debt under Sec. 199.11 of this part, a provider shall not be reinstated as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. This is not an appealable issue under Sec. 199.10 of this part. (C) For purposes of authorization as a CHAMPUS provider, a provider who is excluded or suspended under this Sec. 199.9 and who submits participating claims for services furnished on or after the effective date of the exclusion or suspension is considered to have forfeited or waived any right or entitlement to bill the beneficiary for the care involved in the claims. Similarly, because a provider is expected to know the CHAMPUS requirements for qualification as an authorized provider, any participating provider who fails to meet the qualification requirements [[Page 218]] for CHAMPUS is considered to have forfeited or waived any right or entitlement to bill the beneficiary for the care involved in the CHAMPUS claims. If, in either situtation, the provider bills the beneficiary, restitution to the beneficiary may be required by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, as a condition for consideration of reinstatement as a CHAMPUS authorized provider. (ii) Terminated providers. A terminated provider who subsequently achieves the minimum qualifications to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider or who has had his/her license reinstated or the impediment to reinstatement removed by the appropriate licensing jurisdiction may submit a written request for reinstatement under CHAMPUS to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. If restitution or proper reinstatement of license is not at issue, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will process the request for reinstatement under the procedures established for initial requests for authorized CHAMPUS provider status. (iii) Providers (other than entities) excluded or suspended under CHAMPUS. (A) A provider excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS (other than an entity excluded under Sec. 199.9(f)(1)(i)) may seek reinstatement by submitting a written request to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, any time after the date specified in the notice of exclusion or suspension or any earlier date specified in an appeal decision issued in the provider's appeal under Sec. 199.10 of this part. The request for reinstatement shall include: (1) Documentation sufficient to establish the provider's qualifications under this part to be a CHAMPUS authorized provider; (2) A statement from the provider setting forth the reasons why the provider should be reinstated, accompanied by written statements from professional associates, peer review bodies, and/or probation officers (if appropriate), attesting to their belief that the violations that led to exclusion or suspension will not be repeated. (B) A provider entity excluded from CHAMPUS under Sec. 199.9(f)(1)(i) may seek reinstatement by submitting a written request to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, with documentation sufficient to establish the provider's qualifications under this part to be a CHAMPUS authorized provider and either: (1) Documentation showing the CHAMPUS reinstatement of the excluded individual provider whose conviction led to the CHAMPUS exclusion or suspension of the provider entity; or (2) Documentation acceptable to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, that shows that the individual whose conviction led to the entity's exclusion: (i) Has reduced his or her ownership or control interest in the entity below 5 percent; or (ii) Is no longer an officer, director, agent or managing employee of the entity; or (iii) Continues to maintain a 5 percent or more ownership or control interest in such entity, and that the entity due to circumstances beyond its control, is unable to obtain a divestiture. Note: Under paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(B)(2) of this section, the request for reinstatement may be submitted any time prior to the date specified in the notice of exclusion or suspension or an earlier date specified in the appeal decision issued under Sec. 199.10 of this part. (iv) Action on request for reinstatement. In order to reinstate a provider as a CHAMPUS authorized provider, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, must determine that: (A) The provider meets all requirements under this part to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider; (B) No additional criminal, civil, or administrative action has been taken or is being considered which could subject the provider to exclusion, suspension, or termination under this section; (C) In the case of a provider entity, verification has been made of the divestiture or termination of the owner, controlling party, officer, director, agent or managing employee whose conviction led to the entity's exclusion, or that the provider entity should be reinstated because the entity, due to [[Page 219]] circumstances beyond its control, cannot obtain a divestiture of the 5 percent or more ownership or controlling interest by the convicted party. (v) Notice of action on request for reinstatement--(A) Notice of approval of request. If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, approves the request for reinstatement, he or she will: (1) Give written notice to the sanctioned party specifying the date when the authorized provider status under CHAMPUS may resume; and (2) Give notice to those agencies and groups that were originally notified, in accordance with Sec. 199.9(k), of the imposition of the sanction. General notice may also be given to beneficiaries and other parties as deemed appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (B) Notice of denial of request. If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, does not approve the request for reinstatement, written notice will be given to the provider. If established procedures for processing initial requests for authorized provider status are used to review the request for reinstatement, the established procedures may be used to provide the notice that the provider does not meet requirements of this part for such status. If the provider continues to be excluded, suspended, or terminated under the provisions of this section, the procedures set forth in this paragraph (h) may be followed in denying the provider's request for reinstatement. (5) Reversed or vacated convictions or civil judgments involving CHAMPUS fraud. (i) If a CHAMPUS provider is excluded or suspended solely on the basis of a criminal conviction or civil judgment involving a CHAMPUS fraud and the conviction or judgment is reversed or vacated on appeal, CHAMPUS will void the exclusion of a provider. Such action will not preclude the initiation of additional independent administrative action under this section or any other administrative remedy based on the same facts or events which were the subject of the criminal conviction or civil judgment. (ii) If an exclusion is voided under paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section, CHAMPUS will make payment, either to the provider or the beneficiary (if the claim was not a participating claim) for otherwise authorized services under CHAMPUS that are furnished or performed during the period of exclusion. (iii) CHAMPUS will also void the exclusion of any entity that was excluded under Sec. 199.9(f)(1)(i) based solely on an individual's conviction that has been reversed or vacated on appeal. (iv) When CHAMPUS voids the exclusion of a provider or an entity, notice will be given to the agencies and others that were originally notified, in accordance with Sec. 199.9(k). (i) Evidence required for determinations to invoke administrative remedies--(1) General. Any relevant evidence may be used by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule that might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil or criminal courts. (2) Types of evidence. The types of evidence which the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may rely on in reaching a determination to invoke administrative remedies under this section include but are not limited to the following: (i) Results of audits conducted by or on behalf of the Government. Such audits can include the results of 100 percent review of claims and related records or a statistically valid sample audit of the claims or records. A statistical sampling shall constitute prima facie evidence of the number and amount of claims and the instances of fraud, abuse, or conflict of interest. (ii) Reports, including sanction reports, from various sources including a peer review organization (PRO) for the area served by the provider; state or local licensing or certification authorities; peer or medical review consultants of the Government, including consultants for Government contractors; state or local professional societies; or other sources deemed appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (iii) Orders or documents issued by Federal, state, foreign, or other courts of competent jurisdiction which issue [[Page 220]] findings and/or criminal convictions or civil judgments involving the provider, and administrative rulings, findings, or determinations by any agency of the Federal Government, a state, or local licensing or certification authority regarding the provider's status with that agency or authority. (j) Suspending Administrative Action. (1) All or any administrative action may be suspended by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pending action in the case by the Department of Defense--Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, or the Department of Justice (including the responsible United States Attorney). However, action by the Department of Defense--Inspector General or the Department of Justice, including investigation, criminal prosecution, or civil litigation, does not preclude administrative action by OCHAMPUS. (2) The normal OCHAMPUS procedure is to suspend action on the administrative process pending an investigation by the Department of Defense--Inspector General or final disposition by the Department of Justice. (3) Though OCHAMPUS administrative action is taken independently of any action by the Department of Defense-Inspector General or by the Department of Justice, once a case is forwarded to the Department of Defense-Inspector General or the Department of Justice for legal action (criminal or civil), administrative action may be held in abeyance. (4) In some instances there may be dual jurisdiction between agencies; as in, for example, the joint regulations issued by the Department of Justice and the Government Accounting Office regarding debt collection. (k) Notice to Other Agencies. (1) When CHAMPUS excludes, suspends, or terminates a provider, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will notify other appropriate agencies (for example, the Department of Health and Human Services and the state licensing agency that issued the provider's license to practice) that the individual has been excluded, suspended, or terminated as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS. An exclusion, suspension, or termination action is considered a public record. Such notice can include the notices and determinations sent to the suspended provider and other public documents such as testimony given at a hearing or exhibits or depositions given in a lawsuit or hearing. Notice may also be given to Uniformed Services Military Treatment Facilities, Health Benefit Advisors, beneficiaries and sponsors, the news media, and institutional providers if inpatient care was involved. (2) If CHAMPUS has temporarily suspended claims processing, notice of such action normally will be given to the affected provider and Uniformed Services Medical Treatment Facilities, Health Benefits Advisors, beneficiaries, and sponsors. Notice may also be given to any information or news media and any other individual, professional provider, or institutional provider, as deemed appropriate. However, since a ``temporary suspension of claims processing'' is by definition not a final or formal agency action, the basis for the action generally will not be disclosed. It is noted that the basis for the action can be a result of questions arising from routine audits to investigation of possible criminal violations. (l) Compromise, Settlement, and Resolution Authority. (1) In lieu of invoking any remedy provided by this Section, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may elect to enter into an agreement with the provider intended to correct the situation within an established time period and subject to any remedies deemed appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (2) When it is in the best interest of CHAMPUS, the Director, OCHAMPUS, has the discretionary authority to waive an action or enter into compromise or settlement of administrative actions taken under this Sec. 199.9. (m) Government-wide effect of exclusion or suspension from CHAMPUS. As provided by section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-355, October 13 1994, and Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension from Federal Financial and Nonfinancial Assistance Programs,'' February 18, 1986, any health care provider excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS under this section shall, as a general rule, also be debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from all [[Page 221]] other programs and activities involving Federal financial assistance. Among the other programs for which this debarment, suspension, or exclusion shall operate are the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This debarment, suspension, or termination requirement is subject to limited exceptions in the regulations governing the respective Federal programs affected. (Note: Other regulations related to this government-wide exclusion or suspension authority are 32 CFR Part 25 and 45 CFR Part 76.) [54 FR 25246, June 14, 1989, as amended at 63 FR 48445, Sept. 10, 1998] Sec. 199.10 Appeal and hearing procedures. (a) General. This Section sets forth the policies and procedures for appealing decisions made by OCHAMPUS, OCHAMPUSEUR, and CHAMPUS contractors adversely affecting the rights and liabilities of CHAMPUS beneficiaries, CHAMPUS participating providers, and providers denied the status of authorized provider under CHAMPUS. An appeal under CHAMPUS is an administrative review of program determinations made under the provisions of law and regulation. An appeal cannot challenge the propriety, equity, or legality of any provision of law or regulation. (1) Initial determination. (i) Notice of initial determination and right to appeal. (A) OCHAMPUS, OCHAMPUSEUR, and CHAMPUS contractors shall mail notices of initial determinations to the affected provider or CHAMPUS beneficiary (or representative) at the last known address. For beneficiaries who are under 18 years of age or who are incompetent, a notice issued to the parent, guardian, or other representative, under established CHAMPUS procedures, constitutes notice to the beneficiary. (B) CHAMPUS contractors and OCHAMPUSEUR shall notify a provider of an initial determination on a claim only if the provider participated in the claim. (See Sec. 199.7 of this part.) (C) CHAMPUS peer review organizations shall notify providers and fiscal intermediaries of a denial determination on a claim. (D) Notice of an initial determination on a claim processed by a CHAMPUS contractor or OCHAMPUSEUR normally will be made on a CHAMPUS Explanation of Benefits (CEOB) form. (E) Each notice of an initial determination on a request for benefit authorization, a request by a provider for approval as an authorized CHAMPUS provider, or a decsion to disqualify or exclude a provider as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS shall state the reason for the determination and the underlying facts supporting the determination. (F) In any case when the initial determination is adverse to the beneficiary or participating provider, or to the provider seeking approval as an authorized CHAMPUS provider, the notice shall include a statement of the beneficiary's or provider's right to appeal the determination. The procedure for filing the appeal also shall be explained. (ii) Effect of initial determination. (A) The initial determination is final unless appealed in accordance with this chapter, or unless the initial determination is reopened by the TRICARE Management Activity, the CHAMPUS contractor, or the CHAMPUS peer review organization. (B) An initial determination involving a CHAMPUS beneficiary entitled to Medicare Part A, who is enrolled in Medicare Part B, may be appealed by the beneficiary or their provider under this section of this Part only when the claimed services or supplies are payable by CHAMPUS and are not payable under Medicare. Both Medicare and CHAMPUS offer an appeal process when a claim for healthcare services or supplies is denied and most healthcare services and supplies are a benefit payable under both Medicare and CHAMPUS. In order to avoid confusion on the part of beneficiaries and providers and to expedite the appeal process, services and supplies denied payment by Medicare will not be considered for coverage by CHAMPUS if the Medicare denial of payment is appealable under Medicare. Because such claims are not considered for payment by CHAMPUS, there can be no [[Page 222]] CHAMPUS appeal. If, however, a Medicare claim or appeal results in some payment by Medicare, the services and supplies paid by Medicare will be considered for payment by CHAMPUS. In that situation, any decision to deny CHAMPUS payment will be appealable under this section. The following examples of CHAMPUS appealable issues involving Medicare- eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries are illustrative; they are not all- inclusive. (1) If Medicare processes a claim for a healthcare service or supply that is a Medicare benefit and the claim is denied by Medicare for a patient-specific reason, the claim is appealable through the Medicare appeal process. The Medicare decision will be final if the claim is denied by Medicare. The claimed services or supplies will not be considered for CHAMPUS payment and there is no CHAMPUS appeal of the CHAMPUS decision denying the claim. (2) If Medicare processes a claim for a healthcare service or supply that is a Medicare benefit and the claim is paid, either on initial submission or as a result of a Medicare appeal decision, the claim will be submitted to CHAMPUS for processing as a second payer to Medicare. If CHAMPUS denies payment of the claim, the Medicare-eligible beneficiary or their provider have the same appeal rights as other CHAMPUS beneficiaries and their providers under this section. (3) If Medicare processes a claim and the claim is denied by Medicare because it is not a healthcare service or supply that is a benefit under Medicare, the claim is submitted to CHAMPUS. CHAMPUS will process the claim under this Part 199 as primary payer (or as secondary payer if another double coverage plan exists). If any part of the claim is denied, the Medicare-eligible beneficiary and their provider will have the same appeal rights as other CHAMPUS beneficiaries and their providers under this section. (2) Participation in an appeal. Participation in an appeal is limited to any party to the initial determination, including CHAMPUS, and authorized representatives of the parties. Any party to the initial determination, except CHAMPUS, may appeal an adverse determination. The appealing party is the party who actually files the appeal. (i) Parties to the initial determination. For purposes of the CHAMPUS appeals and hearing procedures, the following are not parties to an initial determination and are not entitled to administrative review under this section. (A) A provider disqualified or excluded as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS based on a determination of abuse or fraudulent practices or procedures under another Federal or federally funded program is not a party to the CHAMPUS action and may not appeal under this section. (B) A beneficiary who has an interest in receiving care or has received care from a particular provider cannot be an appealing party regarding the exclusion, suspension, or termination of the provider under Sec. 199.9 of this part. (C) A sponsor or parent of a beneficiary under 18 years of age or guardian or an incompetent beneficiary is not a party to the initial determination and may not serve as the appealing party, although such persons may represent the appealing party in an appeal. (D) A third party, such as an insurance company, is not a party to the initial determination and is not entitled to appeal even though it may have an indirect interest in the initial determination. (E) A nonparticipating provider is not a party to the initial determination and may not appeal. (ii) Representative. Any party to the initial determination may appoint a representative to act on behalf of the party in connection with an appeal. Generally, the parent of a minor beneficiary and the legally appointed guardian of an incompetent beneficiary shall be presumed to have been appointed representative without specific designation by the beneficiary. The custodial parent or legal guardian (appointed by a cognizant court) of a minor beneficiary may initiate an appeal based on the above presumption. However, should a minor beneficiary turn 18 years of age during the course of an appeal, then any further requests to appeal on behalf of the beneficiary must be from the beneficiary or pursuant to the written authorization of the [[Page 223]] beneficiary appointing a representative. For example, if the beneficiary is 17 years of age and the sponsor (who is a custodial parent) requests a formal review, absent written objection by the minor beneficiary, the sponsor is presumed to be acting on behalf of the minor beneficiary. Following the issuance of the formal review, the sponsor requests a hearing; however if, at the time of the request for a hearing, the beneficiary is 18 years of age or older, the request must either be by the beneficiary or the beneficiary must appoint a representative. The sponsor, in this example, could not pursue the request for hearing without being appointed by the beneficiary as the beneficiary's representative. (A) The representative shall have the same authority as the party to the appeal and notice given to the representative shall constitute notice required to be given to the party under this part. (B) To avoid possible conflicts of interest, an officer or employee of the United States, such as an employee or member of a Uniformed Service, including an employee or staff member of a Uniformed Service legal office, or a CHAMPUS advisor, subject to the exceptions in 18 U.S.C. 205, is not eligible to serve as a representative. An exception usually is made for an employee or member of a Uniformed Service who represents an immediate family member. In addition, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may appoint an officer or employee of the United States as the CHAMPUS representative at a hearing. (3) Burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the appealing party to establish affirmatively by substantial evidence the appealing party's entitlement under law and this part to the authorization of CHAMPUS benefits, approval of authorized CHAMPUS provider status, or removal of sanctions imposed under Sec. 199.9 of this part. If a presumption exists under the provisions of this part or information constitutes prima facie evidence under the provisions of this part, the appealing party must produce evidence reasonably sufficient to rebut the presumption or prima facie evidence as part of the appealing party's burden of proof. CHAMPUS shall not pay any part of the cost or fee, including attorney fees, associated with producing or submitting evidence in support of an appeal. (4) Evidence in appeal and hearing cases. Any relevant evidence may be used in the administrative appeal and hearing process if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule that might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil or criminal courts. (5) Late filing. If a request for reconsideration, formal review, or hearings is filed after the time permitted in this section, written notice shall be issued denying the request. Late filing may be permitted only if the appealing party reasonably can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, that the timely filing of the request was not feasible due to extraordinary circumstances over which the appealing party had no practical control. Each request for an exception to the filing requirement will be considered on its own merits. The decision of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, on the request for an exception to the filing requirement shall be final. (6) Appealable issue. An appealable issue is required in order for an adverse determination to be appealed under the provisions of this section. Examples of issues that are not appealable under this section include: (i) A dispute regarding a requirement of the law or regulation. (ii) The amount of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost or charge, since the methodology for determining allowable costs or charges is established by this part. (iii) The establishment of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), or the methodology for the classification of inpatient discharges within the DRGs, or the weighting factors that reflect the relative hospital resources used with respect to discharges within each DRG, since each of these is established by this part. (iv) Certain other issues on the basis that the authority for the initial determination is not vested in CHAMPUS. [[Page 224]] Such issues include but are not limited to the following examples: (A) Determination of a person's eligibility as a CHAMPUS beneficiary is the responsibility of the appropriate Uniformed Service. Although OCHAMPUS, OCHAMPUSEUR, and CHAMPUS contractors must make determinations concerning a beneficiary's eligibility in order to ensure proper disbursement of appropriated funds on each CHAMPUS claim processed, ultimate responsibility for resolving a beneficiary's eligibility rests with the Uniformed Services. Accordingly, disputed question of fact concerning a beneficiary's eligibility will not be considered an appealable issue under the provisions of this section, but shall be resolved in accordance with Sec. 199.3 of this part. (B) Similarly, decisions relating to the issuance of a Nonavailability Statement (DD Form 1251) in each case are made by the Uniformed Services. Disputes over the need for a Nonavailability Statement or a refusal to issue a Nonavailability Statement are not appealable under this section. The one exception is when a dispute arises over whether the facts of the case demonstrate a medical emergency for which a Nonavailability Statement is not required. Denial of payment in this one situation is an appealable issue. (C) Any sanction, including the period of the sanction, imposed under Sec. 199.9 of this part which is based solely on a provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or a local licensing authority is not appealable under this section. The provider must exhaust administrative appeal rights offered by the other agency that made the initial determination to exclude or suspend the provider. Similarly, any sanction imposed under Sec. 199.9 which is based solely on a criminal conviction or civil judgment against the provider is not appealable under this section. If the sanction imposed under Sec. 199.9 is not based solely on the provider's criminal conviction or civil judgment or on the provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or a local licensing authority, that portion of the CHAMPUS administrative determination which is in addition to the criminal conviction/civil judgment or exclusion/suspension by the other agency may be appealed under this section. (v) A decision by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, as a suspending official when the decision is final under the provisions of Sec. 199.9(h)(1)(iv)(A). (7) Amount in dispute. An amount in dispute is required for an adverse determination to be appealed under the provisions of this section, except as set forth below. (i) The amount in dispute is calculated as the amount of money CHAMPUS would pay if the services and supplies involved in dispute were determined to be authorized CHAMPUS benefits. Examples of amounts of money that are excluded by the Regulation from CHAMPUS payments for authorized benefits include, but are not limited to: (A) Amounts in excess of the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost. (B) The beneficiary's CHAMPUS deductible and cost-share amounts. (C) Amounts that the CHAMPUS beneficiary, or parent, guardian, or other responsible person has no legal obligation to pay. (D) Amounts excluded under the provisions of Sec. 199.8 of this part. (ii) The amount of dispute for appeals involving a denial of a request for authorization in advance of obtaining care shall be the estimated allowable charge or cost for the services requested. (iii) There is no requirement for an amount in dispute when the appealable issue involves a denial of a provider's request for approval as an authorized CHAMPUS provider or the determination to exclude, suspend, or terminate a provider's authorized CHAMPUS provider status. (iv) Individual claims may be combined to meet the required amount in dispute if all of the following exist: (A) The claims involve the same beneficiary. (B) The claims involve the same issue. (C) At least one of the claims so combined has had a reconsideration decision issued by OCHAMPUSEUR, a [[Page 225]] CHAMPUS contractor, or a CHAMPUS peer review organization. Note: A request for administrative review under this appeal process which involves a dispute regarding a requirement of law or regulation (paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section) or does not involve a sufficient amount in dispute (paragraph (a)(7) of this section) may not be rejected at the reconsideration level of appeal. However, an appeal shall involve an appealable issue and sufficient amount in dispute under these paragraphs to be granted a formal review or hearing. (8) Levels of appeal. The sequence and procedures of a CHAMPUS appeal vary, depending on whether the initial determination was made by OCHAMPUS, OCHAMPUSEUR, a CHAMPUS contractor, or a CHAMPUS peer review organization. (i) Appeal levels for initial determination made by OCHAMPUSEUR, CHAMPUS contractor, or CHAMPUS peer review organization. (A) Reconsideration by OCHAMPUSEUR, CHAMPUS contractor, or CHAMPUS peer review organization. (B) Formal review by OCHAMPUS (except for CHAMPUS peer review organization reconsiderations). (C) Hearing. (ii) Appeal levels for initial determination made by OCHAMPUS. (A) Reconsideration by OCHAMPUSEUR or CHAMPUS contractor. (B) Formal review by OCHAMPUS except (1) initial determinations involving the suspension of claims processing where the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, determines that additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed material facts and the suspending official's decision is not final under the provisions of Sec. 199.9(h) (1)(iv)(A) or (2) initial determinations involving the sanctioning (exclusion, suspension, or termination) of CHAMPUS providers. Initial determinations involving these matters shall be appealed directly to the hearing level. (C) Hearing. (9) Appeal decision. An appeal decision at any level may address all pertinent issues which arise under the appeal or are otherwise presented by the information in the case record (for example, the entire episode of care in the appeal), and shall not be limited to addressing the specific issue appealed by a party. In the case of sanctions imposed under Sec. 199.9, the final decision may affirm, increase or reduce the sanction period imposed by CHAMPUS, or otherwise modify or reverse the imposition of the sanction. (b) Reconsideration. Any party to the initial determination made by the CHAMPUS contractor, or a CHAMPUS peer review organization may request reconsideration. (1) Requesting a reconsideration--(i) Written request required. The request must be in writing, shall state the specific matter in dispute, and shall include a copy of the notice of initial determination (such as the CEOB form) made by OCHAMPUSEUR, the CHAMPUS contractor, or the CHAMPUS peer review organization. (ii) Where to file. The request shall be submitted to the office that made the initial determination (i.e., OCHAMPUSEUR, the CHAMPUS contractor, or the CHAMPUS peer review organization) or any other CHAMPUS contractor designated in the notice of initial determination. (iii) Allowed time to file. The request must be mailed within 90 days after the date of the notice of initial determination. (iv) Official filing date. A request for a reconsideration shall be deemed filed on the date it is mailed and postmarked. If the request does not have a postmark, it shall be deemed filed on the date received by OCHAMPUSEUR, the CHAMPUS contractor or the CHAMPUS peer review organization. (2) The reconsideration process. The purpose of the reconsideration is to determine whether the initial determination was made in accordance with law, regulation, policies, and guidelines in effect at the time the care was provided or requested, or at the time of the initial determination and/or reconsideration decision involving a provider request for approval as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS. The reconsideration is performed by a member of the OCHAMPUSEUR, CHAMPUS contractor, or CHAMPUS peer review organization staff who was not involved in making the initial determination and is a thorough and [[Page 226]] independent reveiw of the case. The reconsideration is based on the information submitted that led to the initial determination, plus any additional information that the appealing party may submit or OCHAMPUSEUR, the CHAMPUS contractor, or CHAMPUS peer review organization may obtain. (3) Timeliness of reconsideration determination. OCHAMPUSEUR, the CHAMPUS contractor, or CHAMPUS peer review organization normally shall issue its reconsideration determination no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of the request for reconsideration by OCHAMPUSEUR, the CHAMPUS contractor, or the CHAMPUS peer review organization. (4) Notice of reconsideration determination. OCHAMPUSEUR, the CHAMPUS contractor, or the CHAMPUS peer review organization shall issue a written notice of the reconsideration determination to the appealing party at his or her last known address. The notice of the reconsideration must contain the following elements: (i) A statement of the issues or issue under appeal. (ii) The provisions of law, regulation, policies, and guidelines that apply to the issue or issues under appeal. (iii) A discussion of the original and additional information that is relevant to the issue or issues under appeal. (iv) Whether the reconsideration upholds the initial determination or reverses it, in whole or in part, and the rationale for the action. (v) A statement of the right to appeal further in any case when the reconsideration determination is less than fully favorable to the appealing party and the amount in dispute is $50 or more. (5) Effect of reconsideration determination. The reconsideration determination is final if either of the following exist: (i) The amount in dispute is less than $50. (ii) Appeal rights have been offered, but a request for formal review is not received by OCHAMPUS within 60 days of the date of the notice of the reconsideration determination. (c) Formal review. Except as explained in this paragraph, any party to an initial determination made by OCHAMPUS, or a reconsideration determination made by the CHAMPUS contractor, may request a formal review by OCHAMPUS if the party is dissatisfied with the initial or reconsideration determination unless the initial or reconsideration determination is final under paragraph (b)(5) of this section; involves the sanctioning of a provider by the exclusion, suspension or termination of authorized provider status; involves a written decision issued pursuant to Sec. 199.9(h)(1)(iv)(A) regarding the temporary suspension of claims processing; or involves a reconsideration determination by a CHAMPUS peer review organization. A hearing, but not a formal review level of appeal, may be available to a party to an initial determination involving the sanctioning of a provider or to a party to a written decision involving a temporary suspension of claims processing. A beneficiary (or an authorized representative of a beneficiary), but not a provider (except as provided in Sec. 199.15), may request a hearing, but not a formal review, of a reconsideration determination made by a CHAMPUS peer review organization. (1) Requesting a formal review. (i) Written request required. The request must be in writing, shall state the specific matter in dispute, shall include copies of the written determination (notice of reconsideration determination or OCHAMPUS initial determination) being appealed, and shall include any additional information or documents not submitted previously. (ii) Where to file. The request shall be submitted to the Chief, Office of Appeals and Hearings, TRICARE Management Activity, 16401 East Centretech Parkway, Auroa, Colorado 80011-9066. (iii) Allowed time to file. The request shall be mailed within 60 days after the date of the notice of the reconsideration determination or OCHAMPUS initial determination being appealed. (iv) Official filing date. A request for a formal review shall be deemed filed on the date it is mailed and postmarked. If the request does not have a postmark, it shall be deemed filed on the date received by OCHAMPUS. (2) The formal review process. The purpose of the formal review is to determine whether the initial determination or reconsideration determination was [[Page 227]] made in accordance with law, regulation, policies, and guidelines in effect at the time the care was provided or requested or at the time of the initial determination, reconsideration, or formal review decision involving a provider request for approval as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. The formal review is performed by the Chief, Office of Appeals and Hearings, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, and is a thorough review of the case. The formal review determination shall be based on the information, upon which the initial determination and/or reconsideration determination was based, and any additional information the appealing party may submit or OCHAMPUS may obtain. (3) Timeliness of formal review determination. The Chief, Office of Appeals and Hearings, OCHAMPUS, or a designee normally shall issue the formal review determination no later than 90 days from the date of receipt of the request for formal review by the OCHAMPUS. (4) Notice of formal review determination. The Chief, Office of Appeals and Hearings, OCHAMPUS, or a designee shall issue a written notice of the formal review determination to the appealing party at his or her last known address. The notice of the formal review determination must contain the following elements: (i) A statement of the issue or issues under appeal. (ii) The provisions of law, regulation, policies, and guidelines that apply to the issue or issues under appeal. (iii) A discussion of the original and additional information that is relevant to the issue or issues under appeal. (iv) Whether the formal review upholds the prior determination or determinations or reverses the prior determination or determinations in whole or in part and the rationale for the action. (v) A statement of the right to request a hearing in any case when the formal review determination is less than fully favorable, the issue is appealable, and the amount in dispute is $300 or more. (5) Effect of formal review determination. The formal review determination is final if one or more of the following exist: (i) The issue is not appealable. (See paragraph (a)(6) of this section.) (ii) The amount in dispute is less than $300. (See paragraph (a)(7) of this section.) (iii) Appeal rights have been offered but a request for hearing is not received by OCHAMPUS within 60 days of the date of the notice of the formal review determination. (d) Hearing. Any party to the initial determination may request a hearing if the party is dissatisfied with the formal review determination and the formal review determination is not final under the provisions of paragraph (c)(5), of this section, or the initial determination involves the sanctioning of a provider under Sec. 199.9 of this part and involves an appealable issue. (1) Requesting a hearing--(i) Written request required. The request shall be in writing, state the specific matter in dispute, include a copy of the appropriate initial determination or formal review determination being appealed, and include any additional information or documents not submitted previously. (ii) Where to file. The request shall be submitted to the Chief, Appeals and Hearings, OCHAMPUS, Aurora, Colorado 80045-6900. (iii) Allowed time to file. The request shall be mailed within 60 days after the date of the notice of the initial determination or formal review determination being appealed. (iv) Official filing date. A request for hearing shall be deemed filed on the date it is mailed and postmarked. If a request for hearing does not have a postmark, it shall be deemed filed on the day received by OCHAMPUS. (2) Hearing process. A hearing is an administrative proceeding in which facts relevant to the appealable issue(s) in the case are presented and evaluated in relation to applicable law, regulation, policies, and guidelines in effect at the time the care in dispute was provided or requested; at the time of the initial determination, formal review determination, or hearing decision involving a provider request for approval under CHAMPUS as an authorized provider; or at the time of the [[Page 228]] act or event which is the basis for the imposition of sanctions under this part. A hearing, except for an appeal involving a provider sanction, generally shall be conducted as a nonadversary, administrative proceeding. However, an authorized party to any hearing, including CHAMPUS, may submit additional evidence or testimony relevant to the appealable issue(s) and may appoint a representative, including legal counsel, to participate in the hearing process. (3) Timeliness of hearing. (i) Except as otherwise provided in this section, within 60 days following receipt of a request for hearing, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, normally will appoint a hearing officer to hear the appeal. Copies of all records in the possession of OCHAMPUS that are pertinent to the matter to be heard or that formed the basis of the formal review determination shall be provided to the hearing officer and, upon request, to the appealing party. (ii) The hearing officer, except as otherwise provided in this Section, normally shall have 60 days from the date of written notice of assignment to review the file, schedule and hold the hearing, and issue a recommended decision to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee. (iii) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may delay the case assignment to the hearing officer if additional information is needed that cannot be obtained and included in the record within the time period specified above. The appealing party will be notified in writing of the delay resulting from the request for additional information. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, in such circumstances, will assign the case to a hearing officer within 30 days of receipt of all such additional information, or within 60 days of receipt of the request for hearing, whichever shall occur last. (iv) The hearing officer may delay submitting the recommended decision if, at the close of the hearing, any party to the hearing requests that the record remain open for submission of additional information. In such circumstances, the hearing officer will have 30 days following receipt of all such additional information including comments from the other parties to the hearing concerning the additional information to submit the recommended decision to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (4) Representation at a hearing. Any party to the hearing may appoint a representative to act on behalf of the party at the hearing, unless such person currently is disqualified or suspended from acting in another Federal administrative proceeding, or unless otherwise prohibited by law, this part, or any other DoD regulation (see paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section). A hearing officer may refuse to allow any person to represent a party at the hearing when such person engages in unethical, disruptive, or contemptuous conduct, or intentionally fails to comply with proper instructions or requests of the hearing officer, or the provisions of this part. The representative shall have the same authority as the appealing party and notice given to the representative shall constitute notice required to be given to the appealing party. (5) Consolidation of proceedings. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may consolidate any number of proceedings for hearing when the facts and circumstances are similar and no substantial right of an appealing party will be prejudiced. (6) Authority of the hearing officer. The hearing officer in exercising the authority to conduct a hearing under this part will be bound by 10 U.S.C. chapter 55 and this part. The hearing officer in addressing substantive, appealable issues shall be bound by policy manuals, instructions, procedures, and other guidelines issued by the ASD(HA), or a designee, or by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, in effect for the period in which the matter in dispute arose. A hearing officer may not establish or amend policy, procedures, instructions, or guidelines. However, the hearing officer may recommend reconsideration of the policy, procedures, instructions or guidelines by the ASD(HA), or a designee, when the final decision is issued in the case. (7) Disqualification of hearing officer. A hearing officer voluntarily shall disqualify himself or herself and withdraw [[Page 229]] from any proceeding in which the hearing officer cannot give fair or impartial hearing, or in which there is a conflict of interest. A party to the hearing may request the disqualification of a hearing officer by filing a statement detailing the reasons the party believes that a fair and impartial hearing cannot be given or that a conflict of interest exists. Such request immediately shall be sent by the appealing party or the hearing officer to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, who shall investigate the allegations and advise the complaining party of the decision in writing. A copy of such decision also shall be mailed to all other parties to the hearing. If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, reassigns the case to another hearing officer, no investigation shall be required. (8) Notice and scheduling of hearing. The hearing officer shall issue by certified mail, when practicable, a written notice to the parties to the hearing of the time and place for the hearing. Such notice shall be mailed at least 15 days before the scheduled date of the hearing. The notice shall contain sufficient information about the hearing procedure, including the party's right to representation, to allow for effective preparation. The notice also shall advise the appealing party of the right to request a copy of the record before the hearing. Additionally, the notice shall advise the appealing party of his or her responsibility to furnish the hearing officer, no later than 7 days before the scheduled date of the hearing, a list of all witnesses who will testify and a copy of all additional information to be presented at the hearing. The time and place of the hearing shall be determined by the hearing officer, who shall select a reasonable time and location mutually convenient to the appealing party and OCHAMPUS. (9) Dismissal of request for hearing. (i) By application of appealing party. A request for hearing may be dismissed by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, at any time before the mailing of the final decision, upon the application of the appealing party. A request for dismissal must be in writing and filed with the Chief, Appeals and Hearings, OCHAMPUS, or the hearing officer. When dismissal is requested, the formal review determination in the case shall be deemed final, unless the dismissal is vacated in accordance with paragraph (d)(9)(v) of this section. (ii) By stipulation of the parties to the hearing. A request for a hearing may be dismissed by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, at any time before to the mailing of notice of the final decision under a stipulation agreement between the appealing party and OCHAMPUS. When dismissal is entered under a stipulation, the formal review decision shall be deemed final, unless the dismissal is vacated in accordance with paragraph (d)(9)(v) of this section. (iii) By abandonment. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may dismiss a request for hearing upon abandonment by the appealing party. (A) An appealing party shall be deemed to have abandoned a request for hearing, other than when personal appearance is waived in accordance with Sec. 199.10(d)(11)(xii), if neither the appealing party nor an appointed representative appears at the time and place fixed for the hearing and if, within 10 days after the mailing of a notice by certified mail to the appealing party by the hearing officer to show cause, such party does not show good and sufficient cause for such failure to appear and failure to notify the hearing officer before the time fixed for hearing that an appearance could not be made. (B) An appealing party shall be deemed to have abandoned a request for hearing if, before assignment of the case to the hearing officer, OCHAMPUS is unable to locate either the appealing party or an appointed representative. (C) An appealing party shall be deemed to have abandoned a request for hearing if the appealing party fails to prosecute the appeal. Failure to prosecute the appeal includes, but is not limited to, an appealing party's failure to provide information reasonably requested by OCHAMPUS or the hearing officer for consideration in the appeal. (D) If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, dismisses the request for hearing because of abandonment, the formal review determination in the case shall be deemed to be final, unless [[Page 230]] the dismissal is vacated in accordance with paragraph (d)(9)(v) of this section. (iv) For cause. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may dismiss for cause a request for hearing either entirely or as to any stated issue. If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, dismisses a hearing request for cause, the formal review determination in the case shall be deemed to be final, unless the dismissal is vacated in accordance with paragraph (d)(9)(v) of this section. A dismissal for cause may be issued under any of the following circumstances: (A) When the appealing party requesting the hearing is not a proper party under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, or does not otherwise have a right to participate in a hearing. (B) When the appealing party who filed the hearing request dies, and there is no information before the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, showing that a party to the initial determination who is not an appealing party may be prejudiced by the formal review determination. (C) When the issue is not appealable (see Sec. 199.10(a)(6)). (D) When the amount in dispute is less than $300 (see Sec. 199.10(a)(7)). (E) When all appealable issues have been resolved in favor of the appealing party. (v) Vacation of dismissal. Dismissal of a request for hearing may be vacated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, upon written request of the appealing party, if the request is received within 6 months of the date of the notice of dismissal mailed to the last known address of the party requesting the hearing. (10) Preparation for hearing. (i) Prehearing statement of contentions. The hearing officer may on reasonable notice require a party to the hearing to submit a written statement of contentions and reasons. The written statement shall be provided to all parties to the hearing before the hearing takes place. (ii) Discovery. Upon the written request of a party to the initial determination (including OCHAMPUS) and for good cause shown, the hearing officer will allow that party to inspect and copy all documents, unless privileged, relevant to issues in the proceeding that are in the possession or control of the other party participating in the appeal. The written request shall state clearly what information and documents are required for inspection and the relevance of the documents to the issues in the proceeding. Depositions, interrogatories, requests for admissions, and other forms of prehearing discovery are generally not authorized and the Department of Defense does not have subpoena authority for purposes of administrative hearings under this Section. If the hearing officer finds that good cause exists for taking a deposition or interrogatory, the expense shall be assessed to the requesting party, with copies furnished to the hearing officer and the other party or parties to the hearing. (iii) Witnesses and evidence. All parties to a hearing are responsible for producing, at each party's expense, meaning without reimbursement of payment by CHAMPUS, witnesses and other evidence in their own behalf, and for furnishing copies of any such documentary evidence to the hearing officer and other party or parties to the hearing. The Department of Defense is not authorized to subpoena witnesses or records. The hearing officer may issue invitations and requests to individuals to appear and testify without cost to the Government, so that the full facts in the case may be presented. (11) Conduct of hearing. (i) Right to open hearing. Because of the personal nature of the matters to be considered, hearings normally shall be closed to the public. However, the appealing party may request an open hearing. If this occurs, the hearing shall be open except when protection of other legitimate Government purposes dictates closing certain portions of the hearing. (ii) Right to examine parties to the hearing and their witnesses. Each party to the hearing shall have the right to produce and examine witnesses, to introduce exhibits, to question opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issue even though the matter was not covered in the direct examination, to impeach any witness regardless of which party to the hearing first called the witness to testify, and to rebut any evidence presented. Except for those [[Page 231]] witnesses employed by OCHAMPUS at the time of the hearing, or records in the possession of OCHAMPUS, a party to a hearing shall be responsible, that is to say no payment or reimbursement shall be made by CHAMPUS for the cost or fee associated with producing witnesses or other evidence in the party's own behalf, or for furnishing copies of documentary evidence to the hearing officer and other party or parties to the hearing. (iii) Taking of evidence. The hearing officer shall control the taking of evidence in a manner best suited ascertain the facts and safeguard the rights of the parties to the hearing. Before taking evidence, the hearing officer shall identify and state the issues in dispute on the record and the order in which evidence will be recieved. (iv) Questioning and admission of evidence. A hearing officer may question any witness and shall admit any relevant evidence. Evidence that is irrelevant or unduly repetitious shall be excluded. (v) Relevant evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted, unless unduly repetitious, if it is the type of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule that might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil or criminal actions. (vi) CHAMPUS determination first. The basis of the CHAMPUS determinations shall be presented to the hearing officer first. The appealing party shall then be given the opportunity to establish affirmatively why this determination is held to be in error. (vii) Testimony. Testimony shall be taken only on oath, affirmation, or penalty of perjury. (viii) Oral argument and briefs. At the request of any party to the hearing made before the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall grant oral argument. If written argument is requested, it shall be granted, and the parties to the hearing shall be advised as to the time and manner within which such argument is to be filed. The hearing officer may require any party to the hearing to submit written memoranda pertaining to any or all issues raised in the hearing. (ix) Continuance of hearing. A hearing officer may continue a hearing to another time or place on his or her own motion or, upon showing of good cause, at the request of any party. Written notice of the time and place of the continued hearing, except as otherwise provided here, shall be in accordance with this part. When a continuance is ordered during a hearing, oral notice of the time and place of the continued hearing may be given to each party to the hearing who is present at the hearing. (x) Continuance for additional evidence. If the hearing officer determines, after a hearing has begun, that additional evidence is necessary for the proper determination of the case, the following procedures may be invoked: (A) Continue hearing. The hearing may be continued to a later date in accordance with Sec. 199.10(d)(11)(ix), above. (B) Closed hearing. The hearing may be closed, but the record held open in order to permit the introduction of additional evidence. Any evidence submitted after the close of the hearing shall be made available to all parties to the hearing, and all parties to the hearing shall have the opportunity for comment. The hearing officer may reopen the hearing if any portion of the additional evidence makes further hearing desirable. Notice thereof shall be given in accordance with paragraph (d)(8) of this section. (xi) Transcript of hearing. A verbatim taped record of the hearing shall be made and shall become a permanent part of the record. Upon request, the appealing party shall be furnished a duplicate copy of the tape. A typed transcript of the testimony will be made only when determined to be necessary by OCHAMPUS. If a typed transcript is made, the appealing party shall be furnished a copy without charge. Corrections shall be allowed in the typed transcript by the hearing officer solely for the purpose of conforming the transcript to the actual testimony. (xii) Waiver of right to appear and present evidence. If all parties waive their right to appear before the hearing [[Page 232]] officer for presenting evidence and contentions personally or by representation, it will not be necessary for the hearing officer to give notice of, or to conduct a formal hearing. A waiver of the right to appear must be in writing and filed with the hearing officer or the Chief, Appeals and Hearings, OCHAMPUS. Such waiver may be withdrawn by the party by written notice received by the hearing officer or Chief, Appeals and Hearings, no later than 7 days before the scheduled hearing or the mailing of notice of the final decision, whichever occurs first. For purposes of this Section, failure of a party to appear personally or by representation after filing written notice of waiver, will not be cause for finding of abandonment and the hearing officer shall make the recommended decision on the basis of all evidence of record. (12) Recommended decision. At the conclusion of the hearing and after the record has been closed, the matter shall be taken under consideration by the hearing officer. Within the time frames previously set forth in this Section, the hearing officer shall submit to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, a written recommended decision containing a statement of findings and a statement of reasons based on the evidence adduced at the hearing and otherwise included in the hearing record. (i) Statement of findings. A statement of findings is a clear and concise statement of fact evidenced in the record or conclusions that readily can be deduced from the evidence of record. Each finding must be supported by substantial evidence that is defined as such evidence as a reasonable mind can accept as adequate to support a conclusion. (ii) Statement of reasons. A reason is a clear and concise statement of law, regulation, policies, or guidelines relating to the statement of findings that provides the basis for the recommended decision. (e) Final decision. (1) Director, OCHAMPUS. The recommended decision shall be reviewed by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, who shall adopt or reject the recommended decision or refer the recommended decision for review by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, normally will take action with regard to the recommended decision within 90 days of receipt of the recommended decision or receipt of the revised recommended decision following a remand order to the Hearing Officer. (i) Final action. If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, concurs in the recommended decision, no further agency action is required and the recommended decision, as adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS, is the final agency decision in the appeal. In the case of rejection, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall state the reason for disagreement with the recommended decision and the underlying facts supporting such disagreement. In these circumstances, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may have a final decision prepared based on the record, or may remand the matter to the Hearing Officer for appropriate action. In the latter instance, the Hearing Officer shall take appropriate action and submit a new recommended decision within 60 days of receipt of the remand order. The decision by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, concerning a case arising under the procedures of this section, shall be the final agency decision and the final decision shall be sent by certified mail to the appealing party or parties. A final agency decision under paragraph (e)(1) of this section will not be relied on, used, or cited as precedent by the Department of Defense in the administration of CHAMPUS. (ii) Referral for review by ASD(HA). The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may refer a hearing case to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) when the hearing involves the resolution of CHAMPUS policy and issuance of a final decision which may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent in the administration of CHAMPUS. In such a circumstance, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall forward the recommended decision, together with the recommendation of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, regarding disposition of the hearing case. (2) ASD(HA). The ASD(HA), or a designee, after reviewing a case arising [[Page 233]] under the procedures of this section may issue a final decision based on the record in the hearing case or remand the case to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for appropriate action. A decision issued by the ASD(HA), or a designee, shall be the final agency decision in the appeal and a copy of the final decision shall be sent by certified mail to the appealing party or parties. A final decision of the ASD(HA), or a designee, issued under this paragraph (e)(2) may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent in the administration of CHAMPUS. [51 FR 24008, July 1, 1986, as amended FR 33007, Sept. 1, 1987; 54 FR 12, 2004] Sec. 199.11 Overpayments recovery. (a) General. Actions to recover overpayments arise when the government has a right to recover money or property from an individual, partnership, association, corporation, governmental body or other legal entity, foreign or domestic, except an instrumentality of the United States because of an erroneous payment of benefits under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). A claim against several joint debtors arising from a single incident or transaction is considered to be one claim. It is the purpose of this Section to prescribe procedures for investigation, determination, assertion, collection, compromise, waiver and termination of claims in favor of the United States for erroneous benefits payments arising out of administration of CHAMPUS. (b) Authority. (1) Federal statutory authority. The Federal Claims Collection Act provides the basic authority under which claims may be asserted pursuant to this section. It is implemented by joint regulations issued by the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office, 4 CFR parts 101-105. Thereunder, the heads of federal agencies or their designees are required to attempt collection of all claims of the United States for money or property arising out of the activities of their respective agencies. These officials may, with respect to claims that do not exceed $20,000, exclusive of interest, and in conformity with the standards promulgated in the joint regulations, compromise, suspend, or terminate collection action on such claims. Section 743 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law 104-106) authorizes the waiver (see paragraph (g)(3) of this section) of collection of overpayments otherwise due from a person after the termination of the person's CHAMPUS eligibility, because the person became eligible for Medicare Part A by reason of disability or end-stage renal disease. (2) Other authority. Occasionally, federal claims may arise which are grounded, at least in part, in authority other than the federal statute referenced above. These include, but are not limited to, claims arising under: (i) State worker's compensation laws. (ii) State hospital lien laws. (iii) State no-fault automobile statutes. (iv) Contract rights under terms of insurance policies. (c) Policy. The governmental policy of avoiding unnecessary litigation in the collection of claims by the United States for money or property necessitates aggressive agency collection action. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will insure that CHAMPUS claims asserting personnel are adequately supported to take timely and effective action. Claims arising out of any incident which has or probably will generate a claim in favor of the government will not be compromised nor will collection action be terminated by any person not authorized to take final action on the government's claim. By the Act of July 18, 1966 (28 U.S.C. 2415-2418), Congress established a statute of limitation applicable to the government in areas where previously neither limitations nor laches were available as a defense. Claims falling within the provisions of this statute will be processed expeditiously to the Department of Justice or the General Accounting Office, as appropriate, without attempting administrative collection action if such action cannot be accomplished in sufficient time to preclude the running of the statute of limitations. [[Page 234]] (d) Appealability. This section describes the procedures to be followed in the recovery and collection of federal claims in favor of the United States arising from the operation of the CHAMPUS. Actions taken under this section are not initial determinations for the purpose of the appeal procedures of Sec. 199.10 of this part. However, the proper exercise of the right to appeal benefit or provider status determinations under the procedures set forth in Sec. 199.10 may affect the processing of federal claims arising under this section. Those appeal procedures afford a CHAMPUS beneficiary or participating provider an opportunity for administrative appellate review in cases in which benefits have been denied and in which there is a significant factual dispute. For example, a fiscal intermediary may erroneously make payment for services which are excluded as CHAMPUS benefits because they are determined to be not medically necessary. In that event recoupment action will be initiated by the fiscal intermediary at the same time the fiscal intermediary will offer an administrative appeal as provided in Sec. 199.10 of this part on the medical necessity issue raised by the adverse benefit determination. The recoupment action and the administrative appeal are separate actions. However, in an appropriate case, the pendency of the appeal may provide a basis for the suspension of collection in the recoupment. Obviously, if the appeal is resolved entirely in favor of the appealing party, that would provide a basis for the termination of collection action in the recoupment case. (e) Delegation. Subject to the limitations imposed by law or contained in this section, the authority to assert, settle, compromise or to suspend or terminate collection action on claims arising under the Federal Claims Collection Act has been delegated to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (f) Recoupment of erroneous payments. (1) Erroneous payments. Erroneous payments are expenditures of government funds which are not authorized by law or this part. Examples which are sometimes encountered in the administration of the CHAMPUS include mathematical errors, payment for care provided to an ineligible person, payment for care which is not an authorized benefit, payment for duplicate claims, inaccurate application of the deductible or co-payment, or payment for services which were not medically necessary. Claims in favor of the government arising as the result of the filing of false CHAMPUS claims or other fraud fall under the direct cognizance of the Department of Justice. Consequently, the procedures in this section apply to such claims only when specifically authorized or directed by the Department of Justice. (See 32 CFR 101.3.) (2) Scope. (i) General. Paragraph (f) of this section and the paragraphs following contain requirements and procedures for the assertion, collection or compromise of, and the suspension or termination of collection action on claims for erroneous payments against a sponsor, beneficiary, provider, physician or other supplier of services under the CHAMPUS. These provisions are adopted pursuant to the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq., as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97-365), which requires each agency of the U.S. Government (pursuant to regulations jointly promulgated by the Attorney General and the Comptroller General) to attempt collection of federal claims in favor of the United States arising out of the activities of the agency, and 5 U.S.C. 5514, which provides for installment deduction for indebtedness to the United States, implemented by regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management, 5 CFR part 550, and the Department of Defense, 32 CFR part 90. Paragraph (f) of this section also includes government-wide collections by salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514. (ii) Debtor defined. As used herein, ``debtor'' means a sponsor, beneficiary, provider, physician, other supplier of services or supplies, or any other person who has for any reason been erroneously paid under the CHAMPUS. It includes an individual, partnership, corporation, professional corporation or association, estate, trust or any other legal entity. (iii) Delinquency defined. As used herein, a debt is considered ``delinquent'' if it has not been paid by the [[Page 235]] date specified in the initial demand for payment (that is, the initial written notification) or applicable contractual agreement, unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made by that date. A debt is also considered delinquent if at any time after entering into a repayment agreement, the debtor fails to satisfy any obligations under that agreement. (3) Other health insurance claims. Claims arising from erroneous CHAMPUS payments in situations where the beneficiary has entitlement to insurance, medical service, health and medical plan, or other government program, except in the case of a plan administered under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), through employment, by law, through membership in an organization, or as a student, or through the purchase of a private insurance or health plan, shall be recouped under one of the following procedures: (i) Where the other health insurance plan has not already made benefit payments to the beneficiary or provider, a claim for direct reimbursement will be asserted against the plan, pursuant to the fiscal intermediary's coordination of benefit procedures. (ii) If the other health insurance plan has made its benefit payment prior to receiving the CHAMPUS request for reimbursement, the recoupment procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section will be followed. (4) Claims denials due to clarification or change. In those instances where claim review results in the denial of benefits previously provided but now denied due to a change, clarification or interpretation of the public law or this part, no recoupment action need be taken to recover funds expended prior to the effective date of such change, clarification, or interpretation. (5) Good faith payment. (i) The Department of Defense, through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), is responsible for establishing and maintaining a file listing persons eligible to receive benefits under CHAMPUS. However, it is the responsibility of the Uniformed Services to provide eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries with accurate and appropriate means of identification. When sources of civilian medical care exercise reasonable care and precaution in identifying persons claiming to be eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries and furnish otherwise covered services and supplies to such persons in good faith, CHAMPUS benefits may be paid subject to prior approval by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, notwithstanding the fact that the person receiving the services and supplies is subsequently determined to be ineligible for benefits. Good faith payments will not be authorized for services and supplies provided by a civilian source of medical care as the result of its own careless identification procedures. (ii) When it is determined that a person was not a CHAMPUS beneficiary, the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary and the civilian source of medical care are expected to make all reasonable efforts to obtain payment or recoup the amount of the good faith payment from the person who erroneously claimed to be a CHAMPUS beneficiary. Recoupments of good faith payments initiated by the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary will be processed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. (6) Recoupment procedures. (i) Initial action. When an erroneous payment is discovered, the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary normally will be required to take the initial action to effect recoupment. Such action will be in accordance with the provisions of this part and the fiscal intermediary's CHAMPUS contract and will include demands for refund or an offset against any other CHAMPUS payment becoming due the debtor. When the efforts of the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary to effect recoupment are not successful within a reasonable time, recoupment cases will be referred to the General Counsel, OCHAMPUS, for further action in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. All requests to debtors for refund or notices of intent to offset shall be in writing. (ii) Demand for payment. The CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary and OCHAMPUS normally shall make a total of at least three progressively stronger written demands upon the debtor in terms which inform the debtor of the consequences of his or her [[Page 236]] failure to cooperate. The initial written demand shall inform the debtor of the basis for and the amount of the indebtedness. The initial written demand shall also inform the debtor of the following: The debtor's right to inspect and copy all records pertaining to the debt; his or her right to request an administrative review by the fiscal intermediary; that interest on the debt at the current rate as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will begin to accrue on the date of the initial demand notification; that such interest shall be waived on the debt, or any portion thereof, which is paid within 30 days of the date of the initial demand notification; that payment of the indebtedness is due within 30 days of the date of the initial demand notification; and that administrative costs and penalties will be charged pursuant to 4 CFR 102.13. The debtor also shall be informed that collection by offset against current or subsequent claims may be taken. All debtors will be offered an opportunity to enter into a written agreement to repay the indebtedness. The fiscal intermediary demand letters must be dated the same day as they are mailed. Two written demands, at 30-day intervals, normally will be made by the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary unless a response to the first demand indicates that further demand would be futile or unless prompt suit or attachment is required in anticipation of the departure of the debtor, of his removal or transfer of assets, or the running of the statute of limitations. There should be no undue time lag in responding to any communication received from the debtor. Responses should be made within 30 days whenever feasible. If these initial efforts at collection are not productive or if immediate legal action on the claim appears necessary, the claim either will be referred promptly by the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary to the General Counsel, OCHAMPUS, or the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary will prepare a final notice informing the debtor that the debt is to be offset in whole or in part. When a case is referred to OCHAMPUS, the Office of General Counsel will normally prepare a third written demand unless from the record such demand appears futile or otherwise inappropriate. (iii) Collection by administrative offset. Collections by offset will be undertaken administratively on claims which are liquidated or certain in amount in every instance in which this is feasible. No collection by offset may be undertaken unless a demand for payment containing all of the procedural safeguards described in paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section, has been sent to the debtor. The determinations of indebtedness made for recoupment of erroneous CHAMPUS payments rarely involve issues of credibility of veracity. Erroneous CHAMPUS payments most frequently arise from claims submitted by individuals ineligible for CHAMPUS benefits; from claims submitted for services or supplies not covered by CHAMPUS; from claims in which there have been other insurance payments which reduce the CHAMPUS liability and from claims from participating providers in which payment is initially erroneously made to the beneficiary. While these recoupment claims normally involve the resolution of factual questions, these resolution nearly always require only reference to the documentary evidence compiled in the investigation and processing of the claim. The appeals system described in Sec. 199.10 of this part affords a CHAMPUS beneficiary or participating provider an opportunity for an administrative appellate review, including, under certain circumstances, the right to oral hearing before a hearing officer. Further, there is no statutory provision for the waiver of indebtedness arising from erroneous CHAMPUS payments, other than the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Act which allow for the compromise of claims or the termination of collection action under certain circumstances specified in paragraph (g) of this section. Consequently, the pre-offset oral hearing requirements of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR 102.3) do not apply to the recoupment of erroneous CHAMPUS payments. CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries may take administrative action to offset erroneous payments against other current CHAMPUS payments owing a debtor. Payments on the claims of a debtor [[Page 237]] pending at or filed subsequent to the time collection action is initiated should be suspended pending the outcome of the collection action so that these funds will be available for offset. All or any part of a debt may be offset depending upon the amount available for offset. Only the case in which no possibility of offset arises within 60 days of the initiation of collection action and on which other collection efforts have been unsuccessful or in which the debtor seeks relief from the indebtedness will be referred to the General Counsel, OCHAMPUS, by the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary. Offset, under the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716, is not to be used with respect to debts owed by any state or local government. Any requests for offset that are received from other agencies shall be forwarded to the General Counsel, OCHAMPUS, for processing, as will orders for garnishment issued by courts of competent jurisdiction. (iv) Collection of installments. CHAMPUS recoupment claims should be collected in one lump sum whenever possible. However, if the debtor is financially unable to pay the debt in one lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments by the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary or the General Counsel, OCHAMPUS. Installment payments normally will be required on at least a monthly basis and their size will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. A CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary should not enter into installment agreements which extend beyond 24 months. OCHAMPUS installment agreements normally should liquidate the government's claim within 3 years. Installment payments of less than $50 per month normally will be accepted only if justifiable on grounds of financial hardship or some other reasonable cause. Any installment agreement with a debtor in which the total amount of the deferred installments will exceed $750 should normally include an executed promissory note. (v) Interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Interest shall be charged on CHAMPUS recoupment debts and debts collected in installments in accordance with 4 CFR 102.13 and instructions issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. Interest shall accrue from the date on which the initial demand is mailed to the debtor. The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current value of funds to the United States Treasury (that is, the Treasury tax and loan account rate). The rate of interest, as initially assessed shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except that where the debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, a new interest rate may be set which reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement is executed. The collection of interest on the debt or any portion of the debt, which is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue, shall be waived. The agency may extend this 30-day period, on a case-by-case basis, if it reasonably determines that such action is appropriate. Also, the collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs may be waived in whole or in part as a part of the compromise of a debt as provided in paragraph (g) of this section. In addition, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may waive in whole or in part, the collection of interest, penalties, or administrative costs assessed herein, if he or she determines that collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interests of the United States. Some situations in which such a waiver may be appropriate include: (A) Waiver of interest consistent with 4 CFR 104.2(c)(2) in connection with a suspension of collection action pending a CHAMPUS appeal under Sec. 199.10 of this part where there is a substantial issue of fact in dispute. (B) Waiver of interest where the original debt arose through no fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor and the collection of interest would impose a financial hardship or burden on the debtor. Some examples in which such a waiver may be appropriate include: a debt arising when a CHAMPUS beneficiary, who is unaware of the loss of eligibility for CHAMPUS because he or she has become eligible for Medicare, continues to file and be paid for CHAMPUS claims, resulting in erroneous CHAMPUS payments; a debt [[Page 238]] arising when a CHAMPUS beneficiary in good faith files and is paid a CHAMPUS claim for medical services or supplies which are later determined not to be benefits of CHAMPUS; and a debt arising when a CHAMPUS beneficiary is overpaid as the result of a calculation error on the part of a fiscal intermediary or OCHAMPUS. (C) Waiver of interest where there has been an agreement to repay a debt in installments, there is no indication of fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor, and the amount of interest is so large in relation to the size of the installments that the debtor can reasonably afford to pay, that it is likely the debt will never be repaid in full. When a debt is paid in installments, the installment payments first will be applied to the payment of outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest and then to principal. Administrative costs incurred as the result of a debt becoming delinquent (as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section) shall be assessed against a debtor. These administrative costs represent the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent. The calculation of administrative costs should be based upon cost analysis establishing an average of actual additional costs incurred in processing and handling claims against other debtors in similar stages of delinquency. A penalty charge, not exceeding six percent a year shall be assessed on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge, which need not be calculated until the 91st day of delinquency, shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent. (vi) Referral to other federal agencies for administrative offset. As appropriate and in accordance with 4 CFR part 1023, agencies will be requested to initiate administrative offset to collect CHAMPUS debts. When a debtor is employed by the U.S. Government, or is a member or retired member of the Uniformed Service, and collection by offset against other CHAMPUS payments due the debtor cannot be accomplished, and there have been no positive responses to a demand for payment within 60 days, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may contact the agency holding funds payable to the debtor for payment by allotment or otherwise by salary offset from current disposable pay in accordance with 37 U.S.C. 1007 or 5 U.S.C. 5514 as implemented by 32 CFR part 90 and 5 CFR part 550. Where applicable, the request for recovery of erroneous CHAMPUS payments shall be submitted to the debtor's paying agency in accordance with 5 CFR 550.1106. Before contacting the paying agency, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will provide the debtor written notification of the agency's intent to collect the debt by means of salary offset, authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5514. The notification will include, as a minimum: (A) The agency's determination that a debt is owed, including the origin, nature, and the amount of the debt; (B) The date by which payment is to be made, which will normally be 30 days from the date the demand letter is mailed; (C) The amount, frequency, proposed beginning date and duration of the intended deductions, which will be determined in accordance with the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1104 or 32 CFR part 90, as appropriate. Ordinarily, the size of installment deductions must bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay (4 CFR 102.11). However, the amount deducted for any period must not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the debtor has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. Debts must be collected in one lump-sum whenever possible. However, if the employee is financially unable to pay in one lump-sum, or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of current disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, collection must be made in installments. Such installment deductions must be made to effect collection within the period of anticipated active duty or employment. If the debtor retires or resigns or if his or her employment or period of active duty ends before collection of the debt is completed, offset from subsequent payments of any kind due the employee from the paying agency as of the date of separation shall be made to [[Page 239]] the extent necessary to liquidate the debt pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 as implemented by 5 CFR part 550 and 32 CFR part 90. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the government's claim in not more than 3 years. Installment payments of less than $50 per month should be accepted only with reasonable justification. An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 will not be construed as a waiver of any rights the debtor may have under that statute or any other provisions of contract or law, unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary. (D) An explanation of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, including a statement that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards; (E) Advice that the debtor may inspect and copy government records relating to the debt or, if debtor or his or her representative cannot personally inspect the records, to request and receive a copy of such records. Requests for copies of the records relating to the debt shall be made no later than 10 days from the receipt by the debtor of the notice of indebtedness. (F) An opportunity for a review by the agency of its determination regarding the existence or the amount of the debt, or when a repayment schedule is established other than by written agreement, concerning the terms of the repayment schedule. The debtor shall be advised that a challenge to either the existence of the debt, the amount of the debt, or the repayment schedule, must be made within 30 days of the receipt by the debtor of the notice of indebtedness or within 45 days after receipt of the records relating to the debt, if such records are requested by the debtor. A request for waiver or reconsideration should be accompanied by supporting documents indicating why the debtor believes he is not so indebted, or by a financial affidavit supporting his request for an alternative repayment schedule; (G) Notice that the timely filing of a petition for review will stay the commencement of collection proceedings; (H) Notice that a final decision on the review (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the petition requesting the review unless the employee requests, and the agency grants, a delay in the proceedings; (I) The opportunity, if it has not been previously provided, to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement will be signed by both the debtor and the agency's representative and will be kept in the agency's files; (J) Notice that any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the debtor to: (1) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under chapter 75 of Title 5 U.S. Code, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations; (2) Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3731, or any other applicable authority, or (3) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001 and 1002, or any other applicable authority; (K) Where applicable, notice of the debtor's right to appeal, under Sec. 199.10 of this part; (L) That amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will promptly be refunded to the debtor. Refunds do not bear interest unless required or permitted by law or contract; (M) The specific address to which all correspondence regarding the debt shall be directed. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, moneys which are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund may be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payment or a minimal number of payments debts owed to the United States by the debtor. The General Counsel, OCHAMPUS, may forward requests for offset of debts arising from the operation of CHAMPUS to the appropriate officials of the Office of Personnel Management. These requests shall comply with the provisions of 4 CFR 102.4 and 5 CFR part 550. [[Page 240]] (vii) Referral to debt collection agencies. Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR 102.6), the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is authorized to enter into contracts for collection services, including contracts with private collection agencies for the purpose of supplementing and strengthening the collection efforts of the Department of Defense in recouping erroneous CHAMPUS payments. Such contracts will supplement but not replace the basic collection program described herein. The authority to resolve disputes, compromise claims, terminate collection action and initiate legal action may not be delegated in such contracts but will be retained by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. Individuals or firms that enter into contracts for collection services pursuant to this paragraph are subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to debt collection practices, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692. Debt collection contractors shall be required to account strictly for all amounts collected and must agree to provide any data contained in their files relating to 4 CFR 105.2(a) (1), (2) and (3). Contracts for commercial collection services must comply with 32 CFR part 90. (viii) Referrals to consumer reporting agencies. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is authorized to provide for the reporting of delinquent debts to consumer reporting agencies. Delinquent debts are those which are not paid or for which satisfactory payment arrangements are not made by the due date specified in the initial notification of indebtedness, or those for which the debtor has entered into a written payment agreement and installment payments are past due 30 days or longer. These referrals may be made only after publication of a ``routine use'' for the disclosures involved as required by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a. Procedures developed for such referrals must also insure that an accounting of the disclosures is kept which is available to the debtor; that the consumer reporting agencies are provided with corrections and annotations of disagreements by the debtor; and that reasonable efforts are made to assure that the information to be reported is accurate, complete, timely and relevant. When requested by a consumer reporting agency, verification of information disclosed will promptly be provided. Once a claim has been reviewed and determined to be valid, a complete explanation of the claim will be given the debtor. When the claim is overdue, the individual will be notified in writing that payment is overdue; that within 60 days, disclosure of the claim shall be made to a consumer reporting agency unless satisfactory payment arrangements are made or unless the debtor requests an administrative review and demonstrates some basis on which the debt is legitimately disputed; and of the specific information to be disclosed to the consumer reporting agency. The information to be disclosed to the consumer reporting agency will be limited to information necessary to establish the identity of the debtor, including name, address and taxpayer identification number; the amount, status and history of the claim; and the agency or program under which the claim arose. Reasonable action will be taken to locate an individual for whom a current address is not available. (ix) Use and disclosure of mailing addresses. In attempting to locate a debtor in the collection of a debt under this section, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may send a written request to the Secretary of the Treasury, or a designee, for current address information from records of the Internal Revenue Service. These requests will comply with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6103(p)(4) and applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service. Disclosure of a mailing address so obtained may be made pursuant to 4 CFR 102.18(b) and 31 U.S.C. 3711. (g) Compromise, waiver, suspension or termination of collection actions arising under the Federal Claims Collection Act. (1) Basic considerations. Federal claims against the debtor and in favor of the United States arising out of the administration of the CHAMPUS may be compromised or collection action [[Page 241]] taken thereon may be suspended or terminated in compliance with the Federal Claims Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711(a)(2) as implemented by the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 CFR parts 101 through 105. (2) Authority. CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries are not authorized to compromise or to suspend or terminate collection action on federal CHAMPUS claims. Only the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, and Uniformed Service claims officers acting under the provisions of their own regulations, are so authorized. (3) Waiver of collection of erroneous payments due from certain persons unaware of loss of CHAMPUS eligibility. (i) The Director, OCHAMPUS may waive collection of payments otherwise due from certain persons as a result of health benefits received under this part after the termination of the person's eligibility for such benefits. Waiver may be granted if collection of such payments would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interest of the United States. These criteria are met by a finding that there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the person who received the erroneous payment or any other person having an interest in obtaining such waiver. (ii) Persons eligible for waiver. The following persons are eligible for waiver: (A) A person who: (1) Is entitled to Medicare Part A by reason of disability or end stage renal disease; (2) In the absence of such entitlement, would have been eligible for CHAMPUS under 10 U.S.C. 1086; and (3) At the time of the receipt of such benefits, was under age 65. (B) Any participating provider of care who received direct payment for care provided to a person described in paragraph (g)(ii)(A) of this section pursuant to an assignment of benefits from such person. (iii) The authority to waive collection of payments under this section shall apply with regard to health benefits provided during the period beginning January 1, 1967, and ending on the later of: the termination date of any special enrollment period for Medicare Part B provided specifically for such persons; or July 1, 1996. (4) Basis for compromise. A claim may be compromised hereunder if the government cannot collect the full amount if: (i) The debtor or the estate of a debtor does not have the present or prospective ability to pay the full amount within a reasonable time; (ii) The debtor refuses to pay the claim in full and the government is unable to enforce collection of the full amount within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings; (iii) There is real doubt concerning the government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed either because of the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the facts; or (iv) The cost of collecting the claim does not justify enforced collection of the full amount. (5) Basis for suspension. Collection action may be suspended for either of the following reasons if future collection action may be sufficiently productive to justify periodic review and action on the claim giving consideration to its size and the amount which may be realized thereon: (i) The debtor cannot be located; or (ii) The debtor is unable to make payments on the government's claim or effect a compromise at the time, but the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review and action and: (A) The applicable statute of limitations has been tolled or started running anew; or (B) Future collection action can be effected by offset, notwithstanding the statute of limitations with due regard to the 10- year limitation prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(1); or (C) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on which collection action will be temporarily suspended, and such temporary suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to fully pay the principal amount of the debt with interest at a later date. (iii) Consideration may be given by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to suspend collection action [[Page 242]] pending action on a request for a review of the government's claim against the debtor or pending an administrative review under Sec. 199.10 of this part of any CHAMPUS claim or claims directly involved in the government's claim against the debtor. Suspension under this paragraph will be based upon appropriate consideration, on a case-by- case basis as to whether: (A) There is a reasonable possibility that the debt (in whole or in part) will be found not owing from the debtor; (B) The Government's interest would be protected if suspension were granted by reasonable assurance that the debt would be recovered if the debtor does not prevail; and (C) Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship. (6) Basis for termination. Collection action may be terminated for one or more of the following reasons: (i) The United States cannot collect or enforce collection of any significant sum from the debtor having due regard to the judicial remedies available to the government, the debtor's future financial prospects and the exemptions available to the debtor under state and federal law; (ii) The debtor cannot be located, and either: (A) There is no security remaining to be liquidated, or (B) The applicable statute of limitations has run and the prospects of collecting by offset, notwithstanding the bar of the statute of limitations, are too remote to justify retention of the claim; (iii) The cost of further collection action is likely to exceed any recovery; (iv) It is determined that the claim is legally without merit; or (v) Evidence necessary to prove the claim cannot be produced or the necessary witnesses are unavailable and efforts to induce voluntary payment are unavailing. (7) Factors considered. In determining whether a claim will be compromised, or collection action terminated or suspended, the responsible CHAMPUS collection authority will consider the following factors: (i) Age and health of the debtor, present and potential income, inheritance prospects, possible concealment or improper transfer of assets and the availability of assets or income which may be realized upon by enforced collection proceedings; (ii) Applicability of exemptions available to a debtor under state or federal law; (iii) Uncertainty as to the price which collateral or other property may bring at forced sale; or (iv) The probability of proving the claim in court, the probability of full or partial recovery, the availability of necessary evidence and related pragmatic considerations. (8) Amount of compromise. The amount acceptable in compromise will be reasonable in relation to the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection proceedings. Consideration shall be given to the following: (i) The exemptions available to the debtor under state and federal law; (ii) The time necessary to collect the debt; (iii) The litigative probabilities involved; and (iv) The administrative and litigative costs of collection where the cost of collecting the claim is a basis for compromise. (9) Payment of compromised claims. (i) Time and manner. Compromised claims are to be paid in one lump sum if possible. However, if payment of a compromise is necessary, a legally enforceable compromise agreement must be obtained. Payment of the amount that CHAMPUS has agreed to accept as a compromise in full settlement of a CHAMPUS claim must be made within the time and in the manner prescribed in the compromise agreement. Any such compromised claim is not settled until the full payment of the compromised amount has been made within the time and the manner prescribed. Compromise agreements must provide for the reinstatement of the prior indebtedness, less sums paid thereon, and acceleration of the balance due upon default in the payment of any installment. (ii) Failure to pay the compromised amount. Failure of any debtor to make payment as provided in the compromise agreement will have the effect of reinstating the full amount of the [[Page 243]] original claim, less any amounts paid prior to the default. (10) Effect of compromise, waiver, suspension or termination of collection action. Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6041, compromises and terminations of undisputed debts not discharged in a Title 11 bankruptcy case and totaling $600 or more for the year will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service in the manner prescribed for inclusion in the debtor's gross income for that year. Any action taken under paragraph (g) of this section regarding the compromise of a federal claim, or waiver or suspension or termination of collection action on a federal claim is not an initial determination for purposes of the appeal procedures Sec. 199.10. (h) Referrals for collection. (1) Prompt referral. Federal claims of $600 or more on which collection action has been taken in accordance with the provisions of this section and which cannot be collected or compromised or on which collection action cannot be suspended or terminated, as provided herein, will be promptly referred by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to the Department of Justice for litigation in accordance with 4 CFR part 105. Such referrals will be made as early as possible consistent with aggressive collection action by CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries and OCHAMPUS and well within the period for bringing a timely suit against the debtor. Ordinarily referrals will be made within one year of the OCHAMPUS final determination of the fact and the amount of the debt. (2) Report of prior collection actions. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will prepare a Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR) for each case referred for collection under the provisions of this section. The CCLR shall also be used when a claim is referred to the Department of Justice in order to obtain approval of that Department with respect to compromise, suspension, or termination when such approval is required by 4 CFR 103.1(b) and 104.1(b). The CCLR will include, as a minimum, the following: (i) A checklist or brief summary of the actions previously taken to collect or compromise the claim. If any of the required administrative collection actions have been omitted, the reason for its omission must be provided. (ii) The current address or the debtor, or the same and address of the agent for a corporation upon whom service may be made. Reasonable and appropriate steps will be taken to locate missing parties in all cases. Referrals to the Department of Justice for the institution of foreclosure or other proceedings, in which the current address of any party is unknown, will be accompanied by a listing of the prior known addresses of such party and a statement of the steps taken to locate that party. (iii) Reasonably current credit data indicating that there is a reasonable prospect of effecting enforced collection from the debtor, having due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under state and federal law and the judicial remedies available to the government. Such credit data may take the form of a commercial credit report; an agency investigative report showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses; the individual debtor's own financial statement executed under penalty of perjury reflecting the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses; or an audited balance sheet of a corporate debtor. Such credit data may be omitted if a surety bond is available in an amount sufficient to satisfy the claim in full; the forced sale value of any security available for application to the government's claim is sufficient to satisfy the claim in full; the debtor is in bankruptcy or receivership; the debtor's liability to the government is fully covered by insurance, in which case such information as can be developed concerning the identity and address of the insurer and the type and amount of insurance coverage will be furnished; or the nature of the debtor is such that credit data is not normally available or cannot reasonably be obtained, for example, a unit of state or local government. (3) Preservation of evidence. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will take such action as is necessary to ensure that all files, records and exhibits on claims referred hereunder are properly preserved. [[Page 244]] (i) Claims Involving Indications of Fraud, Filing of False Claims or Misrepresentation. Any case in which there is an indication of fraud, filing of false claims or misrepresentation will be promptly referred to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for processing. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will investigate and evaluate the case and either refer the case to the appropriate investigative law enforcement agency or return the claim for other appropriate administrative action, including collection action under this section. Payment on all CHAMPUS beneficiary or provider claims in which fraud, filing false claims or misrepresentation is suspected will be suspended until payment or denial of the claim is authorized by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. Collection action on all federal claims in which a suspicion of fraud, misrepresentation or filing false claims arises will be suspended pending referral to the appropriate law enforcement agencies by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. Only the Department of Justice has authority to compromise or terminate collection action on such claims. [51 FR 24008, July 1, 1986, as amended at 62 FR 35097, June 30, 1997; 63 FR 27678, May 20, 1998] Sec. 199.12 Third party recoveries. (a) General. This section deals with the right of the United States to recover from third-parties the costs of medical care furnished to or paid on behalf of TRICARE beneficiaries. These third-parties may be individuals or entities that are liable for tort damages to the injured TRICARE beneficiary or a liability insurance carrier covering the individual or entity. These third-parties may also include other entities who are primarily responsible to pay for the medical care provided to the injured beneficiary by reason of an insurance policy, workers' compensation program or other source of primary payment. Authority. (1) Third-party payers. This part implements the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1095b which, in general, allow the Secretary of Defense to authorize certain TRICARE claims to be paid, even though a third-party payer may be primary payer, with authority to collect from the third-party payer the TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of the beneficiary. (See Sec. 199.2 for definition of ``third-party payer.'') Therefore, 10 U.S.C. 1095b establishes the statutory obligation of third-party payers to reimburse the United States the costs incurred on behalf of TRICARE beneficiaries who are also covered by the third-party payer's plan. (2) Federal Medical Care Recovery Act. (i) In general. In many cases covered by this section, the United States has a right to collect under both 10 U.S.C. 1095b and the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (FMCRA), Public Law 87-693 (42 U.S.C. 2651 et. seq.). In such cases, the authority is concurrent and the United States may pursue collection under both statutory authorities. (ii) Cases involving tort liability. In cases in which the right of the United States to collect from an automobile liability insurance carrier is premised on establishing some tort liability on some third person, matters regarding the determination of such tort liability shall be governed by the same substantive standards as would be applied under the FMCRA including reliance on state law for determinations regarding tort liability. In addition, the provisions of 28 CFR part 43 (Department of Justice regulations pertaining to the FMCRA) shall apply to claims made under the concurrent authority of the FMCRA and 10 U.S.C. 1095b. All other matters and procedures concerning the right of the United States to collect shall, if a claim is made under the concurrent authority of the FMCRA and this section, be governed by 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this part. (c) Appealability. This section describes the procedures to be followed in the assertion and collection of third-party recovery claims in favor of the United States arising from the operation of TRICARE. Actions taken under this section are not initial determinations for the purpose of the appeal procedures of Sec. 199.10 of this part. However, the proper exercise of the right to appeal benefit or provider status determinations under the procedures set forth in Sec. 199.10 may affect the processing of federal claims arising under this section. Those appeal procedures [[Page 245]] afford a TRICARE beneficiary or participating provider an opportunity for administrative appellate review in cases in which benefits have been denied and in which there is a significant factual dispute. For example, a TRICARE contractor may deny payment for services that are determined to be excluded as TRICARE benefits because they are found to be not medically necessary. In that event the TRICARE contractor will offer an administrative appeal as provided in Sec. 199.10 of this part on the medical necessity issue raised by the adverse benefit determination. If the care in question results from an accidental injury and if the appeal results in a reversal of the initial determination to deny the benefit, a third-party recovery claim may arise as a result of the appeal decision to pay the benefit. However, in no case is the decision to initiate such a claim itself appealable under Sec. 199.10. (d) Statutory obligation of third-party payer to pay. (1) Basic Rule. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095b, when the Secretary of Defense authorizes certain TRICARE claims to be paid, even though a third-party payer may be primary payer (as specified under Sec. 199.8(c)(2)), the right to collect from a third-party payer the TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of the beneficiary is the same as exists for the United States to collect from third-party payers the cost of care provided by a facility of the uniformed services under 10 U.S.C. 1095 and part 220 of this title. Therefore the obligation of a third-party payer to pay is to the same extent that the beneficiary would be eligible to receive reimbursement or indemnification from the third-party payer if the beneficiary were to incur the costs on the beneficiary's own behalf. (2) Application of cost shares. If the third-party payer's plan includes a requirement for a deductible or copayment by the beneficiary of the plan, then the amount the United States may collect from the third-party payer is the cost of care incurred on behalf of the beneficiary less the appropriate deductible or copayment amount. (3) Claim from the United States exclusive. The only way for a third-party payer to satisfy its obligation under 10 U.S.C. 1095b is to pay the United States or authorized representative of the United States. Payment by a third-party payer to the beneficiary does not satisfy 10 U.S.C. 1095b. (4) Assignment of benefits not necessary. The obligation of the third-party to pay is not dependent upon the beneficiary executing an assignment of benefits to the United States. (e) Exclusions impermissible. (1) Statutory requirement. With the same right to collect from third-party payers as exists under 10 U.S.C. 1095(b), no provision of any third-party payer's plan having the effect of excluding from coverage or limiting payment for certain care if that care is provided or paid by the United States shall operate to prevent collection by the United States. (2) Regulatory application. No provision of any third-party payer's plan or program purporting to have the effect of excluding or limiting payment for certain care that would not be given such effect under the standards established in part 220 of this title to implement 10 U.S.C. 1095 shall operate to exclude or limit payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095b or this section. (f) Records available. When requested, TRICARE contractors or other representatives of the United States shall make available to representatives of any third-party payer from which the United States seeks payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095b, for inspection and review, appropriate health care records (or copies of such records) of individuals for whose care payment is sought. Appropriate records which will be made available are records which document that the TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of beneficiaries which are the subject of the claims for payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095b were incurred as claimed and the health care service were provided in a manner consistent with permissible terms and conditions of the third-party payer's plan. This is the sole purpose for which patient care records will be made available. Records not needed for this purpose will not be made available. (g) Remedies. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095b, when the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, authorizes certain TRICARE claims to [[Page 246]] be paid, even though a third-party payer may be primary payer, the right to collect from a third-party payer the TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of the beneficiary is the same as exists for the United States to collect from third-party payers the cost of care provided by a facility of the uniformed services under 10 U.S.C. 1095. (1) This includes the authority under 10 U.S.C. 1095(e)(1) for the United States to institute and prosecute legal proceedings against a third-party payer to enforce a right of the United States under 10 u.S.C. 1095b and this section. (2) This also includes the authority under 10 u.S.C. 1095(e)(2) for an authorized representative of the United States to compromise, settle or waive a claim of the United States under 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this section. (3) The authorities provided by the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3701 et. seq.) and any implementing regulations (including Sec. 199.11) regarding collection of indebtedness due the United States shall also be available to effect collections pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this section. (h) Obligations of beneficiaries. To insure the expeditious and efficient processing of third-party payer claims, any person furnished care and treatment under TRICARE, his or her guardian, personal representative, counsel, estate, dependents or survivors shall be required: (1) To provide information regarding coverage by a third-party payer plan and/or the circumstances surrounding an injury to the patient as a conditional precedent of the processing of a TRICARE claim involving possible third-party payer coverage. (2) To furnish such additional information as may be requested concerning the circumstances giving rise to the injury or disease for which care and treatment are being given and concerning any action instituted or to be instituted by or against a third person; and, (3) To cooperate in the prosecution of all claims and actions by the United States against such third person. (i) Reponsibility for recovery. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, is responsible for insuring that TRICARE claims arising under 10 U.S.C. 1095b and this section (including claims involving the FMCRA) are properly referred to and coordinated with designated claims authorities of the uniformed services who shall assert and recover TRICARE costs incurred on behalf of beneficiaries. Generally, claims arising under this section will be processed as follows: (1) Identification and referral. In most cases where civilian providers provide medical care and payment for such care has been by a TRICARE contractor, initial identification of potential third-party payers will be by the TRICARE contractor. In such cases, the TRICARE contractor is responsible for conducting a preliminary investigation and referring the case to designated appropriate claims authorities of the Uniformed Services. (2) Processing TRICARE claims. When the TRICARE contractor initially identifies a claim as involving a potential third-party payer, it shall request additional information concerning the circumstances of the injury or disease and/or the identify of any potential third-party payer from the beneficiary or other responsible party unless adequate information is submitted with the claim. The TRICARE claim will be suspended and no payment issued pending receipt of the requested information. If the requested information is not received, the claim will be denied. A TRICARE beneficiary may expedite the processing of his or her TRICARE claim by submitting appropriate information with the first claim for treatment of an accidental injury. Third-party payer information normally is required only once concerning any single accidental injury on episode of care. Once the third-party payer information pertaining to a single incident or episode of care is received, subsequent claims associated with the same incident or episode of care may be processed to payment in the usual manner. If, however, the requested third-party payer information is not received, subsequent claims involving the same incident or episode of care will be suspended or denied as stated above. [[Page 247]] (3) Ascertaining total potential liability. It is essential that the appropriate claims responsible for asserting the claim against the third-party payer recive from the TRICARE contractor a report of all amounts expended by the United States for care resulting from the incident upon which potential liability in the third party is based (including amounts paid by TRICARE for both inpatient and outpatient care). Prior to assertion and final settlement of a claim, it will be necessary for the responsible claims authority to secure from the TRICARE contractor updated information to insure that all amounts expended under TRICARE are included in the government's claim. It is equally important that information on future medical payments be obtained through the investigative process and included as a part of the government's claim. No TRICARE-related claim will be settled, compromised or waived without full consideration being given to the possible future medical payment aspects of the individual case. (j) Reporting requirements. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1079a, all refunds and other amounts collected in the administration of TRICARE shall be credited to the appropriation available for that program for the fiscal year in which the refund or amount is collected. Therefore, the Department of Defense requires an annual report stating the number and dollar amount of claims asserted against, and the number and dollar amount of recoveries from third-party payers (including FMCRA recoveries) arising from the operation of the TRICARE. To facilitate the preparation of this report and to maintain program integrity, the following reporting requirements are established: (1) TRICARE contractors. Each TRICARE contractor shall submit on or before January 31 of each year an annual report to the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, covering the 12 months of the previous calendar year. This report shall contain, as a minimum, the number and total dollar of cases of potential third-party payer/FMCRA liability referred to uniformed services claims authorities for further investigation and collection. These figures are to be itemized by the states and uniformed services to which the cases are referred. (2) Uniformed Services. Each uniformed service will submit to the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee, an annual report covering the 12 calendar months of the previous year, setting forth, as a minimum, the number and total dollar amount of cases involving TRICARE payments received from TRICARE contractors, the number and dollar amount of cases involving TRICARE payments received from other sources, and the number and dollar amount of claims actually asserted against, and the dollar amount of recoveries from, third-payment payers or under the FMCRA. The report, itemized by state and foreign claims jurisdictions, shall be provided no later than February 28 of each year. (3) Implementation of the reporting requirements. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee shall issue guidance for implementation of the reporting requirements prescribed by this section. [68 FR 6619, Feb. 10, 2003] Sec. 199.13 TRICARE Dental Program. (a) General provisions--(1) Purpose. This section prescribes guidelines and policies for the delivery and administration of the TRICARE Dental Program (TDP) of the Uniformed Services of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Corps. The TDP is a premium based indemnity dental insurance coverage plan that is available to specified categories of individuals who are qualified for these benefits by virtue of their relationship to one of the seven (7) Uniformed Services and their voluntary decision to accept enrollment in the plan and cost share (when applicable) with the Government in the premium cost of the benefits. The TDP is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1076a, TRICARE dental program, and this section was previously titled the ``Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan''. The TDP incorporates the former 10 U.S.C. 1076b, Selected Reserve dental insurance, and the section [[Page 248]] previously titled the ``TRICARE Selected Reserve Dental Program'', Sec. 199.21. (2) Applicability.--(i) Geographic scope. (A) The TDP is applicable geographically within the fifty (50) States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These areas are collectively referred to as the ``CONUS (or Continental United States) service area''. (B) Extension of the TDP to areas outside the CONUS service area. In accordance with the authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 1076a(h), the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)) may extend the TDP to areas other than those areas specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section for the eligible members and eligible dependents of members of the Uniformed Services. These areas are collectively referred to as the ``OCONUS (or outside the Continental United States) service area''. In extending the TDP outside the CONUS service area, the ASD(HA), or designee, is authorized to establish program elements, methods of administration and payment rates and procedures to providers that are different from those in effect for the CONUS service area to the extent the ASD(HA), or designee, determines necessary for the effective and efficient operation of the TDP. This includes provisions for preauthorization of care if the needed services are not available in a Uniformed Service overseas dental treatment facility and payment by the Department of certain cost-shares (or co-payments) and other portions of a provider's billed charges for certain beneficiary categories. Other differences may occur based on limitations in the availability and capabilities of the Uniformed Service overseas dental treatment facility and a particular nation's civilian sector providers in certain areas. These differences include varying licensure and certification requirements of OCONUS providers, Uniformed Service provider selection criteria and local results of provider selection, referral, beneficiary pre-authorization and marketing procedures, and care for beneficiaries residing in distant areas. The Director, Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) shall issue guidance, as necessary, to implement the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B). Beneficiaries will be eligible for the same TDP benefits in the OCONUS service area although services may not be available or accessible in all OCONUS countries. (ii) Agency. The provisions of this section apply throughout the Department of Defense (DoD), the United States Coast Guard, the USPHS and NOAA. (iii) Exclusion of benefit services performed in military dental care facilities. Except for emergency treatment, dental care provided outside the United States, and services incidental to noncovered services, dependents of active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve members enrolled in the TDP may not obtain those services that are benefits of the TDP in military dental care facilities, as long as those covered benefits are available for cost-sharing under the TDP. Enrolled dependents of active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve members may continue to obtain noncovered services from military dental care facilities subject to the provisions for space available care. (3) Authority and responsibility.--(i) Legislative authority.--(A) Joint regulations. 10 U.S.C. 1076a authorized the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Secretary of Transportation, to prescribe regulations for the administration of the TDP. (B) Administration. 10 U.S.C. 1073 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to administer the TDP for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps under DoD jurisdiction, the Secretary of Transportation to administer the TDP for the Coast Guard, when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to administer the TDP for the Commissioned Corps of the USPHS and the NOAA Corps. (ii) Organizational delegations and assignments--(A) Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD(HA)). The Secretary of Defense, by 32 CFR part 367, delegated authority to the ASD(HA) to provide policy guidance, [[Page 249]] management control, and coordination as required for all DoD health and medical resources and functional areas including health benefit programs. Implementing authority is contained in 32 CFR part 367. For additional implementing authority see Sec. 199.1. Any guidelines or policy necessary for implementation of this Sec. 199.13 shall be issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS. (B) Evidence of eligibility. DoD, through the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), is responsible for establishing and maintaining a listing of persons eligible to receive benefits under the TDP. (4) Preemption of State and local laws. (i) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103 and section 8025 (fourth proviso) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1994, DoD has determined that, in the administration of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including, but not limited to, the assurance of uniform national health programs for Uniformed Service beneficiaries and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to DoD, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States. This determination is applicable to the dental services contracts that implement this section. (ii) Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, any State or local law relating to health or dental insurance, prepaid health or dental plans, or other health or dental care delivery or financing methods is preempted and does not apply in connection with the TDP contract. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without any force or effect, and State or local governments have no legal authority to enforce them in relation to the TDP contract. (However, DoD may, by contract, establish legal obligations on the part of the dental plan contractor to conform with requirements similar or identical to requirements of State or local laws or regulations.) (iii) The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of the statutes identified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees, or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD health and dental services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f). (5) Plan funds--(i) Funding sources. The funds used by the TDP are appropriated funds furnished by the Congress through the annual appropriation acts for DoD, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Transportation and funds collected by the Uniformed Services or contractor through payroll deductions or through direct billing as premium shares from beneficiaries. (ii) Disposition of funds. TDP funds are paid by the Government (or in the case of direct billing, by the beneficiary) as premiums to an insurer, service, or prepaid dental care organization under a contract negotiated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, under the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR chapter 1). (iii) Plan. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee provides an insurance policy, service plan, or prepaid contract of benefits in accordance with those prescribed by law and regulation; as interpreted and adjudicated in accord with the policy, service plan, or contract and a dental benefits brochure; and as prescribed by requirements of the dental plan contractor's contract with the Government. [[Page 250]] (iv) Contracting out. The method of delivery of the TDP is through a competitively procured contract. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, is responsible for negotiating, under provisions of the FAR, a contract for dental benefits insurance or prepayment that includes responsibility for: (A) Development, publication, and enforcement of benefit policy, exclusions, and limitations in compliance with the law, regulation, and the contract provisions; (B) Adjudicating and processing claims; and conducting related supporting activities, such as enrollment, disenrollment, collection of premiums, eligibility verification, provider relations, and beneficiary communications. (6) Role of Health Benefits Advisor (HBA). The HBA is appointed (generally by the commander of an Uniformed Services medical treatment facility) to serve as an advisor to patients and staff in matters involving the TDP. The HBA may assist beneficiaries in applying for benefits, in the preparation of claims, and in their relations with OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractor. However, the HBA is not responsible for the TDP's policies and procedures and has no authority to make benefit determinations or obligate the TDP's funds. Advice given to beneficiaries by HBAs as to determination of benefits or level of payment is not binding on OCHAMPUS or the dental plan contractor. (7) Right to information. As a condition precedent to the provision of benefits hereunder, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, shall be entitled to receive information from an authorized provider or other person, institution, or organization (including a local, State, or United States Government agency) providing services or supplies to the beneficiary for which claims for benefits are submitted. While establishing enrollment and eligibility, benefits, and benefit utilization and performance reporting information standards, the Government has established and does maintain a system of records for dental information under the TDP. By contract, the Government audits the adequacy and accuracy of the dental plan contractor's system of records and requires access to information and records to meet plan accountabilities, to assist in contractor surveillance and program integrity investigations and to audit OCONUS financial transactions where the Department has a financial stake. Such information and records may relate to attendance, testing, monitoring, examination, or diagnosis of dental disease or conditions; or treatment rendered; or services and supplies furnished to a beneficiary; and shall be necessary for the accurate and efficient administration and payment of benefits under this plan. To assist in claims adjudication, grievance and fraud investigations, and the appeals process, and before an interim or final determination can be made on a claim of benefits, a beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or individual Ready Reserve member must provide particular additional information relevant to the requested determination, when necessary. Failure to provide the requested information may result in denial of the claim and inability to effectively investigate the grievance or fraud or process the appeal. The recipient of such information shall in every case hold such records confidential except when: (i) Disclosure of such information is necessary to the determination by a provider or the dental plan contractor of beneficiary enrollment or eligibility for coverage of specific services; (ii) Disclosure of such information is authorized specifically by the beneficiary; (iii) Disclosure is necessary to permit authorized Government officials to investigate and prosecute criminal actions; (iv) Disclosure constitutes a routine use of a routine use of a record which is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected. This includes a standard and acceptable business practice commonly used among dental insurers which is consistent with the principle of preserving confidentiality of personal information and detailed clinical data. For example, the release of utilization information for the purpose of determining eligibility for certain services, such as the number of dental prophylaxis procedures performed for a beneficiary, is authorized; [[Page 251]] (v) Disclosure is pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (vi) Disclosure by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, is for the purpose of determining the applicability of, and implementing the provisions of, other dental benefits coverage or entitlement. (8) Utilization review and quality assurance. Claims submitted for benefits under the TDP are subject to review by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, for quality of care and appropriate utilization. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, is responsible for appropriate utilization review and quality assurance standards, norms, and criteria consistent with the level of benefits. (b) Definitions. For most definitions applicable to the provisions of this section, refer to Sec. 199.2. The following definitions apply only to this section: (1) Assignment of benefits. Acceptance by a nonparticipating provider of payment directly from the insurer while reserving the right to charge the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for any remaining amount of the fees for services which exceeds the prevailing fee allowance of the insurer. (2) Authorized provider. A dentist, dental hygienist, or certified and licensed anesthetist specifically authorized to provide benefits under the TDP in paragraph (f) of this section. (3) Beneficiary. A dependent of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, or a member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, who has been enrolled in the TDP, and has been determined to be eligible for benefits, as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. (4) Beneficiary liability. The legal obligation of a beneficiary, his or her estate, or responsible family member to pay for the costs of dental care or treatment received. Specifically, for the purposes of services and supplies covered by the TDP, beneficiary liability includes cost-sharing amounts or any amount above the prevailing fee determination by the insurer where the provider selected by the beneficiary is not a participating provider or a provider within an approved alternative delivery system. In cases where a nonparticipating provider does not accept assignment of benefits, beneficiaries may have to pay the nonparticipating provider in full at the time of treatment and seek reimbursement directly from the insurer for all or a portion of the nonparticipating provider's fee. Beneficiary liability also includes any expenses for services and supplies not covered by the TDP, less any available discount provided as a part of the insurer's agreement with an approved alternative delivery system. (5) By report. Dental procedures which are authorized as benefits only in unusual circumstances requiring justification of exceptional conditions related to otherwise authorized procedures. These services are further defined in paragraph (e) of this section. (6) Contingency operation. Defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13) as a military operation designated as a contingency operation by the Secretary of Defense or a military operation that results in the exercise of authorities for ordering Reserve Component members to active duty without their consent and is therefore automatically a contingency operation. (7) Cost-share. The amount of money for which the beneficiary (or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member) is responsible in connection with otherwise covered dental services (other than disallowed amounts) as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. A cost-share may also be referred to as a ``co-payment.'' (8) Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). The automated system that is composed of two (2) phases: (i) Enrolling all active duty, Reserve and retired service members, their dependents, and the dependents of deceased service members; and (ii) Verifying their eligibility for health care benefits in the direct care facilities and through the TDP. (9) Dental hygienist. Practitioner in rendering complete oral prophylaxis services, applying medication, performing dental radiography, and providing dental education services with a certificate, associate degree, or bachelor's degree in the field, and licensed by an appropriate authority. [[Page 252]] (10) Dentist. Doctor of Dental Medicine (D.M.D.) or Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.) who is licensed to practice dentistry by an appropriate authority. (11) Diagnostic services. Category of dental services including: (i) Clinical oral examinations; (ii) Radiographic examinations; and (iii) Diagnostic laboratory tests and examinations provided in connection with other dental procedures authorized as benefits of the TDP and further defined in paragraph (e) of the section. (12) Endodontics. The etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and injuries affecting the dental pulp, tooth root, and periapical tissue as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section. (13) Initial determination. A formal written decision on a TDP claim, a request for TDP benefit pre-determination, a request by a provider for approval as an authorized provider, or a decision suspending, excluding or terminating a provider as an authorized provider under the TDP. Rejection of a claim or pre-determination, or of a request for benefit or provider authorization for failure to comply with administrative requirements, including failure to submit reasonably requested information, is not an initial determination. Responses to general or specific inquiries regarding TDP benefits are not initial determinations. (14) Nonparticipating provider. A dentist or dental hygienist that furnished dental services to a TDP beneficiary, but who has not agreed to participate or to accept the insurer's fee allowances and applicable cost-share as the total charge for the services. A nonparticipating provider looks to the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for final responsibility for payment of his or her charge, but may accept payment (assignment of benefits) directly from the insurer or assist the beneficiary in filing the claim for reimbursement by the dental plan contractor. Where the nonparticipating provider does not accept payment directly from the insurer, the insurer pays the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, not the provider. (15) Oral and maxillofacial surgery. Surgical procedures performed in the oral cavity as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section. (16) Orthodontics. The supervision, guidance, and correction of the growing or mature dentofacial structures, including those conditions that require movement of teeth or correction of malrelationships and malformations of their related structures and adjustment of relationships between and among teeth and facial bones by the application of forces and/or the stimulation and redirection of functional forces within the craniofacial complex as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section. (17) Participating provider. A dentist or dental hygienist who has agreed to accept the insurer's reasonable fee allowances or other fee arrangements as the total charge (even though less than the actual billed amount), including provision for payment to the provider by the beneficiary (or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member) or any cost-share for covered services. (18) Party to the initial determination. Includes the TDP, a beneficiary of the TDP and a participating provider of services whose interests have been adjudicated by the initial determination. In addition, provider who has been denied approval as an authorized TDP provider is a party to the initial determination, as is a provider who is suspended, excluded or terminated as an authorized provider, unless the provider is excluded or suspended by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or a local licensing authority. (19) Periodontics. The examination, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases affecting the supporting structures of the teeth as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section. (20) Preventive services. Traditional prophylaxis including scaling deposits from teeth, polishing teeth, and topical application of fluoride to teeth as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section. [[Page 253]] (21) Prosthodontics. The diagnosis, planning, making, insertion, adjustment, refinement, and repair of artificial devices intended for the replacement of missing teeth and associated tissues as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section. (22) Provider. A dentist, dental hygienist, or certified and licensed anesthetist as specified in paragraph (f) of this section. This term, when used in relation to OCONUS service area providers, may include other recognized professions authorized to furnish care under laws of that particular country. (23) Restorative services. Restoration of teeth including those procedures commonly described as amalgam restorations, resin restorations, pin retention, and stainless steel crowns for primary teeth as further defined in paragraph (e) of this section. (24) Sealants. A material designed for application on specified teeth to seal the surface irregularities to prevent ingress of oral fluids, food, and debris in order to prevent tooth decay. (c) Eligibility and enrollment--(1) General. 10 U.S.C. 1076a, 1072(2)(A), (D), or (I), 1072(6), 10143 and 10144 set forth those persons who are eligible for voluntary enrollment in the TDP. A determination that a person is eligible for voluntary enrollment does not automatically entitle that person to benefit payments. The person must be enrolled in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section and meet any additional eligibility requirements in this part in order for dental benefits to be extended. (2) Eligibility--(i) Persons eligible. Eligibility for the TDP is continuous in situations where the sponsor or member changes status between any of these eligible categories and there is no break in service or transfer to a non-eligible status. (A) A person who bears one of the following relationships to an active duty member (under a call or order that does not specify a period of thirty (30) days or less) or a member of the Selected Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10143) or Individual Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10144): (1) Spouse. A lawful husband or wife, regardless of whether or not dependent upon the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member. (2) Child. To be eligible, the child must be unmarried and meet the requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(iv)(A) and 199.3(b)(2)(iv)(C). (B) A member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10143). (C) A member of the Individual Ready Reserve of the Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10144(b)) who is subject to being ordered to active duty involuntarily in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 12304. (D) All other members of the Individual Ready Reserve of the Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10144(a)). (ii) Determination of eligibility status and evidence of eligibility--(A) Eligibility determination responsibility of the Uniformed Services. Determination of a person's eligibility for the TDP is the responsibility of the member's Uniformed Service. For the purpose of program integrity, the appropriate Uniformed Service shall, upon request of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, review the eligibility of a specified person when there is reason to question the eligibility status. In such cases, a report on the result of the review and any action taken will be submitted to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee. (B) Procedures for determination of eligibility. Uniformed Service identification cards do not distinguish eligibility for the TDP. Procedures for the determination of eligibility are identified in Sec. 199.3(f)(2), except that Uniformed Service identification cards do not provide evidence of eligibility for the TDP. Although OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractor must make determinations concerning a member or dependent's eligibility in order to ensure proper enrollment and proper disbursement of appropriated funds, ultimate responsibility for resolving a member or dependent's eligibility rests with the Uniformed Services. (C) Evidence of eligibility required. Eligibility and enrollment in the TDP will be verified through the DEERS. Eligibility and enrollment information established and maintained in the [[Page 254]] DEERS file is the only acceptable evidence of TDP eligibility and enrollment. It is the responsibility of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member or TDP beneficiary, parent, or legal representative, when appropriate, to provide adequate evidence for entry into the DEERS file to establish eligibility for the TDP, and to ensure that all changes in status that may affect eligibility are reported immediately to the appropriate Uniformed Service for action. Ineligibility for benefits is presumed in the absence of prescribed eligibility evidence in the DEERS file. (3) Enrollment--(i) Previous plans--(A) Basic Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan. The Basic Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan was effective from August 1, 1987, up to the date of implementation of the Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan. The Basic Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan terminated upon implementation of the expanded plan. (B) Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan. The Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan (also known as the TRICARE Family Member Dental Plan) was effective from August 1, 1993, up to the date of implementation of the TDP. The Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan terminates upon implementation of the TDP. (ii) TRICARE Dental Program (TDP)--(A) Election of coverage. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A)(2) of this section, active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve service members may voluntarily elect to enroll their eligible dependents and members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve may voluntarily elect to enroll themselves following implementation of the TDP. In order to obtain TDP coverage, written or telephonic election by the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member must be made and will be accomplished by submission or telephonic completion of an application to the dental plan contractor. This election can also be accomplished via electronic means. (2) Eligible dependents of active duty members enrolled in the Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan at the time of implementation of the TDP will automatically be enrolled in the TDP. Eligible members of the Selected Reserve enrolled in the TRICARE Selected Reserve Dental Program at the time of implementation of the TDP will automatically be enrolled in the TDP. No election to enroll in the TDP will be required by the active duty or Selected Reserve member. (B) Premiums--(1) Enrollment will be by either single or family premium as defined as follows: (i) Single premium. One (1) covered eligible dependent or one (1) covered eligible Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member. (ii) Family premium. Two (2) or more covered eligible dependents. Under the family premium, all eligible dependents of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member are enrolled. (2) Exceptions. (i) An active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may elect to enroll only those eligible dependents residing in one (1) location when the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member has eligible dependents residing in two or more geographically separate locations (e.g., children living with a divorced spouse; a child attending college). (ii) Instances where a dependent of an active duty member requires a hospital or special treatment environment (due to a medical, physical handicap, or mental condition) for dental care otherwise covered by the TDP, the dependent may be excluded from TDP enrollment and may continue to receive care from a military treatment facility. (iii) A member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve may enroll separately from his or her eligible dependents. A member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve does not have to be enrolled in order for his or her eligible dependents to enroll under the TDP. (C) Enrollment period--(1) General. Enrollment of eligible dependents or members is for a period of one (1) year [[Page 255]] followed by month-to-month enrollment as long as the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member chooses to continue enrollment. Active duty members may enroll their eligible dependents and eligible members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve may enroll themselves or their eligible dependents in the TDP provided there is an intent to remain on active duty or as a member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve (or any combination thereof without a break in service or transfer to a non-eligible status) for a period of not less than one (1) year by the service member and their parent Uniformed Service. Beneficiaries enrolled in the TDP must remain enrolled for a minimum period of one (1) year unless one of the conditions for disenrollment specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section is met. (2) Special enrollment period for Reserve component members ordered to active duty in support of contingency operations. The mandatory twelve (12) month enrollment period does not apply to Reserve component members ordered to active duty (other than for training) in support of a contingency operation as designated by the Secretary of Defense. Affected Reserve component members may enroll in the TDP only if their orders specify that they are ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation, as defined by 10 U.S.C., for a period of thirty- one (31) days or more. An affected Reserve component member must elect to enroll in the TDP and complete the enrollment application within thirty (30) days following entry on active duty or within sixty (60) days following implementation of the TDP. Following enrollment, beneficiaries must remain enrolled, with the member paying premiums, until the end of the member's active duty period in support of the contingency operation or twelve (12) months, whichever occurs first unless one of the conditions for disenrollment specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section is met. (3) Continuation of enrollment from Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan. Beneficiaries enrolled in the Expanded Active Duty Dependents Dental Benefit Plan at the time when TDP coverage begins must complete their two (2) year enrollment period established under this former plan except if one of the conditions for disenrollment specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section is met. Once this original two (2) year enrollment period is met, the active duty member may continue TDP enrollment on a month-to-month basis. A new one (1) year enrollment period will only be incurred if the active duty member disenrolls and attempts to reenroll in the TDP at a later date. (4) Continuation of enrollment from TRICARE Selected Reserve Dental Program. Beneficiaries enrolled in the TRICARE Selected Reserve Dental Program at the time when TDP coverage begins must complete their one (1) year enrollment period established under this former program except if one of the conditions for disenrollment specified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section is met. Once this original one (1) year enrollment period is met, the Selected Reserve member may continue TDP enrollment on a month-to-month basis. A new one (1) year enrollment period will only be incurred if the Selected Reserve member disenrolls and attempts to reenroll in the TDP at a later date. (D) Beginning dates of eligibility. The beginning date of eligibility for TDP benefits is the first day of the month following the month in which the election of enrollment is completed, signed, and the enrollment and premium is received by the dental plan contractor, subject to a predetermined and publicized dental plan contractor monthly cut-off date, except that the date of eligibility shall not be earlier than the first day of the month in which the TDP is implemented. This includes any changes between single and family member premium coverage and coverage of newly eligible or enrolled dependents or members. (E) Changes in and termination of enrollment. (1) Changes in status of active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member. When the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member is separated, discharged, retired, transferred to the Standby or Retired Reserve, his or her enrolled dependents and/or the enrolled [[Page 256]] Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member lose eligibility and enrollment as of 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the month in which the change in status takes place. When the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member is ordered to active duty for a period of thirty- one (31) days or more without a break in service, the member loses their eligibility and is disenrolled, if they were previously enrolled; however, their enrolled dependents maintain their eligibility and previous enrollment subject to eligibility, enrollment and disenrollment provisions described in this section and in the TDP contract. When the previously enrolled active duty member is transferred back to the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve without a break in service, the member regains eligibility and is reenrolled; however, their enrolled dependents maintain their eligibility and previous enrollment subject to eligibility, enrollment and disenrollment provisions described in this section and in the TDP contract. Eligible dependents of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member serving a sentence of confinement in conjunction with a sentence of punitive discharge are still eligible for the TDP until such time as the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's discharge is executed. (2) Continuation of eligibility for dependents of service members who die while on active duty or while a member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve. Eligible dependents of active duty members while on active duty for a period of thirty-one (31) days or more and eligible dependents of Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve members, as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10143 and 10144(b) respectively, if on the date of the death of the member, the dependent is enrolled in the TDP, or if not enrolled by reason of a discontinuance of a former enrollment under paragraphs (c)(4)(ii) and (c)(4)(iii) of this section shall be eligible for continued enrollment in the TDP for up to three (3) years from the date of the member's death. This 3-year period of continued enrollment also applies to dependents of active duty members who died within the year prior to the beginning of the TDP while the dependents were enrolled in the TFMDP. This continued enrollment is not contingent on the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own enrollment in the TDP. During the three-year period of continuous enrollment, the government will pay both the Government and the beneficiary's portion of the premium share. (3) Changes in status of dependent.--(i) Divorce. A spouse separated from an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member by a final divorce decree loses all eligibility based on his or her former marital relationship as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the divorce becomes final. The eligibility of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own children (including adopted and eligible illegitimate children) is unaffected by the divorce. An unadopted stepchild, however, loses eligibility with the termination of the marriage, also as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the divorce becomes final. (ii) Annulment. A spouse whose marriage to an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member is dissolved by annulment loses eligibility as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the court grants the annulment order. The fact that the annulment legally declares the entire marriage void from its inception does not affect the termination date of eligibility. When there are children, the eligibility of the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own children (including adopted and eligible illegitimate children) is unaffected by the annulment. An unadopted stepchild, however, loses eligibility with the annulment of the marriage, also as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the court grants the annulment order. (iii) Adoption. A child of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member who is adopted by a person, other than a person whose dependents are eligible for TDP benefits while the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member is living, thereby severing the legal relationship between the child [[Page 257]] and the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, loses eligibility as of 11:59 p.m. of the last day of the month in which the adoption becomes final. (iv) Marriage of child. A child of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member who marries a person whose dependents are not eligible for the TDP, loses eligibility as of 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the month in which the marriage takes place. However, should the marriage be terminated by death, divorce, or annulment before the child is twenty-one (21) years old, the child again become eligible for enrollment as a dependent as of 12:00 a.m. of the first day of the month following the month in which the occurrence takes place that terminates the marriage and continues up to age twenty-one (21) if the child does not remarry before that time. If the marriage terminates after the child's 21st birthday, there is no reinstatement of eligibility. (v) Disabling illness or injury of child age 21 or 22 who has eligibility based on his or her student status. A child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old who is pursuing a full-time course of higher education and who, either during the school year or between semesters, suffers a disabling illness or injury with resultant inability to resume attendance at the institution remains eligible for the TDP for six (6) months after the disability is removed or until the student passes his or her 23rd birthday, whichever occurs first. However, if recovery occurs before the 23rd birthday and there is resumption of a full-time course of higher education, the TDP can be continued until the 23rd birthday. The normal vacation periods during an established school year do not change the eligibility status of a dependent child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old in full- time student status. Unless an incapacitating condition existed before, and at the time of, a dependent child's 21st birthday, a dependent child twenty-one (21) or twenty-two (22) years old in student status does not have eligibility related to mental or physical incapacity as described in Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(iv)(C)(2). (4 ) Other.--(i) Disenrollment because of no eligible beneficiaries. When an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member ceases to have any eligible beneficiaries, enrollment is terminated for those enrolled dependents. (ii) Option to disenroll as a result of a change in active duty station. When an active duty member transfers with enrolled dependents to a duty station where space-available dental care for the enrolled dependents is readily available at the local Uniformed Service dental treatment facility, the active duty member may elect, within ninety (90) calendar days of the transfer, to disenroll their dependents from the TDP. If the active duty member is later transferred to a duty station where dental care for the dependents is not available in the local Uniformed Service dental treatment facility, the active duty member may reenroll their eligible dependents in the TDP provided the member, as of the date of reenrollment, otherwise meets the requirements for enrollment, including the intent to remain on active duty for a period of not less than one (1) year. This disenrollment provision does not apply to enrolled dependents of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve or to enrolled members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve. (iii) Option to disenroll due to transfer to OCONUS service area. When an enrolled dependent of an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member or an enrolled Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member relocates to locations within the OCONUS service area, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may elect, within ninety (90) calendar days of the relocation, to disenroll their dependents from the TDP, or in the case of enrolled members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, to disenroll themselves from the TDP. The active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may reenroll their eligible dependents, or in the case of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve, may reenroll themselves in the TDP provided the member, as of the date of reenrollment, otherwise meets the requirements for enrollment, including [[Page 258]] the intent to remain on active duty or as a member of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve (or any combination thereof without a break in service or transfer to a non-eligible status) for a period of not less than one (1) year. (iv) Option to disenroll after an initial one (1) year enrollment. When a dependent's enrollment under an active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member or a Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's own enrollment has been in effect for a continuous period of one (1) year, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may disenroll their dependents, or in the case of enrolled members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve may disenroll themselves at any time following procedures as set up by the dental plan contractor. Subsequent to the disenrollment, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member may reenroll their eligible dependents, or in the case of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve may reenroll themselves, for another minimum period of one (1) year. If, during any one (1) year enrollment period, the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member disenrolls their dependents, or in the case of members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve disenrolls themselves, for reasons other than those listed in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) or fails to make premium payments, dependents enrolled under the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, or enrolled members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve, will be subject to a lock-out period of twelve (12) months. Following this period of time, active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve members will be able to reenroll their eligible dependents, or members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve will be able to reenroll themselves, if they so choose. The twelve (12) month lock- out period applies to enrolled dependents of a Reserve component member who disenrolls for reasons other than those listed in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) or fails to make premium payments after the member has enrolled pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section. (d) Premium sharing--(1) General. Active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve members enrolling their eligible dependents, or members of the Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve enrolling themselves, in the TDP shall be required to pay all or a portion of the premium cost depending on their status. (i) Members required to pay a portion of the premium cost. This premium category includes active duty members (under a call or order to active duty that does not specify a period of thirty (30) days or less) on behalf of their enrolled dependents. It also includes members of the Selected Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10143) and the Individual Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10144(b)) enrolled on their own behalf. (ii) Members required to pay the full premium cost. This premium category includes members of the Selected Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10143), and the Individual Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10144), on behalf of their enrolled dependents. It also includes members of the Individual Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10144(a)) enrolled on their own behalf. (2) Proportion of premium share. The proportion of premium share to be paid by the active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Reserve member pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section is established by the ASD(HA), or designee, at not more than forty (40) percent of the total premium. The proportion of premium share to be paid by the Selected Reserve and Individual Reserve member pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section is established by the ASD(HA), or designee, at one hundred (100) percent of the total premium. (3) Provision for increases in active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve member's premium share. (i) Although previously capped at $20 per month, the law has been amended to authorize the cap on active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve member's premiums pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section to rise, effective as of January 1 of each [[Page 259]] year, by the percent equal to the lesser of: (A) The percent by which the rates of basic pay of members of the Uniformed Services are increased on such date; or (B) The sum of one-half percent and the percent computed under 5 U.S.C. 5303(a) for the increase in rates of basic pay for statutory pay systems for pay periods beginning on or after such date. (ii) Under the legislation authorizing an increase in the monthly premium cap, the methodology for determining the active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve member's TDP premium pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section will be applied as if the methodology had been in continuous use since December 31, 1993. (4) Reduction of premium share for enlisted members. For enlisted members in pay grades E-1 through E-4, the ASD(HA) or designee, may reduce the monthly premium these active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve members pay pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. (5) Reduction of cost-shares for enlisted members. For enlisted members in pay grades E-1 through E-4, the ASD(HA) or designee, may reduce the cost-shares that active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve members pay on behalf of their enrolled dependents and that members of the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve pay on their own behalf for selected benefits as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. (6) Premium payment method. The active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve member's premium share may be deducted from the active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member's basic pay or compensation paid under 37 U.S.C. 206, if sufficient pay is available. For members who are otherwise eligible for TDP benefits and who do not receive such pay and dependents who are otherwise eligible for TDP benefits and whose sponsors do not receive such pay, or if insufficient pay is available, the premium payment may be collected pursuant to procedures established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee. (7) Annual notification of premium rates. TDP premium rates will be determined as part of the competitive contracting process. Information on the premium rates will be widely distributed by the dental plan contractor and the Government. (e) Plan benefits--(1) General.--(i) Scope of benefits. The TDP provides coverage for diagnostic and preventive services, sealants, restorative services, endodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, orthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery. (ii) Authority to act for the plan. The authority to make benefit determinations and authorize plan payments under the TDP rests primarily with the insurance, service plan, or prepayment dental plan contractor, subject to compliance with Federal law and regulation and Government contract provisions. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, provides required benefit policy decisions resulting from changes in Federal law and regulation and appeal decisions. No other persons or agents (such as dentists or Uniformed Services HBAs) have such authority. (iii) Dental benefits brochure.--(A) Content. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, shall establish a comprehensive dental benefits brochure explaining the benefits of the plan in common lay terminology. The brochure shall include the limitations and exclusions and other benefit determination rules for administering the benefits in accordance with the law and this part. The brochure shall include the rules for adjudication and payment of claims, appealable issues, and appeal procedures in sufficient detail to serve as a common basis for interpretation and understanding of the rules by providers, beneficiaries, claims examiners, correspondence specialists, employees and representatives of other Government bodies, HBAs, and other interested parties. Any conflict, which may occur between the dental benefits brochure and law or regulation, shall be resolved in favor of law and regulation. (B) Distribution. The dental benefits brochure will be available through the dental plan contractor and will be distributed with the assistance of the Uniformed Services HBAs and major personnel centers at Uniformed Service installations and headquarters to all [[Page 260]] members enrolling themselves or their eligible dependents. (iv) Alternative course of treatment policy. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may establish, in accordance with generally accepted dental benefit practices, an alternative course of treatment policy which provides reimbursement in instances where the dentist and beneficiary select a more expensive service, procedure, or course of treatment than is customarily provided. The alternative course of treatment policy must meet following conditions: (A) The service, procedure, or course of treatment must be consistent with sound professional standards of dental practice for the dental condition concerned. (B) The service, procedure, or course of treatment must be a generally accepted alternative for a service or procedure covered by the TDP for the dental condition. (C) Payment for the alternative service or procedure may not exceed the lower of the prevailing limits for the alternative procedure, the prevailing limits or dental plan contractor's scheduled allowance for the otherwise authorized benefit procedure for which the alternative is substituted, or the actual charge for the alternative procedure. (2) Benefits. The following benefits are defined (subject to the TDP's exclusions, limitations, and benefit determination rules approved by OCHAMPUS) using the American Dental Association's Council on Dental Care Program's Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may modify these services, to the extent determined appropriate based on developments in common dental care practices and standard dental insurance programs. (i) Diagnostic and preventive services. Benefits may be extended for those dental services described as oral examination, diagnostic, and preventive services defined as traditional prophylaxis (i.e., scaling deposits from teeth, polishing teeth, and topical application of fluoride to teeth) when performed directly by dentists and dental hygienists as authorized under paragraph (f) of this section.

The following categories of services are authorized when performed directly by dentists or dental hygienists, as authorized under paragraph (f) of this section, only in unusual circumstances requiring justification of exceptional conditions directly related to otherwise authorized procedures. Use of the procedures may not result in the fragmentation of services normally included in a single procedure. The dental plan contractor may recognize a ``by report'' condition by providing additional allowance to the primary covered procedure instead of recognizing or permitting a distinct billing for the ``by report'' service. These include the following categories of general services: (A) Unclassified treatment. (B) Anesthesia. (C) Professional consultation. (D) Professional visits. (E) Drugs. (F) Miscellaneous services. (iii) Restorative services.

The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may establish such exclusions and limitations as are consistent with those established by dental insurance and prepayment plans to control utilization and quality of care for the services and items covered by the TDP. (xi) Limitation on reduction of benefits. If a reduction in benefits is planned, the Secretary of Defense, or designee, may not reduce TDP benefits without notifying the appropriate Congressional committees. If a reduction is approved, the Secretary of Defense, or designee, must wait one (1) year from the date of notice before a benefit reduction can be implemented. [[Page 262]] (3) Cost-shares, liability and maximum coverage.--(i) Cost-shares. The following table lists maximum active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve member and dependent cost-shares for covered services for participating and nonparticipating providers of care (see paragraph (f)(6) of this section for additional active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve costs). These are percentages of the dental plan contractor's determined allowable amount that the active duty, Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve member or beneficiary must pay to these providers. For care received in the OCONUS service area, the ASD(HA), or designee, may pay certain cost-shares and other portions of a provider's billed charge for enrolled dependents of active duty members (under a call or order that does not specify a period of thirty (30) days or less), and for members of the Selected Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10143) and Individual Ready Reserve (as specified in 10 U.S.C. 10144(b)) enrolled on their own behalf. [In percent] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cost-share for pay Cost-share Covered services grades E-1, for all E-2, E-3 other pay and E-4 grades ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Diagnostic.................................... 0 0 Preventive, except Sealants................... 0 0 Emergency Services............................ 0 0 Sealants...................................... 20 20 Professional Consultations.................... 20 20 Professional Visits........................... 20 20 Post Surgical Services........................ 20 20 Basic Restorative (example: amalgams, resins, 20 20 stainless steel crowns)...................... Endodontic.................................... 30 40 Periodontic................................... 30 40 Oral and Maxilllofacial Surgery............... 30 40 General Anesthesia............................ 40 40 Intravenous Sedation.......................... 50 50 Other Restorative (example: crowns, onlays, 50 50 casts)....................................... Prosthodontics................................ 50 50 Medications................................... 50 50 Orthodontic................................... 50 50 Miscellaneous................................. 50 50 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (ii) Dental plan contractor liability. When more than twenty-five (25) percent or more than two hundred (200) enrollees in a specific five (5) digit zip code area are unable to obtain a periodic or initial (non- emergency) dentistry appointment with a network provider within twenty- one (21) calendar days and within thirty-five (35) miles of the enrollee's place of residence, then the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) will designate that area as ``non-compliant with the access standard.'' Once so designated, the dental program contractor will reimburse the beneficiary, or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, or the nonparticipating provider selected by enrollees in that area (or a subset of the area or nearby zip codes in other five (5) digit zip code areas as determined by TMA) at the level of the provider's usual fees less the applicable enrollee cost-share, if any. TMA shall determine when such area becomes compliant with the access standards. This access standard and associated liability does not apply to care received in the OCONUS service area. (iii) Maximum coverage amounts. Beneficiaries are subject to an annual maximum coverage amount for non-orthodontic dental benefits and a lifetime maximum coverage amount for orthodontics as established by the ASD (HA) or designee. (f) Authorized providers--(1) General. Beneficiaries may seek covered services from any provider who is fully licensed and approved to provide dental care or covered anesthesia benefits in the state where the provider is located. This includes licensed dental hygienists, practicing within the scope of their licensure, subject to any restrictions a state licensure or legislative body imposes regarding their status as independent providers of care. (2) Authorized provider status does not guarantee payment of benefits. The fact that a provider is ``authorized'' is not to be construed to mean that the TDP will automatically pay a claim for services or supplies provided by such a provider. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, also must determine if the patient is an eligible beneficiary, whether the services or supplies billed are authorized and medically necessary, and whether any of the authorized exclusions of otherwise qualified providers presented in this section apply. (3) Utilization review and quality assurance. Services and supplies furnished by providers of care shall be subject to [[Page 263]] utilization review and quality assurance standards, norms, and criteria established under the TDP. Utilization review and quality assurance assessments shall be performed under the TDP consistent with the nature and level of benefits of the plan, and shall include analysis of the data and findings by the dental plan contractor from other dental accounts. (4) Provider required. In order to be considered benefits, all services and supplies shall be rendered by, prescribed by, or furnished at the direction of, or on the order of a TDP authorized provider practicing within the scope of his or her license. (5) Participating provider. An authorized provider may elect to participate for all TDP beneficiaries and accept the fee or charge determinations as established and made known to the provider by the dental plan contractor. The fee or charge determinations are binding upon the provider in accordance with the dental plan contractor's procedures for participation. The authorized provider may not participate on a claim-by-claim basis. The participating provider must agree to accept, within one (1) day of a request for appointment, beneficiaries in need of emergency palliative treatment. Payment to the participating provider is based on the lower of the actual charge or the dental plan contractor's determination of the allowable charge; however, payments to participating providers shall be in accordance with the methodology specified in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section. Payment is made directly to the participating provider, and the participating provider may only charge the beneficiary the percent cost-share of the dental plan contractor's allowable charge for those benefit categories as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, in addition to the full charges for any services not authorized as benefits. (6) Nonparticipating provider. An authorized provider may elect to not participate for all TDP beneficiaries and request the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member to pay any amount of the provider's billed charge in excess of the dental plan contractor's determination of allowable charges (to include the appropriate cost-share). Neither the Government nor the dental plan contractor shall have any responsibility for any amounts over the allowable charges as determined by the dental plan contractor, except where the dental plan contractor is unable to identify a participating provider of care within thirty-five (35) miles of the beneficiary's place of residence with appointment availability within twenty-one (21) calendar days. In such instances of the nonavailability of a participating provider and in accordance with the provisions of the dental contract, the nonparticipating provider located within thirty- five (35) miles of the beneficiary's place of residence shall be paid his or her usual fees (either by the beneficiary or the dental plan contractor if the beneficiary elected assignment of benefits), less the percent cost-share as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. (i) Assignment of benefits. A nonparticipating provider may accept assignment of benefits for claims (for beneficiaries certifying their willingness to make such assignment of benefits) by filing the claims completed with the assistance of the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for direct payment by the dental plan contractor to the provider. (ii) No assignment of benefits. A nonparticipating provider for all beneficiaries may request that the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member file the claim directly with the dental plan contractor, making arrangements with the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member for direct payment by the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member. (7) Alternative delivery system--(i) General. Alternative delivery systems may be established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, as authorized providers. Only dentists, dental hygienists and licensed anesthetists shall be authorized to provide or direct the provision of authorized services and supplies in an approved alternative delivery system. [[Page 264]] (ii) Defined. An alternative delivery system may be any approved arrangement for a preferred provider organization, capitation plan, dental health maintenance or clinic organization, or other contracted arrangement which is approved by OCHAMPUS in accordance with requirements and guidelines. (iii) Elective or exclusive arrangement. Alternative delivery systems may be established by contract or other arrangement on either an elective or exclusive basis for beneficiary selection of participating and authorized providers in accordance with contractual requirements and guidelines. (iv) Provider election of participation. Otherwise authorized providers must be provided with the opportunity of applying for participation in an alternative delivery system and of achieving participation status based on reasonable criteria for timeliness of application, quality of care, cost containment, geographic location, patient availability, and acceptance of reimbursement allowance. (v) Limitation on authorized providers. Where exclusive alternative delivery systems are established, only providers participating in the alternative delivery system are authorized providers of care. In such instances, the TDP shall continue to pay beneficiary claims for services rendered by otherwise authorized providers in accordance with established rules for reimbursement of nonparticipating providers where the beneficiary has established a patient relationship with the nonparticipating provider prior to the TDP's proposal to subcontract with the alternative delivery system. (vi) Charge agreements. Where the alternative delivery system employs a discounted fee-for-service reimbursement methodology or schedule of charges or rates which includes all or most dental services and procedures recognized by the American Dental Association's Council on Dental Care Program's Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature, the discounts or schedule of charges or rates for all dental services and procedures shall be extended by its participating providers to beneficiaries of the TDP as an incentive for beneficiary participation in the alternative delivery system. (g) Benefit payment--(1) General. TDP benefits payments are made either directly to the provider or to the beneficiary or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve member, depending on the manner in which the claim is submitted or the terms of the subcontract of an alternative delivery system with the dental plan contractor. (2) Benefit payment. Beneficiaries are not required to utilize participating providers. For beneficiaries who do use these participating providers, however, these providers shall not balance bill any amount in excess of the maximum payment allowed by the dental plan contractor for covered services. Beneficiaries using nonparticipating providers may be balance-billed amounts in excess of the dental plan contractor's determination of allowable charges. The following general requirements for the TDP benefit payment methodology shall be met, subject to modifications and exceptions approved by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee: (i) Nonparticipating providers (or the Beneficiaries or active duty, Selected Reserve or Individual Ready Reserve members for unassigned claims) shall be reimbursed at the equivalent of not less than the 50th percentile of prevailing charges made for similar services in the same locality (region) or state, or the provider's actual charge, whichever is lower, subject to the exception listed in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, less any cost-share amount due for authorized services. (ii) Participating providers shall be reimbursed at the equivalent of a percentile of prevailing charges sufficiently above the 50th percentile of prevailing charges made for similar services in the same locality (region) or state as to constitute a significant financial incentive for participation, or the provider's actual charge, whichever is lower, less any cost-share amount due for authorized services. (3) Fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest. The provisions of Sec. 199.9 shall apply except for Sec. 199.9(e). All references to contractors'', ``CHAMPUS beneficiaries'' and ``CHAMPUS providers'' in Sec. 265]] ``TDP beneficiaries'' and ``TPD providers'' respectively for the purposes of this section. Examples of fraud include situations in which ineligible persons not enrolled in the TDP obtain care and file claims for benefits under the name and identification of a beneficiary; or when providers submit claims for services and supplies not rendered to Beneficiaries; or when a participating provider bills the beneficiary for amounts over the dental plan contractor's determination of allowable charges; or when a provider fails to collect the specified patient cost- share amount. (h) Appeal and hearing procedures. The provisions of Sec. 199.10 shall apply except where noted in this section. All references to ``CHAMPUS contractors'', ``CHAMPUS beneficiaries'', ``CHAMPUS Benefits'' in Sec. 199.10 shall be construed to mean the plan contractor'', ``TDP beneficiaries'', ``TDP participating providers'' and ``Dental Explanation of Benefits or DEOB'' respectively for the purposes of this section. References to ``OCHAMPUSEUR'' in Sec. 199.10 are not applicable to the TDP or this section. (1) General. See Sec. 199.10(a). (i) Initial determination--(A) Notice of initial determination and right to appeal. See Sec. 199.10(a)(1)(i). (B) Effect of initial determination. See Sec. 199.10(a)(1)(ii). (ii) Participation in an appeal. Participation in an appeal is limited to any party to the initial determination, including OCHAMPUS, the dental plan contractor, and authorized representatives of the parties. Any party to the initial determination, except OCHAMPUS and the dental plan contractor, may appeal an adverse determination. The appealing party is the party who actually files the appeal. (A) Parties to the initial determination. See Sec. Sec. 199.10(a)(2)(i) and 199.10(a)(2)(i) (A), (B), (C) and (E). In addition, a third party other than the dental plan contractor, such as an insurance company, is not a party to the initial determination and is not entitled to appeal, even though it may have an indirect interest in the initial determination. (B) Representative. See Sec. 199.10(a)(2)(ii). (iii) Burden of proof. See Sec. 199.10(a)(3). (iv) Evidence in appeal and hearing cases. See Sec. 199.10(a)(4). (v) Late filing. If a request for reconsideration, formal review, or hearing is filed after the time permitted in this section, written notice shall be issued denying the request. Late filing may be permitted only if the appealing party reasonably can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the dental plan contractor, or the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, that timely filing of the request was not feasible due to extraordinary circumstances over which the appealing party had no practical control. Each request for an exception to the filing requirement will be considered on its own merits. The decision of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, on the request for an exception to the filing requirement shall be final. (vi) Appealable issue. See Sec. Sec. 199.10(a)(6), 199.10(a)(6)(i), 199.10(a)(6)(iv), including Sec. Sec. 199.10(a)(6)(iv) (A) and (C), and 199.10(a)(6)(v) for an explanation and examples of non-appealable issues. Other examples of issues that are not appealable under this section include: (A) The amount of the dental plan contractor-determined allowable charge since the methodology constitutes a limitation on benefits under the provisions of this section. (B) Certain other issues on the basis that the authority for the initial determination is not vested in OCHAMPUS. Such issues include but are not limited to the following examples: (1) A determination of a person's enrollment in the TDP is the responsibility of the dental plan contractor and ultimate responsibility for resolving a beneficiary's enrollment rests with the dental plan contractor. Accordingly, a disputed question of fact concerning a beneficiary's enrollment will not be considered an appealable issue under the provisions of this section, but shall be resolved in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and the dental plan contractor's enrollment policies and procedures. (2) Decisions relating to the issuance of a nonavailability statement (NAS) [[Page 266]] in each case are made by the Uniformed Services. Disputes over the need for an NAS or a refusal to issue an NAS are not appealable under this section. The one exception is when a dispute arises over whether the facts of the case demonstrate a dental emergency for which an NAS is not required. Denial of payment in this one situation is an appealable issue. (3) Any decision or action on the part of the dental plan contractor to include a provider in their network or to designate a provider as participating is not appealable under this section. Similarly, any decision or action on the part of the dental plan contractor to exclude a provider from their network or to deny participating provider status is not appealable under this section. (vii) Amount in dispute--(A) General. An amount in dispute is required for an adverse determination to be appealed under the provisions of this section, except as set forth or further explained in Sec. 199.10(a)(7)(ii), (iii) and (iv). (B) Calculated amount. The amount in dispute is calculated as the amount of money the dental plan contractor would pay if the services involved in the dispute were determined to be authorized benefits of the TDP. Examples of amounts of money that are excluded by this section from payments for authorized benefits include, but are not limited to: (1) Amounts in excess of the dental plan contractor's--determined allowable charge. (2) The beneficiary's cost-share amounts. (3) Amounts that the beneficiary, or parent, guardian, or other responsible person has no legal obligation to pay. (4) Amounts excluded under the provisions of Sec. 199.8 of this part. (viii) Levels of appeal. See Sec. 199.10(a)(8)(i). Initial determinations involving the sanctioning (exclusion, suspension, or termination) of TDP providers shall be appealed directly to the hearing level. (ix) Appeal decision. See Sec. 199.10(a)(9). (2) Reconsideration. See Sec. 199.10(b). (3) Formal review. See Sec. 199.10(c). (4) Hearing--(i) General. See Sec. Sec. 1.99.10(d) and 199.10(d)(1) through (d)(5) and (d0(7) through (d)(12) for information on the hearing process. (ii) Authority of the hearing officer. The hearing officer, in exercising the authority to conduct a hearing under this part, will be bound by 10 U.S.C., chapter 55, and this part. The hearing officer in addressing substantive, appealable issues shall be bound by the dental benefits brochure applicable for the date(s) of service, policies, procedures, instructions and other guidelines issued by the ASD(HA), or a designee, or by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, in effect for the period in which the matter in dispute arose. A hearing officer may not establish or amend the dental benefits brochure, policy, procedures, instructions, or guidelines. However, the hearing officer may recommend reconsideration of the policy, procedures, instructions or guidelines by the ASD (HA), or a designee, when the final decisions is issued in the case. (5) Final decision. See Sec. Sec. 199.10(e)(1) and 199.10(e)(1)(i) for information on final decisions in the appeal and hearing process, with the exception that no recommended decision shall be referred for review by ASD(HA). [66 FR 12860, Mar. 1, 2001; 66 FR 26, 2001, as amended at 68 FR 65174, Nov. 19, 2003] Sec. 199.14 Provider reimbursement methods. (a) Hospitals. The CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost for reimbursement of a hospital shall be determined on the basis of one of the following methodologies. (1) CHAMPUS Diagnosis Related Group (DRG)-based payment system. Under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, payment for the operating costs of inpatient hospital services furnished by hospitals subject to the system is made on the basis of prospectively-determined rates and applied on a per discharge basis using DRGs. Payments under this system will include a differentiation for urban (using large urban and other urban areas) and rural hospitals and an adjustment for area wage differences and indirect medical education costs. Additional payments will be made for capital costs, direct medical education costs, and outlier cases. [[Page 267]] (i) General--(A) DRGs used. The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system will use the same DRGs used in the most recently available grouper for the Medicare Prospective Payment System, except as necessary to recognize distinct characteristics of CHAMPUS beneficiaries and as described in instructions issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS. (B) Assignment of discharges to DRGs. (1) The classification of a particular discharge shall be based on the patient's age, sex, principal diagnosis (that is, the diagnosis established, after study, to be chiefly responsible for causing the patient's admission to the hospital), secondary diagnoses, procedures performed and discharge status. In addition, for neonatal cases (other than normal newborns) the classification shall also account for birthweight, surgery and the presence of multiple, major and other neonatal problems, and shall incorporate annual updates to these classification features. (2) Each discharge shall be assigned to only one DRG regardless of the number of conditions treated or services furnished during the patient's stay. (C) Basis of payment--(1) Hospital billing. Under the CHAMPUS DRG- based payment system, hospitals are required to submit claims (including itemized charges) in accordance with Sec. 199.7(b). The CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary will assign the appropriate DRG to the claim based on the information contained in the claim. Any request from a hospital for reclassification of a claim to a higher weighted DRG must be submitted, within 60 days from the date of the initial payment, in a manner prescribed by the Director, OCHAMPUS. (2) Payment on a per discharge basis. Under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, hospitals are paid a predetermined amount per discharge for inpatient hospital services furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. (3) Claims priced as of date of admission. Except for interim claims submitted for qualifying outlier cases, all claims reimbursed under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system are to be priced as of the date of admission, regardless of when the claim is submitted. (4) Payment in full. The DRG-based amount paid for inpatient hospital services is the total CHAMPUS payment for the inpatient operating costs (as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C)(5) of this section) incurred in furnishing services covered by the CHAMPUS. The full prospective payment amount is payable for each stay during which there is at least one covered day of care, except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(1)(i)(A) of this section. (5) Inpatient operating costs. The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system provides a payment amount for inpatient operating costs, including: (i) Operating costs for routine services, such as the costs of room, board, and routine nursing services; (ii) Operating costs for ancillary services, such as hospital radiology and laboratory services (other than physicians' services) furnished to hospital inpatients; (iii) Special care unit operating costs; and (iv) Malpractice insurance costs related to services furnished to inpatients. (6) Discharges and transfers. (i) Discharges. A hospital inpatient is discharged when: (A) The patient is formally released from the hospital (release of the patient to another hospital as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C)(6)(ii) of this section, or a leave of absence from the hospital, will not be recognized as a discharge for the purpose of determining payment under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system); (B) The patient dies in the hospital; or (C) The patient is transferred from the care of a hospital included under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to a hospital or unit that is excluded from the prospective payment system. (ii) Transfers. Except as provided under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C)(6)(i) of this section, a discharge of a hospital inpatient is not counted for purposes of the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system when the patient is transferred: [[Page 268]] (A) From one inpatient area or unit of the hospital to another area or unit of the same hospital; (B) From the care of a hospital included under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to the care of another hospital paid under this system; (C) From the care of a hospital included under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to the care of another hospital that is excluded from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system because of participation in a statewide cost control program which is exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; or (D) From the care of a hospital included under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to the care of a uniformed services treatment facility. (iii) Payment in full to the discharging hospital. The hospital discharging an inpatient shall be paid in full under the CHAMPUS DRG- based payment system. (iv) Payment to a hospital transferring an inpatient to another hospital. If a hospital subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system transfers an inpatient to another such hospital, the transferring hospital shall be paid a per diem rate (except that in neonatal cases, other than normal newborns, the hospital will be paid at 125 percent of that per diem rate), as determined under instructions issued by TSO, for each day of the patient's stay in that hospital, not to exceed the DRG- based payment that would have been paid if the patient had been discharged to another setting. For admissions occurring on or after October 1, 1995, the transferring hospital shall be paid twice the per diem rate for the first day of any transfer stay, and the per diem amount for each subsequent day, up to the limit described in this paragraph. (v) Additional payments to transferring hospitals. A transferring hospital may qualify for an additional payment for extraordinary cases that meet the criteria for long-stay or cost outliers. (D) DRG system updates. The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system is modeled on the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) and uses annually updated items and numbers from the Medicare PPS as provided for in this part and in instructions issued by the Director, OCHAMPUS. The effective date of these items and numbers shall correspond to that under the Medicare PPS except where distinctions are made in this part. (ii) Applicability of the DRG system. (A) Areas affected. The CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system shall apply to hospitals' services in the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, except that any state which has implemented a separate DRG-based payment system or similar payment system in order to control costs and is exempt from the Medicare Prospective Payment System may be exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system if it requests exemption in writing, and provided payment under such system does not exceed payment which would otherwise be made under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. (B) Services subject to the DRG-based payment system. All normally covered inpatient hospital services furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by hospitals are subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. (C) Services exempt from the DRG-based payment system. The following hospital services, even when provided in a hospital subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, are exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. The services in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(C)(1) through (a)(1)(ii)(C)(4) and (a)(1)(ii)(C)(7) through (a)(1)(ii)(C)(9) of this section shall be reimbursed under the procedures in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and the services in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(C)(5) and (a)(1)(ii)(C)(6) of this section shall be reimbursed under the procedures in paragraph (g) of this section. (1) Services provided by hospitals exempt from the DRG-based payment system. (2) All services related to solid organ acquisition for CHAMPUS covered transplants by CHAMPUS-authorized transplantation centers. (3) All services related to heart and liver transplantation for admissions prior to October 1, 1998, which would [[Page 269]] otherwise be paid under DRG 103 and 480, respectively. (4) All services related to CHAMPUS covered solid organ transplantations for which there is no DRG assignment. (5) All professional services provided by hospital-based physicians. (6) All services provided by nurse anesthetists. (7) All services related to discharges involving pediatric bone marrow transplants (patient under 18 at admission). (8) All services related to discharges involving children who have been determined to be HIV seropositive (patient under 18 at admission). (9) All services related to discharges involving pediatric cystic fibrosis (patient under 18 at admission). (10) For admissions occurring on or after October 1, 1990, and before October 1, 1994, and for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, the costs of blood clotting factor for hemophilia inpatients. An additional payment shall be made to a hospital for each unit of blood clotting factor furnished to a CHAMPUS inpatient who is hemophiliac in accordance with the amounts established under the Medicare Prospective Payment System (42 CFR 412.115). (D) Hospitals subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. All hospitals within the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico which are certified to provide services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries are subject to the DRG-based payment system except for the following hospitals or hospital units which are exempt. (1) Psychiatric hospitals. A psychiatric hospital which is exempt from the Medicare Prospective Payment System is also exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. In order for a psychiatric hospital which does not participate in Medicare to be exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, it must meet the same criteria (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee) as required for exemption from the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.23. (2) Rehabilitation hospitals. A rehabilitation hospital which is exempt from the Medicare Prospective Payment System is also exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. In order for a rehabilitation hospital which does not participate in Medicare to be exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, it must meet the same criteria (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee) as required for exemption from the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.23. (3) Psychiatric and rehabilitation units (distinct parts). A psychiatric or rehabilitation unit which is exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system is also exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. In order for a distinct unit which does not participate in Medicare to be exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, it must meet the same criteria (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee) as required for exemption from the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.23. (4) Long-term hospitals. A long-term hospital which is exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system is also exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. In order for a long-term hospital which does not participate in Medicare to be exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, it must meet the same criteria (as determined by the Director, TSO, or a designee) as required for exemption from the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in Sec. 412.23 of Title 42 CFR. (5) Hospitals within hospitals. A hospital within a hospital which is exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system is also exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. In order for a hospital within a hospital which does not participate in Medicare to be exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, it must meet the same criteria (as determined by the Director, TSO, or a designee) as required for exemption from the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.22 and the criteria for one or more of the excluded hospital classifications described in Sec. 412.23 of Title 42 CFR. (6) Sole community hospitals. Any hospital which has qualified for special [[Page 270]] treatment under the Medicare prospective payment system as a sole community hospital and has not given up that classification is exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. (See subpart G of 42 CFR part 412.) (7) Christian Science sanitoriums. All Christian Science sanitoriums (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(viii) of Sec. 199.6) are exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. (8) Cancer hospitals. Any hospital which qualifies as a cancer hospital under the Medicare standards and has elected to be exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system is exempt from the CHAMPUS DRG- based payment system. (See 42 CFR 412.94.) (9) Hospitals outside the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. A hospital is excluded from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system if it is not located in one of the fifty States, the District of Colubmia, or Puerto Rico. (E) Hospitals which do not participate in Medicare. It is not required that a hospital be a Medicare-participating provider in order to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. However, any hospital which is subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system and which otherwise meets CHAMPUS requirements but which is not a Medicare-participating provider (having completed a form HCFA-1514, Hospital Request for Certification in the Medicare/Medicaid Program and a form HCFA-1561, Health Insurance Benefit Agreement) must complete a participation agreement with OCHAMPUS. By completing the participation agreement, the hospital agrees to participate on all CHAMPUS inpatient claims and to accept the CHAMPUS-determined allowable amount as payment in full for these claims. Any hospital which does not participate in Medicare and does not complete a participation agreement with OCHAMPUS will not be authorized to provide services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. (F) Substance Use Disorder Rehabilitation facilities. With admissions on or after July 1, 1995, substance use disorder rehabilitation facilities, authorized under Sec. 199.6(b)(4)(xiv), are subject to the DRG-based payment system. (iii) Determination of payment amounts. The actual payment for an individual claim under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system is calculated by multiplying the appropriate adjusted standardized amount (adjusted to account for area wage differences using the wage indexes used in the Medicare program) by a weighting factor specific to each DRG. (A) Calculation of DRG weights. (1) Grouping of charges. All discharge records in the database shall be grouped by DRG. (2) Remove DRGs 469 and 470. Records from DRGs 469 and 470 shall be removed from the database. (3) Indirect medical education standardization. To standardize the charges for the cost effects of indirect medical education factors, each teaching hospital's charges will be divided by 1.0 plus the following ratio on a hospital-specific basis: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.042 (4) Wage level standardization. To standardize the charge records for area wage differences, each charge record will be divided into labor-related and nonlabor-related portions, and the labor-related portion shall be divided by the most recently available Medicare wage index for the area. The labor-related and nonlabor-related portions will then be added together. (5) Elimination of statistical outliers. All unusually high or low charges shall be removed from the database. (6) Calculation of DRG average charge. After the standardization for indirect medical education, and area wage differences, an average charge for each DRG shall be computed by summing charges in a DRG and dividing that [[Page 271]] sum by the number of records in the DRG. (7) Calculation of national average charge per discharge. A national average charge per discharge shall be calculated by summing all charges and dividing that sum by the total number of records from all DRG categories. (8) DRG relative weights. DRG relative weights shall be calculated for each DRG category by dividing each DRG average charge by the national average charge. (B) Empty and low-volume DRGs. For any DRG with less than ten (10) occurrences in the CHAMPUS database, the Director, TSO, or designee, has the authority to consider alternative methods for estimating CHAMPUS weights in these low-volume DRG categories. (C) Updating DRG weights. The CHAMPUS DRG weights shall be updated or adjusted as follows: (1) DRG weights shall be recalculated annually using CHAMPUS charge data and the methodology described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. (2) When a new DRG is created, CHAMPUS will, if practical, calculate a weight for it using an appropriate charge sample (if available) and the methodology described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. (3) In the case of any other change under Medicare to an existing DRG weight (such as in connection with technology changes), CHAMPUS shall adjust its weight for that DRG in a manner comparable to the change made by Medicare. (D) Calculation of the adjusted standardized amounts. The following procedures shall be followed in calculating the CHAMPUS adjusted standardized amounts. (1) Differentiate large urban and other area charges. All charges in the database shall be sorted into large urban and other area groups (using the same definitions for these categories used in the Medicare program. The following procedures will be applied to each group. (2) Indirect medical education standardization. To standardize the charges for the cost effects of indirect medical education factors, each teaching hospital's charges will be divided by 1.0 plus the following ratio on a hospital-specific basis: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.043 (3) Wage level standardization. To standardize the charge records for area wage differnces, each charge record will be divided into labor- related and nonlabor-related portions, and the labor-related portion shall be divided by the most recently available Medicare wage index for the area. The labor-related and nonlabor-related portions will then be added together. (4) Apply the cost to charge ratio. Each charge is to be reduced to a representative cost by using the Medicare cost to charge ratio. This amount shall be increased by 1 percentage point in order to reimburse hospitals for bad debt expenses attributable to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. (5) Preliminary base year standardized amount. A preliminary base year standardized amount shall be calculated by summing all costs in the database applicable to the large urban or other area group and dividing by the total number of discharges in the respective group. (6) Update for inflation. The preliminary base year standardized amounts shall be updated using an annual update factor equal to 1.07 to produce fiscal year 1988 preliminary standardized amounts. Therefore, any development of a new standardized amount will use an inflation factor equal to the hospital market basket index used by the Health Care Financing Administration in their Prospective Payment System. (7) The preliminary standardized amounts, updated for inflation, shall be divided by a system standardization factor so that total DRG outlays, given [[Page 272]] the database distribution across hospitals and diagnosis, are equal to the total charges reduced to costs. (8) Labor and nonlabor portions of the adjusted standardized amounts. The adjusted standardized amounts shall be divided into labor and nonlabor portions in accordance with the Medicare division of labor and nonlabor portions. (E) Adjustments to the DRG-based payments amounts. The following adjustments to the DRG-based amounts (the weight multiplied by the adjusted standardized amount) will be made. (1) Outliers. The DRG-based payment to a hospital shall be adjusted for atypical cases. These outliers are those cases that have either an unusually short length-of-stay or extremely long length-of-stay or that involve extraordinarily high costs when compared to most discharges classified in the same DRG. Cases which qualify as both a length-of-stay outlier and a cost outlier shall be paid at the rate which results in the greater payment. (i) Length-of-stay outliers. Length-of-stay outliers shall be identified and paid by the fiscal intermediary when the claims are processed. (A) Short-stay outliers. Any discharge with a length-of-stay (LOS) less than 1.94 standard deviations from the DRG's arithmetic LOS shall be classified as a short-stay outlier. Short-stay outliers shall be reimbursed at 200 percent of the per diem rate for the DRG for each covered day of the hospital stay, not to exceed the DRG amount. The per diem rate shall equal the DRG amount divided by the arithmetic mean length-of-stay for the DRG. (B) Long-stay outliers. Any discharge (except for neonatal services and services in children's hospitals) which has a length-of-stay (LOS) exceeding a threshold established in accordance with the criteria used for the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.82 shall be classified as a long-stay outlier. Any discharge for neonatal services or for services in a children's hospital which has a LOS exceeding the lesser of 1.94 standard deviations or 17 days from the DRG's arithmetic mean LOS also shall be classified as a long-stay outlier. Long-stay outliers shall be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus a percentage (as established for the Medicare Prospective Payment System) of the per diem rate for the DRG for each covered day of care beyond the long-stay outlier threshold. The per diem rate shall equal the DRG amount divided by the arithmetic mean LOS for the DRG. For admissions on or after October 1, 1997, the long stay outlier has been eliminated for all cases except children's hospitals and neonates. For admissions on or after October 1, 1998, the long stay outlier has been eliminated for children's hospitals and neonates. (ii) Cost outliers. Additional payment for cost outliers shall be made only upon request by the hospital. (A) Cost outliers except those in children's hospitals or for neonatal services. Any discharge which has standardized costs that exceed a threshold established in accordance with the criteria used for the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.84 shall qualify as a cost outlier. The standardized costs shall be calculated by multiplying the total charges by the factor described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(D)(4) of this section and adjusting this amount for indirect medical education costs. Cost outliers shall be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus a percentage (as established for the Medicare Prospective Payment System) of all costs exceeding the threshold. Effective with admissions occurring on or after October 1, 1997, the standardized costs are no longer adjusted for indirect medical education costs. (B) Cost outliers in children's hospitals for neonatal services. Any discharge for services in a children's hospital or for neonatal services which has standardized costs that exceed a threshold of the greater of two times the DRG-based amount or $13,500 shall qualify as a cost outlier. The standardized costs shall be calculated by multiplying the total charges by the factor described in paragraph (a)(1) (iii) (D) (4) of this section (adjusted to include average capital and direct medical education costs) and adjusting this amount for indirect medical education costs. Cost outliers for services in children's hospitals and for neonatal services shall be reimbursed the DRG-based [[Page 273]] amount plus a percentage (as established for the Medicare Prospective Payment System) of all costs exceeding the threshold. Effective with admissions occurring on or after October 1, 1998, standardized costs are no longer adjusted for indirect medical education costs. In addition, CHAMPUS will calculate the outlier payments that would have occurred at each of the 59 Children's hospitals under the FY99 outlier policy for all cases that would have been outliers under the FY94 policies using the most accurate data available in September 1998. A ratio will be calculated which equals the level of outlier payments that would have been made under the FY94 outlier policies and the outlier payments that would be made if the FY99 outlier policies had applied to each of these potential outlier cases for these hospitals. The ratio will be calculated across all outlier claims for the 59 hospitals and will not be hospital specific. The ratio will be used to increase cost outlier payments in FY 1999 and FY 2000, unless the hospital has a negotiated agreement with a managed care support contractor which would affect this payment. For hospitals with managed care support agreements which affect these payments, CHAMPUS will apply these payments if the increased payments would be consistent with the agreements. In FY 2000 the ratio of outlier payments (long stay and cost) that would have occurred under the FY 94 policy and actual cost outlier payments made under the FY 99 policy will be recalculated. If the ratio has changed significantly, the ratio will be revised for use in FY 2001 and thereafter. In FY 2002, the actual cost outlier cases in FY 2000 and 2001 will be reexamined. The ratio of outlier payments that would have occurred under the FY94 policy and the actual cost outlier payments made under the FY 2000 and FY 2001 policies. If the ratio has changed significantly, the ratio will be revised for use in FY 2003. (C) Cost outliers for burn cases. All cost outliers for DRGs related to burn cases shall be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus a percentage (as established for the Medicare Prospective Payment System) of all costs exceeding the threshold. The standardized costs and thresholds for these cases shall be calculated in accordance with Sec. 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(E)(1)(ii)(A) and Sec. 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(E)(1)(ii)(B). (2) Wage adjustment. CHAMPUS will adjust the labor portion of the standardized amounts according to the hospital's area wage index. (3) Indirect medical education adjustment. The wage adjusted DRG payment will also be multiplied by 1.0 plus the hospital's indirect medical education ratio. (4) Children's hospital differential. With respect to claims from children's hospitals, the appropriate adjusted standardized amount shall also be adjusted by a children's hospital differential. (i) Qualifying children's hospitals. Hospitals qualifying for the children's hospital differential are hospitals that are exempt from the Medicare Prospective Payment System, or, in the case of hospitals that do not participate in Medicare, that meet the same criteria (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee) as required for exemption from the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.23. (ii) Calculation of differential. The differential shall be equal to the difference between a specially calculated children's hospital adjusted standardized amount and the adjusted standardized amount for fiscal year 1988. The specially calculated children's hospital adjusted standardized amount shall be calculated in the same manner as set forth in Sec. 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(D), except that: (A) The base period shall be fiscal year 1988 and shall represent total estimated charges for discharges that occurred during fiscal year 1988. (B) No cost to charge ratio shall be applied. (C) Capital costs and direct medical education costs will be included in the calculation. (D) The factor used to update the database for inflation to produce the fiscal year 1988 base period amount shall be the applicable Medicare inpatient hospital market basket rate. (iii) Transition rule. Until March 1, 1992, separate differentials shall be used for each higher volume children's [[Page 274]] hospital (individually) and for all other children's hospitals (in the aggregate). For this purpose, a higher volume hospital is a hospital that had 50 or more CHAMPUS discharges in fiscal year 1988. (iv) Hold harmless provision. At such time as the weights initially assigned to neonatal DRGs are recalibrated based on sufficient volume of CHAMPUS claims records, children's hospital differentials shall be recalculated and appropriate retrospective and prospective adjustments shall be made. To the extent practicable, the recalculation shall also include reestimated values of other factors (including but not limited to direct education and capital costs and indirect education factors) for which more accurate data became available. (v) No update for inflation. The children's hospital differential, calculated (and later recalculated under the hold harmless provision) for the base period of fiscal year 1988, shall not be updated for subsequent fiscal years. (vi) Administrative corrections. In connection with determinations pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(iii) (E)(4)(iii) of this section, any children's hospital that believes OCHAMPUS erroneously failed to classify the hospital as a high volume hospital or incorrectly calculated (in the case of a high volume hospital) the hospital's differential may obtain administrative corrections by submitting appropriate documentation to the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). (F) Updating the adjusted standardized amounts. Beginning in FY 1989, the adjusted standardized amounts will be updated by the Medicare annual update factor, unless the adjusted standardized amounts are recalculated. (G) Annual cost pass-throughs. (1) Capital costs. When requested in writing by a hospital, CHAMPUS shall reimburse the hospital its share of actual capital costs as reported annually to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary. Payment for capital costs shall be made annually based on the ratio of CHAMPUS inpatient days for those beneficiaries subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to total inpatient days applied to the hospital's total allowable capital costs. Reductions in payments for capital costs which are required under Medicare shall also be applied to payments for capital costs under CHAMPUS. (i) Costs included as capital costs. Allowable capital costs are those specified in Medicare Regulation Sec. 413.130, as modified by Sec. 412.72. (ii) Services, facilities, or supplies provided by supplying organizations. If services, facilities, or supplies are provided to the hospital by a supplying organization related to the hospital within the meaning of Medicare Regulation Sec. 413.17, then the hospital must include in its capital-related costs, the capital-related costs of the supplying organization. However, if the supplying organization is not related to the provider within the meaning of Sec. 413.17, no part of the change to the provider may be considered a capital-related cost unless the services, facilities, or supplies are capital-related in nature and: (A) The capital-related equipment is leased or rented by the provider; (B) The capital-related equipment is located on the provider's premises; and (C) The capital-related portion of the charge is separately specified in the charge to the provider. (2) Direct medical education costs. When requested in writing by a hospital, CHAMPUS shall reimburse the hospital its actual direct medical education costs as reported annually to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary. Such teaching costs must be for a teaching program approved under Medicare Regulation Sec. 413.85. Payment for direct medical education costs shall be made annually based on the ratio of CHAMPUS inpatient days for those benficiaries subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to total inpatient days applied to the hospital's total allowable direct medical education costs. Allowable direct medical education costs are those specified in Medicare Regulation Sec. 413.85. (3) Information necessary for payment of capital and direct medical education costs. All hospitals subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, except for children's hospitals, may be reimbursed for allowed capital and direct medical education costs by submitting a request to the CHAMPUS contractor. Beginning October 1, 1998, such request shall be filed with [[Page 275]] CHAMPUS on or before the last day of the twelfth month following the close of the hospitals' cost reporting period, and shall cover the one- year period corresponding to the hospital's Medicare cost-reporting period. The first such request may cover a period of less than a full year--from the effective date of the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to the end of the hospital's Medicare cost-reporting period. All costs reported to the CHAMPUS contractor must correspond to the costs reported on the hospital's Medicare cost report. An extension of the due date for filing the request may only be granted if an extension has been granted by HCFA due to a provider's operations being significantly adversely affected due to extraordinary circumstances over which the provider has no control, such as flood or fire. (If these costs change as a result of a subsequent audit by Medicare, the revised costs are to be reported to the hospital's CHAMPUS contractor within 30 days of the date the hospital is notified of the change). The request must be signed by the hospital official responsible for verifying the amounts and shall contain the following information. (i) The hospital's name. (ii) The hospital's address. (iii) The hospital's CHAMPUS provider number. (iv) The hospital's Medicare provider number. (v) The period covered--this must correspond to the hospital's Medicare cost-reporting period. (vi) Total inpatient days provided to all patients in units subject to DRG-based payment. (vii) Total allowed CHAMPUS inpatient days provided in units subject to DRG-based payment. (viii) Total allowable capital costs. (ix) Total allowable direct medical education costs. (x) Total full-time equivalents for: (A) Residents. (B) Interns. (xi) Total inpatient beds as of the end of the cost-reporting period. If this has changed during the reporting period, an explanation of the change must be provided. (xii) Title of official signing the report. (xiii) Reporting date. (xiv) The report shall contain a certification statement that any changes to the items in paragraphs (a)(1)(iii)(G)(3)(vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), or (x), which are a result of an audit of the hospital's Medicare cost-report, shall be reported to CHAMPUS within thirty (30) days of the date the hospital is notified of the change. (2) CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system. The CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system shall be used to reimburse for inpatient mental health hospital care in specialty psychiatric hospitals and units. Payment is made on the basis of prospectively determined rates and paid on a per diem basis. The system uses two sets of per diems. One set of per diems applies to hospitals and units that have a relatively higher number of CHAMPUS discharges. For these hospitals and units, the system uses hospital-specific per diem rates. The other set of per diems applies to hospitals and units with a relatively lower number of CHAMPUS discharges. For these hospitals and units, the system uses regional per diems, and further provides for adjustments for area wage differences and indirect medical education costs and additional pass-through payments for direct medical education costs. (i) Applicability of the mental health per diem payment system. (A) Hospitals and units covered. The CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system applies to services covered (see paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section) that are provided in Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) exempt psychiatric specialty hospitals and all Medicare PPS exempt psychiatric specialty units of other hospitals. In addition, any psychiatric hospital that does not participate in Medicare, or any other hospital that has a psychiatric specialty unit that has not been so designated for exemption from the Medicare prospective payment system because the hospital does not participate in Medicare, may be designated as a psychiatric hospital or psychiatric specialty unit for purposes of the CHAMPUS mental health [[Page 276]] per diem payment system upon demonstrating that it meets the same criteria (as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS) as required for the Medicare exemption. The CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system does not apply to mental health services provided in other hospitals. (B) Services covered. Unless specifically exempted, all covered hospitals' and units' inpatient claims which are classified into a mental health DRG (DRG categories 425-432, but not DRG 424) or an alcohol/drug abuse DRG (DRG categories 433-437) shall be subject to the mental health per diem payment system. (ii) Hospital-specific per diems for higher volume hospitals and units. This paragraph describes the per diem payment amounts for hospitals and units with a higher volume of CHAMPUS discharges. (A)(1) Per diem amount. A hospital-specific per diem amount shall be calculated for each hospital and unit with a higher volume of CHAMPUS discharges. The base period per diem amount shall be equal to the hospital's average daily charge in the base period. The base period amount, however, may not exceed the cap described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. The base period amount shall be updated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section. (2) In states that have implemented a payment system in connection with which hospitals in that state have been exempted from the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, psychiatric hospitals and units may have per diem amounts established based on the payment system applicable to such hospitals and units in the state. The per diem amount, however, may not exceed the cap amount applicable to other higher volume hospitals. (B) Cap--(1) As it affects payment for care provided to patients prior to April 6, 1995, the base period per diem amount may not exceed the 80th percentile of the average daily charge weighted for all discharges throughout the United States from all higher volume hospitals. (2) Applicable to payments for care provided to patients on or after April 6, 1996, the base period per diem amount may not exceed the 70th percentile of the average daily charge weighted for all discharges throughout the United States from all higher volume hospitals. For this purpose, base year charges shall be deemed to be charges during the period of July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992, adjusted to correspond to base year (FY 1988) charges by the percentage change in average daily charges for all higher volume hospitals and units between the period of July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992 and the base year. (C) Review of per diem. Any hospital or unit which believes OCHAMPUS calculated a hospital-specific per diem which differs by more than $5.00 from that calculated by the hospital or unit may apply to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for a recalculation. The burden of proof shall be on the hospital. (iii) Regional per diems for lower volume hospitals and units. This paragraph describes the per diem amounts for hospitals and units with a lower volume of CHAMPUS discharges. (A) Per diem amounts. Hospitals and units with a lower volume of CHAMPUS patients shall be paid on the basis of a regional per diem amount, adjusted for area wages and indirect medical education. Base period regional per diems shall be calculated based upon all CHAMPUS lower volume hospitals' claims paid during the base period. Each regional per diem amount shall be the quotient of all covered charges divided by all covered days of care, reported on all CHAMPUS claims from lower volume hospitals in the region paid during the base period, after having standardized for indirect medical education costs and area wage indexes and subtracted direct medical education costs. Regional per diem amounts are adjusted in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) of this section. Additional pass-through payments to lower volume hospitals are made in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(D) of this section. The regions shall be the same as the Federal census regions. (B) Review of per diem amount. Any hospital that believes the regional per diem amount applicable to that hospital has been erroneously calculated [[Page 277]] by OCHAMPUS by more than $5.00 may submit to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, evidence supporting a different regional per diem. The burden of proof shall be on the hosptial. (C) Adjustments to regional per diems. Two adjustments shall be made to the regional per diem rates. (1) Area wage index. The same area wage indexes used for the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system (see paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(2) of this section) shall be applied to the wage portion of the applicable regional per diem rate for each day of the admission. The wage portion shall be the same as that used for the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. (2) Indirect medical education. The indirect medical education adjustment factors shall be calculated for teaching hospitals in the same manner as is used in the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system (see paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(E)(3) of this section) and applied to the applicable regional per diem rate for each day of the admission. (D) Annual cost pass-through for direct medical education. In addition to payments made to lower volume hospitals under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, CHAMPUS shall annually reimburse hospitals for actual direct medical education costs associated with services to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. This reimbursement shall be done pursuant to the same procedures as are applicable to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system (see paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(G) of this section). (iv) Base period and update factors. (A) Base period. The base period for calculating the hospital- specific and regional per diems, as described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section, is Federal fiscal year 1988. Base period calculations shall be based on actual claims paid during the period July 1, 1987 through May 31, 1988, trended forward to represent the 12-month period ending September 30, 1988 on the basis of the Medicare inpatient hospital market basket rate. (B) Alternative hospital-specific data base. Upon application of a higher volume hospital or unit to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, the hospital or unit may have its hospital-specific base period calculations based on claims with a date of discharge (rather than date of payment) between July 1, 1987 through May 31, 1988 if it has generally experienced unusual delays in claims payments and if the use of such an alternative data base would result in a difference in the per diem amount of at least $5.00. For this purpose, the unusual delays means that the hospital's or unit's average time period between date of discharge and date of payment is more than two standard deviations longer than the national average. (C) Update factors--(1) The hospital-specific per diems and the regional per diems calculated for the base period pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall remain in effect for federal fiscal year 1989; there will be no additional update for fiscal year 1989. (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(C)(3) of this section, for subsequent federal fiscal years, each per diem shall be updated by the Medicare update factor for hospitals and units exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system. (3) As an exception to the update required by paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(C)(2) of this section, all per diems in effect at the end of fiscal year 1995 shall remain in effect, with no additional update, throughout fiscal years 1996 and 1997. For fiscal year 1998 and thereafter, the per diems in effect at the end of fiscal year 1997 will be updated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(C)(2). (4) Hospitals and units with hospital-specific rates will be notified of their respective rates prior to the beginning of each Federal fiscal year. New hospitals shall be notified at such time as the hospital rate is determined. The actual amounts of each regional per diem that will apply in any Federal fiscal year shall be published in the Federal Register at approximately the start of that fiscal year. (v) Higher volume hospitals. This paragraph describes the classification of and other provisions pertinent to hospitals with a higher volume of CHAMPUS patients. (A) In general. Any hospital or unit that had an annual rate of 25 or more CHAMPUS discharges of CHAMPUS patients during the period July 1, 1987 [[Page 278]] through May 31, 1988 shall be considered a higher volume hospital has 25 or more CHAMPUS discharges, that hospital shall be considered to be a higher volume hospital during Federal fiscal year 1989 and all subsequent fiscal years. All other hospitals and units covered by the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system shall be considered lower volume hospitals. (B) Hospitals that subsequently become higher volume hospitals. In any Federal fiscal year in which a hospital, including a new hospital (see paragraph (a)(2)(v)(C) of this section), not previously classified as a higher volume hospital has 25 or more CHAMPUS discharges, that hospital shall be considered to be a higher volume hospital during the next Federal fiscal year and all subsequent fiscal years. The hospital specific per diem amount shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, except that the base period average daily charge shall be deemed to be the hospital's average daily charge in the year in which the hospital had 25 or more discharges, adjusted by the percentage change in average daily charges for all higher volume hospitals and units between the year in which the hospital had 25 or more CHAMPUS discharges and the base period. The base period amount, however, may not exceed the cap described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. (C) Special retrospective payment provision for new hospitals. For purposes of this paragraph, a new hospital is a hospital that qualifies for the Medicare exemption from the rate of increase ceiling applicable to new hospitals which are PPS-exempt psychiatric hospitals. Any new hospital that becomes a higher volume hospital, in addition to qualifying prospectively as a higher volume hospital for purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this section, may additionally, upon application to the Director, OCHAMPUS, receive a retrospective adjustment. The retrospective adjustment shall be calculated so that the hospital receives the same government share payments it would have received had it been designated a higher volume hospital for the federal fiscal year in which it first had 25 or more CHAMPUS discharges and the preceding fiscal year (if it had any CHAMPUS patients during the preceding fiscal year). Such new hospitals must agree not to bill CHAMPUS beneficiaries for any additional costs beyond that determined initially. (D) Review of classification. Any hospital or unit which OCHAMPUS erroneously fails to classify as a higher volume hospital may apply to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, for such a classification. The hospital shall have the burden of proof. (vi) Payment for hospital based professional services. Lower volume hospitals and units may not bill separately for hospital based professional mental health services; payment for those services is included in the per diems. Higher volume hospitals and units, whether they billed CHAMPUS separately for hospital based professional mental health services or included those services in the hospital's billing to CHAMPUS, shall continue the practice in effect during the period July 1, 1987 to May 31, 1988 (or other data base period used for calculating the hospital's or unit's per diem), except that any such hospital or unit may change its prior practice (and obtain an appropriate revision in its per diem) by providing to OCHAMPUS notice in accordance with procedures established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (vii) Leave days. CHAMPUS shall not pay for days where the patient is absent on leave from the specialty psychiatric hospital or unit. The hospital must identify these days when claiming reimbursement. CHAMPUS shall not count a patients's leave of absence as a discharge in determining whether a facility should be classified as a higher volume hospital pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section. (viii) Exemptions from the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system. The following providers and procedures are exempt from the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system. (A) Non-specialty providers. Providers of inpatient care which are not either psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric specialty units as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section are exempt from the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system. Such [[Page 279]] providers should refer to paragraph (a)(1) of this section for provisions pertinent to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. (B) DRG 424. Admissions for operating room procedures involving a principal diagnosis of mental illness (services which group into DRG 424) are exempt from the per diem payment system. They will be reimbursed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (C) Non-mental health services. Admissions for non-mental health procedures in specialty psychiatric hospitals and units are exempt from the per diem payment system. They will be reimbursed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (D) Sole community hospitals. Any hospital which has qualified for special treatment under the Medicare prospective payment system as a sole community hospital and has not given up that classification is exempt. (E) Hospitals outside the U.S. A hospital is exempt if it is not located in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia or Puerto Rico. (ix) Per diem payment for psychiatric and substance use disorder rehabilitation partial hospitalization services--(A) In general. Psychiatric and substance use disorder rehabilitation partial hospitalization services authorized by Sec. 199.4 (b)(10) and (e)(4) and provided by institutional providers authorized under Sec. 199.6 (b)(4)(xii) and (b)(4)(xiv), are reimbursed on the basis of prospectively determined, all-inclusive per diem rates. The per diem payment amount must be accepted as payment in full for all institutional services provided, including board, routine nursing services, ancillary services (includes art, music, dance, occupational and other such therapies), psychological testing and assessments, overhead and any other services for which the customary practice among similar providers is included as part of the institutional charges. (B) Services which may be billed separately. The following services are not considered as included within the per diem payment amount and may be separately billed when provided by an authorized independent professional provider: (1) Psychotherapy sessions not included. Professional services provided by an authorized professional provider (who is not employed by or under contract with the partial hospitalization program) for purposes of providing clinical patient care to a patient in the partial hospitalization program are not included in the per diem rate. They may be separately billed. Professional mental health benefits are limited to a maximum of one session (60 minutes individual, 90 minutes family, etc.) per authorized treatment day not to exceed five sessions in any calendar week. (2) Non-mental health related medical services. Those services not normally included in the evaluation and assessment of a partial hospitalization program, non-mental health related medical services, may be separately billed when provided by an authorized independent professional provider. This includes ambulance services when medically necessary for emergency transport. (C) Per diem rate. For any full day partial hospitalization program (minimum of 6 hours), the maximum per diem payment amount is 40 percent of the average inpatient per diem amount per case established under the CHAMPUS mental health per diem reimbursement system for both high and low volume psychiatric hospitals and units (as defined in Sec. 199.14(a)(2)) for the fiscal year. A partial hospitalization program of less than 6 hours (with a minimum of three hours) will be paid a per diem rate of 75 percent of the rate for a full-day program. (D) Other requirements. No payment is due for leave days, for days in which treatment is not provided, or for days in which the duration of the program services was less than three hours. (3) Billed charges and set rates. The allowable costs for authorized care in all hospitals not subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system or the CHAMPUS mental health per diem payment system shall be determined on the basis of billed charges or set rates. Under this procedure the allowable costs may not exceed the lower of: (i) The actual charge for such service made to the general public; or (ii) The allowed charge applicable to the policyholders or subscribers of the [[Page 280]] CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary for comparable services under comparable circumstances, when extended to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by consent or agreement; or (iii) The allowed charge applicable to the citizens of the community or state as established by local or state regulatory authority, excluding title XIX of the Social Security Act or other welfare program, when extended to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by consent or agreement. (4) CHAMPUS discount rates. The CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost for authorized care in any hospital may be based on discount rates established under paragraph (i) of this section. (5) Hospital outpatient services. This paragraph (a)(5) establishes payment methods for certain outpatient services, including emergency services, provided by hospitals. (i) Clinical laboratory services. Services provided on an outpatient basis by hospital-based clinical laboratories are paid on the same basis as services covered by the allowable charge method under paragraph (h)(1)(viii) of this section. (ii) Rehabilitation therapy services. Rehabilitation therapy services provided on an outpatient basis by hospitals are paid on the same basis as rehabilitation therapy services covered by the allowable charge method under paragraph (h)(1) of this section. (iii) Venipuncture. Routine venipuncture services provided on an outpatient basis by hospitals are paid on the same basis as such services covered by the allowable charge method under paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Routine venipuncture services provided on an outpatient basis by institutional providers other than hospitals are also paid on this basis. (iv) Radiology services. TRICARE payments for hospital outpatient radiology services are based on the allowable charge method under paragraph (h)(1) of the section in the case of radiology services for which the CMAC rates establish under that paragraph provide a payment rate for the technical component of the radiology services provided. Hospital charges for an outpatient radiology service are reimbursed using the CMAC technical component rate. (b) Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). (1) Use of Medicare prospective payment system and rates. TRICARE payments to SNFs are determined using the same methods and rates used under the Medicare prospective payment system for SNFs under 42 CFR part 413, subpart J, except for children under age ten. SNFs receive a per diem payment of a predetermined Federal payment rate appropriate for the case based on patient classification (using the RUG classification system), urban or rural location of the facility, and area wage index. (2) Payment in full. The SNF payment rates represent payment in full (subject to any applicable beneficiary cost shares) for all costs (routine, ancillary, and capital-related) associated with furnishing inpatient SNF services to TRICARE beneficiaries other than costs associated with operating approved educational activities. (3) Education costs. Costs for approved educational activities shall be subject to separate payment under procedures established by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity. Such procedures shall be similar to procedures for payments for direct medical education costs of hospitals under paragraph (a)(1)(iii)(G)(2) of this section. (4) Resident assessment data. SNFs are required to submit the same resident assessment data as is required under the Medicare program. (The residential assessment is addressed in the Medicare regulations at 42 CFR 483.20.) SNFs must submit assessments according to an assessment schedule. This schedule must include performance of patient assessments on the 5th, 14th, and 30th days of SNF care and at each successive 30 day interval of SNF admissions that are longer than 30 days. It must also include such other assessments that are necessary to account for changes in patient care needs. TRICARE pays a default rate for the days of a patient's care for which the SNF has failed to comply with the assessment schedule. (c) Reimbursement for Other Than Hospitals and SNFs. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall establish such other methods of determining [[Page 281]] allowable cost or charge reimbursement for those institutions, other than hospitals and SNFs, as may be required. (d) Payment of institutional facility costs for ambulatory surgery. (1) In general. CHAMPUS pays institutional facility costs for ambulatory surgery on the basis of prospectively determined amounts, as provided in this paragraph. This payment method is similar to that used by the Medicare program for ambulatory surgery. This paragraph applies to payment for institutional charges for ambulatory surgery provided in hospitals and freestanding ambulatory surgical centers. It does not apply to professional services. A list of ambulatory surgery procedures subject to the payment method set forth in this paragraph shall be published periodically by the Director, OCHAMPUS. Payment to freestanding ambulatory surgery centers is limited to these procedures. (2) Payment in full. The payment provided for under this paragraph is the payment in full for services covered by this paragraph. Facilities may not charge beneficiaries for amounts, if any, in excess of the payment amounts determined pursuant to this paragraph. (3) Calculation of standard payment rates. Standard payment rates are calculated for groups of procedures under the following steps: (i) Step 1: Calculate a median standardized cost for each procedure. For each ambulatory surgery procedure, a median standardized cost will be calculated on the basis of all ambulatory surgery charges nationally under CHAMPUS during a recent one-year base period. The steps in this calculation include standardizing for local labor costs by reference to the same wage index and labor/non-labor-related cost ratio as applies to the facility under Medicare, applying a cost-to-charge ratio, calculating a median cost for each procedure, and updating to the year for which the payment rates will be in effect by the Consumer Price Index-Urban. In applying a cost-to-charge ratio, the Medicare cost-to- charge ratio for freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (FASCs) will be used for all charges from FASCs, and the Medicare cost-to-charge ratio for hospital outpatient settings will be used for all charges from hospitals. (ii) Step 2: Grouping procedures. Procedures will then be placed into one of ten groups by their median per procedure cost, starting with $0 to $299 for group 1 and ending with $1000 to $1299 for group 9 and $1300 and above for group 10, with groups 2 through 8 set on the basis of $100 fixed intervals. (iii) Step 3: Adjustments to groups. The Director, OCHAMPUS may make adjustments to the groupings resulting from step 2 to account for any ambulatory surgery procedures for which there were insufficient data to allow a grouping or to correct for any anomalies resulting from data or statistical factors or other special factors that fairness requires be specially recognized. In making any such adjustments, the Director may take into consideration the placing of particular procedures in the ambulatory surgery groups under Medicare. (iv) Step 4: standard payment amount per group. The standard payment amount per group will be the volume weighted median per procedure cost for the procedures in that group. For cases in which the standard payment amount per group exceeds the CHAMPUS-determined inpatient allowable amount, the Director, TSO or his designee, may make adjustments. (v) Step 5: Actual payments. Actual payment for a procedure will be the standard payment amount for the group which covers that procedure, adjusted for local labor costs by reference to the same labor/non-labor- related cost ratio and hospital wage index as used for ambulatory surgery centers by Medicare. (4) Multiple procedures. In cases in which authorized multiple procedures are performed during the same operative session, payment shall be based on 100 percent of the payment amount for the procedure with the highest ambulatory surgery payment amount, plus, for each other procedure performed during the session, 50 percent of its payment amount. (5) Annual updates. The standard payment amounts will be updated annually by the same update factor as is used in the Medicare annual updates [[Page 282]] for ambulatory surgery center payments. (6) Recalculation of rates. The Director, OCHAMPUS may periodically recalculate standard payment rates for ambulatory surgery using the steps set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. (e) Reimbursement of Birthing Centers. (1) Reimbursement for maternity care and childbirth services furnished by an authorized birthing center shall be limited to the lower of the CHAMPUS established all-inclusive rate or the center's most- favored all-inclusive rate. (2) The all-inclusive rate shall include the following to the extent that they are usually associated with a normal pregnancy and childbirth: Laboratory studies, prenatal management, labor management, delivery, post-partum management, newborn care, birth assistant, certified nurse- midwife professional services, physician professional services, and the use of the facility. (3) The CHAMPUS established all-inclusive rate is equal to the sum of the CHAMPUS area prevailing professional charge for total obstetrical care for a normal pregnancy and delivery and the sum of the average CHAMPUS allowable institutional charges for supplies, laboratory, and delivery room for a hospital inpatient normal delivery. The CHAMPUS established all-inclusive rate areas will coincide with those established for prevailing professional charges and will be updated concurrently with the CHAMPUS area prevailing professional charge database. (4) Extraordinary maternity care services, when otherwise authorized, may be reimbursed at the lesser of the billed charge or the CHAMPUS allowable charge. (5) Reimbursement for an incomplete course of care will be limited to claims for professional services and tests where the beneficiary has been screened but rejected for admission into the birthing center program, or where the woman has been admitted but is discharged from the birthing center program prior to delivery, adjudicated as individual professional services and items. (6) The beneficiary's share of the total reimbursement to a birthing center is limited to the cost-share amount plus the amount billed for non-covered services and supplies. (f) Reimbursement of Residential Treatment Centers. The CHAMPUS rate is the per diem rate that CHAMPUS will authorize for all mental health services rendered to a patient and the patient's family as part of the total treatment plan submitted by a CHAMPUS-approved RTC, and approved by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee. (1) The all-inclusive per diem rate for RTCs operating or participating in CHAMPUS during the base period of July 1, 1987, through June 30, 1988, will be the lowest of the following conditions: (i) The CHAMPUS rate paid to the RTC for all-inclusive services as of June 30, 1988, adjusted by the Consumer Price Index--Urban (CPI-U) for medical care as determined applicable by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee; or (ii) The per diem rate accepted by the RTC from any other agency or organization (public or private) that is high enough to cover one-third of the total patient days during the 12-month period ending June 30, 1988, adjusted by the CPI-U; or Note: The per diem rate accepted by the RTC from any other agency or organization includes the rates accepted from entities such as Government contractors in CHAMPUS demonstration projects. (iii) An OCHAMPUS determined capped per diem amount not to exceed the 80th percentile of all established CHAMPUS RTC rates nationally, weighted by total CHAMPUS days provided at each rate during the base period discussed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. (2) The all-inclusive per diem rates for RTCs which began operation after June 30, 1988, or began operation before July 1, 1988, but had less than 6 months of operation by June 30, 1988, will be calculated based on the lower of the per diem rate accepted by the RTC that is high enough to cover one-third of the total patient days during its first 6 to 12 consecutive months of operation, or the CHAMPUS determined capped amount. Rates for RTCs beginning operation prior to July 1, 1988, will be adjusted by an appropriate CPI-U inflation factor for the period ending June [[Page 283]] 30, 1988. A period of less than 12 months will be used only when the RTC has been in operation for less than 12 months. Once a full 12 months is available, the rate will be recalculated. (3) For care on or after April 6, 1995, the per diem amount may not exceed a cap of the 70th percentile of all established Federal fiscal year 1994 RTC rates nationally, weighted by total CHAMPUS days provided at each rate during the first half of Federal fiscal year 1994, and updated to FY95. For Federal fiscal years 1996 and 1997, the cap shall remain unchanged. For Federal fiscal years after fiscal year 1997, the cap shall be adjusted by the Medicare update factor for hospitals and units exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system. (4) All educational costs, whether they include routine education or special education costs, are excluded from reimbursement except when appropriate education is not available from, or not payable by, a cognizant public entity. (i) The RTC shall exclude educational costs from its daily costs. (ii) The RTC's accounting system must be adequate to assure CHAMPUS is not billed for educational costs. (iii) The RTC may request payment of educational costs on an individual case basis from the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, when appropriate education is not available from, or not payable by, a cognizant public entity. To qualify for reimbursement of educational costs in individual cases, the RTC shall comply with the application procedures established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, including, but not limited to, the following: (A) As part of its admission procedures, the RTC must counsel and assist the beneficiary and the beneficiary's family in the necessary procedures for assuring their rights to a free and appropriate public education. (B) The RTC must document any reasons why an individual beneficiary cannot attend public educational facilities and, in such a case, why alternative educational arrangements have not been provided by the cognizant public entity. (C) If reimbursement of educational costs is approved for an individual beneficiary by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, such educational costs shall be shown separately from the RTC's daily costs on the CHAMPUS claim. The amount paid shall not exceed the RTC's most- favorable rate to any other patient, agency, or organization for special or general educational services whichever is appropriate. (D) If the RTC fails to request CHAMPUS approval of the educational costs on an individual case, the RTC agrees not to bill the beneficiary or the beneficiary's family for any amounts disallowed by CHAMPUS. Requests for payment of educational costs must be referred to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee for review and a determination of the applicability of CHAMPUS benefits. (5) Subject to the applicable RTC cap, adjustments to the RTC rates may be made annually. (i) For Federal fiscal years through 1995, the adjustment shall be based on the Consumer Price Index-Urban (CPI-U) for medical care as determined applicable by the Director, OCHAMPUS. (ii) For purposes of rates for Federal fiscal years 1996 and 1997: (A) For any RTC whose 1995 rate was at or above the thirtieth percentile of all established Federal fiscal year 1995 RTC rates normally, weighted by total CHAMPUS days provided at each rate during the first half of Federal fiscal year 1994, that rate shall remain in effect, with no additional update, throughout fiscal years 1996 and 1997; and (B) For any RTC whose 1995 rate was below the 30th percentile level determined under paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, the rate shall be adjusted by the lesser of: the CPI-U for medical care, or the amount that brings the rate up to that 30th percentile level. (iii) For subsequent Federal fiscal years after fiscal year 1997, RTC rates shall be updated by the Medicare update factor for hospitals and units exempt from the Medicare prospective payment system. (6) For care provided on or after July 1, 1995, CHAMPUS will not pay for days in which the patient is absent on leave from the RTC. The RTC must identify [[Page 284]] these days when claiming reimbursement. (g) Reimbursement of hospice programs. Hospice care will be reimbursed at one of four predetermined national CHAMPUS rates based on the type and intensity of services furnished to the beneficiary. A single rate is applicable for each day of care except for continuous home care where payment is based on the number of hours of care furnished during a 24-hour period. These rates will be adjusted for regional differences in wages using wage indices for hospice care. (1) National hospice rates. CHAMPUS will use the national hospice rates for reimbursement of each of the following levels of care provided by or under arrangement with a CHAMPUS approved hospice program: (i) Routine home care. The hospice will be paid the routine home care rate for each day the patient is at home, under the care of the hospice, and not receiving continuous home care. This rate is paid without regard to the volume or intensity of routine home care services provided on any given day. (ii) Continuous home care. The hospice will be paid the continuous home care rate when continuous home care is provided. The continuous home care rate is divided by 24 hours in order to arrive at an hourly rate. (A) A minimum of 8 hours of care must be provided within a 24-hour day starting and ending at midnight. (B) More than half of the total actual hours being billed for each 24-hour period must be provided by either a registered or licensed practical nurse. (C) Homemaker and home health aide services may be provided to supplement the nursing care to enable the beneficiary to remain at home. (D) For every hour or part of an hour of continuous care furnished, the hourly rate will be reimbursed to the hospice up to 24 hours a day. (iii) Inpatient respite care. The hospice will be paid at the inpatient respite care rate for each day on which the beneficiary is in an approved inpatient facility and is receiving respite care. (A) Payment for respite care may be made for a maximum of 5 days at a time, including the date of admission but not counting the date of discharge. The necessity and frequency of respite care will be determined by the hospice interdisciplinary group with input from the patient's attending physician and the hospice's medical director. (B) Payment for the sixth and any subsequent days is to be made at the routine home care rate. (iv) General inpatient care. Payment at the inpatient rate will be made when general inpatient care is provided for pain control or acute or chronic symptom management which cannot be managed in other settings. None of the other fixed payment rates (i.e., routine home care) will be applicable for a day on which the patient receives general inpatient care except on the date of discharge. (v) Date of discharge. For the day of discharge from an inpatient unit, the appropriate home care rate is to be paid unless the patient dies as an inpatient. When the patient is discharged deceased, the inpatient rate (general or respite) is to be paid for the discharge date. (2) Use of Medicare rates. CHAMPUS will use the most current Medicare rates to reimburse hospice programs for services provided to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. It is CHAMPUS' intent to adopt changes in the Medicare reimbursement methodology as they occur; e.g., Medicare's adoption of an updated, more accurate wage index. (3) Physician reimbursement. Payment is dependent on the physician's relationship with both the beneficiary and the hospice program. (i) Physicians employed by, or contracted with, the hospice. (A) Administrative and supervisory activities (i.e., establishment, review and updating of plans of care, supervising care and services, and establishing governing policies) are included in the adjusted national payment rate. (B) Direct patient care services are paid in addition to the adjusted national payment rate. (1) Physician services will be reimbursed an amount equivalent to 100 percent of the CHAMPUS' allowable charge; i.e., there will be no cost-sharing and/or deductibles for hospice physician services. (2) Physician payments will be counted toward the hospice cap limitation. [[Page 285]] (ii) Independent attending physician. Patient care services rendered by an independent attending physician (a physician who is not considered employed by or under contract with the hospice) are not part of the hospice benefit. (A) Attending physician may bill in his/her own right. (B) Services will be subject to the appropriate allowable charge methodology. (C) Reimbursement is not counted toward the hospice cap limitation. (D) Services provided by an independent attending physician must be coordinated with any direct care services provided by hospice physicians. (E) The hospice must notify the CHAMPUS contractor of the name of the physician whenever the attending physician is not a hospice employee. (iii) Voluntary physician services. No payment will be allowed for physician services furnished voluntarily (both physicians employed by, and under contract with, the hospice and independent attending physicians). Physicians may not discriminate against CHAMPUS beneficiaries; e.g., designate all services rendered to non-CHAMPUS patients as volunteer and at the same time bill for CHAMPUS patients. (4) Unrelated medical treatment. Any covered CHAMPUS services not related to the treatment of the terminal condition for which hospice care was elected will be paid in accordance with standard reimbursement methodologies; i.e., payment for these services will be subject to standard deductible and cost-sharing provisions under the CHAMPUS. A determination must be made whether or not services provided are related to the individual's terminal illness. Many illnesses may occur when an individual is terminally ill which are brought on by the underlying condition of the ill patient. For example, it is not unusual for a terminally ill patient to develop pneumonia or some other illness as a result of his or her weakened condition. Similarly, the setting of bones after fractures occur in a bone cancer patient would be treatment of a related condition. Thus, if the treatment or control of an upper respiratory tract infection is due to the weakened state of the terminal patient, it will be considered a related condition, and as such, will be included in the hospice daily rates. (5) Cap amount. Each CHAMPUS-approved hospice program will be subject to a cap on aggregate CHAMPUS payments from November 1 through October 31 of each year, hereafter known as ``the cap period.'' (i) The cap amount will be adjusted annually by the percent of increase or decrease in the medical expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI-U). (ii) The aggregate cap amount (i.e., the statutory cap amount times the number of CHAMPUS beneficiaries electing hospice care during the cap period) will be compared with total actual CHAMPUS payments made during the same cap period. (iii) Payments in excess of the cap amount must be refunded by the hospice program. The adjusted cap amount will be obtained from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) prior to the end of each cap period. (iv) Calculation of the cap amount for a hospice which has not participated in the program for an entire cap year (November 1 through October 31) will be based on a period of at least 12 months but no more than 23 months. For example, the first cap period for a hospice entering the program on October 1, 1994, would run from October 1, 1994 through October 31, 1995. Similarly, the first cap period for hospice providers entering the program after November 1, 1993 but before November 1, 1994 would end October 31, 1995. (6) Inpatient limitation. During the 12-month period beginning November 1 of each year and ending October 31, the aggregate number of inpatient days, both for general inpatient care and respite care, may not exceed 20 percent of the aggregate total number of days of hospice care provided to all CHAMPUS beneficiaries during the same period. (i) If the number of days of inpatient care furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries exceeds 20 percent of the total days of hospice care to CHAMPUS beneficiaries, the total payment for inpatient care is determined follows: (A) Calculate the ratio of the maximum number of allowable inpatient [[Page 286]] days of the actual number of inpatient care days furnished by the hospice to Medicare patients. (B) Multiply this ratio by the total reimbursement for inpatient care made by the CHAMPUS contractor. (C) Multiply the number of actual inpatient days in excess of the limitation by the routine home care rate. (D) Add the amounts calculated in paragraphs (g)(6)(i) (B) and (C) of this section. (ii) Compare the total payment for inpatient care calculated in paragraph (g)(6)(i)(D) of this section to actual payments made to the hospice for inpatient care during the cap period. (iii) Payments in excess of the inpatient limitation must be refunded by the hospice program. (7) Hospice reporting responsibilities. The hospice is responsible for reporting the following data within 30 days after the end of the cap period: (i) Total reimbursement received and receivable for services furnished CHAMPUS beneficiaries during the cap period, including physician's services not of an administrative or general supervisory nature. (ii) Total reimbursement received and receivable for general inpatient care and inpatient respite care furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries during the cap period. (iii) Total number of inpatient days furnished to CHAMPUS hospice patients (both general inpatient and inpatient respite days) during the cap period. (iv) Total number of CHAMPUS hospice days (both inpatient and home care) during the cap period. (v) Total number of beneficiaries electing hospice care. The following rules must be adhered to by the hospice in determining the number of CHAMPUS beneficiaries who have elected hospice care during the period: (A) The beneficiary must not have been counted previously in either another hospice's cap or another reporting year. (B) The beneficiary must file an initial election statement during the period beginning September 28 of the previous cap year through September 27 of the current cap year in order to be counted as an electing CHAMPUS beneficiary during the current cap year. (C) Once a beneficiary has been included in the calculation of a hospice cap amount, he or she may not be included in the cap for that hospice again, even if the number of covered days in a subsequent reporting period exceeds that of the period where the beneficiary was included. (D) There will be proportional application of the cap amount when a beneficiary elects to receive hospice benefits from two or more different CHAMPUS-certified hospices. A calculation must be made to determine the percentage of the patient's length of stay in each hospice relative to the total length of hospice stay. (8) Reconsideration of cap amount and inpatient limit. A hospice dissatisfied with the contractor's calculation and application of its cap amount and/or inpatient limitation may request and obtain a contractor review if the amount of program reimbursement in controversy--with respect to matters which the hospice has a right to review--is at least $1000. The administrative review by the contractor of the calculation and application of the cap amount and inpatient limitation is the only administrative review available. These calculations are not subject to the appeal procedures set forth in Sec. 199.10. The methods and standards for calculation of the hospice payment rates established by CHAMPUS, as well as questions as to the validity of the applicable law, regulations or CHAMPUS decisions, are not subject to administrative review, including the appeal procedures of Sec. 199.10. (9) Beneficiary cost-sharing. There are no deductibles under the CHAMPUS hospice benefit. CHAMPUS pays the full cost of all covered services for the terminal illness, except for small cost-share amounts which may be collected by the individual hospice for outpatient drugs and biologicals and inpatient respite care. (i) The patient is responsible for 5 percent of the cost of outpatient drugs or $5 toward each prescription, whichever is less. Additionally, the cost of prescription drugs (drugs or biologicals) may not exceed that which a prudent buyer would pay in similar [[Page 287]] circumstances; that is, a buyer who refuses to pay more than the going price for an item or service and also seeks to economize by minimizing costs. (ii) For inpatient respite care, the cost-share for each respite care day is equal to 5 percent of the amount CHAMPUS has estimated to be the cost of respite care, after adjusting the national rate for local wage differences. (iii) The amount of the individual cost-share liability for respite care during a hospice cost-share period may not exceed the Medicare inpatient hospital deductible applicable for the year in which the hospice cost-share period began. The individual hospice cost-share period begins on the first day an election is in effect for the beneficiary and ends with the close of the first period of 14 consecutive days on each of which an election is not in effect for the beneficiary. (h) Reimbursement of Home Health Agencies (HHAs). HHAs will be reimbursed using the same methods and rates as used under the Medicare HHA prospective payment system under section 1895 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395fff) and 42 CFR part 484, subpart E, except for children under age ten and except as otherwise necessary to recognize distinct characteristics of TRICARE beneficiaries and as described in instructions issued by the Director, TMA. Under this methodology, an HHA will receive a fixed case-mix and wage-adjusted national 60-day episode payment amount as payment in full for all costs associated with furnishing home health services to TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries with the exception of osteoporosis drugs and DME. The full case-mix and wage- adjusted 60-day episode amount will be payment in full subject to the following adjustments and additional payments: (1) Split percentage payments. The initial percentage payment for initial episodes is paid to an HHA at 60 percent of the case-mix and wage adjusted 60-day episode rate. The residual final payment for initial episodes is paid at 40 percent of the case-mix and wage adjusted 60-day episode rate. The initial percentage payment for subsequent episodes is paid at 50 percent of the case-mix and wage-adjusted 60-day episode rate. The residual final payment for subsequent episodes is paid at 50 percent of the case-mix and wage-adjusted 60-day episode rate. (2) Low-utilization payment. A low utilization payment is applied when a HHA furnishes four or fewer visits to a beneficiary during the 60-day episode. The visits are paid at the national per-visit amount by discipline updated annually by the applicable market basket for each visit type. (3) Partial episode payment (PEP). A PEP adjustment is used for payment of an episode of less than 60 days resulting from a beneficiary's elected transfer prior to the end of the 60-day episode or discharge and readmission of a beneficiary to the same HHA before the end of the 60-day episode. The PEP payment is calculated by multiplying the proportion of the 60-day episode during which the beneficiary remained under the care of the original HHA by the beneficiary's assigned 60-day episode payment. (4) Significant change in condition (SCIC). The full-episode payment amount is adjusted if a beneficiary experiences a significant change in condition during the 60-day episode that was not envisioned in the initial treatment plan. The total significant change in condition payment adjustment is a proportional payment adjustment reflecting the time both prior to and after the patient experienced a significant change in condition during the 60-day episode. The initial percentage payment provided at the start of the 60-day episode will be adjusted at the end of the episode to reflect the first and second parts of the total SCIC adjustment determined at the end of the 60-day episode. The SCIC payment adjustment is calculated in two parts: (i) The first part of the SCIC payment adjustment reflects the adjustment to the level of payment prior to the significant change in the patient's condition during the 60-day episode. (ii) The second part of the SCIC payment adjustment reflects the adjustment to the level of payment after the significant change in the patient's condition occurs during the 60-day episode. (5) Outlier payment. Outlier payments are allowed in addition to regular 60-day episode payments for beneficiaries [[Page 288]] generating excessively high treatment costs. The outlier payment is a proportion of the imputed costs beyond the outlier threshold for each case-mix (HHRG) group. (6) Services paid outside the HHA prospective payment system. The following are services that receive a separate payment amount in addition to the prospective payment amount for home health services: (i) Durable medical equipment (DME). Reimbursement of DME is based on the same amounts established under the Medicare Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) fee schedule under 42 CFR part 414, subpart D. (ii) Osteoporosis drugs. Although osteoporosis drugs are subject to home health consolidated billing, they continue to be paid on a cost basis, in addition to episode payments. (7) Accelerated payments. Upon request, an accelerated payment may be made to an HHA that is receiving payment under the home health prospective payment system if the HHA is experiencing financial difficulties because there is a delay by the contractor in making payment to the HHA. The following are criteria for making accelerated payments: (i) Approval of payment. An HHA's request for an accelerated payment must be approved by the contractor and TRICARE Management Activity (TMA). (ii) Amount of payment. The amount of the accelerated payment is computed as a percentage of the net payment for unbilled or unpaid covered services. (iii) Recovery of payment. Recovery of the accelerated payment is made by recoupment as HHA bills are processed or by direct payment by the HHA. (8) Assessment data. Beneficiary assessment data, incorporating the use of the current version of the OASIS items, must be submitted to the contractor for payment under the HHA prospective payment system. (9) Administrative review. An HHA is not entitled to judicial or administrative review with regard to: (i) Establishment of the payment unit, including the national 60-day prospective episode payment rate, adjustments and outlier payment. (ii) Establishment of transition period, definition and application of the unit of payment. (iii) Computation of the initial standard prospective payment amounts. (iv) Establishment of case-mix and area wage adjustment factors. (i) Changes in Federal Law affecting Medicare. With regard to paragraph (b) and (h) of this section, the Department of Defense must, within the time frame specified in law and to the extent it is practicable, bring the TRICARE program into compliance with any changes in Federal Law affecting the Medicare program that occur after the effective date of the DoD rule to implement the prospective payment systems for skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies. (j) Reimbursement of individual health care professionals and other non-institutional, non-professional provers. The CHAMPUS-determined reasonable charge (the amount allowed by CHAMPUS) for the service of an individual health care professional or other non-institutional, non- professional provider (even if employed by or under contract to an institutional provider) shall be determined by one of the following methodologies, that is, whichever is in effect in the specific geographic location at the time covered services and supplies are provided to a CHAMPUS beneficiary. (1) Allowable charge method--(i) Introduction--(A) In general. The allowable charge method is the preferred and primary method for reimbursement of individual health care professionals and other non- institutional health care providers (covered by 10 U.S.C. 1079(h)(1)). The allowable charge for authorized care shall be the lower of the billed charge or the local CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge (CMAC). (B) CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge. Beginning in calendar year 1992, prevailing charge levels and appropriate charge levels will be calculated on a national level. There will then be calculated a national CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge (CMAC) level for each procedure, which shall be the lesser of the national prevailing charge level or the [[Page 289]] national appropriate charge level. The national CMAC will then be adjusted for localities in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section. (C) Limits on balance billing by nonparticipating providers. Nonparticipating providers may not balance bill a beneficiary an amount which exceeds the applicable balance billing limit. The balance billing limit shall be the same percentage as the Medicare limiting charge percentage for nonparticipating physicians. The balance billing limit may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS on a case-by-case basis if requested by the CHAMPUS beneficiary (or sponsor) involved. A decision by the Director to waive or not waive the limit in any particular case is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of Sec. 199.10. (D) Special rule for TRICARE Prime Enrollees. In the case of a TRICARE Prime enrollee (see section 199.17) who receives authorized care from a non-participating provider, the CHAMPUS determined reasonable charge will be the CMAC level as established in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section plus any balance billing amount up to the balance billing limit as referred to in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(C) of this section. The authorization for such care shall be pursuant to the procedures established by the Director, OCHAMPUS (also referred to as the TRICARE Support Office). (ii) Prevailing charge level. (A) Beginning in calendar year 1992, the prevailing charge level shall be calculated on a national basis. (B) The national prevailing charge level referred to in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(A) of this section is the level that does not exceed the amount equivalent to the 80th percentile of billed charges made for similar services during the base period. The 80th percentile of charges shall be determined on the basis of statistical data and methodology acceptable to the Director, OCHAMPUS (or a designee). (C) For purposes of paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the base period shall be a period of 12 calendar months and shall be adjusted once a year, unless the Director, OCHAMPUS, determines that a different period for adjustment is appropriate and publishes a notice to that effect in the Federal Register. (iii) Appropriate charge level. Beginning in calendar year 1992, the appropriate charge level shall be calculated on a national basis. The appropriate charge level for each procedure is the product of the two- step process set forth in paragraphs (g)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. This process involves comparing the prior year's CMAC with the fully phased in Medicare fee. For years after the Medicare fee has been fully phased in, the comparison shall be to the current year Medicare fee. For any particular procedure for which comparable Medicare fee and CHAMPUS data are unavailable, but for which alternative data are available that the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee) determines provide a reasonable approximation of relative value or price, the comparison may be based on such alternative data. (A) Step 1: Procedures classified. All procedures are classified into one of three categories, as follows: (1) Overpriced procedures. These are the procedures for which the prior year's national CMAC exceeds the Medicare fee. (2) Other procedures. These are procedures subject to the allowable charge method that are not included in either the overpriced procedures group or the underpriced procedures group. (3) Underpriced procedures. These are the procedures for which the prior year's national CMAC is less than the Medicare fee. (B) Step 2: Calculating appropriate charge levels. For each year, appropriate charge levels will be calculated by adjusting the prior year's CMAC as follows: (1) For overpriced procedures, the appropriate charge level for each procedure shall be the prior year's CMAC, reduced by the lesser of: the percentage by which it exceeds the Medicare fee or fifteen percent. (2) For other procedures, the appropriate charge level for each procedure shall be the same as the prior year's CMAC. (3) For underpriced procedures, the appropriate charge level for each procedure shall be the prior year's CMAC, [[Page 290]] increased by the lesser of: the percentage by which it is exceeded by the Medicare fee or the Medicare Economic Index. (C) Special rule for cases in which the CHAMPUS appropriate charge was prematurely reduced. In any case in which a recalculation of the Medicare fee results in a Medicare rate higher than the CHAMPUS appropriate charge for a procedure that had been considered an overpriced procedure, the reduction in the CHAMPUS appropriate charge shall be restored up to the level of the recalculated Medicare rate. (D) Special rule for cases in which the national CMAC is less than the Medicare rate. Note: This paragraph will be implemented when CMAC rates are published. In any case in which the national CMAC calculated in accordance with paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section is less than the Medicare rate, the Director, TSO, may determine that the use of the Medicare Economic Index under paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(B) of this section will result in a CMAC rate below the level necessary to assure that beneficiaries will retain adequate access to health care services. Upon making such a determination, the Director, TSO, may increase the national CMAC to a level not greater than the Medicare rate. (iv) Calculating CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge levels for localities. (A) In general. The national CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge level for each procedure will be adjusted for localities using the same (or similar) geographical areas and the same geographic adjustment factors as are used for determining allowable charges under Medicare. (B) Special locality-based phase-in provision. (1) In general. Beginning with the recalculation of CMACS for calendar year 1993, the CMAC in a locality will not be less than 72.25 percent of the maximum charge level in effect for that locality on December 31, 1991. For recalculations of CMACs for calendar years after 1993, the CMAC in a locality will not be less than 85 percent of the CMAC in effect for that locality at the end of the prior calendar year. (2) Exception. The special locality-based phase-in provision established by paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(B)(1) of this section shall not be applicable in the case of any procedure code for which there were not CHAMPUS claims in the locality accounting for at least 50 services. (C) Special locality-based waivers of reductions to assure adequate access to care. Beginning with the recalculation of CMACs for calendar year 1993, in the case of any procedure classified as an overpriced procedure pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(iii)(A)(1) of this section, a reduction in the CMAC in a locality below the level in effect at the end of the previous calendar year that would otherwise occur pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1)(iii) and (g)(1)(iv) of this section may be waived pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(iii)(C) of this section. (1) Waiver based on balanced billing rates. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(C)(2) of this section such a reduction will be waived if there has been excessive balance billing in the locality for the procedure involved. For this purpose, the extent of balance billing will be determined based on a review of all services under the procedure code involved in the prior year (or most recent period for which data are available). If the number of services for which balance billing was not required was less than 60 percent of all services provided, the Director will determine that there was excessive balance billing with respect to that procedure in that locality and will waive the reduction in the CMAC that would otherwise occur. A decision by the Director to waive or not waive the reduction is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of Sec. 199.10. (2) Exception. As an exception to the paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(C)(1) of this section, the waiver required by that paragraph shall not be applicable in the case of any procedure code for which there were not CHAMPUS claims in the locality accounting for at least 50 services. A waiver may, however, be granted in such cases pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(C)(3) of this section. (3) Waiver based on other evidence that adequate access to care would be impaired. The Director, OCHAMPUS may waive a reduction that would otherwise [[Page 291]] occur (or restore a reduction that was already taken) if the Director determines that available evidence shows that the reduction would impair adequate access. For this purpose, such evidence may include consideration of the number of providers in the locality who provide the affected services, the number of such providers who are CHAMPUS Participating Providers, the number of CHAMPUS beneficiaries in the area, and other relevant factors. Providers or beneficiaries in a locality may submit to the Director, OCHAMPUS a petition, together with appropriate documentation regarding relevant factors, for a determination that adequate access would be impaired. The Director, OCHAMPUS will consider and respond to all such petitions. Petitions may be filed at any time. Any petition received by the date which is 120 days prior to the implementation of a recalculation of CMACs will be assured of consideration prior to that implementation. The Director, OCHAMPUS may establish procedures for handling petitions. A decision by the Director to waive or not waive a reduction is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of Sec. 199.10. (D) Special locality-based exception to applicable CMACs to assure adequate beneficiary access to care. In addition to the authority to waive reductions under paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, the Director may authorize establishment of higher payment rates for specific services than would otherwise be allowable, under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, if the Director determines that available evidence shows that access to health care services is severely impaired. For this purpose, such evidence may include consideration of the number of providers in the locality who provide the affected services, the number of providers who are CHAMPUS participating providers, the number of CHAMPUS beneficiaries in the locality, the availability of military providers in the location or nearby, and any other factors the Director determines relevant. (1) Procedure. Providers or beneficiaries in a locality may submit to the Director, a petition, together with appropriate documentation regarding relevant factors, for a determination that adequate access to health care services is severely impaired. The Director, will consider and respond to all petitions. A decision to authorize a higher payment amount is subject to review and determination or modification by the Director at any time if circumstances change so that adequate access to health care services would no longer be severely impaired. A decision by the Director, to authorize, not authorize, terminate, or modify authorization of higher payment amounts is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of Sec. 199.10 of the part. (2) Establishing the higher payment rate(s). When the Director, determines that beneficiary access to health care services in a locality is severely impaired, the Director may establish the higher payment rate(s) as he or she deems appropriate and cost-effective through one of the following methodologies to assure adequate access: (i) A percent factor may be added to the otherwise applicable payment amount allowable under paragraph (h)(1) of this section; (ii) A prevailing charge may be calculated, by applying the prevailing charge methodology of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section to a specific locality (which need not be the same as the localities used for purposes of paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(A) of this section; or another government payment rate may be adopted, for example, an applicable state Medicaid rate). (3) Application of higher payment rates. Higher payment rates defined under paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(D) of this section may be applied to all similar services performed in a locality, or, if circumstances warrant, a new locality may be defined for application of the higher payments. Establishment of a new locality may be undertaken where access impairment is localized and not pervasive across the existing locality. Generally, establishment of a new, more specific locality will occur when the area is remote so that geographical characteristics and other factors significantly impair transportation through normal means to health care services routinely available within the existing locality. (E) Special locality-based exception to applicable CMACs to ensure an adequate [[Page 292]] TRICARE Prime preferred network. The Director, may authorize reimbursements to health care providers participating in a TRICARE preferred provider network under Sec. 199.17(p) of this part at rates higher than would otherwise be allowable under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, if the Director, determines that application of the higher rates is necessary to ensure the availability of an adequate number and mix of qualified health care providers in a network in a specific locality. This authority may only be used to ensure adequate networks in those localities designated by the Director, as requiring TRICAR preferred provider networks, not in localities in which preferred provider networks have been suggested or established but are not determined by the Director to be necessary. Appropriate evidence for determining that higher rates are necessary may include consideration of the number of available primary care and specialist providers in the network locality, availability (including reassignment) of military providers in the location or nearby, the appropriate mix of primary care and specialists needed to satisfy demand and meet appropriate patient access standards (appointment/waiting time, travel distance, etc.), the efforts that have been made to create an adequate network, other cost- effective alternatives, and other relevant factors. The Director, may establish procedures by which exceptions to applicable CMACs are requested and approved or denied under paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(E) of this section. A decision by the Director, to authorize or deny an exception is not subject to the appeal and hearing procedures of Sec. 199.10. When the Director, determines that it is necessary and cost-effective to approve a higher rate or rates in order to ensure the availability of an adequate number of qualified health care providers in a network in a specific locality, the higher rate may not exceed the lesser of the following: (1) The amount equal to the local fee for service charge for the service in the service area in which the service is provided as determined by the Director, based on one or more of the following payment rates: (i) Usual, customary, and reasonable; (ii) The Health Care Financing Administration's Resource Based Relative Value Scale; (iii) Negotiated fee schedules; (iv) Global fees; or (v) Sliding scale individual fee allowances. (2) The amount equal to 115 percent of the otherwise allowable charge under paragraph (h)(1) of the section for the service. (v) Special rules for 1991. (A) Appropriate charge levels for care provided on or after January 1, 1991, and before the 1992 appropriate levels take effect shall be the same as those in effect on December 31, 1990, except that appropriate charge levels for care provided on or after October 7, 1991, shall be those established pursuant to this paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this section. (B) Appropriate charge levels will be established for each locality for which a appropriate charge level was in effect immediately prior to October 7, 1991. For each procedure, the appropriate charge level shall be the prevailing charge level in effect immediately prior to October 7, 1991, adjusted as provided in (g)(1)(v)(B) (1) through (3) of this section. (1) For each overpriced procedure, the level shall be reduced by fifteen percent. For this purpose, overpriced procedures are the procedures determined by the Physician Payment Review Commission to be overvalued pursuant to the process established under the Medicare program, other procedures considered overvalued in the Medicare program (for which Congress directed reductions in Medicare allowable levels for 1991), radiology procedures and pathology procedures. (2) For each other procedure, the level shall remain unchanged. For this purpose, other procedures are procedures which are not overpriced procedures or primary care procedures. (3) For each primary care procedure, the level shall be adjusted by the MEI, as the MEI is applied to Medicare prevailing charge levels. For this purpose, primary care procedures include maternity care and delivery services and well baby care services. (C) For purposes of this paragraph (g)(i)(v), ``appropriate charge levels'' in [[Page 293]] effect at any time prior to October 7, 1991 shall mean the lesser of: (1) The prevailing charge levels then in effect, or (2) The fiscal year 1988 prevailing charge levels adjusted by the Medicare Economic Index (MEI), as the MEI was applied beginning in the fiscal year 1989. (vi) Special transition rule for 1992. (A) For purposes of calculating the national appropriate charge levels for 1992, the prior year's appropriate charge level for each service will be considered to be the level that does not exceed the amount equivalent to the 80th percentile of billed charges made for similar services during the base period of July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987 (determined as under paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(B) of this section), adjusted to calendar year 1991 based on the adjustments made for maximum CHAMPUS allowable charge levels through 1990 and the application of paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this section for 1991. (B) The adjustment to calendar year 1991 of the product of paragraph (g)(1)(vi)(A) of this section shall be as follows: (1) For procedures other than those described in paragraph (g)(1)(vi)(B)(2) of this section, the adjustment to 1991 shall be on the same basis as that provided under paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this section. (2) For any procedure that was considered an overpriced procedure for purposes of the 1991 appropriate charge levels under paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this section for which the resulting 1991 appropriate charge level was less than 150 percent of the Medicare converted relative value unit, the adjustment to 1991 for purposes of the special transition rule for 1992 shall be as if the procedure had been treated under paragraph (g)(1)(v)(B)(2) of this section for purposes of the 1991 appropriate charge level. (vii) Adjustments and procedural rules. (A) The Director, OCHAMPUS may make adjustments to the appropriate charge levels calculated pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1)(iii) and (g)(1)(v) of this section to correct any anomalies resulting from data or statistical factors, significant differences between Medicare- relevant information and CHAMPUS-relevant considerations or other special factors that fairness requires be specially recognized. However, no such adjustment may result in reducing an appropriate charge level. (B) The Director, OCHAMPUS will issue procedural instructions for administration of the allowable charge method. (viii) Clinical laboratory services. The allowable charge for clinical diagnostic laboratory test services shall be calculated in the same manner as allowable charges for other individual health care providers are calculated pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(iv) of this section, with the following exceptions and clarifications. (A) The calculation of national prevailing charge levels, national appropriate charge levels and national CMACs for laboratory service shall begin in calendar year 1993. For purposes of the 1993 calculation, the prior year's national appropriate charge level or national prevailing charge level shall be the level that does not exceed the amount equivalent to the 80th percentile of billed charges made for similar services during the period July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1992 (referred to in this paragraph (g)(1)(viii) of this section as the ``base period''). (B) For purposes of comparison to Medicare allowable payment amounts pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, the Medicare national laboratory payment limitation amounts shall be used. (C) For purposes of establishing laboratory service local CMACs pursuant to paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section, the adjustment factor shall equal the ratio of the local average charge (standardized for the distribution of clinical laboratory services) to the national average charge for all clinical laboratory services during the base period. (D) For purposes of a special locality-based phase-in provision similar to that established by paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, the CMAC in a locality will not be less than 85 percent of the maximum charge level in effect for that locality during the base period. [[Page 294]] (ix) The allowable charge for physician assistant services other than assistant-at-surgery may not exceed 85 percent of the allowable charge for a comparable service rendered by a physician performing the service in a similar location. For cases in which the physician assistant and the physician perform component services of a procedure other than assistant-at-surgery (e.g., home, office or hospital visit), the combined allowable charge for the procedure may not exceed the allowable charge for the procedure rendered by a physician alone. The allowable charge for physician assistant services performed as an assistant-at-surgery may not exceed 65 percent of the allowable charge for a physician serving as an assistant surgeon when authorized as CHAMPUS benefits in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 199.4(c)(3)(iii). Physician assistant services must be billed through the employing physician who must be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (x) A charge that exceeds the CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge can be determined to be allowable only when unusual circumstances or medical complications justify the higher charge. The allowable charge may not exceed the billed charge under any circumstances. (2) Bonus payments in medically underserved areas. A bonus payment, in addition to the amount normally paid under the allowable charge methodology, may be made to physicians in medically underserved areas. For purposes of this paragraph, medically underserved areas are the same as those determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the Medicare program. Such bonus payments shall be equal to the bonus payments authorized by Medicare, except as necessary to recognize any unique or distinct characteristics or requirements of the TRICARE program, and as described in instructions issued by the Executive Director, TRICARE Management Activity. If the Department of Health and Human Services acts to amend or remove the provision for bonus payments under Medicare, TRICARE likewise may follow Medicare in amending or removing provision for such payments. (3) All-inclusive rate. Claims from individual health-care professional providers for services rendered to CHAMPUS beneficiaries residing in an RTC that is either being reimbursed on an all-inclusive per diem rate, or is billing an all-inclusive per diem rate, shall be denied; with the exception of independent health-care professionals providing geographically distant family therapy to a family member residing a minimum of 250 miles from the RTC or covered medical services related to a nonmental health condition rendered outside the RTC. Reimbursement for individual professional services is included in the rate paid the institutional provider. (4) Alternative method. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may, subject to the approval of the ASD(HA), establish an alternative method of reimbursement designed to produce reasonable control over health care costs and to ensure a high level of acceptance of the CHAMPUS-determined charge by the individual health-care professionals or other noninstitutional health-care providers furnishing services and supplies to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. Alternative methods may not result in reimbursement greater than the allowable charge method above. (k) Reimbursement Under the Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program. The Military-Civilian Health Services Partnership Program, as authorized by section 1096, chapter 55, title 10, provides for the sharing of staff, equipment, and resources between the civilian and military health care system in order to achieve more effective, efficient, or economical health care for authorized beneficiaries. Military treatment facility commanders, based upon the authority provided by their respective Surgeons General of the military departments, are responsible for entering into individual partnership agreements only when they have determined specifically that use of the Partnership Program is more economical overall to the Government than referring the need for health care services to the civilian community under the normal operation of the CHAMPUS Program. (See [[Page 295]] paragraph (p) of Sec. 199.1 for general requirements of the Partnership Program.) (1) Reimbursement of institutional health care providers. Reimbursement of institutional health care providers under the Partnership Program shall be on the same basis as non-Partnership providers. (2) Reimbursement of individual health-care professionals and other non-institutional health care providers. Reimbursement of individual health care professionals and other non-institutional health care providers shall be on the same basis as non-Partnership providers as detailed in paragraph (g) of this section. (l) Accommodation of Discounts Under Provider Reimbursement Methods. (1) General rule. The Director. OCHAMPUS (or designee) has authority to reimburse a provider at an amount below the amount usually paid pursuant to this section when, under a program approved by the Director, the provider has agreed to the lower amount. (2) Special applications. The following are examples of applications of the general rule; they are not all inclusive. (i) In the case and individual health care professionals and other non-institutional providers, if the discounted fee is below the provider's normal billed charge and the prevailing charge level (see paragraph (g) of this section), the discounted fee shall be the provider's actual billed charge and the CHAMPUS allowable charge. (ii) In the case of institutional providers normally paid on the basis of a pre-set amount (such as DRG-based amount under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or per-diem amount under paragraph (a)(2) of this section), if the discount rate is lower than the pre-set rate, the discounted rate shall be the CHAMPUS-determined allowable cost. This is an exception to the usual rule that the pre-set rate is paid regardless of the institutional provider's billed charges or other factors. (3) Procedures. (i) This paragraph applies only when both the provider and the Director have agreed to the discounted payment rate. The Director's agreement may be in the context of approval of a program that allows for such discounts. (ii) The Director of OCHAMPUS may establish uniform terms, conditions and limitations for this payment method in order to avoid administrative complexity. (m) Outside the United States. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall determine the appropriate reimbursement method or methods to be used in the extension of CHAMPUS benefits for otherwise covered medical services or supplies provided by hospitals or other institutional providers, physicians or other individual professional providers, or other providers outside the United States. (n) Implementing Instructions. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue CHAMPUS policies, instructions, procedures, and guidelines, as may be necessary to implement the intent of this section. [55 FR 13266, Apr. 10, 1990, as amended at 55 FR 31180, Aug. 1, 1990; 55 FR June 13, 2002] Editorial Note: The following text, appearing at 63 FR 48445, Sept. 10, 1998, could not be incorporated into Sec. 199.14 because it was not mentioned in the amendatory instruction. For the convenience of the user, the text is set forth as follows: Sec. 199.14 Provider reimbursement methods. (a) * * * (1) * * * * * * * * (iii) * * * (B) Empty and low-volume DRGs. For any DRG with less than ten (10) occurrences in the CHAMPUS database, the Director, TSO, or designee, has the authority to consider alternative methods for estimating CHAMPUS weights in these low-volume DRG categories. * * * * * (D) * * * (1) Differentiate large urban and other area charges. All charges in the database shall be sorted into large urban and other area [[Page 296]] groups (using the same definitions for these categories used in the Medicare program. * * * * * * * * (5) Preliminary base year standardized amount. A preliminary base year standardized amount shall be calculated by summing all costs in the database applicable to the large urban or other area group and dividing by the total number of discharges in the respective group. * * * * * (E) * * * (1) * * * (i) * * * (A) Short-stay outliers. Any discharge with a length-of-stay (LOS) less than 1.94 standard deviations from the DRG's arithmetic LOS shall be classified as a short-stay outlier. Short-stay outliers shall be reimbursed at 200 percent of the per diem rate for the DRG for each covered day of the hospital stay, not to exceed the DRG amount. The per diem rate shall equal the DRG amount divided by the arithmetic mean length-of-stay for the DRG. (B) Long-stay outliers. Any discharge (except for neonatal services and services in children's hospitals) which has a length-of-stay (LOS) exceeding a threshold established in accordance with the criteria used for the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.82 shall be classified as a long-stay outliner. Any discharge for neonatal services or for services in a children's hospital which has a LOS exceeding the lesser of 1.94 standard deviations or 17 days from the DRG's arithmetic mean LOS also shall be classified as a long-stay outlier. Long-stay outliers shall be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus a percentage (as established for the Medicare Prospective Payment System) of the per diem rate for the DRG for each covered day of care beyond the long-stay outlier threshold. The per diem rate shall equal the DRG amount divided by the arithmetic mean LOS for the DRG. For admissions on or after October 1, 1997, the long stay outlier has been eliminated for all cases except children's hospitals and neonates. For admissions on or after October 1, 1998, the long stay outlier has been eliminated for children's hospitals and neonates. (ii) * * * (A) Cost outliers except those in children's hospitals or for neonatal services. Any discharge which has standardized costs that exceed a threshold established in accordance with the criteria used for the Medicare Prospective Payment System as contained in 42 CFR 412.84 shall qualify as a cost outlier. The standardized costs shall be calculated by multiplying the total charges by the factor described in Sec. 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(D)(4) and adjusting this amount for indirect medical education costs. Cost outliers shall be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus a percentage (as established for the Medicare Prospective Payment System) of all costs exceeding the threshold. Effective with admissions occurring on or after October 1, 1997, the standardized costs are no longer adjusted for indirect medical education costs. (B) Cost outliers in children's hospitals and for neonatal services. Any discharge for services in a children's hospital or for neonatal services which has standardized costs that exceed a threshold of the greater of two times the DRG-based amount or $13,500 shall qualify as a cost outlier. The standardized costs shall be calculated by multiplying the total charges by the factor described in Sec. 199.14(a)(1)(iii)(D)(4) (adjusted to include average capital and direct medical education costs) and adjusting this amount for indirect medical education costs. Cost outliers for services in children's hospitals and for neonatal services shall be reimbursed the DRG-based amount plus a percentage (as established for the Medicare Prospective Payment System) of all costs exceeding the threshold. Effective with admissions occurring on or after October 1, 1998, standardized costs are no longer adjusted for indirect medical education costs. In addition, CHAMPUS will calculate the outlier payments that would have occurred at each of the 59 Children's hospitals under the FY99 outlier policy for all cases that would have been outliers under the FY94 policies using the most accurate data available in September 1998. A ratio will be calculated which equals the level of outlier payments that would have been made under the FY94 outlier policies and the outlier payments that would be made if the FY99 outlier policies had applied to each of these potential outlier cases for these hospitals. The ratio will be calculated across all outlier claims for the 59 hospitals and will not be hospital specific. The ratio will be used to increase cost outlier payments in FY 1999 and FY 2000, unless the hospital has a negotiated agreement with a managed care support contractor which would affect this payment. For hospitals with managed care support agreements which affect these payments, CHAMPUS will apply these payments if the increased payments would be consistent with the agreements. In FY 2000 the ratio of outlier payments (long stay and cost) that would have occurred under the FY 94 policy and actual cost outlier payments made under the FY 99 policy will be recalculated. If the ratio has changed significantly, the ratio will be revised for use in FY 2001 and thereafter. In FY 2002, the actual cost outlier cases in FY 2000 and 2001 will be reexamined. The ratio of outlier payments that would have occurred under the FY94 policy and the actual cost outlier payments [[Page 297]] made under the FY 2000 and FY 2001 policies. If the ratio has changed significantly, the ratio will be revised for use in FY 2003. * * * * * (G) * * * (3) Information necessary for payment of capital and direct medical education costs. All hospitals subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system, except for children's hospitals, may be reimbursed for allowed capital and direct medical education costs by submitting a request to the CHAMPUS contractor. Beginning October 1, 1998, such request shall be filed with CHAMPUS on or before the last day of the twelfth month following the close of the hospitals' cost reporting period, and shall cover the one-year period corresponding to the hospital's Medicare cost- reporting period. The first such request may cover a period of less than a full year--from the effective date of the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to the end of the hospital's Medicare cost-reporting period. All costs reported to the CHAMPUS contractor must correspond to the costs reported on the hospital's Medicare cost report. An extension of the due date for filing the request may only be granted if an extension has been granted by HCFA due to a provider's operations being significantly adversely affected due to extraordinary circumstances over which the provider has no control, such as flood or fire. (If these costs change as a result of a subsequent audit by Medicare, the revised costs are to be reported to the hospital's CHAMPUS contractor within 30 days of the date the hospital is notified of the change.) The request must be signed by the hospital official responsible for verifying the amounts and shall contain the following information. * * * * * (d) * * * (3) * * * (iv) Step 4: standard payment amount per group. The standard payment amount per group will be the volume weighted median per procedure cost for the procedures in that group. For cases in which the standard payment amount per group exceeds the CHAMPUS-determined inpatient allowable amount, the Director, TSO or his designee, may make adjustments. * * * * * (h) Reimbursement of individual health care professionals and other non-institutional, non-professional providers. The CHAMPUS-determined reasonable charge (the amount allowed by CHAMPUS) for the service of an individual health care professional or other non-institutional, non- professional provider (even if employed by or under contract to an institutional provider) shall be determined by one of the following methodologies, that is, whichever is in effect in the specific geographic location at the time covered services and supplies are provided to a CHAMPUS beneficiary. * * * * * Sec. 199.15 Quality and utilization review peer review organization program. (a) General. (1) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish rules and procedures for the CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program. (2) Applicability of program. All claims submitted for health services under CHAMPUS are subject to review for quality of care and appropriate utilization. The Director, OCHAMPUS shall establish generally accepted standards, norms and criteria as are necessary for this program of utilization and quality review. These standards, norms and criteria shall include, but not be limited to, need for inpatient admission or inpatient or outpatient service, length of inpatient stay, intensity of care, appropriateness of treatment, and level of institutional care required. The Director, OCHAMPUS may issue implementing instructions, procedures and guidelines for retrospective, concurrent and prospective review. (3) Contractor implementation. The CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program may be implemented through contracts administered by the Director, OCHAMPUS. These contractors may include contractors that have exclusive functions in the area of utilization and quality review, fiscal intermediary contractors (which perform these functions along with a broad range of administrative services), and managed care contractors (which perform a range of functions concerning management of the delivery and financing of health care services under CHAMPUS). Regardless of the contractors involved, utilization and quality review activities follow the same standards, rules and procedures set forth in this section, unless otherwise specifically provided in this section or elsewhere in this part. [[Page 298]] (4) Medical issues affected. The CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program is distinguishable in purpose and impact from other activities relating to the administration and management of CHAMPUS in that the Peer Review Organization program is concerned primarily with medical judgments regarding the quality and appropriateness of health care services. Issues regarding such matters as benefit limitations are similar, but, if not determined on the basis of medical judgments, are governed by CHAMPUS rules and procedures other than those provided in this section. (See, for example, Sec. 199.7 regarding claims submission, review and payment.) Based on this purpose, a major attribute of the Peer Review Organization program is that medical judgments are made by (directly or pursuant to guidelines and subject to direct review) reviewers who are peers of the health care providers providing the services under review. (5) Provider responsibilities. Because of the dominance of medical judgments in the quality and utilization review program, principal responsibility for complying with program rules and procedures rests with health care providers. For this reason, there are limitations, set forth in this section and in Sec. 199.4(h), on the extent to which beneficiaries may be held financially liable for health care services not provided in conformity with rules and procedures of the quality and utilization review program concerning medical necessity of care. (6) Medicare rules used as model. The CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program, based on specific statutory authority, follows many of the quality and utilization review requirements and procedures in effect for the Medicare Peer Review Organization program, subject to adaptations appropriate for the CHAMPUS program. In recognition of the similarity of purpose and design between the Medicare and CHAMPUS PRO programs, and to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, the CHAMPUS Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program will have special procedures applicable to supplies and services furnished to Medicare-eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries. These procedures will enable CHAMPUS normally to rely upon Medicare determinations of medical necessity and appropriateness in the processing of CHAMPUS claims as a second payer to Medicare. As a general rule, only in cases involving Medicare-eligible CHAMPUS beneficiaries where Medicare payment for services and supplies is denied for reasons other than medical necessity and appropriateness will the CHAMPUS claim be subject to review for quality of care and appropriate utilization under the CHAMPUS PRO program. TRICARE will continue to perform a medical necessity and appropriateness review for quality of care and appropriate utilization under the CHAMPUS PRO program where required by statute, such as inpatient mental health services in excess of 30 days in any year. (b) Objectives and general requirements of review system--(1) In general. Broadly, the program of quality and utilization review has as its objective to review the quality, completeness and adequacy of care provided, as well as its necessity, appropriateness and reasonableness. (2) Payment exclusion for services provided contrary to utilization and quality standards. (i) In any case in which health care services are provided in a manner determined to be contrary to quality or necessity standards established under the quality and utilization review program, payment may be wholly or partially excluded. (ii) In any case in which payment is excluded pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the patient (or the patient's family) may not be billed for the excluded services. (iii) Limited exceptions and other special provisions pertaining to the requirements established in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, are set forth in Sec. 199.4(h). (3) Review of services covered by DRG-based payment system. Application of these objectives in the context of hospital services covered by the DRG-based payment system also includes a validation of diagnosis and procedural information that determines [[Page 299]] CHAMPUS reimbursement, and a review of the necessity and appropriateness of care for which payment is sought on an outlier basis. (4) Preauthorization and other utilization review procedures--(i) In general. all health care services for which payment is sought under TRICARE are subject to review for appropriateness of utilization as determined by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee. (A) The procedures for this review may be prospective (before the care is provided), concurrent (while the care is in process), or retrospective (after the care has been provided). Regardless of the procedures of this utilization review, the same generally accepted standards, norms and criteria for evaluating the medical necessity, appropriateness and reasonableness of the care involved shall apply. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee, shall establish procedures for conducting reviews, including types of health care services for which preauthorization or concurrent review shall be required. Preauthorization or concurrent review may be required for categories of health care services. Except where required by law, the categories of health care services for which preauthorization or concurrent review is required may vary in different geographical locations or for different types of providers. (B) For healthcare services provided under TRICARE contracts entered into by the Department of Defense after October 30, 2000, medical necessity preauthorization will not be required for referrals for specialty consultation appointment services required by primary care providers or specialty providers when referring TRICARE Prime beneficiaries for specialty consultation appointment services within the TRICARE contractor's network. However, the lack of medical necessity preauthorization requirements for consultative appointment services does not mean that non-emergent admissions or invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures which in and of themselves constitute categories of health care services related to, but beyond the level of the consultation appointment service, are also not subject to medical necessity prior authorization. In fact many such health care services may continue to require medical necessity prior authorization as determined by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries are also required to obtain preauthorization before seeking health care services from a non-network provider. (ii) Preauthorization procedures. With respect to categories of health care (inpatient or outpatient) for which preauthorization is required, the following procedures shall apply: (A) The requirement for preauthorization shall be widely publicized to beneficiaries and providers. (B) All requests for preauthorization shall be responded to in writing. Notification of approval or denial shall be sent to the beneficiary. Approvals shall specify the health care services and supplies approved and identify any special limits or further requirements applicable to the particular case. (C) An approved preauthorization shall state the number of days, appropriate for the type of care involved, for which it is valid. In general, preauthorizations will be valid for 30 days. If the services or supplies are not obtained within the number of days specified, a new preauthorization request is required. For organ and stem cell transplants, the preauthorization shall remain in effect as long as the beneficiary continues to meet the specific transplant criteria set forth in the TRICARE/CHAMPUS Policy Manual, or until the approved transplant occurs. (D) For healthcare services provided under TRICARE contracts entered into by the Department of Defense after October 30, 2000, medical necessity preauthorization for specialty consultation appointment services within the TRICARE contractor's network will not be required. However TRICARE contractors shall determine, based upon best-business practice, utility and cost-savings, the categories of other health care services which are best served by medical necessity prior (or pre) authorization and may request a waiver from the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or designee, [[Page 300]] from compliance with previously established requirements for medical necessity prior (or pre) authorization. (iii) Payment reduction for noncompliance with required utilization review procedures. (A) Paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section applies to any case in which: (1) A provider was required to obtain preauthorization or continued stay (in connection with required concurrent review procedures) approval. (2) The provider failed to obtain the necessary approval; and (3) The health care services have not been disallowed on the basis of necessity, appropriateness or reasonableness. In such a case, reimbursement will be reduced, unless such reduction is waived based on special circumstances. (B) In a case described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, reimbursement will be reduced, unless such reduction is waived based on special circumstances. The amount of this reduction shall be at least ten percent of the amount otherwise allowable for services for which preauthorization (including preauthorization for continued stays in connection with concurrent review requirements) approval should have been obtained, but was not obtained. (C) The payment reduction set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS when the provider could not reasonably have been expected to know of the preauthorization requirement or some other special circumstance justifies the waiver. (D) Services for which payment is disallowed under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section may not be billed to the patient (or the patient's family). (c) Hospital cooperation. All hospitals which participate in CHAMPUS and submit CHAMPUS claims are required to provide all information necessary for CHAMPUS to properly process the claims. In order for CHAMPUS to be assured that services for which claims are submitted meet quality of care standards, hospitals are required to provide the Peer Review Organization (PRO) responsible for quality review with all the information, within timeframes to be established by OCHAMPUS, necessary to perform the review functions required by this paragraph. Additionally, all participating hospitals shall provide CHAMPUS beneficiaries, upon admission, with information about the admission and quality review system including their appeal rights. A hospital which does not cooperate in this activity shall be subject to termination as a CHAMPUS-authorized provider. (1) Documentation that the beneficiary has received the required information about the CHAMPUS PRO program must be maintained in the same manner as is the notice required for the Medicare program by 42 CFR 466.78(b). (2) The physician acknowledgment required for Medicare under 42 CFR 412.46 is also required for CHAMPUS as a condition for payment and may be satisfied by the same statement as required for Medicare, with substitution or addition of ``CHAMPUS'' when the word ``Medicare'' is used. (3) Participating hospitals must execute a memorandum of understanding with the PRO providing appropriate procedures for implementation of the PRO program. (4) Participating hospitals may not charge a CHAMPUS beneficiary for inpatient hospital services excluded on the basis of Sec. 199.4(g)(1) (not medically necessary), Sec. 199.4(g)(3) (inappropriate level), or Sec. 199.4(g)(7) (custodial care) unless all of the conditions established by 42 CFR 412.42(c) with respect to Medicare beneficiaries have been met with respect to the CHAMPUS beneficiary. In such cases in which the patient requests a PRO review while the patient is still an inpatient in the hospital, the hospital shall provide to the PRO the records required for the review by the close of business of the day the patient requests review, if such request was made before noon. If the hospital fails to provide the records by the close of business, that day and any subsequent working day during which the hospital continues to fail to provide the records shall not be counted for purposes of the two-day period of 42 CFR 412.42(c)(3)(ii). (d) Areas of review--(1) Admissions. The following areas shall be subject to review to determine whether inpatient care was medically appropriate and [[Page 301]] necessary, was delivered in the most appropriate setting and met acceptable standards of quality. This review may include preadmission or prepayment review when appropriate. (i) Transfers of CHAMPUS beneficiaries from a hospital or hospital unit subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system to another hospital or hospital unit. (ii) CHAMPUS admissions to a hospital or hospital unit subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system which occur within a certain period (specified by OCHAMPUS) of discharge from a hospital or hospital unit subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. (iii) A random sample of other CHAMPUS admissions for each hospital subject to the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. (iv) CHAMPUS admissions in any DRGs which have been specifically identified by OCHAMPUS for review or which are under review for any other reason. (2) DRG validation. The review organization responsible for quality of care reviews shall be responsible for ensuring that the diagnostic and procedural information reported by hospitals on CHAMPUS claims which is used by the fiscal intermediary to assign claims to DRGs is correct and matches the information contained in the medical records. In order to accomplish this, the following review activities shall be done. (i) Perform DRG validation reviews of each case under review. (ii) Review of claim adjustments submitted by hospitals which result in the assignment of a higher weighted DRG. (iii) Review for physician's acknowledgement of annual receipt of the penalty statement as contained in the Medicare regulation at 42 CFR 412.46. (iv) Review of a sample of claims for each hospital reimbursed under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. Sample size shall be determined based upon the volume of claims submitted. (3) Outlier review. Claims which qualify for additional payment as a long-stay outlier or as a cost-outlier shall be subject to review to ensure that the additional days or costs were medically necessary and appropriate and met all other requirements for CHAMPUS coverage. In addition, claims which qualify as short-stay outliers shall be reviewed to ensure that the admission was medically necessary and appropriate and that the discharge was not premature. (4) Procedure review. Claims for procedures identified by OCHAMPUS as subject to a pattern of abuse shall be the subject of intensified quality assurance review. (5) Other review. Any other cases or types of cases identified by OCHAMPUS shall be subject to focused review. (e) Actions as a result of review--(1) Findings related to individual claims. If it is determined, based upon information obtained during reviews, that a hospital has misrepresented admission, discharge, or billing information, or is found to have quality of care defects, or has taken an action that results in the unnecessary admissions of an individual entitled to benefits, unnecessary multiple admission of an individual, or other inappropriate medical or other practices with respect to beneficiaries or billing for services furnished to beneficiaries, the PRO, in conjunction with the fiscal intermediary, shall, as appropriate: (i) Deny payment for or recoup (in whole or in part) any amount claimed or paid for the inpatient hospital and professional services related to such determination. (ii) Require the hospital to take other corrective action necessary to prevent or correct the inappropriate practice. (iii) Advise the provider and beneficiary of appeal rights, as required by Sec. 199.10 of this part. (iv) Notify OCHAMPUS of all such actions. (2) Findings related to a pattern of inappropriate practices. In all cases where a pattern of inappropriate admissions and billing practices that have the effect of circumventing the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system is identified, OCHAMPUS shall be notified of the hospital and practice involved. (3) Revision of coding relating to DRG validation. The following provisions [[Page 302]] apply in connection with the DRG validation process set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. (i) If the diagnostic and procedural information in the patient's medical record is found to be inconsistent with the hospital's coding or DRG assignment, the hospital's coding on the CHAMPUS claim will be appropriately changed and payments recalculated on the basis of the appropriate DRG assignment. (ii) If the information stipulated under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is found not to be correct, the PRO will change the coding and assign the appropriate DRG on the basis of the changed coding. (f) Special procedures in connection with certain types of health care services or certain types of review activities--(1) In general. Many provisions of this section are directed to the context of services covered by the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system. This section, however, is also applicable to other services. In addition, many provisions of this section relate to the context of peer review activities performed by Peer Review Organizations whose sole functions for CHAMPUS relate to the Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program. However, it also applies to review activities conducted by contractors who have responsibilities broader than those related to the quality and utilization review program. Paragraph (f) of this section authorizes certain special procedures that will apply in connection with such services and such review activities. (2) Services not covered by the DRG-based payment system. In implementing the quality and utilization review program in the context of services not covered by the DRG-based payment system, the Director, OCHAMPUS may establish procedures, appropriate to the types of services being reviewed, substantively comparable to services covered by the DRG- based payment system regarding obligations of providers to cooperate in the quality and utilization review program, authority to require appropriate corrective actions and other procedures. The Director, OCHAMPUS may also establish such special, substantively comparable procedures in connection with review of health care services which, although covered by the DRG-based payment method, are also affected by some other special circumstances concerning payment method, nature of care, or other potential utilization or quality issue. (3) Peer review activities by contractors also performing other administration or management functions--(i) Sole-function PRO versus multi-function PRO. In all cases, peer review activities under the Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program are carried out by physicians and other qualified health care professionals, usually under contract with OCHAMPUS. In some cases, the Peer Review Organization contractor's only functions are pursuant to the quality and utilization review program. In paragraph (f)(3) of this section, this type of contractor is referred to as a ``sole function PRO.'' In other cases, the Peer Review Organization contractor is also performing other functions in connection with the administration and management of CHAMPUS. In paragraph (f)(3) of this section, this type of contractor is referred to as a ``multi-function PRO.'' As an example of the latter type, managed care contractors may perform a wide range of functions regarding management of the delivery and financing of health care services under CHAMPUS, including but not limited to functions under the Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program. (ii) Special rules and procedures. With respect to multi-function PROs, the Director, OCHAMPUS may establish special procedures to assure the independence of the Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization program and otherwise advance the objectives of the program. These special rules and procedures include, but are not limited to, the following: (A) A reconsidered determination that would be final in cases involving sole-function PROs under paragraph (i)(2) of this section will not be final in connection with multi-function PROs. Rather, in such cases (other than any case which is appealable under paragraph (i)(3) of this section), an opportunity for a second reconsideration [[Page 303]] shall be provided. The second reconsideration will be provided by OCHAMPUS or another contractor independent of the multi-function PRO that performed the review. The second reconsideration may not be further appealed by the provider. (B) Procedures established by paragraphs (g) through (m) of this section shall not apply to any action of a multi-function PRO (or employee or other person or entity affiliated with the PRO) carried out in performance of functions other than functions under this section. (g) Procedures regarding initial determinations. The CHAMPUS PROs shall establish and follow procedures for initial determinations that are substantively the same or comparable to the procedures applicable to Medicare under 42 CFR 466.83 to 466.104. In addition, these procedures shall provide that a PRO's determination that an admission is medically necessary is not a guarantee of payment by CHAMPUS; normal CHAMPUS benefit and procedural coverage requirements must also be applied. (h) Procedures regarding reconsiderations. The CHAMPUS PROs shall establish and follow procedures for reconsiderations that are substantively the same or comparable to the procedures applicable to reconsiderations under Medicare pursuant to 42 CFR 473.15 to 473.34, except that the time limit for requesting reconsideration (see 42 CFR 473.20(a)(1)) shall be 90 days. A PRO reconsidered determination is final and binding upon all parties to the reconsideration except to the extent of any further appeal pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section. (i) Appeals and hearings. (1) Beneficiaries may appeal a PRO reconsideration determination of OCHAMPUS and obtain a hearing on such appeal to the extent allowed and under the procedures set forth in Sec. 199.10(d). (2) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(3), a PRO reconsidered determination may not be further appealed by a provider. (3) A provider may appeal a PRO reconsideration determination to OCHAMPUS and obtain a hearing on such appeal to the extent allowed under the procedures set forth in Sec. 199.10(d) if it is a determination pursuant to Sec. 199.4(h) that the provider knew or could reasonably have been expected to know that the services were excludable. (4) For purposes of the hearing process, a PRO reconsidered determination shall be considered as the procedural equivalent of a formal review determination under Sec. 199.10, unless revised at the initiative of the Director, OCHAMPUS prior to a hearing on the appeal, in which case the revised determination shall be considered as the procedural equivalent of a formal review determination under Sec. 199.10. (5) The provisions of Sec. 199.10(e) concerning final action shall apply to hearings cases. (j) Acquisition, protection and disclosure of peer review information. The provisions of 42 CFR part 476, except Sec. 476.108, shall be applicable to the CHAMPUS PRO program as they are to the Medicare PRO program. (k) Limited immunity from liability for participants in PRO program. The provisions of section 1157 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320c-6) are applicable to the CHAMPUS PRO program in the same manner as they apply to the Medicare PRO program. Section 1102(g) of title 10, United States Code also applies to the CHAMPUS PRO program. (l) Additional provision regarding confidentiality of records--(1) General rule. The provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1102 regarding the confidentiality of medical quality assurance records shall apply to the activities of the CHAMPUS PRO program as they do to the activities of the external civilian PRO program that reviews medical care provided in military hospitals. (2) Specific applications. (i) Records concerning PRO deliberations are generally nondisclosable quality assurance records under 10 U.S.C. 1102. (ii) Initial denial determinations by PROs pursuant to pargraph (g) of this section (concerning medical necessity determinations, DRG validation actions, etc.) and subsequent decisions regarding those determinations are not nondisclosable quality assurance records under 10 U.S.C. 1102. (iii) Information the subject of mandatory PRO disclosure under 42 CFR [[Page 304]] part 476 is not a nondisclosable quality assurance record under 10 U.S.C. 1102. (m) Obligations, sanctions and procedures. (1) The provisions of 42 CFR 1004.1-1004.80 shall apply to the CHAMPUS PRO program as they do the Medicare PRO program, except that the functions specified in those sections for the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services shall be the responsibility of OCHAMPUS. (2) The provisions of 42 U.S.C. section 1395ww(f)(2) concerning circumvention by any hospital of the applicable payment methods for inpatient services shall apply to CHAMPUS payment methods as they do to Medicare payment methods. (3) The Director, or a designee, of CHAMPUS shall determine whether to impose a sanction pursuant to paragraphs (m)(1) and (m)(2) of this section. Providers may appeal adverse sanctions decisions under the procedures set forth in Sec. 199.10(d). (n) Authority to integrate CHAMPUS PRO and military medical treatment facility utilization review activities. (1) In the case of a military medical treatment facility (MTF) that has established utilization review requirements similar to those under the CHAMPUS PRO program, the contractor carrying out this function may, at the request of the MTF, utilize procedures comparable to the CHAMPUS PRO program procedures to render determinations or recommendations with respect to utilization review requirements. (2) In any case in which such a contractor has comparable responsibility and authority regarding utilization review in both an MTF (or MTFs) and CHAMPUS, determinations as to medical necessity in connection with services from an MTF or CHAMPUS-authorized provider may be consolidated. (3) In any case in which an MTF reserves authority to separate an MTF determination on medical necessity from a CHAMPUS PRO program determination on medical necessity, the MTF determination is not binding on CHAMPUS. [55 FR 625, Jan. 8, 1990, as amended at 58 FR 58961, Nov. 5, 1993; 60 FR FR 44881, July 31, 2003] Sec. 199.16 Supplemental Health Care Program for active duty members. (a) Purpose and applicability. (1) The purpose of this section is to implement, with respect to health care services provided under the supplemental health care program for active duty members of the uniformed services, the provision of 10 U.S.C. 1074(c). This section of law authorizes DoD to establish for the supplemental care program the same payment rules, subject to appropriate modifications, as apply under CHAMPUS. (2) This section applies to the program, known as the supplemental care program, which provides for the payment by the uniformed services to private sector health care providers for health care services provided to active duty members of the uniformed services. Although not part of CHAMPUS, the supplemental care program is similar to CHAMPUS in that it is a program for the uniformed services to purchase civilian health care services for active duty members. For this reason, the Director, OCHAMPUS assists the uniformed services in the administration of the supplemental care program. (3) This section applies to all health care services covered by the CHAMPUS. For purposes of this section, health care services ordered by a military treatment facility (MTF) provider for an MTF patient (who is not an active duty member) for whom the MTF provider maintains responsibility are also covered by the supplemental care program and subject to the requirements of this section. (b) Obligation of providers concerning payment for supplemental health care for active duty members--(1) Hospitals covered by DRG-based payment system. For a hospital covered by the CHAMPUS [[Page 305]] DRG-based payment system to maintain its status as an authorized provider for CHAMPUS pursuant to Sec. 199.6, that hospital must also be a participating provider for purposes of the supplemental care program. As a participating provider, each hospital must accept the DRG-based payment system amount determined pursuant to Sec. 199.14 as payment in full for the hospital services covered by the system. The failure of any hospital to comply with this obligation subjects that hospital to exclusion as a CHAMPUS-authorized provider. (2) Other participating providers. For any institutional or individual provider, other than those described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that is a participating provider, the provider must also be a participating provider for purposes of the supplemental care program. The provider must accept the CHAMPUS allowable amount determined pursuant to Sec. 199.14 as payment in full for the hospital services covered by the system. The failure of any provider to comply with this obligation subjects the provider to exclusion as a participating provider. (c) General rule for payment and administration. Subject to the special rules and procedures in paragraph (d) of this section and the waiver authority in paragraph (e) of this section, as a general rule the provisions of Sec. 199.14 shall govern payment and administration of claims under the supplemental care program as they do claims under CHAMPUS. To the extent necessary to interpret or implement the provisions of Sec. 199.14, related provisions of this part shall also be applicable. (d) Special rules and procedures. As exceptions to the general rule in paragraph (c) of this section, the special rules and procedures in this section shall govern payment and administration of claims under the supplemental care program. These special rules and procedures are subject to the TRICARE Prime Remote program for active duty service members set forth in paragraph (e) of this section and the waiver authority of paragraph (f) of this section. (1) There is no patient cost sharing under the supplemental care program. All amounts due to be paid to the provider shall be paid by the program. (2) Preauthorization by the Uniformed Services of each service is required for the supplemental care program except for services in cases of medical emergency (for which the definition in Sec. 199.2 shall apply) or in cases governed by the TRICARE Prime Remote program for active duty service members set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. It is the responsibility of the active duty members to obtain preauthorization for each service. With respect to each emergency inpatient admission, after such time as the emergency condition is addressed, authorization for any proposed continued stay must be obtained within two working days of admission. (3) With respect to the filing of claims and similar administrative matters for which this part refers to activities of the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries, for purposes of the supplemental care program, responsibilities for claims processing, payment and some other administrative matters may be assigned by the Director, OCHAMPUS to the same fiscal intermediaries, other contractor, or to the nearest military medical treatment facility or medical claims office. (4) The annual cost pass-throughs for capital and direct medical education costs that are available under the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system are also available, upon request, under the supplemental care program. To obtain payment include the number of active duty bed days as a separate line item on the annual request to the CHAMPUS fiscal intermediaries. (5) For providers other than participating providers, the Director, OCHAMPUS may authorize payment in excess of CHAMPUS allowable amounts. No provider may bill an active duty member any amount in excess of the CHAMPUS allowable amount. (e) TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Members. (1) General. The TRICARE Prime Remote (TPR) program is available for certain active duty members of the Uniformed Services assigned to remote locations in the United States and the District of Columbia who are entitled to coverage of medical care, and the standards for timely access to such care, outside a [[Page 306]] military treatment facility that are comparable to coverage for medical care and standards for timely access to such care as exist under TRICARE Prime under Sec. 199.17. Those active duty members who are eligible under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1074(c)(3) and who enroll in the TRICARE Prime Remote program, may not be required to receive routine primary medical care at a military medical treatment facility. (2) Eligibility. To receive health care services under the TRICARE Prime Remote program, an individual must be an active duty member of the Uniformed Services on orders for more than thirty consecutive days who meet the following requirements: (i) Has a permanent duty assignment that is greater than fifty miles or approximately one hour drive from a military treatment facility or military clinic designated as adequate to provide the needed primary care services to the active duty service member; and (ii) Pursuant to the assignment of such duty, resides at a location that is greater than fifty miles or approximately one hour from a military medical treatment facility or military clinic designated as adequate to provide the needed primary care services to the active duty service member. (3) Enrollment. An active duty service member eligible for the TRICARE Prime Remote program must enroll in the program. If an eligible active duty member does not enroll in the TRICARE Prime Remote program, the member shall receive health care services provide under the supplemental health program subject to all requirements of this section without application of the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section. (4) Preauthorization. If a TRICARE Prime network under Sec. 199.17 exists in the remote location, the TRICARE Prime Remote enrolled active duty member will select or be assigned a primary care manager. In the absence of a TRICARE primary care manager in the remote location and if the active duty member is not assigned to a military primary care manager based on fitness for duty requirements, the TRICARE Prime Remote enrolled active duty member may use a local TRICARE authorized provider for primary health care services without preauthorization. Any referral for specialty care will require the TRICARE Prime Remote enrolled active duty member to obtain preauthorization for such services. (f) Waiver authority. With the exception of statutory requirements, any restrictions or limitations pursuant to the general rule in paragraph (c) of this section, and special rules and procedures in paragraph (d) of this section, may be waived by the Director, OCHAMPUS, at the request of an authorized official of the uniformed service concerned, based on a determination that such waiver is necessary to assure adequate availability of health care services to active duty members. (g) Authorities. (1) The Uniformed Services may establish additional procedures, consistent with this part, for the effective administration of the supplemental care program in their respective services. (2) The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs is responsible for the overall policy direction of the supplemental care program and the administration of this part. (3) The Director, OCHAMPUS shall issue procedural requirements for the implementation of this section, including requirement for claims submission similar to those established by Sec. 199.7. [56 FR 23801, May 24, 1991, as amended FR 58963, Nov. 5, 1993; 67 FR 5479, Feb. Sec. 199.17 TRICARE program. (a) Establishment. The TRICARE program is established for the purpose of implementing a comprehensive managed health care program for the delivery and financing of health care services in the Military Health System. (1) Purpose. The TRICARE program implements management improvements primarily through managed care support contracts that include special arrangements with civilian sector health care providers and better coordination between military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and these civilian providers. Implementation of these management improvements includes adoption of special rules and procedures not ordinarily followed [[Page 307]] under CHAMPUS or MTF requirements. This section establishes those special rules and procedures. (2) Statutory authority. Many of the provisions of this section are authorized by statutory authorities other than those which authorize the usual operation of the CHAMPUS program, especially 10 U.S.C. 1079 and 1086. The TRICARE program also relies upon other available statutory authorities, including 10 U.S.C. 1099 (health care enrollment system), 10 U.S.C. 1097 (contracts for medical care for retirees, dependents and survivors: alternative delivery of health care), and 10 U.S.C. 1096 (resource sharing agreements). (3) Scope of the program. The TRICARE program is applicable to all of the uniformed services. Its geographical applicability is all 50 states and the District of Columbia, In addition, if authorized by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), the TRICARE program may be implemented in areas outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In such cases, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may also authorize modifications to TRICARE program rules and procedures as may be appropriate to the area involved. (4) MTF rules and procedures affected. Much of this section relates to rules and procedures applicable to the delivery and financing of health care services provided by civilian providers outside military treatment facilities. This section provides that certain rules, procedures, rights and obligations set forth elsewhere in this part (and usually applicable to CHAMPUS) are different under the TRICARE program. In addition, some rules, procedures, rights and obligations relating to health care services in military treatment facilities are also different under the TRICARE program. In such cases, provisions of this section take precedence and are binding. (5) Implementation based on local action. The TRICARE program is not automatically implemented in all areas where it is potentially applicable. Therefore, provisions of this section are not automatically implemented, Rather, implementation of the TRICARE program and this section requires an official action by an authorized individual, such as a military medical treatment facility commander, a Surgeon General, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), or other person authorized by the Assistant Secretary. Public notice of the initiation of the TRICARE program will be achieved through appropriate communication and media methods and by way of an official announcement by the Director, OCHAMPUS, identifying the military medical treatment facility catchment area or other geographical area covered. (6) Major features of the TRICARE program. The major features of the TRICARE program, described in this section, include the following: (i) Comprehensive enrollment system. Under the TRICARE program, all health care beneficiaries become classified into one of four categories: (A) Active duty members, all of whom are automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime; (B) TRICARE Prime enrollees; (C) TRICARE Standard participants, who are all CHAMPUS eligible beneficiaries who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime; (D) Non-CHAMPUS beneficiaries, who are beneficiaries eligible for health care services in military treatment facilities, but not eligible for CHAMPUS; (ii) Establishment of a triple option benefit. A second major feature of TRICARE is the establishment of three options for receiving health care: (A) ``TRICARE Prime,'' which is a health maintenance organization (HMO)-like program. It generally features use of military treatment facilities and substantially reduced out-of-pocket costs for CHAMPUS care. Beneficiaries generally agree to use military treatment facilities and designated civilian provider networks and to follow certain managed care rules and procedures. (B) ``TRICARE Extra,'' which is a preferred provider organization (PPO) program. It allows TRICARE Standard beneficiaries to use the TRICARE provider network, including both military facilities and the civilian network, with reduced out-of-pocket costs. These beneficiaries also continue to be [[Page 308]] eligible for military medical treatment facility care on a space- available basis. (C) ``TRICARE Standard'' which is the basic CHAMPUS program. All eligible beneficiaries are automatically included in Standard unless they have enrolled in Prime. It preserves broad freedom of choice of civilian providers, but does not offer reduced out-of-pocket costs. These beneficiaries continue to be eligible to receive care in military medical treatment facilities on a space available basis. (iii) Coordination between military and civilian health care delivery systems. A third major feature of the TRICARE program is a series of activities affecting all beneficiary enrollment categories, designed to coordinate care between military and civilian health care systems. These activities include: (A) Resource sharing agreements, under which a TRICARE contractor provides to a military medical treatment facility, personnel and other resources to increase the availability of services in the facility. All beneficiary enrollment categories may benefit from this increase. (B) Health care finder, an administrative activity that facilitates referrals to appropriate health care services in the military facility and civilian provider network. All beneficiary enrollment categories may use the health care finder. (C) Integrated quality and utilization management services, potentially standardizing reviews for military and civilian sector providers. All beneficiary categories may benefit from these services. (iv) Consolidated schedule of charges. A fourth major feature of TRICARE is a consolidated schedule of charges, incorporating revisions that reduce differences in charges between military and civilian services. In general, the TRICARE program reduces out-of-pocket costs for civilian sector care. (7) Preemption of State laws. (i) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103 and section 8025 (fourth proviso) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1994, the Department of Defense has determined that in the administration of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including but not limited to the assurance of uniform national health programs for military families and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to the Department of Defense, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States. (ii) Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section, any State or local law relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is preempted and does not apply in connection with TRICARE regional contracts. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without any force or effect, and State or local governments have no legal authority to enforce them in relation to the TRICARE regional contracts. (However, the Department of Defense may by contract establish legal obligations of the part of TRICARE contractors to conform with requirements similar or identical to requirements of State or local laws or regulations). (iii) The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of the statutes identified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD health and dental services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f). [[Page 309]] (b) Triple option benefit in general. Where the TRICARE program is fully implemented, eligible beneficiaries are given the option of enrolling in TRICARE Prime (also referred to as ``Prime'') or remaining in TRICARE Standard (also referred to as ``Standard''). In the absence of an enrollment in Prime, coverage under Standard is automatic. (1) Choice voluntary. With the exception of active duty members, the choice of whether to enroll in Prime is voluntary for all eligible beneficiaries. For dependents who are minors, the choice will be exercised by a parent or guardian. (2) Active duty members. For active duty members located in areas where the TRICARE program is implemented, enrollment in Prime is mandatory. (3) Automatic enrollment of certain dependents: Under 10 U.S.C. 1097a, in the case of dependents of active duty members in the grade of E-1 to E-4, such dependents who reside in a catchment area of a military treatment facility shall be enrolled in TRICARE Prime consistent with procedures established under paragraph (o)(7) of this section. The enrollment of a dependent of the member may be terminated by the member, dependent or other responsible individual at any time. (c) Eligibility for enrollment. Where the TRICARE program is fully implemented, all CHAMPUS-eligible beneficiaries who are not Medicare eligible on the basis of age are eligible to enroll in Prime or to remain covered under Standard. CHAMPUS beneficiaries who are eligible for Medicare on basis of age (and are enrolled in Medicare Part B) are automatically covered under TRICARE Standard. Further, some rules and procedures are different for dependents of active duty members and retirees, dependents, and survivors. In addition, where the TRICARE program is implemented, a military medical treatment facility commander or other authorized individual may establish priorities, consistent with paragraph (c) of this section, based on availability or other operational requirements, for when and whether to offer enrollment in Prime. (1) Active duty members. Active duty members are required to enroll in Prime when it is offered. Active duty members shall have first priority for enrollment in Prime. Because active duty members are not CHAMPUS eligible, when active duty members obtain care from civilian providers outside the military medical treatment facility, the supplemental care program and its requirements (including Sec. 199.16) will apply. (2) Dependents of active duty members. (i) Dependents of active duty members are eligible to enroll in Prime. After all active duty members are enrolled, those dependents of active duty members in the grade of E-1 to E-4 will have second priority and all other dependents of active duty members will have third priority. (ii) If all dependents of active duty members within the area concerned cannot be accepted for enrollment in Prime at the same time, the MTF Commander (or other authorized individual) may establish priorities within this beneficiary group category. The priorities may be based on first-come, first-served, or alternatively, be based on rank of sponsor, beginning with the lowest pay grade. (3) Retired members, dependents of retired members, and survivors.(i) Where TRICARE is fully implemented, all CHAMPUS-eligible retired members, dependents of retired members, and survivors who are not eligible for Medicare on the basis of age are eligible to enroll in Prime. After all active duty members are enrolled and availability of enrollment is assured for all active duty dependents wishing to enroll, this category of beneficiaries will have third priority for enrollment. (ii) If all eligible retired members, dependents of retired members, and survivors within the area concerned cannot be accepted for enrollment in Prime at the same time, the MTF Commander (or other authorized individual) may allow enrollment within this beneficiary group category on a first come, first served basis. (4) Coverage under Standard. All CHAMPUS-eligible beneficiaries who do not enroll in Prime will remain in Standard. (d) Health benefits under Prime. Health benefits under Prime, set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, differ from [[Page 310]] those under Extra and Standard, set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. (1) Military treatment facility (MTF) care--(i) In general. All participants in Prime are eligible to receive care in military treatment facilities. Participants in Prime will be given priority for such care over other beneficiaries. Among the following beneficiary groups, access priority for care in military treatment facilities where TRICARE is implemented as follows: (A) Active duty service members; (B) Active duty service members' dependents and survivors of service members who died on active duty, who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime; (C) Retirees, their dependents and survivors, who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime; (D) Active duty service members' dependents and survivors of service members who died on active duty, who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime; and (E) Retirees, their dependents and survivors who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), survivors of members who died while on active duty are considered as among dependents of active duty service members. (ii) Special provisions. Enrollment in Prime does not affect access priority for care in military treatment facilities for several miscellaneous beneficiary groups and special circumstances. Those include Secretarial designees, NATO and other foreign military personnel and dependents authorized care through international agreements, civilian employees under workers' compensation programs or under safety programs, members on the Temporary Disability Retired List (for statutorily required periodic medical examinations), members of the reserve components not on active duty (for covered medical services), military prisoners, active duty dependents unable to enroll in Prime and temporarily away from place of residence, and others as designated by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). Additional exceptions to the normal Prime enrollment access priority rules may be granted for other categories of individuals, eligible for treatment in the MTF, whose access to care is necessary to provide an adequate clinical case mix to support graduate medical education programs or readiness-related medical skills sustainment activities, to the extent approved by the ASD(HA). (2) Non-MTF care for active duty members. Under Prime, non-MTF care needed by active duty members continues to be arranged under the supplemental care program and subject to the rules and procedures of that program, including those set forth in Sec. 199.16. (3) Benefits covered for CHAMPUS eligible beneficiaries for civilian sector care. The provisions of Sec. 199.18 regarding the Uniform HMO Benefit apply to TRICARE Prime enrollees. (e) Health benefits under the TRICARE extra plan. Beneficiaries not enrolled in Prime, although not in general required to use the Prime civilian preferred provider network, are eligible to use the network on a case-by-case basis under Extra. The health benefits under Extra are identical to those under Standard, set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, except that the CHAMPUS cost sharing percentages are lower than usual CHAMPUS cost sharing. The lower requirements are set forth in the consolidated schedule of charges in paragraph (m) of this section. (f) Health benefits under the TRICARE standard plan. Where the TRICARE program is implemented, health benefits under Prime, set forth under paragraph (d) of this section, and Extra, set forth under paragraph (e) of this section, are different than health benefits under Standard, set forth in this paragraph (f). (1) Military treatment facility (MTF) care. All nonenrollees (including beneficiaries not eligible to enroll) continue to be eligible to receive care in military treatment facilities on a space available basis. (2) Freedom of choice of civilian provider. Except as stated in Sec. 199.4(a) in connection with nonavailability statement requirements, CHAMPUS-eligible participants in Standard maintain their freedom of choice of civilian provider under CHAMPUS. All nonavailability statement requirements of Sec. 199.4(a) apply to Standard participants. [[Page 311]] (3) CHAMPUS benefits apply. The benefits, rules and procedures of the CHAMPUS basis program as set forth in this part, shall apply to CHAMPUS-eligible participants in Standard. (4) Preferred provider network option for standard participants. Standard participants, although not generally required to use the TRICARE program preferred provider network are eligible to use the network on a case-by-case basis, under Extra. (g) TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members. (1) In general. In geographic areas in which TRICARE Prime is not offered and in which eligible family members reside, there is offered under 10 U.S.C. 1079(p) TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members as an enrollment option. TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members (TPRADFM) will generally follow the rules and procedures of TRICARE Prime, except as provided in this paragraph (g) and otherwise except to the extent the Director, TRICARE Management Activity determines them to be infeasible because of the remote area. (2) Active duty family member. For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term ``active duty family member'' means one of the following dependents of an active duty member of the Uniformed Services: spouse, child, or unmarried child placed in the legal custody of the active duty member as a result of an order of a court of competent jurisdiction for a period of at least 12 consecutive months. (3) Eligibility. (i) An active duty family member is eligible for TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members if he or she is eligible for CHAMPUS and, on or after December 2, 2003 meets the criteria of either (g)(3)(i)(A) and (B), or (g)(3)(i)(C): (A) The family member's active duty sponsor has been assigned permanent duty as a recruiter; as an instructor at an educational institution, an administrator of a program, or to provide administrative services in support of a program of instruction for the Reserve Officers' Training Corps; as a full-time adviser to a unit of a reserve component; or any other permanent duty designated by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity that the Director determines is more than 50 miles, or approximately one hour driving time, from the nearest military treatment facility that is adequate to provide care. (B) The family members and active duty sponsor, pursuant to the assignment of duty described in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A) of this section, reside at a location designed by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, that the Director determines is more than 50 miles, or approximately one hour driving time, from the nearest military medical treatment facility that is adequate to provide care. (C) The family member, having resided together with the active duty sponsor while the sponsor served in an assignment described in (g)(3)(i)(A), continues to reside at the same location after the sponsor relocates without the family member pursuant to orders for a permanent change of duty station, and the orders do not authorize dependents to accompany the sponsor to the new duty station at the expense of the United States. (ii) A family member who is a dependent of a reserve component member is eligible for TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family members if he or she is eligible for CHAMPUS and meets all of the following additional criteria: (A) The reserve component member has been ordered to active duty for a period of more than 30 days. (B) The family member resides with the member. (C) The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, determines the residence of the reserve component member is more than 50 miles, or approximately one hour driving time, from the nearest military medical treatment facility that is adequate to provide care. (D) ``Resides with'' is defined as the TRICARE Prime Remote residence address at which the family resides with the activated reservist upon activation. (4) Enrollment. TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members requires enrollment under procedures set forth in paragraph (o) of this section or as otherwise established by the Executive Director, TRICARE Management Activity. [[Page 312]] (5) Health care management requirements under TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members. The additional health care management requirements applicable to Prime enrollees under paragraph (n) of this section are applicable under TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members unless the Executive Director, TRICARE Management Activity determines they are infeasible because of the particular remote location. Enrollees will be given notice of the applicable management requirements in their remote location. (6) Cost sharing. Beneficiary cost sharing requirements under TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members are the same as those under TRICARE Prime under paragraph (m) of this section, except that the higher point-of-service option cost sharing and deductible shall not apply to routine primary health care services in cases in which, because of the remote location, the beneficiary is not assigned a primary care manager or the Executive Director, TRICARE Management Activity determines that care from a TRICARE network provider is not available within the TRICARE access standards under paragraph (p)(5) of this section. The higher point-of-service option cost sharing and deductible shall apply to specialty health care services received by any TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members enrollee unless an appropriate referral/preauthorization is obtained as required by section (n) under TRICARE Prime. In the case of pharmacy services under Sec. 199.21, where the Director, TRICARE Management Activity determines that no TRICARE network retail pharmacy has been established within a reasonable distance of the residence of the TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members enrollee, cost sharing applicable to TRICARE network retail pharmacies will be applicable to all CHAMPUS eligible pharmacies in the remote area. (h) Resource sharing agreements. Under the TRICARE program, any military medical treatment facility (MTF) commander may establish resource sharing agreements with the applicable managed care support contractor for the purpose of providing for the sharing of resources between the two parties. Internal resource sharing and external resource sharing agreements are authorized. The provisions of this paragraph (h) shall apply to resource sharing agreements under the TRICARE program. (1) In connection with internal resource sharing agreements, beneficiary cost sharing requirements shall be the same as those applicable to health care services provided in facilities of the uniformed services. (2) Under internal resource sharing agreements, the double coverage requirements of Sec. 199.8 shall be replaced by the Third Party Collection procedures of 32 CFR part 220, to the extent permissible under such part. In such a case, payments made to a resource sharing agreement provider through the TRICARE managed care support contractor shall be deemed to be payments by the MTF concerned. (3) Under internal or external resource sharing agreements, the commander of the MTF concerned may authorize the provision of services, pursuant to the agreement, to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, if such services are not reimbursable by Medicare, and if the commander determines that this will promote the most cost-effective provision of services under the TRICARE program. (i) Health care finder. The Health Care Finder is an administrative activity that assists beneficiaries in being referred to appropriate health care providers, especially the MTF and preferred providers. Health Care Finder services are available to all beneficiaries. In the case of TRICARE Prime enrollees, the Health Care Finder will facilitate referrals in accordance with Prime rules and procedures. For Standard participants, the Finder will provide assistance for use of Extra. For Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, the Finder will facilitate referrals to TRICARE network providers, generally required to be Medicare participating providers. For participants in other managed care programs, the Finder will assist in referrals pursuant to the arrangements made with the other [[Page 313]] managed care program. For all beneficiary enrollment categories, the finder will assist in obtaining access to available services in the medical treatment facility. (j) General quality assurance, utilization review, and preauthorization requirements under TRICARE program. All quality assurance, utilization review, and preauthorization requirements for the basic CHAMPUS program, as set forth in this part 199 (see especially applicable provisions of Sec. Sec. 199.4 and 199.15), are applicable to Prime, Extra and Standard under the TRICARE program. Under all three options, some methods and procedures for implementing and enforcing these requirements may differ from the methods and procedures followed under the basic CHAMPUS program in areas in which the TRICARE program has not been implemented. Pursuant to an agreement between a military medical treatment facility and TRICARE managed care support contractor, quality assurance, utilization review, and preauthorization requirements and procedures applicable to health care services outside the military medical treatment facility may be made applicable, in whole or in part, to health care services inside the military medical treatment facility. (k) Pharmacy services. Pharmacy services under Prime are as provided in the Pharmacy benefits Program (see Sec. 199.21). (l) PRIMUS and NAVCARE clinics--(1) Description and authority. PRIMUS and NAVCARE clinics are contractor owned, staffed, and operated clinics that exclusively serve uniformed services beneficiaries. They are authorized as transitional entities during the phase-in of TRICARE. This authority to operate a PRIMUS or NAVCARE clinic will cease upon implementation of TRICARE in the clinic's location, or on October 1, 1997, whichever is later. (2) Eligible beneficiaries. All TRICARE beneficiary categories are eligible for care in PRIMUS and NAVCARE Clinics. This includes active duty members, Medicare-eligible beneficiaries and other MHSS-eligible persons not eligible for CHAMPUS. (3) Services and charges. For care provided PRIMUS and NAVCARE Clinics, CHAMPUS rules regarding program benefits, deductibles and cost sharing requirements do not apply. Services offered and charges will be based on those applicable to care provided in military medical treatment facilities. (4) Priority access. Access to care in PRIMUS and NAVCARE Clinics shall be based on the same order of priority as is established for military treatment facilities care under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. (m) Consolidated schedule of beneficiary charges. The following consolidated schedule of beneficiary charges is applicable to health care services provided under TRICARE for Prime enrollees, Standard enrollees and Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. (There are no charges to active duty members. Charges for participants in other managed health care programs affiliated with TRICARE will be specified in the applicable affiliation agreements.) (1) Cost sharing for services from TRICARE network providers. (i) For Prime enrollees, cost sharing is as specified in the Uniform HMO Benefit in Sec. 199.18, except that for care not authorized by the primary care manager or Health Care Finder, rules applicable to the TRICARE point of service option (see paragraph (n)(3) of this section) are applicable. For such unauthorized care, the deductible is $300 per person and $600 per family. The beneficiary cost share is 50 percent of the allowable charges for inpatient and outpatient care, after the deductible. (ii) For Standard participants, TRICARE Extra cost sharing applies. The deductible is the same as standard CHAMPUS. Cost shares are as follows: (A) For outpatient professional services, cost sharing will be reduced from 20 percent to 15 percent for dependents of active duty members. (B) For most services for retired members, dependents of retired members, and survivors, cost sharing is reduced from 25 percent to 20 percent. (C) In fiscal year 1996, the per diem inpatient hospital copayment for retirees, dependents of retirees, and survivors when they use a preferred provider network hospital is $250 per day, or 25 percent of total charges, whichever is less. There is a nominal copayment for active duty dependents, which [[Page 314]] is the same as under the CHAMPUS program (see Sec. 199.4). The per diem amount may be updated for subsequent years based on changes in the standard CHAMPUS per diem. (iii) For Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, cost sharing will generally be as applicable to Medicare participating providers. (2) Cost sharing for non-network providers. (i) For TRICARE Prime enrollees, rules applicable to the TRICARE point of service option (see paragraph (n)(3) of this section) are applicable. The deductible is $300 per person and $600 per family. The beneficiary cost share is 50 percent of the allowable charges, after the deductible. (ii) For Standard participants, cost sharing is as specified for the basic CHAMPUS program. (3) Cost sharing under internal resource sharing agreements. (i) For Prime enrollees, cost sharing is as provided in military treatment facilities. (ii) For Standard participants, cost sharing is as provided in military treatment facilities. (iii) For Medicare eligible beneficiaries, where made applicable by the commander of the military medical treatment facility concerned, cost sharing will be as provided in military treatment facilities. (4) Cost sharing under external resource sharing. (i) For Prime enrollees, cost sharing applicable to services provided by military facility personnel shall be as applicable to services in military treatment facilities; that applicable to institutional and related ancillary charges shall be as applicable to services provided under TRICARE Prime. (ii) For TRICARE Standard participants, cost sharing applicable to services provided by military facility personnel shall be as applicable to services in military treatment facilities; that applicable to non- military providers, including institutional and related ancillary charges, shall be as applicable to services provided under TRICARE Extra. (5) Prescription drugs. Cost sharing for prescription drugs is as provided under the Pharmacy Benefits Program in Sec. 199.21. (6) Cost share for outpatient services in military treatment facilities. (i) For dependents of active duty members in all enrollment categories, there is no charge for outpatient visits provided in military medical treatment facilities. (ii) For retirees, their dependents, and survivors in all enrollment categories, there is no charge for outpatient visits provided in military medical treatment facilities. (7) Cost sharing for additional beneficiaries under the TRICARE Prime Remote Program. (i) Active duty family members, defined as the lawful husband or wife of a member, and children, as defined in Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(ii)(A) through (b)(2)(ii)(F) and (b)(2)(ii)(H)(1), (b)(2)(ii)(H)(2), and (b)(2)(ii)(H)(4), residing with their Active Duty Service Member Sponsor who is TRICARE Prime Remote eligible will have cost-shares, co-payments, and deductibles waived for services provided on or after October 30, 2000. Pharmacy Benefits Program cost-shares established under Sec. 199.21 apply to services provided on or after April 1, 2001. Active Duty Service Member Sponsors who are TRICARE Prime Remote eligible are those who receive a remote permanent duty assignment, and pursuant to the assignment, reside at a location that is more than 50 miles, or approximately one hour of driving time from the nearest military medical treatment facility adequate to provide the needed care. Remote permanent duty assignments include permanent duty as a recruiter; permanent duty at an educational institution to instruct, administer a program of instruction, or provide administrative services in support of a program of instruction for the Reserves Officers' Training Corps; permanent duty as a full-time adviser to a unit of a reserve component; or any other permanent duty designated by the Secretary. This waiver applies to TRICARE covered benefits only. Claims processed with a date of service beginning on or after October 30, 2000 will waive the cost-share, copayment, and deductible. Active Duty Family Members residing with TPR eligible Active Duty Service Member (ADSM) have copayments, cost-shares, and deductibles for CHAMPUS covered benefits except pharmacy benefits waived until the implementation of TRICARE Prime Remote for Family Members or [[Page 315]] October 30, 2001, whichever is later. The claims processor will pay the waived portion of the claim to the eligible family member or to the provider, as appropriate. (ii) Eligible family members will be able to access their provider without preauthorization. To obtain the waiver of charges, eligible family members are required to use network providers, where available and within the TRICARE access standards. Failure to do so will result in claims being processed under TRICARE Standard rules. For beneficiaries who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime, existing specialty care preauthorization requirements and Point of Service rules remain in effect. (iii) To the greatest extent possible, contractors will assist eligible members in finding a TRICARE network, participating, or authorized provider. If a network provider cannot be identified within the access standards established under TRICARE, the eligible family member shall use an authorized provider to be eligible for the waiver. (n) Additional health care management requirements under TRICARE prime. Prime has additional, special health care management requirements not applicable under Extra, Standard or the CHAMPUS basic program. Such requirements must be approved by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). In TRICARE, all care may be subject to review for medical necessity and appropriateness of level of care, regardless of whether the care is provided in a military medical treatment facility or in a civilian setting. Adverse determinations regarding care in military facilities will be appealable in accordance with established military medical department procedures, and adverse determinations regarding civilian care will be appealable in accordance with Sec. 199.15. (1) Primary care manager. (i) All active duty members and Prime enrollees will be assigned or allowed to select a primary care manager pursuant to a system established by the MTF Commander or other authorized official, and consistent with the access standards in paragraph (p)(5)(i) of this section. The primary care manager may be an individual, physician, a group practice, a clinic, a treatment site, or other designation. The primary care manager may be part of the MTF or the Prime civilian provider network. The enrollee will be given the opportunity to register a preference for primary care manager from a list of choices provided by the MTF Commander. This preference will be entered on a TRICARE Prime enrollment form or similar document. Preference requests will be honored subject to availability, under the MTF beneficiary category priority system and other operational requirements established by the commander and other authorized person. MTF PCM nonavailability may be a condition of assignment to a civilian provider network PCM. (ii) Prime enrollees who are dependents of active duty members in pay grades E-1 through E-4 shall have priority over other active duty dependents for enrollment with MTF PCMs, subject to MTF capacity. (2) Restrictions on the use of providers. The requirements of this paragraph (n)(2) shall be applicable to health care utilization under TRICARE Prime, except in cases of emergency care and under the point-of- service option (see paragraph (n)(3) of this section). (i) Prime enrollees must obtain all primary health care from the primary care manager or from another provider to which the enrollee is referred by the primary care manager or an authorized Health Care Finder. (ii) For any necessary specialty care and nonemergent inpatient care, the primary care manager or the Health Care Finder will assist in making an appropriate referral. (A) For healthcare services provided under managed care support contracts entered into by the Department of Defense before October 30, 2000, all such nonemergency specialty care and inpatient care must be preauthorized by the primary care manager or the Health Care Finder. (B) For healthcare services provided under TRICARE contracts entered into by the Department of Defense on or after October 30, 2000, referral requests (consultation requests) for specialty care consultation appointment services for TRICARE Prime beneficiaries must [[Page 316]] be submitted by primary care managers. Such referrals will be authorized by Health Care Finders (authorizations numbers will be assigned so as to facilitate claims processing) but medical necessity preauthorization will not be required by referral consultation appointment services within the TRICARE contractor's network. Some health care services subsequent to consultation appointments (invasive procedures, nonemergent admissions and other health care services as determined by the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or a designee) will require medical necessity preauthorization. Though referrals for specialty care are generally the responsibility of the primary care managers, subject to discretion exercised by the regional Lead Agents, and established in regional policy or memoranda of understanding, specialist providers may be permitted to refer patients for additional specialty consultation appointment services within the TRICARE contractor's network without prior authorization by primary care managers or subject to medical necessity preauthorization. (iii) The following procedures will apply to health care referrals and preauthorizations in catchment areas under TRICARE Prime: (A) The first priority for referral for specialty care or inpatient care will be to the local MTF (or to any other MTF in which catchment area the enrollee resides). (B) If the local MTF(s) are unavailable for the services needed, but there is another MTF at which the needed services can be provided, the enrollee may be required to obtain the services at that MTF. However, this requirement will only apply to the extent that the enrollee was informed at the time of (or prior to) enrollment that mandatory referrals might be made to the MTF involved for the service involved. (C) If the needed services are available within civilian preferred provider network serving the area, the enrollee may be required to obtain the services from a provider within the network. Subject to availability, the enrollee will have the freedom to choose a provider from among those in the network. (D) If the needed services are not available within the civilian preferred provider network serving the area, the enrollee may be required to obtain the services from a designated civilian provider outside the area. However, this requirement will only apply to the extent that the enrollee was informed at the time of (or prior to) enrollment that mandatory referrals might be made to the provider involved for the service involved (with the provider and service either identified specifically or in connection with some appropriate classification). (E) In cases in which the needed health care services cannot be provided pursuant to the procedures identified in paragraphs (n)(2)(iii) (A) through (D) of this section, the enrollee will receive authorization to obtain services from a CHAMPUS-authorized civilian provider(s) of the enrollee's choice not affiliated with the civilian preferred provider network. (iv) When Prime is operating in noncatchment areas, the requirements in paragraphs (n)(2)(iii) (B) through (E) of this section shall apply. (v) Any health care services obtained by a Prime enrollee, but not obtained in accordance with the utilization management rules and procedures of Prime will not be paid for under Prime rules, but may be covered by the point-of-service option (see paragraph (n)(3) of this section). However, Prime rules may cover such services if the enrollee did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the services were not obtained in accordance with the utilization management rules and procedures of Prime. (vi) In accordance with guidelines issued by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, certain travel expenses may be reimbursed when a TRICARE Prime enrollee is referred by the primary care manager for medically necessary specialty care more than 100 miles away from the primary care manager's office received on or after October 30, 2000. Such guidelines shall be consistent with appropriate provisions of generally applicable Department of Defense rules and procedures governing travel expenses. (3) Point-of-service option. TRICARE Prime enrollees retain the freedom to [[Page 317]] obtain services from civilian providers on a point-of-service basis. In such cases, all requirements applicable to standard CHAMPUS shall apply, except that there shall be higher deductible and cost sharing requirements (as set forth in paragraphs (m)(1)(i) and (m)(2)(i) of this section). (o) TRICARE program enrollment procedures. There are certain requirements pertaining to procedures for enrollment in Prime and TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members. (These procedures do not apply to active duty members, whose enrollment is mandatory). (1) Open enrollment. Beneficiaries will be offered the opportunity to enroll in Prime on a continuing basis. (2) Enrollment period. The following provisions apply to enrollment periods on or after March 10, 2003. (i) Beneficiaries who select the TRICARE Prime option or the TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members option remain enrolled for 12 months increments until: they take action to disenroll; they are no longer eligible for enrollment in TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Prime Remote for Active Duty Family Members; or they are disenrolled for failure to pay required enrollment fees if applicable. For those who remain eligible for TRICARE Prime enrollment, no later than 15 days before the expiration date of an enrollment, the sponsor will be sent a written notification of the pending expiration and renewal of the TRICARE Prime enrollment. TRICARE Prime enrollments shall be automatically renewed upon the expiration of the enrollment unless the renewal is declined by the sponsor. Termination of enrollment for failure to pay enrollment fees is addressed in paragraph (o)(3) of this section. (ii) Exceptions to the 12-month enrollment period. (A) Beneficiaries who are eligible to enroll in TRICARE Prime but have less than one year of TRICARE eligibility remaining. (B) The dependents of a reservist who is called or ordered to active duty or of a member of the National Guard who is called or ordered to full-time federal National Guard duty for a period of more than 30 days. (3) Installment payments of enrollment fee. The enrollment fee required by Sec. 199.18(c) may be paid in monthly or quarterly installments. Monthly fees may be payable by an allotment from retired or retainer pay, or paid from a financial institution through an electronic transfer of funds. For beneficiaries paying enrollment fees on an installment basis, failure to make a required installment payment on a timely basis [including a grace period, as determined by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs)] will result in termination of the beneficiary's enrollment in Prime and disqualification from future enrollment in Prime for a period of one year. (4) Voluntary disenrollment. Any non-active duty beneficiary may disenroll at any time. Disenrollment will take effect in accordance with administrative procedures established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). Beneficiaries who disenroll prior to their annual enrollment renewal date will not be eligible to reenroll in Prime for a one-year period from the effective date of the disenrollment. This one-year exclusion may be waived by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) based on extraordinary circumstances. This one-year period does not apply to any dependent whose sponsor is in the grade of E-1 to E-4. (5) Period revision. Periodically, certain features, rules or procedures of Prime, Extra and/or Standard may be revised. If such revisions will have a significant effect on participants' costs or access to care, beneficiaries will be given the opportunity to change their enrollment status coincident with the revisions. (6) Effects of failure to enroll. Beneficiaries offered the opportunity to enroll in Prime, who do not enroll, will remain in Standard and will be eligible to participate in Extra on a case-by-case basis. (7) Special procedures for certain dependents of active duty members in pay grades E-1 to E-4. As an exception to other procedures in paragraph (o) of this section, dependents of active duty members in pay grades E-1 to E-4, if such dependents reside in a catchment [[Page 318]] area of a military hospital, are automatically enrolled in TRICARE Prime. The applicable military hospital shall provide written notice of the automatic enrollment to the member and the affected dependents. The effective date of such automatic enrollment shall be the date of the written notice, unless an earlier effective date is requested by the member or affected dependents, so long as the affected dependents were as of the effective date dependents of an active duty member in pay grades E-1 to E-4 and residents in a catchment area of a military hospital. Dependents who are automatically enrolled under this paragraph may disenroll at any time. Such disenrollment shall remain in effect until such dependents take specific action to reenroll which such dependents may do at any time. (p) Civilian preferred provider networks. A major feature of the TRICARE program is the civilian preferred provider network. (1) Status of network providers. Providers in the preferred provider network are not employees or agents of the Department of Defense or the United States Government. Rather, they are independent contractors of the government (or other independent entities having business arrangements with the government). Although network providers must follow numerous rules and procedures of the TRICARE program, on matters of professional judgment and professional practice, the network provider is independent and not operating under the direction and control of the Department of Defense. Each preferred provider must have adequate professional liability insurance, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and must agree to indemnify the United States Government for any liability that may be assessed against the United States Government that is attributable to any action or omission of the provider. (2) Utilization management policies. Preferred providers are required to follow the utilization management policies and procedures of the TRICARE program. These policies and procedures are part of discretionary judgments by the Department of Defense regarding the methods of delivering and financing health care services that will best achieve health and economic policy objectives. (3) Quality assurance requirements. A number of quality assurance requirements and procedures are applicable to preferred network providers. These are for the purpose of assuring that the health care services paid for with government funds meet the standards called for in the contract or provider agreement. (4) Provider qualifications. All preferred providers must meet the following qualifications: (i) They must be CHAMPUS authorized providers and CHAMPUS participating providers. (ii) All physicians in the preferred provider network must have staff privileges in a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO). This requirement may be waived in any case in which a physician's practice does not include the need for admitting privileges in such a hospital, or in locations where no JCAHO accredited facility exists. However, in any case in which the requirement is waived, the physician must comply with alternative qualification standards as are established by the MTF Commander (or other authorized official). (iii) All preferred providers must agree to follow all quality assurance, utilization management, and patient referral procedures established pursuant to this section, to make available to designated DoD utilization management or quality monitoring contractors medical records and other pertinent records, and to authorize the release of information to MTF Commanders regarding such quality assurance and utilization management activities. (iv) All preferred network providers must be Medicare participating providers, unless this requirement is waived based on extraordinary circumstances. This requirement that a provider be a Medicare participating provider does not apply to providers not eligible to be participating providers under Medicare. (v) The provider must be available to Extra participants. [[Page 319]] (vi) The provider must agree to accept the same payment rates negotiated for Prime enrollees for any person whose care is reimbursable by the Department of Defense, including, for example, Extra participants, supplemental care cases, and beneficiaries from outside the area. (vii) All preferred providers must meet all other qualification requirements, and agree to comply with all other rules and procedures established for the preferred provider network. (5) Access standards. Preferred provider networks will have attributes of size, composition, mix of providers and geographical distribution so that the networks, coupled with the MTF capabilities, can adequately address the health care needs of the enrollees. Before offering enrollment in Prime to a beneficiary group, the MTF Commander (or other authorized person) will assure that the capabilities of the MTF plus preferred provider network will meet the following access standards with respect to the needs of the expected number of enrollees from the beneficiary group being offered enrollment: (i) Under normal circumstances, enrollee travel time may not exceed 30 minutes from home to primary care delivery site unless a longer time is necessary because of the absence of providers (including providers not part of the network) in the area. (ii) The wait time for an appointment for a well-patient visit or a specialty care referral shall not exceed four weeks; for a routine visit, the wait time for an appointment shall not exceed one week; and for an urgent care visit the wait time for an appointment shall generally not exceed 24 hours. (iii) Emergency services shall be available and accessible to handle emergencies (and urgent care visits if not available from other primary care providers pursuant to paragraph (p)(5)(ii) of this section), within the service area 24 hours a day, seven days a week. (iv) The network shall include a sufficient number and mix of board certified specialists to meet reasonably the anticipated needs of enrollees. Travel time for specialty care shall not exceed one hour under normal circumstances, unless a longer time is necessary because of the absence of providers (including providers not part of the network) in the area. This requirement does not apply under the Specialized Treatment Services Program. (v) Office waiting times in nonemergency circumstances shall not exceed 30 minutes, except when emergency care is being provided to patients, and the normal schedule is disrupted. (6) Special reimbursement methods for network providers. The Director, OCHAMPUS, may establish, for preferred provider networks, reimbursement rates and methods different from those established pursuant to Sec. 199.14. Such provisions may be expressed in terms of percentage discounts off CHAMPUS allowable amounts, or in other terms. In circumstances in which payments are based on hospital-specific rates (or other rates specific to particular institutional providers), special reimbursement methods may permit payments based on discounts off national or regional prevailing payment levels, even if higher than particular institution-specific payment rates. (7) Methods for establishing preferred provider networks. There are several methods under which the MTF Commander (or other authorized official) may establish a preferred provider network. These include the following: (i) There may be an acquisition under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, either conducted locally for that catchment area, in a larger area in concert with other MTF Commanders, regionally as part of a CHAMPUS acquisition, or on some other basis. (ii) To the extent allowed by law, there may be a modification by the Director, OCHAMPUS, of an existing CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary contract to add TRICARE program functions to the existing responsibilities of the fiscal intermediary contractor. (iii) The MTF Commander (or other authorized official) may follow the ``any qualified provider'' method set forth in paragraph (q) of this section. (iv) Any other method authorized by law may be used. [[Page 320]] (q) Preferred provider network establishment under any qualified provider method. The any qualified provider method may be used to establish a civilian preferred provider network. Under this method, any CHAMPUS-authorized provider within the geographical area involved that meets the qualification standards established by the MTF Commander (or other authorized official) may become a part of the preferred provider network. Such standards must be publicly announced and uniformly applied. Also under this method, any provider who meets all applicable qualification standards may not be excluded from the preferred provider network. Qualifications include: (1) The provider must meet all applicable requirements in paragraph (p)(4) of this section. (2) The provider must agree to follow all quality assurance and utilization management procedures established pursuant to this section. (3) The provider must be a Participating Provider under CHAMPUS for all claims. (4) The provider must meet all other qualification requirements, and agree to all other rules and procedures, that are established, publicly announced, and uniformly applied by the commander (or other authorized official). (5) The provider must sign a preferred provider network agreement covering all applicable requirements. Such agreements will be for a duration of one year, are renewable, and may be canceled by the provider or the MTF Commander (or other authorized official) upon appropriate notice to the other party. The Director, OCHAMPUS shall establish an agreement model or other guidelines to promote uniformity in the agreements. (r) General fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest requirements under TRICARE program. All fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest requirements for the basic CHAMPUS program, as set forth in this part 199 (see especially applicable provisions of Sec. 199.9) are applicable to the TRICARE program. Some methods and procedures for implementing and enforcing these requirements may differ from the methods and procedures followed under the basic CHAMPUS program in areas in which the TRICARE program has not been implemented. (s) Partial implementation. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may authorize the partial implementation of the TRICARE program. The following are examples of partial implementation: (1) The TRICARE Extra Plan and the TRICARE Standard Plan may be offered without the TRICARE Prime Plan. (2) In remote sites, where complete implementation of TRICARE is impracticable, TRICARE Prime may be offered to a limited group of beneficiaries. In such cases, normal requirements of TRICARE Prime which the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) determines are impracticable may be waived. (3) The TRICARE program may be limited to particular services, such as mental health services. (t) Inclusion of Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in TRICARE networks. TRICARE preferred provider networks may include Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities pursuant to arrangements, made with the approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), between those centers and the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designated TRICARE contractor. (u) Care provided outside the United States to dependents of active duty members. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may, in conjunction with implementation of the TRICARE program, authorize a special CHAMPUS program for dependents of active duty members who accompany the members in their assignments in foreign countries. Under this special program, a preferred provider network will be established through contracts or agreements with selected health care providers. Under the network, CHAMPUS covered services will be provided to the covered dependents with all CHAMPUS requirements for deductibles and copayments waived. The use of this authority by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) for any particular geographical area will be announced in the Federal Register. The announcement will include a description of the preferred [[Page 321]] provider network program and other pertinent information. (v) Administrative procedures. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), the Director, TRICARE Management Activity, and MTF Commanders (or other authorized officials) are authorized to establish administrative requirements and procedures, consistent with this section, this part, and other applicable DoD Directives or Instructions, for the implementation and operation of the TRICARE program. [60 FR 52095, Oct. 5, 1995, as amended 63 FR 9142, Feb. 24, 1998; 63 FR 2003] Sec. 199.18 Uniform HMO Benefit. (a) In general. There is established a Uniform HMO Benefit. The purpose of the Uniform HMO benefit is to establish a health benefit option modeled on health maintenance organization plans. This benefit is intended to be uniform wherever offered throughout the United States and to be included in all managed care programs under the MHSS. Most care purchased from civilian health care providers (outside an MTF) will be under the rules of the Uniform HMO Benefit or the Basic CHAMPUS Program (see Sec. 199.4). The Uniform HMO Benefit shall apply only as specified in this section or other sections of this part, and shall be subject to any special applications indicated in such other sections. (b) Services covered under the uniform HMO benefit option. (1) Except as specifically provided or authorized by this section, all CHAMPUS benefits provided, and benefit limitations established, pursuant to this part, shall apply to the Uniform HMO Benefit. (2) Certain preventive care services not normally provided as part of basic program benefits under CHAMPUS are covered benefits when provided to Prime enrollees by providers in the civilian provider network. Standards for preventive care services shall be developed based on guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Such standards shall establish a specific schedule, including frequency or age specifications for: (i) Laboratory and x-ray tests, including blood lead, rubella, cholesterol, fecal occult blood testing, and mammography; (ii) Pap smears; (iii) Eye exams; (iv) Immunizations; (v) Periodic health promotion and disease prevention exams; (vi) Blood pressure screening; (vii) Hearing exams; (viii) Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy; (ix) Serologic screening; and (x) Appropriate education and counseling services. The exact services offered shall be established under uniform standards established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). (3) In addition to preventive care services provided pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, other benefit enhancements may be added and other benefit restrictions may be waived or relaxed in connection with health care services provided to include the Uniform HMO Benefit. Any such other enhancements or changes must be approved by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) based on uniform standards. (c) Enrollment fee under the uniform HMO benefit. (1) The CHAMPUS annual deductible amount (see Sec. 199.4(f)) is waived under the Uniform HMO Benefit during the period of enrollment. In lieu of a deductible amount, an annual enrollment fee is applicable. The specific enrollment fee requirements shall be published annually by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), and shall be uniform within the following groups: dependents of active duty members in pay grades of E-4 and below; active duty dependents of sponsors in pay grades E-5 and above; and retirees and their dependents. (2) Amount of enrollment fees. In fiscal year 2001, the annual enrollment fee for retirees and their dependents is $230 individual, $460 family. (3) Waiver of enrollment fee for certain beneficiaries. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may waive the enrollment fee requirements of this section for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. [[Page 322]] (d) Outpatient cost sharing requirements under the uniform HMO benefit--(1) In general. In lieu of usual CHAMPUS cost sharing requirements (see Sec. 199.4(f)), special reduced cost sharing percentages or per service specific dollar amounts are required. The specific requirements shall be uniform and shall be published periodically by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). For care provided on or after April 1, 2001, no copayment shall be charged for care provided under TRICARE Prime to a dependent of an active duty member, except for the copayments charged under the Pharmacy Benefits Program (see Sec. 199.21) and under the point of service option of TRICARE Prime (see Sec. 199.17(n)(4)). (2) Structure of outpatient cost sharing. The special cost sharing requirements for outpatient services include the following specific structural provisions: (i) For most physician office visits and other routine services, there is a per visit fee for retirees and their dependents. This fee applies to primary care and specialty care visits, except as provided elsewhere in this paragraph (d)(2) of this section. It also applies to family health services, home health care visits, eye examinations, and immunizations. It does not apply to ancillary health services or to preventive health services described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or to maternity services under Sec. 199.4(e)(16). (ii) There is a copayment for outpatient mental health visits. It is a per visit fee for retirees and their dependents for individual visits. For group visits, there is a lower per visit fee for retirees and their dependents. (iii) There is a cost share of durable medical equipment, prosthetic devices, and other authorized supplies for retirees and their dependents. (iv) For emergency room services, there is a per visit fee for retirees and their dependents. (v) For ambulatory surgery services, there is a per service fee for retirees and their dependents. (vi) There is a copayment for prescription drugs per prescription, including medical supplies necessary for administration, for dependents of active duty members and for retirees and their dependents under the Pharmacy Benefits Program (see Sec. 199.17(m)(5)). (vii) There is a copayment for ambulance services for retirees and their dependents. (3) Amount of outpatient cost sharing requirements. In fiscal year 2001, the outpatient cost sharing requirements are as follows: (i) For most physician office visits and other routine services, as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the per visit fee for retirees and their dependents is $12. (ii) For outpatient mental health visits, the per visit fee for retirees and their dependents is $25. For group outpatient mental health visits, there is a lower per visit fee for retirees and their dependents of $17. (iii) The cost share for durable medical equipment, prosthetic devices, and other authorized supplies for retirees and their dependents is 20 percent of the negotiated fee. (iv) For emergency room services, the per visit fee for retirees and their dependents is $30. (v) For primary surgeon services in ambulatory surgery, the per service fee for retirees and their dependents is $25. (vi) The copayments for prescription drugs are established under the Pharmacy Benefits Program (see Sec. 199.21). (vii) The copayment for ambulance services for retirees and their dependents is $20. (e) Inpatient cost sharing requirements under the uniform HMO benefit--(1) In general. In lieu of usual CHAMPUS cost sharing requirements (see Sec. 199.4(f)), special cost sharing amounts are required. The specific requirements shall be uniform and shall be published periodically by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). For services provided on or after April 1, 2001, no co-payment shall be charged for inpatient care provided under TRICARE Prime to a dependent of an active duty member except under the point of service option of TRICARE Prime (see Sec. 199.17(n)(4)). In addition, for services provided on or after April 1, 2001, no copayment shall be charged for inpatient care provided under TRICARE Prime to a dependent of an active duty member in military medical treatment facilities. [[Page 323]] (2) Structure of cost sharing. For services other than mental illness or substance use treatment, there is a nominal copayment for retired members, dependents of retired members, and survivors. For inpatient mental health and substance use treatment, a separate per day charge is established. For services provided on or after April 1, 2001, no inpatient copayment shall be charged an active duty dependent enrolled in TRICARE Prime. This elimination of inpatient copayments applies to active duty dependents enrolled in TRICARE Prime who are admitted to a civilian or military inpatient facility. (3) Amount of inpatient cost sharing requirements. In fiscal year 2001, the inpatient cost sharing requirements for retirees and their dependents for acute care admissions and other non-mental health/ substance use treatment admissions is a per diem charge of $11, with a minimum charge of $25 per admission. For mental health/substance use treatment admissions, and for partial hospitalization services, the per diem charge for retirees and their dependents is $40. (f) Limit on out-of-pocket costs under the uniform HMO benefit. (1) Total out-of-pocket costs per family of dependents of active duty members under the Uniform HMO Benefit may not exceed $1,000 during the one-year enrollment period. Total out-of-pocket costs per family of retired members, dependents of retired members and survivors under the Uniform HMO Benefit may not exceed $3,000 during the one-year enrollment period. For this purpose, out-of-pocket costs means all payments required of beneficiaries under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section. In any case in which a family reaches this limit, all remaining payments that would have been required of the beneficiary under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section will be made by the program in which the Uniform HMO Benefit is in effect. (2) The limits established by paragraph (f)(1) of this section do not apply to out-of-pocket costs incurred pursuant to paragraph (m)(1)(i) or (m)(2)(i) of Sec. 199.17 under the point-of-service option of TRICARE Prime. (g) Updates. The enrollment fees for fiscal year 2001 set under paragraph (c) of this section and the per service specific dollar amounts for fiscal year 2001 set under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section may be updated for subsequent years to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with statutory requirements pertaining to government costs. This updating does not apply to cost sharing that is expressed as a percentage of allowable charges; these percentages will remain unchanged. [60 FR 52101, Oct. 5, 1995, as amended at 63 FR 9143, Feb. 24, 1998; 63 FR FR 16400, Mar. 26, 2001] Sec. 199.20 Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP). (a) Purpose. The CHCBP is a premium based temporary health care coverage program that will be available to qualified beneficiaries (set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section). Medical coverage under this program will mirror the benefits offered via the basic CHAMPUS program. Premium costs for this coverage are payable by enrollees to a Third Party Administrator. The CHCBP is not part of the CHAMPUS program. However, as set forth in this section, it functions under most of the rules and procedures of CHAMPUS. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for the Department of Defense and the other Uniformed Services (e.g., NOAA, PHS, and the Coast Guard) health care beneficiaries losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent possible, to be part of CHAMPUS. (b) General provisions. Except for any provisions the Director, OCHAMPUS may exclude, the general provisions of Sec. 199.1 shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. (c) Definitions. Except as may be specifically provided in this section, to the extent terms defined in Sec. 199.2 are relevant to the administration of the CHCBP, the definitions contained in that section shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. (d) Eligibility and enrollment--(1) Eligibility. Enrollment in the CHCBP is open to the following individuals: (i) Members of Uniformed Services, who: [[Page 324]] (A) Are discharged or released from active duty (or full time National Guard duty), whether voluntarily or involuntarily, under other than adverse conditions; (B) Immediately preceding that discharge or release, were entitled to medical and dental care under 10 U.S.C. 1074(a) (except in the case of a member discharged or released from full-time National Guard duty); and, (C) After that discharge or release and any period of transitional health care provided under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) would not otherwise be eligible for any benefit under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55. (ii) A person who: (A) Ceases to meet requirements for being considered an unmarried dependent child of a member or former member of the armed forces under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(D); (B) On the day before ceasing to meet those requirements, was covered under a health benefits plan under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, or transitional health care under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) as a dependent of the member or former member; and, (C) Would not otherwise be eligible for any benefits under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55. (iii) A person who: (A) Is an unremarried former spouse of a member or former member of the armed forces; (B) On the day before the date of the final decree of divorce, dissolution, or annulment was covered under a health benefits plan under 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, or transitional health care under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) as a dependent of the member or former member; and, (C) Is not a dependent of the member or former member under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(F) or (G) or ends a one-year period of dependency under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(H). (iv) An unmarried person who: (A) Is placed in the legal custody of a member or former member by a court or who is placed in the home of a member or former member by a recognized placement agency in anticipation of the legal adoption of the child; and (B) Either: (1) Has not attained the age of 21 if not in school or age 23 if enrolled in a full time course of study at an institution of higher learning; or (2) Is incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical incapacity which occurred while the person was considered a dependent of the member or former member; and (C) Is dependent on the member or former member for over one-half of the person's support; and (D) Resides with the member or former member unless separated by the necessity of military service or to receive institutional care as a result of disability or incapacitation; and (E) Is not a dependent of a member or former member as described in Sec. 199.3(b)(2). (2) Effective date. Except for the special transitional provisions in paragraph (r) of this section, eligibility in the CHCBP is limited to individuals who lost their entitlement to regular military health services system benefits on or after October 1, 1994. (3) Notification of eligibility. (i) The Department of Defense and the other Uniformed Services (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Public Health Service (PHS), Coast Guard) will notify persons eligible to receive health benefits under the CHCBP. (ii) In the case of a member who becomes (or will become) eligible for continued coverage, the Department of Defense shall notify the member of their rights for coverage as part of pre-separation counseling conducted under 10 U.S.C. 1142. (iii) In the case of a child of a member or former member who becomes eligible for continued coverage: (A) The member or former member may submit to the Third Party Administrator a notice of the child's change in status (including the child's name, address, and such other information needed); and (B) The Third Party Administrator, within 14 days after receiving such information, will inform the child of the child's rights under 10 U.S.C. 1142. (iv) In the case of a former spouse of a member or former member who becomes eligible for continued coverage, the Third Party Administrator will notify the individual of eligibility for CHCBP when he or she declares the change in marital status to a military personnel office. [[Page 325]] (4) Election of coverage. (i) In order to obtain continued coverage, written election by eligible beneficiary must be made, within a prescribed time period. In the case of a member discharged or released from active duty (or full time National Guard duty), whether voluntarily or involuntarily; an unremarried spouse of a member or former member; or a child emancipated from a member or former member, the written election shall be submitted to the Third Party Administrator before the end of the 60-day period beginning on the later of: (A) The date of the discharge or release of the member from active duty or full-time National Guard duty; (B) The date on which the period of transitional health care applicable to the member under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a) ends; (C) In the case of an unremarried former spouse of a member or former member, the date the one-year extension of dependency under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(H) expires; or (D) The date the member receives the notification of eligibility. (ii) A member of the armed forces who is eligible for enrollment under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section may elect self-only or family coverage. Family members who may be included in such family coverage are the spouse and children of the member. (5) Enrollment. Enrollment in the Continued Health Care Benefit Program will be accomplished by submission of an application to a Third Party Administrator (TPA). Upon submittal of an application to the Third Party Administrator, the enrollee must submit proof of eligibility. One of the following types of evidence will validate eligibility for care: (i) A Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) printout which indicates the appropriate sponsor status and the sponsor's and dependent's eligibility dates; (ii) A copy of a verified and approved DD Form 1172, ``Application for Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card''; (iii) A front and back copy of a DD Form 1173, ``Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card'' overstamped ``TA'' for Transition Assistance Management Program; or (iv) A copy of a DD Form 214--``Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty''. (6) Period of coverage. CHCBP coverage may not extend beyond: (i) For a member discharged or released from active duty (or full time National Guard duty), whether voluntarily or involuntarily, the date which is 18 months after the date the member ceases to be entitled to care under 10 U.S.C. 1074(a) and any transitional care under 10 U.S.C. 1145. (ii) In the case of an unmarried dependent child of a member or former member, the date which is 36 months after the date on which the person first ceases to meet the requirements for being considered an unmarried dependent child under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(D). (iii) In the case of an unremarried former spouse of a member or former member, the date which is 36 months after the later of: (A) The date on which the final decree of divorce, dissolution, or annulment occurs; or (B) If applicable, the date the one-year extension of dependency under 10 U.S.C. 1072(2)(H) expires. (iv) In the case of an unremarried former spouse of a member or former member, whose divorce occurred prior to the end of transitional coverage, the period of coverage under the CHCBP is unlimited, if: (A) Has not remarried before the age of 55; and (B) Was enrolled in the CHCBP as the dependent of an involuntarily separated member during the 18-month period before the date of the divorce, dissolution, or annulment; and (C) Is receiving a portion of the retired or retainer pay of a member or former member or an annuity based on the retainer pay of the member; or (D) Has a court order for payment of any portion of the retired or retainer pay; or (E) Has a written agreement (whether voluntary or pursuant to a court order) which provides for an election by the member or former member to provide an annuity to the former spouse. (v) For the beneficiary who becomes eligible for the Continued Health Care Benefit Program by ceasing to meet [[Page 326]] the requirements for being considered an unmarried dependent child of a member or former member, health care coverage may not extend beyond the date which is 36 months after the date the member becomes ineligible for medical and dental care under 10 U.S.C. 1074(a) and any transitional health care under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a). (vi) Though beneficiaries have sixty-days (60) to elect coverage under the CHCBP, upon enrolling, the period of coverage must begin the day after entitlement to a military health care plan (including transitional health care under 10 U.S.C. 1145(a)) ends. (e) CHCBP benefits--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the provisions of Sec. 199.4 shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. (2) Exceptions.

(k) Overpayment recovery. The provisions of Sec. 199.11 shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. (l) Third Party recoveries. The provisions of Sec. 199.12 shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. (m) Provider reimbursement methods. The provisions of Sec. 199.14 shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. (n) Peer Review Organization Program. The provisions of Sec. 199.15 shall apply to the CHCBP as they do to CHAMPUS. (o) Preferred provider organization programs available. Any preferred provider organization program under this part that provides for reduced cost sharing for using designated providers, such as the ``TRICARE Extra'' option under Sec. 199.17, shall be available to participants in the CHCBP as it is to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. (p) Special programs not applicable--(1) In general. Special programs established under this part that are not part of the basic CHAMPUS program established pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1079 and 1086 are not, unless specifically provided in this section, available to participants in the CHCBP. (2) Examples. The special programs referred to in paragraph (p)(1) of this section include: (i) The Program for Persons with Disabilities under Sec. 199.5; (ii) The Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan under Sec. 199.13; (iii) The Supplemental Health Care Program under Sec. 199.16; and (iv) The TRICARE Enrollment Program under Sec. 199.17, except for TRICARE Extra program under that section. (3) Exemptions to the restriction. In addition to the provision to make TRICARE Extra available to CHCBP beneficiaries, the following two demonstration projects are also available to CHCBP enrollees: (i) Home Health Care Demonstration; and (ii) Home Health Care-Case Management Demonstration. (q) Premiums--(1) Rates. Premium rates will be established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) for two rate groups-- individual [[Page 327]] and family. Eligible beneficiaries will select the level of coverage they require at the time of initial enrollment (either individual or family) and pay the appropriate premium payment. The rates are based on Federal Employee Health Benefit Program employee and agency contributions required for a comparable health benefits plan, plus an administrative fee. The administrative fee, not to exceed ten percent of the basic premium amount, shall be determined based on actual expected administrative costs for administration of the program. Premiums may be revised annually and shall be published annually for each fiscal year. Premiums will be paid by enrollees quarterly. (2) Effects of failure to make premium payments. Failure by enrollees to submit timely and proper premium payments will result in denial of continued enrollment and denial of payment of medical claims. Premium payments which are late 30 days or more past the start of the quarter for which payment is due will result in the ending of beneficiary enrollment. Beneficiaries denied continued enrollment due to lack of premium payments will not be allowed to reenroll. In such a case, benefit coverage will cease at the end of the ninety day (90) period for which a premium payment was received. Enrollees will be held liable for medical costs incurred after losing eligibility. (r) Transitional provisions. (1) There will be a sixty-day period of enrollment for all eligible beneficiaries (outlined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) whose entitlement to regular military health services system coverage ended on or after August 2, 1994, but prior to the CHCBP implementation on October 1, 1994. (2) Enrollment in the U.S. VIP program may continue up to October 1, 1994. Policies written prior to October 1, 1994, will remain in effect until the end of the policy life. (3) On or after the October 1, 1994, implementation of the Continued Health Care Benefit Program, beneficiaries who enrolled in the U.S. VIP program prior to October 1, 1994, may elect to cancel their U.S. VIP policy and enroll in the CHCBP. (4) With the exception of persons enrolled in the U.S. VIP program who may convert to the CHCBP, individuals who lost their entitlement to regular military health services system coverage prior to August 2, 1994, are not eligible for the CHCBP. (s) Procedures. The Director, OCHAMPUS, may establish other rules and procedures for the administration of the Continued Health Care Benefit Program. [59 FR 49818, Sept. 30, 1994, as amended at 62 FR 35097, June 30, 1997; 64 FR 46141, Aug. 24, 1999] Sec. 199.21 Pharmacy benefits program. (a) General--(1) Statutory authority. Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 1074g requires that the Department of Defense establish an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program for the Military Health System. This law is independent of a number of sections of Title 10 and other laws that affect the benefits, rules, and procedures of TRICARE, resulting in changes to the rules otherwise applicable to TRICARE Prime, Standard, and Extra. (2) Pharmacy benefits program. The pharmacy benefits program, which includes the uniform formulary and its associated tiered co-payment structure, is applicable to all of the uniformed services. Its geographical applicability is all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In addition, if authorized by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), the TRICARE program may be implemented in areas outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In such case, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may also authorize modifications to the pharmacy benefits program rules as may be appropriate to the areas involved. (3) Uniform formulary. The pharmacy benefits program features a uniform formulary of pharmaceutical agents as defined in Sec. 199.2. (i) The uniform formulary will assure the availability of pharmaceutical agents in the complete range of therapeutic classes authorized as basic program benefits. [[Page 328]] (ii) As required by 10 U.S.C. 1074g(a)(2) and implemented under the procedures established by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this seciton, pharmaceutical agents in each therapeutic class are selected for inclusion on the uniform formulary based upon the relative clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the agents in such class. If a pharmaceutical agent in a therapeutic class is determined by the Department of Defense Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee not to have a significant, clinically meaningful therapeutic advantage in terms of safety, effectiveness, or clinical outcome over other pharmaceutical agents included on the uniform formulary, the Committee may recommend it be classified as a non-formulary agent. In addition, if the evaluation by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee concludes that a pharmaceutical agent in a therapeutic class is not cost effective relative to other pharmaceutical agents in that therapeutic class, considering costs, safety, effectiveness, and clinical outcomes, the Committee may recommend it be classified as a non-formulary agent. (iii) Pharmaceutical agents which are used exclusively in medical treatments or procedures that are expressly excluded from the TRICARE benefit by statute or regulation will not be considered for inculsion on the uniform formulary. Excluded pharmaceutical agents shall not be available as non-formulary agents, nor will they be cost-shared under the TRICARE pharmacy benefits program. (b) Definitions. For most definitions applicable to the provisions of this section, refer to Sec. 199.2. The following definitions apply only to this section: (1) Clinically necessary. Also referred to as clinical necessity. Sufficient evidence submitted by a beneficiary or provider on behalf of the beneficiary that establishes that one or more of the following conditions exist: The use of formulary pharmaceutical agents is contraindicated; the patient experiences significant adverse effects from formulary pharmaceutical agents in the therapeutic class, or is likely to experience significant adverse effects from formulary pharmaceutical agents in the therapeutic class; formulary pharmaceutical agents result in therapeutic failure, or the formulary pharmaceutical agent is likely to result in therapeutic failure; the patient previously responded to a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent and changing to a formulary pharmaceutical agent would incur an unacceptable clinical risk; or there is no alternative pharmaceutical agent on the formulary. (2) Therapeutic class. A group of pharmaceutical agents that are similar in chemical structure, pharmacological effect, and/or clinical use. (c) Department of Defense Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee--(1) Purpose. The Department of Defense Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee is established by 10 U.S.C. 1074g to assure that the selection of pharmaceutical agents for the uniform formulary is based on broadly representative professional expertise concerning relative clinical and cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents and accomplishes an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program. (2) Composition. As required by 10 U.S.C. 1074g(b), the committee includes representatives of pharmacies of the uniformed services facilities and representatives of providers in facilities of the uniformed services. Committee members will have expertise in treating the medical needs of the populations served through such entities and in the range of pharmaceutical and biological medicines available for treating such populations. (3) Executive Council. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee may have an Executive Council, composed of those voting and non-voting members of the Committee who are military or civilian employees of the Department of Defense. The function of the Executive Council is to review and analyze issues relating to the operation of the uniform formulary, including issues of an inherently governmental nature, procurement sensitive information, and matters affecting military readiness. The Executive Council presents information to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, but is not authorized to act for the Committee. (d) Uniform Formulary Beneficiary Advisory Panel. As required by 10 U.S.C. [[Page 329]] 1074g(c), a Uniform Formulary Beneficiary Advisory Panel reviews and comments on the development of the uniform formulary. The Panel includes members that represent non-governmental organizations and associations that represent the views and interests of a large number of eligible covered beneficiaries, contractors responsible for the TRICARE retail pharmacy program, contractors responsible for the TRICARE mail-order pharmacy program, and TRICARE network providers. The panel will meet after each Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee quarterly meeting. The Panel's comments will be submitted to the Director, TRICARE Management Activity. The Director will consider the comments before implementing the uniform formulary or any recommendations for change made by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The Panel will function in accordance with the Federated Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2). (e) Determinations regarding relative clinical and cost effectiveness for the selection of pharmaceutical agents for the uniform formulary--(1) Clinical effectiveness. (i) It is presumed that pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class are clinically effective and should be included on the uniform formulary unless the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee finds by a majority vote that a pharmaceutical agent does not have a significant, clinically meaningful therapeutic advantage in terms of safety, effectiveness, or clinical outcome over the other pharmaceutical agents included on the uniform formulary in that therapeutic class. This determination is based on the collective professional judgment of the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and consideration of pertinent information from a variety of sources determined by the Committee to be relevant and reliable. The DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee has discretion based on its collective professional judgment in determining what sources should be reviewed or relied upon in evaluating the clinical effectiveness of a pharmaceutical agent in a therapeutic class. (ii) Sources of information may include but are not limited to: (A) Medical and pharmaceutical textbooks and reference books; (B) Clinical literature; (C) U.S. Food and Drug Administration determinations and information; (D) Information from pharmaceutical companies; (E) Clinical practice guidelines, and (F) Expert opinion. (iii) The DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will evaluate the relative clinical effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents within a therapeutic class by considering information about their safety, effectiveness, and clinical outcome. (iv) Information considered by the Committee may include but is not limited to: (A) U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved and other studied indications; (B) Pharmacology; (C) Pharmacokinetics; (D) Contraindications; (E) Warnings/precautions; (F) Incidence and severity of adverse effects; (G) Drug to drug, drug to food, and drug to disease interactions; (H) Availability, dosing, and method of administration; (I) Epidemiology and relevant risk factors for diseases/conditions in which the pharmaceutical agents are used; (J) Concomitant therapies; (K) Results of safety and efficacy studies; (L) Results of effectiveness/clinical outcomes studies, and (M) Results of meta-analyses. (2) Cost effectiveness. (i) In considering the relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class, the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee shall evaluate the costs of the agents in relation to the safety, effectiveness, and clinical outcomes of the other agents in the class. (ii) Information considered by the Committee concerning the relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents may include but is not limited to: (A) Cost of the pharmaceutical agent to the Government; (B) Impact on overall medical resource utilization and costs; (C) Cost-efficacy studies; [[Page 330]] (D) evaluations; (F) Pharmacoeconomic models; (G) Patent expiration dates; (H) Clinical practice guideline recommendations, and (I) Existence of existing or proposed blanket purchase agreements, incentive price agreements, or contracts. (f) Evaluation of pharmaceutical agents for determinations regarding inclusion on the uniform formulary. The DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will periodically evaluate or re-evaluate individual pharmaceutical agents and therapeutic classes of pharmaceutical agents for determinations regarding inclusion or continuation on the uniform formulary. Such evaluation or re-evaluation may be prompted by a variety of circumstances including, but not limited to: (1) Approval of a new pharmaceutical agent by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; (2) Approval of a new indication for an existing pharmaceutical agent; (3) Changes in the clinical use of existing pharmaceutical agents; (4) New information concerning the safety, effectiveness or clinical outcomes of existing pharmaceutical agents; (5) Price changes; (6) Shifts in market share; (7) Scheduled review of a therapeutic class; and (8) Requests from Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee members, military treatment facilities, or other Military Health System officials. (g) Administrative procedures for establishing and maintaining the uniform formulary--(1) Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee determinations. Determinations of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee are by majority vote and recorded in minutes of Committee meetings. The minutes set forth the determinations of the committee regarding the pharmaceutical agents selected for inclusion in the uniform formulary and summarize the reasons for those determinations. For any pharmaceutical agent (including maintenance medications) for which a recommendation is made that the status of the agent be changed from the formulary tier to the non-formulary tier of the uniform formulary, or that the agent requires a pre-authorization, the Committee shall also make a recommendation as to effective date of such change that will not be longer than 180 days from the final decision date but may be less. The minutes will include a record of the number of members voting for and against the Committee's action. (2) Beneficiary Advisory Panel. Comments and recommendations of the Beneficiary Advisory Panel are recorded in minutes of Panel meetings. The minutes set forth the comments and recommendations of the Panel and summarize the reasons for those comments and recommendations. The minutes will include a record of the number of members voting for or against the Panel's comments and recommendations. (3) Uniform formulary final decisions. The Director of the TRICARE Management Activity makes the final DoD decisions regarding the uniform formulary. Those decisions are based on the Director's review of the final determinations of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and the comments and recommendations of the Beneficiary Advisory Panel. No pharmaceutical agent may be designated as non-formulary on the uniform formulary unless it is preceded by such recommendation by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The decisions of the Director of the TRICARE Management Activity are in writing and establish the effective date(s) of the uniform formulary actions. (h) Obtaining pharmacy services under the pharmacy benefits program--(1) Points of service. There are four outpatient pharmacy points of service: (i) Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs); (ii) Retail network pharmacies: Those are non-MTF pharmacies that are a part of the network established for TRICARE retail pharmacy services; (iii) Retail non-network pharmacies: Those are non-MTF pharmacies that are not part of the network established for TRICARE retail pharmacy services, and (iv) the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP). [[Page 331]] (2) Availability of formulary pharmaceutical agents--(i) General. Subject to paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, formulary pharmaceutical agents are available under the Pharmacy Benefits Program from all of the points of service identified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. (ii) Availability of formulary pharmaceutical agents at military treatment facilities. Pharmaceutical agents included on the uniform formulary are available through MTFs, consistent with the scope of health care services offered in such facilities. The Basic Core Formulary (BCF) is a subset of the uniform formulary and is a mandatory component of all MTF pharmacy formularies. The BCF contains the minimum set of pharmaceutical agents that each MTF pharmacy must have on its formulary to support the primary care scope of practice for Primary Care Manager enrollment sites. Additions to individual MTF formularies are determined by local Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees based on the scope of health care services provided at the respective MTFs. All pharmaceutical agents on the local MTF formulary must be available to all categories of beneficiaries. (3) Availability of non-formulary pharmaceutical agents--(i) General. Non-formulary pharmaceutical agents are generally available under the pharmacy benefits program from the retail network pharmacies, retail non-network pharmacies, and the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP) at the non-formulary cost-share. (ii) Availability of non-formulary pharmaceutical agents at military treatment facilities. Although not a beneficiary entitlement, non- formulary pharmaceutical agents may be made available to eligible covered beneficiaries through the MTF pharmacies for prescriptions approved through the non-formulary special order process that validates the medical necessity for use of the non-formulary pharmaceutical agent. (iii) Availability of clinically appropriate non-formulary pharmaceutical agents to members of the Uniformed Services. The pharmacy benefits program is required to assure the availability of clinically appropriate pharmaceutical agents to members of the uniformed services, including, where appropriate, agents not included on the uniform formulary. Clinically appropriate pharmaceutical agents will be made available to members of the Uniformed Services, including, where medical necessity has been validated, agents not included on the uniform formulary. MTFs shall establish procedures to evaluate the clinical necessity of prescriptions written for members of the uniformed services for pharmaceutical agents not included on the uniform formulary. If it is determined that the prescription is clinically necessary, the MTF will provide the pharmaceutical agent to the member. (iv) Availability of clinically appropriate pharmaceutical agents to other eligible beneficiaries at retail pharmacies or the TMOP. Eligible beneficiaries will receive non-formulary pharmaceutical agents at the formulary cost-share when medical necessity has been established by the beneficiary and/or his/her provider. The peer review provisions of Sec. 199.15 shall apply to the clinical necessity pre-authorization determinations. TRICARE may require that the time for review be expedited under the pharmacy benefits program. (i) Cost-sharing requirements under the pharmacy benefits program-- (1) General. Under 10 U.S.C. 1074g(a)(6), cost-sharing requirements are established in this section for the pharmacy benefits program independent of those established under other provisions of this Part. Cost-shares under this section partially defray government costs of administering the pharmacy benefits program when collected by the government for prescriptions dispensed through the retail network pharmacies or the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy. The higher cost-share paid for prescriptions dispensed by a non-network retail pharmacy is established to encourage the use of the most economical venue to the government. Cost-sharing requirements are based on the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, or non-formulary, in conjunction with the point of service from which the agent is acquired. (2) Cost-sharing amounts. Active duty members of the uniformed services do [[Page 332]] not pay cost-shares. For other categories of beneficiaries, cost-sharing amounts are as follows: (i) For pharmaceutical agents obtained from a military treatment facility, there is no co-payment. (ii) For pharmaceutical agents obtained from a retail network pharmacy there is a: (A) $9.00 co-payment per prescription required for up to a 30-day supply of a formularly pharmaceutical agent. (B) $3.00 co-payment per prescription for up to a 30-day supply of a generic pharmaceutical agent. (C) $22.00 co-payment per prescription for up to a 30-day supply of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent. (iii) For formulary and generic pharmaceutical agents obtained from a retail non-network pharmacy there is a 20 percent or $9.00 co-payment (whichever is greater) per prescription for up to a 30-day supply of the pharmaceutical agent. (iv) For non-formulary pharmaceutical agents obtained at a retail non-network pharmacy there is a 20 percent or $22.00 co-payment (whichever is greater) per prescription for up to a 30-day supply of the pharmaceutical agent. (v) For pharmaceutical agents obtained under the TMOP program there is a: (A) $9.00 co-payment per prescription for up to a 90-day supply of a formulary pharmaceutical agent. (B) $3.00 co-payment for up to a 90-day supply of a generic pharmaceutical agent. (C) $22.00 co-payment for up to a 90-day supply of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent. (vi) For TRICARE Prime beneficiaries who obtain prescriptions from retail non-network pharmacies, the enrollment year deductible for outpatient claims is $300 per individual; $600 per family; and a point of service cost-share of 50 percent thereafter applies in lieu of the 20 percent co-payment. (vii) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(viii) of this section, for pharmaceutical agents acquired by TRICARE Standard beneficiaries from retail non-network pharmacies, beneficiaries are subject to the $150.00 per individual or $300.00 maximum per family annual fiscal year deductible. (viii) Under TRICARE Standard, dependents of members of the uniformed services whose pay grade is E-4 or below are subject to the $50.00 per indiviudal or $100.00 maximum per family annual fiscal year deductible. (ix) The TRICARE catastrophic cap limits apply to pharmacy benefits program cost-sharing. (x) The per prescription co-payments established in this paragraph (i)(2) of this section may be adjusted periodically based on experience with the uniform formulary, changes in economic circumstances, and other appropriate factors. Any such adjustment may be made upon the recommendation of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and approved by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs). Any such adjusted amount will maintain compliance with the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 1074g(a)(6). (3) Special cost-sharing rule when there is a clinical necessity for use of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent. (i) When there is a clinical necessity for the use of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent that is not otherwise excluded as a covered benefit, the pharmaceutical agent will be provided at the same co-payment as a formulary pharmaceutical agent can be obtained. (ii) A clinical necessity for use of a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent is established when the beneficiary or their provider submits sufficient information to show that one or more of the following conditions exist: (A) The use of formualry pharmaceutical agents is contraindicated; (B) The patient experiences significant adverse effects from formulary pharmaceutical agents, or the provider shows that the patient is likely to experience significant adverse effects from formulary pharmaceutical agents; (C) Formulary pharmaceutical agents result in therapeutic failure, or the provider shows that the formulary pharmaceutical agent is likely to result in therapeutic failure; (D) The patient previously responded to a non-formulary pharmaceutical agent and changing to a formulary pharmaceutical agent would incur unacceptable clinical risk; or [[Page 333]] (E) There is no alternative pharmaceutical agent on the formulary. (iii) Information to establish clinical necessity for use of a non- formulary pharmaceutical agent should be provided to TRICARE for prescriptions submitted to a retail network pharmacy. (iv) Information to establish clinical necessity for use of a non- formulary pharmaceutical agent should be provided as part of the claims processes for non-formulary pharmaceutical agents obtained through non- network points of service, claims as a result of other health insurance, or any other situations requiring the submission of a manual claim. (v) Information to establish clinical necessity for use of a non- formulary pharmaceutical agent may be provided with the prescription submitted to the TMOP contractor. (vi) Information to establish clinical necessity for use of a non- formulary pharmaceutical agent may also be provided at a later date, but no later than sixty days from the dispensing date, as an appeal to reduce the non-formulary co-payment to the same co-payment as a formulary drug. (vii) The process of establishing clinical necessity will not unnecessarily delay the dispensing of a prescription. In situations where clinical necessity cannot be determined in a timely manner, the non-formulary pharmaceutical agent will be dispensed at the non- formulary co-payment and a refund provided to the beneficiary should clinical necessity be established. (viii) Peer review and appeal and hearing procedures. All levels of peer review, appeals, and grievances established by the Contractor for internal review shall be exhausted prior to forwarding to TRICARE Management Activity for a formal review. Procedures comparable to those established under Sec. Sec. 199.15 and 199.10 of this part shall apply. If it is determined that the prescription is clinically necessary, the pharmaceutical agent will be provided to the beneficiary at the formulary cost-share. TRICARE may require that the time periods for peer review or for appeal and hearing be expedited under the pharmacy benefits program. For purposes of meeting the amount in dispute requirement of Sec. 199.10(a)(7), the relevant amount is the difference between the cost shares of a formulary versus non-formulary drug. The amount for each of multiple prescriptions involving the same drug to treat the same medical condition and filled within a 12-month period may be combined to meet the required amount in dispute. (j) Use of generic drugs under the pharmacy benefits program. (1) The designation of a drug as a generic, for the purpose of applying cost-shares at the generic rate, will be determined through the use of standard pharmaceutical references as part of commercial best business practices. Pharmaceutical agents will be designated as generics when listed with an ``A'' rating in the current Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) published by the Food and Drug Administration, or any successor to such reference. Generics are multisource products that must contain the same active ingredients, are of the same dosage form, route of administration and are identical in strength or concentration. (2) The pharmacy benefits program generally requires mandatory substitution of generic drugs listed with an ``A'' rating in the current Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) published by the FDA and generic equivalents of grandfather or Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) category drugs for brand name drugs. In cases in which there is a clinical justification for a brand name drug in lieu of a generic equivalent, under the standards and procedures of paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the generic substitution policy is waived. (3) When a blanket purchase agreement, incentive price agreement, Government contract, or other circumstances results in a brand pharmaceutical agent being the most cost effective agent for purchase by the Government, the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee may also designate that the drug be cost-shared at the generic rate. (k) Preauthorization of certain pharmaceutical agents. (1) Selected pharmaceutical agents may be subject to prior [[Page 334]] authorization or utilization review requirements to assure medical necessity, clinical appropriateness and/or cost effectiveness. (2) The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will assess the need to prior authorize a given agent by considering the relative clinical and cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents within a therapeutic class. Pharmaceutical agents that require prior authorization will be identified by a majority vote of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee will establish the prior authorization criteria for the pharamaceutical agent. (3) Prescriptions for pharmaceutical agents for which prior authorization criteria are not met will not be cost-shared under the TRICARE pharmacy benefits program. (4) The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, may issue policies, procedures, instructions, guidelines, standards or criteria to implement this paragraph (k). (l) TRICARE Senior Pharmacy Program. Section 711 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-398, 114 Stat. 1654A-175) established the TRICARE Senior Pharmacy Program for Medicare eligible beneficiaries effective April 1, 2001. These beneficiaries are required to meet the eligibility criteria as prescribed in Sec. 199.3 of this part. The benefit under the TRICARE Senior Pharmacy Program applies to prescription drugs and medicines provided on or after April 1, 2001. (m) Effect of other health insurance. The double coverage rules of Sec. 199.8 of this part are applicable to services provided under the pharmacy benefits program. For this purpose, to the extent they provide a prescription drug benefit, Medicare supplemental insurance plans or Medicare HMO plans are double coverage plans and will be the primary payor. Beneficiaries who elect to use this pharmacy benefits shall provide DoD with other health insurance information. (n) Procedures. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity shall establish procedures for the effective operation of the pharmacy benefits program. Such procedures may include restrictions of the quantity of pharmaceuticals to be included under the benefit, encouragement of the use of generic drugs, implementation of quality assurance and utilization management activities, and other appropriate matters. (o) Preemption of State laws. (1) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103, the Department of Defense has determined that in the administration of 10 U.S.C. chapter 55, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including but not limited to the assurance of uniform national health programs for military families and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to the Department of Defense, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States. (2) Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (o)(1) of this section, any State or local law relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is preempted and does not apply in connection with TRICARE pharmacy contracts. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without any force or effect, and State or local governments have no legal authority to enforce them in relation to the TRICARE pharmacy contracts. However, the Department of Defense may by contract establish legal obligations on the part of TRICARE contractors to conform with requirements similar or identical to requirements of State or local laws or regulations. (3) The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (o)(1) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of the statutes identified in paragraph (o)(1) of this section. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments [[Page 335]] on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD pharmacy services contracts, if those taxes, fees or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD pharmacy services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f). (p) General fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest requirements under TRICARE pharmacy benefits program. All fraud, abuse, and conflict of interest requirements for the basic CHAMPUS program, as set forth in this part 199 (see applicable provisions of Sec. 199.9 of this part) are applicable to the TRICARE pharmacy benefits program. Some methods and procedures for implementing and enforcing these requirements may differ from the methods and procedures followed under the basic CHAMPUS program. [69 FR 17048, Apr. 1, 2004] Sec. Retiree Dental Program (TRDP). (a) Purpose. The TRDP is a premium based indemnity dental insurance coverage program that will be available to retired members of the Uniformed Services, their dependents, and certain other beneficiaries, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The TRDP is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1076c. (b) General provisions.(1) At a minimum, benefits are the diagnostic services, preventive services, basic restorative services (including endodontics), oral surgery services, and emergency services specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Additional services comparable to those contained in paragraph (e)(2) of Sec. 199.13 may be covered pursuant to benefit policy decisions made by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee. (2) Premium costs for this coverage will be paid by the enrollee.

Already enrolled members must satisfy any remaining enrollment commitment prior to enrollment of dependents becoming effective under this paragraph, at which time the dependent-only enrollment will continue on a voluntary, month-to-month basis as specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Members must provide documentation to the TRDP contractor giving evidence of compliance with paragraphs (d)(1)(iv)(A), (B), or (C) of this section at the time of application for enrollment of their dependents under this paragraph. [[Page 336]] (A) The member is enrolled under Section 1705 of Title 38, United States Code, to receive ongoing, comprehensive dental care from the Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to Section 1712 of Title 38, United States Code, and 38 CFR 17.93, 17.161, or 17.166. Authorization of such dental care must be confirmed in writing by the Department of Veterans Affairs. (B) The member is enrolled in a dental plan that is available to the member as a result of employment of the member that is separate from the Uniformed Service of the member, and the dental plan is not available to dependents of the member as a result of such separate employment by the member. Enrollment in this dental plan and the exclusion of dependents from enrollment in the plan must be confirmed by documentation from the member's employer or the dental plan's administrator. (C) The member is prevented by a current and enduring medical or dental condition from being able to obtain benefits under the TRDP. The specific medical or dental condition and reason for the inability to use the program's benefits over time, if not apparent based on the condition, must be documented by the member's physician or dentist. (v) The unremarried surviving spouse and eligible child dependents of a deceased member who died while in status described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; the unremarried surviving spouse and eligible child dependents who receive a surviving spouse annuity; or the unremarried surviving spouse and eligible child dependents of a deceased member who died while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days and whose eligible dependents are not eligible or no longer eligible for the Active Duty Dependents Dental Plan. Note to paragraphs (d)(1)(iii), (d)(1)(iv), and (d)(1)(v): Eligible dependents of Medal of Honor recipients are described in Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(i) (except for former spouses) and Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(ii) (except for a child placed in legal custody of a Medal of Honor recipient under Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(ii)(H)(4)). (2) Notification of eligibility. The contractor will notify persons eligible to receive dental benefits under the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program. (3) Election of coverage. In order to initiate dental coverage, election to enroll must be made by the member or eligible dependent.Enrollment in the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program is voluntary and will be accomplished by submission of an application to the TRDP contractor. (4) Enrollment periods--(i) Enrollment period for basic benefits. The initial enrollment for the basic dental benefits described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall be for a period of 24 months followed by month-to-month enrollment as long as the enrollee remains eligible and chooses to continue enrollment. An enrollee's disenrollment from the TRDP at any time for any reason, including termination for failure to pay premiums, is subject to a lockout period of 12 months. After any lockout period, eligible individuals may elect to reenroll and are subject to a new initial enrollment period. The enrollment periods and conditions stipulated in this paragraph apply only to the basic benefit coverage described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Effective with the implementation of an enhanced benefit program, new enrollments for basic coverage will cease. Enrollees in the basic program at that time may continue their enrollment for basic coverage, subject to the applicable provisions of this section, as long as the contract administering that coverage is in effect. (ii) Enrollment period for enhanced benefits. The initial enrollment period for enhanced benefit coverage described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section shall be established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, when such coverage is offered, to be a period of not less than 12 months and not more than 24 months. The initial enrollment period shall be followed by renewal periods of up to 12 months as long as the enrollee chooses to continue enrollment and remains eligible. An enrollee's disenrollment from the TRDP during an enrollment period for any reason, including termination for failure to pay premiums, is subject to a lockout period of 12 months. This lockout provision does not apply to disenrollment during an enrollment grace period as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section or following [[Page 337]] completion of an initial or renewal enrollment period. Eligible individuals who elect to reenroll following a lockout period or a disenrollment after completion of an enrollment period are subject to a new initial enrollment period. (5) Termination of coverage--(i) Involuntary termination. TRDP coverage is terminated when the member's entitlement to retired pay is terminated, the member's status as a member of the Retired Reserve is terminated, a dependent child loses eligible child dependent status, or a surviving spouse remarries. (ii) Voluntary termination. Regardless of the reason, TRDP coverage shall be canceled, or otherwise terminated, upon written request from an enrollee if the request is received by the TRDP contractor within thirty (30) calendar days following the enrollment effective date and there has been no use of TRDP benefits by the enrolled member, enrolled spouse, or enrolled dependents during that period. If such is the case, the enrollment is voided and all premium payments are refunded. However, use of benefits during this 30-day enrollment grace period constitutes acceptance by the enrollee of the enrollment and the enrollment period commitment. In this case, a request for voluntary disenrollment before the end of the initial enrollment period will not be honored, and premiums will not be refunded. (6) Continuation of dependents' enrollment upon death of enrollee. Coverage of a dependent in the TRDP under an enrollment of a member or surviving spouse who dies during the period of enrollment shall continue until the end of that period and may be renewed by (or for) the dependent, so long as the premium paid is sufficient to cover continuation of the dependent's enrollment. Coverage may be terminated when the premiums paid are no longer sufficient to cover continuation of the enrollment. (e) Premium payments. Persons enrolled in the dental plan will be responsible for paying the full cost of the premiums in order to obtain the dental insurance. (1) Premium payment method. The premium payment may be collected pursuant to procedures established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) or designee. (2) Effects of failure to make premium payments. Failure to make monthly renewal premium payments will result in the enrollee's disenrollment from the TRDP and subject to a lock-out period of 12 months. Following this period of time, persons eligible will be able to reenroll if they so choose. (3) Member's payment of premiums. The cost of the TRDP monthly premium will be paid by the enrollee. Interested beneficiaries may contact the dental contractor-insurer to obtain the enrollee premium cost. (f) Plan benefits. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may modify the services covered by the TRDP to the extent determined appropriate based on developments in common dental care practices and standard dental programs. In addition, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may establish such exclusions and limitations as are consistent with those established by dental insurance and prepayment plans to control utilization and quality of care for the services and items covered by the TRDP. (1) Basic benefits. The minimum TRDP benefit is basic dental care to include diagnostic services, preventive services, basic restorative services (including endodontics), oral surgery services, and emergency services.

In general, these include additional diagnostic and preventive services, major restorative services, prosthodontics (removable and fixed), additional oral surgery services, orthodontics, and additional adjunctive general services (including general anesthesia and intravenous sedation). Enrollees in the basis plan will be given an enrollment option at the time the enhanced plan is implemented. (3) Alternative course of treatment policy. The Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee, may establish, in accordance with generally accepted dental benefit practices, an alternative course of treatment policy which provides reimbursement in instances where the dentist and TRDP enrollee select a more expensive service, procedure, or course of treatment than is customarily provided. The alternative course of treatment policy must meet the following conditions: (i) The service, procedure, or course of treatment must be consistent with sound professional standards of generally accepted dental practice for the dental condition concerned. (ii) The service, procedure, or course of treatment must be a generally accepted alternative for a service or procedure covered by the TRDP for the dental condition. (iii) Payment for the alternative service or procedure may not exceed the lower of the prevailing limits for the alternative procedure, the prevailing limits or dental plan contractor's scheduled allowance for the otherwise authorized benefit procedure for which the alternative is substituted, or the actual charge for the alternative procedure. (g) Maximum coverage amounts. Each enrollee is subject to an annual maximum coverage amount for non-orthodontic dental benefits and, if an orthodontic benefit is offered, a lifetime maximum coverage amount for orthodontics as established by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or designee. (h) Annual notification of rates. TRDP premiums will be determined as part of the competitive contracting process. Information on the premium rates will be widely distributed. (i) Authorized providers. The TRDP enrollee may seek covered services from any provider who is fully licensed and approved to provide dental care in the state where the provider is located. (j) Benefit payment. Enrollees are not required to utilize the special network of dental providers established by the TRDP contractor. For enrollees who do use these network providers, however, providers shall not balance bill any amount in excess of the maximum payment allowable by the TRDP. Enrollees using non-network providers may balance billed amounts in excess of allowable charges. The maximum payment allowable by the TRDP (minus the appropriate cost-share) will be the lesser of: (1) Billed charges; or (2) Usual, Customary and Reasonable rates, in which the customary rate is calculated at the 50th percentile of billed charges in that geographic area, as measured in an undiscounted charge profile in 1995 or later for that geographic area (as defined by three-digit zip code). (k) Appeal and hearing procedures. All levels of appeals and grievances established by the Contractor for internal [[Page 340]] review shall be exhausted prior to forwarding to OCHAMPUS for a final review. Procedures comparable to those established under Sec. 199.13(h) of this part shall apply. (l) Preemption of State laws. (1) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103, the Department of Defense has determined that in the administration of chapter 55 of title 10, U.S. Code, preemption of State and local laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal interests, including but not limited to the assurance of uniform national health programs for military families and the operation of such programs at the lowest possible cost to the Department of Defense, that have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs and national security policy of the United States. This determination is applicable to the dental services contracts that implement this section. (2) Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (l)(1) of this section, any State or local law or regulation pertaining to health or dental insurance, prepaid health or dental plans, or other health or dental care delivery, administration, and financing methods is preempted and does not apply in connection with the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program contract. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without any force or effect, and State or local governments have no legal authority to enforce them in relation to the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program contract. (However, the Department of Defense may, by contract, establish legal obligations on the part of the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program contractor to conform with requirements similar to or identical to requirements of State or local laws or regulations). (3) The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph (l)(2) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other plan managers, or similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or financing methods, within the meaning of section 1103. Preemption, however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees or other payments are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For the purposes of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes and fees in connection with DoD health and dental services contracts, interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f). (m) Administration. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) or designee may establish other rules and procedures for the administration of the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program. [62 FR 66993, Dec. 23, 1997, as amended at 65 FR 48913, Aug. 10, 2000; 65 FR FR 15725, Apr. 3, 2002] Sec. 199.23 Special Supplemental Food Program. (a) General provisions.

Sec. 203.1 Authority. Part 203 is issued under the authorityof section 2705 of Title 10, United States Code. In 1994, Congress authorized the Department of Defense (DoD) to develop a program to facilitate public participation by providing technical assistance to local community members of Restoration Advisory Boards (RABs) and Technical Review Committees (TRCs) (section 326 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, Pub.L. 103-337). In 1996, Congress revised this authority (section 324 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Pub.L. 104-112). It is pursuant to this revised authority, which is codified as new subsection (3) of section 2705, that the Department of Defense issues this part. Sec. 203.2 Purpose and availability of referenced material. (a) This part establishes the Technical Assistance for Public Participation (TAPP) program for the Department of Defense. It sets forth policies and procedures for providing technical assistance to community members of TRCs and RABs established at DoD installations in the United States and its territories. This part sets forth the procedures for the Department of Defense to accept and evaluate TAPP applications, to procure the assistance desired by community members of RABs and TRCs, and to manage the TAPP program. These provisions are applicable to all applicants/recipients of technical assistance as discussed in Sec. 203.4 of this part. (b) Any reference to documents made in this part necessary to apply for TAPP (e.g., the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars or DoD forms) are available through the DoD [[Page 347]] installations, the military department headquarters, or from the Department of Defense, Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental Security (DUSD(ES)), 3400 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-3400. Sec. 203.3 Definitions. As used in this part, the following terms shall have the meaning set forth: Affected. Subject to an actual or potential health or environmental threat arising from a release or a threatened release at an installation where the Secretary of Defense is planning or implementing environmental restoration activities including a response action under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act as amended (CERCLA), corrective action under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), or other such actions under applicable Federal or State environmental restoration laws. This would include actions at active, closing, realigning, and formerly used defense installations. Examples of affected parties include individuals living in areas adjacent to installations whose health is or may be endangered by the release of hazardous substances at the facility. Applicant. Any group of individuals that files an application for TAPP, limited by this part to community members of the RAB or TRC. Application. A completed formal written request for TAPP that is submitted to the installation commander or to the identified decision authority designated for the installation. A completed application will include a TAPP project description. Assistance provider.

Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS). A site that has been owned by, leased to, possessed by, or otherwise under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense. The FUDS program does not apply to those sites outside U.S. jurisdiction. Purchase order. An offer by the Government to buy supplies or services from a commercial source, upon specified terms and conditions, the total cost of which cannot exceed the small purchase limit of $100,000. Purchase orders are governed by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) (48 CFR part 13), and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). Restoration Advisory Board (RAB). The RAB is a forum for representatives of the Department of Defense, local community, and EPA and/or State, local, and tribal officials to discuss and exchange information about the installation's environmental restoration program. The RAB provides stakeholders an opportunity make their views known, review progress and participate in dialogue with the decision makers. Statement of Work. That portion of a contract which describes the actual work to be done by means of specifications or minimum requirements, quantities, performance dates, time and place of performance, and quality requirements. It is key to any procurement because it is the basis for the contractor's response and development of proposed costs. TAPP approval. Signifies that the Department of Defense has approved the eligibility of the proposed TAPP project and will, subject to the availability of funds, undertake an acquisition to obtain the services specified in the TAPP application submitted by the RAB or TRC.

Approval does not constitute an agreement to direct an award to a specific source if such an action would be contrary to the FAR. TAPP project description. A discussion of the assistance requested that includes the elements listed in Section 203.10 of this part. The project description should contain sufficient detail to enable the Department of Defense to determine the nature and eligibility of the project, identify potential providers and estimate costs, and prepare a statement of work to begin the procurement process. Technical assistance. Those activities specified in Sec. 203.10 of this part that will contribute to the public's ability to provide input to the decision-making process by improving the public's understanding of overall conditions and activities. Technical assistance may include interpreting technical documents; assessing technologies; participating in relative risk evaluations, understanding health implications; and, training. Technical assistance does not include those activities prohibited under Section 203.11 of this part, such as litigation or underwriting legal actions; political activity; generation of new primary data such as well drilling andtesting, including split sampling; reopening final DoD decisions or conducting disputes with the Department of Defense; or epidemiological or health studies, such as blood or urine testing. Technical Review Committee (TRC). A group comprised of the Department of Defense, EPA, State, and local authorities and a public representative of the community formed to meet the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2705(c), the Department of Defense Environmental [[Page 349]] Restoration Program. Primarily functioning to review installation restoration documents, these committees are being expanded and modified at installations where interest or need necessitates the creation of a RAB. Sec. 203.4 Major components of the TAPP process. (a) The Department of Defense will issue purchase orders to technical assistance, facilitation, training, and other public participation assistance providers subject to the purchase limit per order as resources continue to be available. If multiple purchase orders are needed to assist community members of a particular RAB or TRC, the combined sum of these purchase orders cannot exceed $100,000 or, during any one year, the lesser of $25,000 or 1 percent of the installation's total projected environmental restoration cost-to-complete. Note that these limitations refer to the maximum allowable technical assistance funding per RAB/TRC. Resources available within a given year may vary. These limitations apply unless a waiver is granted by the DoD Component Secretary or equivalent for the installation in question. The $100,000 total and $25,000 annual limitations may be waived, as appropriate, to reflect the complexity of response action, the nature and extent of contamination at the installation, the level of activity at the installation, projected total needs as identified by the TAPP recipient, the size and diversity of the affected population, and the ability of the TAPP recipient to identify and raise funds from other sources. (b) Community members of the RAB/TRC will provide a description of the services requested (TAPP Project Description) and, if desired, the names of one or more proposed technical assistance providers to the DoD RAB Co-Chair, who will ensure the application is submitted to the installation commander or other designated authority and to the appropriate DoD contracting office. Technical assistance providers proposed by the community members of a RAB or TRC at each DoD installation that meets the minimum set of organizational qualifications guidelines provided by the Department of Defense in Sec. 203.12 of this part will be added to the governments list of bidders for the proposed procurement. Sec. 203.5 TAPP process. This section provides an overview of the TAPP process. Specific details referred to in this section can be found in subsequent sections of this part. (a) TAPP funding. Funding for this TAPP program will come from the Environmental Restoration Accounts established for Army, Navy, and Air Force for operational installations. The funding for Defense Agencies' operating installations will be from the Defense-Wide Environmental Restoration Account. Funding will be from the component's base closure account for transferring or closing installations. Funding for Formerly Used Defense Sites will come from the Environmental Restoration Account established for Formerly Used Defense Sites. After justification of the TAPP proposal, each DoD Component will make funds available from their individual installation's environmental restoration or BRAC accounts, considering a number of factors related to the restoration program at the installation and its impact upon the community. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) Closure status. (2) Budget. (3) Installation restoration program status. (4) Presence (or absence) of alternate funding. (5) Relative risk posed by sites at the installation. (6) Type of task to be funded. (7) Community concern. (8) Available funding. (b) Identification of proposed TAPP project. Eligible applicants of RABs and TRCs, established in Sec. 203.7 of this part, should determine whether a TAPP project is required to assist the community members of the RAB or TRC to interpret information regarding the nature and extent of contamination or the proposed remedial actions. Eligibility requirements for TAPP projects are described in Sec. Sec. 203.10 and 203.11 of this part. In keeping with the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2705(e), the RAB or TRC must be able to demonstrate that the technical expertise necessary for [[Page 350]] the proposed TAPP project is not available through the Federal, State, or local agencies responsible for overseeing environmental restoration at the installation, or that the selection of an independent provider will contribute to environmental restoration activities and the community acceptance of such activities. In addition, the Department of Defense encourages the RAB or TRC to seek other available sources of assistance prior to submitting a request for TAPP in order to preserve limited resources. These sources include DoD's installation restoration contractor, or other DoD contractors or personnel, EPA or state regulatory personnel, volunteer services from local universities or other experts, or assistance from state and local health and environmental organizations. (c) TAPP project request. The RAB or TRC should notify the installation of its intent to pursue TAPP upon the determination that other sources of assistance are unavailable or unlikely to contribute to the community acceptance of environmental restoration activities at the installation and should prepare a formal request specifying the type of assistance required and, if desired, one or more sources for this assistance. Details concerning this request are stated in Sec. 203.9 of this part. The RAB or TRC must certify to the Department of Defense that the TAPP request represents a request by a majority of the community members of the RAB or TRC. The RAB or TRC should ensure that the request meets the eligibility requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 203.10 and 203.11 of this part. Furthermore, the RAB or TRC may outline additional criteria for the Department of Defense to consider in the selection of a provider (such as knowledge of local environmental conditions or specific technical issues, a prior work history within the study area which has relevant specific circumstances or unique challenges, or other relevant expertise or capabilities), keeping in mind that providers must meet the minimum technical qualifications outlined in Sec. 203.12 of this part. The formal request should be submitted to the installation commander or designated decision authority, either directly, or through the DoD RAB Co-chair. The installation commander, or other designated decision authority, will review the proposed project to determine whether the proposed project conforms to the eligibility requirements. If the installation commander, or other designated authority, fails to approve the project request, the rationale for that decision will be provided to the RAB/TRC in writing. (d) Purchase orders. Upon receipt of a completed TAPP request, the installation will begin the procurement process necessary to obtain the desired services by means of a purchase order or will forward the request to the contracting authority designated by the DoD Component to act for that installation. The government is required to follow the rules and regulations for purchase orders as outlined in the FAR (48 CFR part 13). As a result, the government cannot direct awards to a specified supplier unless the procurement is under $2,500, and then only if the cost is comparable to other suppliers. For procurements over $2,500 but under $100,000, the acquisition is reserved for small businesses, unless there is a reasonable expectation that small businesses could not provide the best scientific and technological sources consistent with the demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performance, and schedules. Furthermore, the award must be on a competitive basis. In addition to proposing potential providers, the application for technical assistance may indicate specific criteria or qualifications that are deemed necessary by the RAB/TRC for the completion of the project to their satisfaction. This information will be used to assist the Department of Defense in preparing a bidders list. The Department of Defense will solicit bids from those providers meeting the criteria and will select a provider offering the best value to the government. Should the procurement process identify a qualified respondent other than the proposed provider(s) identified by the RAB/TRC or fail to identify any qualified respondents, the RAB/TRC will be consulted prior to the award of a purchase order. If the Department of Defense determines that [[Page 351]] the TAPP request represents an eligible project for which no funds are available, it will ask the RAB or TRC to specify whether the project should be reconsidered upon the availability of additional funds. (e) Reporting requirements. The applicant must assure that copies of delivered reports are made available to the Department of Defense and must comply with the reporting requirements established in Sec. 203.14 of this part. Sec. 203.6 Cost principles. (a) Non-profit contractors must comply with the cost principles in OMB Circular A-122. Copies of the circular may be obtained from EOP Publications, 725 17th NW, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503. (b) For-profit contractors and subcontractors must comply with the cost principles in the FAR (48 CFR part 31). Sec. 203.7 Eligible applicants. Eligible applicants are community members of RABs or TRCs. Furthermore, the RABs or TRCs must be comprised of at least three community members to ensure community interests are broadly represented. The applicant must certify that the request represents the wishes of a simple majority of the community members of the RAB or TRC. Certification includes, but is not limited to, the results of a roll call vote of community members of the RAB or TRC documented in the meeting minutes. Other requirements of the application are detailed in Sec. 203.9 of this part. Sec. 203.8 Evaluation criteria. The Department of Defense will begin the TAPP procurement process only after it has determined that all eligibility and responsibility requirements listed in Sec. Sec. 203.6, 203.7, and 203.9 of this part are met, and after review of the specific provider qualifications as submitted in the narrative section of the application. In addition, the proposed TAPP project must meet the eligibility criteria as specified in Sec. Sec. 203.10 and 203.11 of this part. Projects that fail to meet those requirements relating to the relevance of the proposed project to the restoration activities at the installation will not be approved. Sec. 203.9 Submission of application. The applicant must submit a TAPP application to begin the TAPP procurement process. The application form is included as appendix A of this part and can be obtained from the DoD installation, the DoD Component headquarters, or directly from the Department of Defense, Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental Security, 3400 Defense Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20301-3400. The applications will not be considered complete until the following data elements have been entered into the form: (a) Installation. (b) Source of TAPP request (names of RAB or TRC). (c) Certification of majority request. (d) RAB/TRC contact point for TAPP project. (e) Project title. (f) Project type (e.g. data interpretation, training, etc.). (g) Project purpose and description (descriptions, time and locations of products or services desired). (h) Statement of eligibility of project. (i) Proposed provider, if known. (j) Specific qualifications or criteria for provider. Sec. 203.10 Eligible activities. (a) TAPP procurements should be pursued by the RAB or TRC only to the extent that Federal, State, or local agencies responsible for overseeing environmental restoration at the facility do not have the necessary technical expertise for the proposed project, or the proposed technical assistance will contribute to the efficiency, effectiveness, or timeliness of environmental restoration activities at the installation and is likely to contribute to community acceptance of those activities. (b) TAPP procurements may be used to fund activities that will contribute to the public's ability to provide advice to decision-makers by improving the public's understanding of overall conditions and activities. Categories of eligible activities include the following: (1) Interpret technical documents. The installation restoration program documents each stage of investigation and decision-making with technical reports that summarize data and support [[Page 352]] cleanup decisions. Technical assistance may be provided to review plans and interpret technical reports for community members of RABs and TRCs. These reports include, but are not limited to: (i) Installation restoration program site studies, engineering documents, such as site inspections, remedial investigations, feasibility studies, engineering evaluation and cost analyses, and decision documents (including records of decision); (ii) Risk assessments, including baseline and ecological risk assessments conducted by the installation; and (iii) Health assessments, such as those conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). (2) Assess technologies. Technical assistance may be provided to help RAB/TRC community members understand the function and implications of those technologies selected to investigate or clean up sites at the installation. (3) Participate in relative risk site evaluations. Technical assistance may be provided to help RAB/TRC community members contribute to the relative risk evaluation process for specific sites. (4) Understand health implications. Technical assistance may be provided to help RAB/TRC community members interpret the potential health implications of cleanup levels or remedial technologies, or to explain the health implications of site contaminants and exposure scenarios. (5) Training, where appropriate. Technical trainers on specific restoration issues may be appropriate in circumstances where RAB/TRC members need supplemental information on installation restoration projects. Sec. 203.11 Ineligible activities. The following activities are ineligible for assistance under the TAPP program: (a) Litigation or underwriting legal actions, such as paying for attorney fees or paying for a technical assistance provider to assist an attorney in preparing legal action or preparing for and serving as an expert witness at any legal proceeding regarding or affecting the site. (b) Political activity and lobbying as defined by OMB Circular A- 122. (c) Other activities inconsistent with the cost principles stated in OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' (d) Generation of new primary data, such as well drilling and testing, including split sampling. (e) Reopening final DoD decisions, such as the Records of Decision (see limitations on judicial review of remedial actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) Section 113(h)) or conducting disputes with the Department of Defense). (f) Epidemiological or health studies, such as blood or urine testing. (g) Community outreach efforts, such as renting a facility and conducting public meetings, or producing and distributing newsletters. Sec. 203.12 Technical assistance for public participation provider qualifications. (a) A technical assistance provider must possess the following credentials: (1) Demonstrated knowledge of hazardous or toxic waste issues and/or laws. (2) Academic training in a relevant discipline (e.g., biochemistry, toxicology, environmental sciences, engineering). (3) Ability to translate technical information into terms understandable to lay persons. (b) A technical assistance provider should possess the following credentials: (1) Experience working on hazardous or toxic waste problems. (2) Experience in making technical presentations. (3) Demonstrated writing skills. (4) Previous experience working with affected individuals or community groups or other groups of individuals. (c) The technical assistance provider's qualifications will vary according to the type of assistance to be provided. Community members of the RAB/TRC may suggest additional provider qualifications as part of the application for technical assistance. These additional qualifications may be used by the Department of Defense to [[Page 353]] target the most appropriate providers during the procurement process. Examples of such criteria could include prior work in the area, knowledge of local environmental conditions or laws, specific technical capabilities, or other relevant expertise. Sec. 203.13 Procurement. Procurements will be conducted as purchase orders in accordance with the FAR (48 CFR part 13). Under these procedures, procurements not exceeding $100,000 are reserved exclusively for small businesses, and will be conducted as competitive procurements. Procurements below a value of $2,500 are considered ``micro-purchases.'' These procurements do not require the solicitation of bids and may be conducted at the discretion of the contracting officer. Sec. 203.14 RAB/TRC reporting requirements. The community point of contact of the RAB or TRC must submit a report, to be provided to the installation and to DUSD(ES), to enable the Department of Defense to meet DoD reporting requirements to Congress. This report should include a description of the TAPP project, a summary of services and products obtained, and a statement regarding the overall satisfaction of the community member of the RAB or TRC with the quality of service and/or products received. Sec. 203.15 Method of payment. The SAP set forth in FAR (48 CFR part 13) require purchase orders to be conducted on a firm-fixed-price basis, unless otherwise authorized by agency procedures. The Department of Defense anticipates all TAPP awards to be firm-fixed-price procurements. Sec. 203.16 Record retention and audits. The recipient technical assistance providers shall keep and preserve detailed records in connection with the contract reflecting acquisitions, work progress, reports, expenditures and commitments, and indicate the relationship to established costs and schedules. Sec. 203.17 Technical assistance provider reporting requirements. Each technical assistance provider shall submit progress reports, financial status reports, materials prepared for the RAB/TRC, and a final report to the DoD installation for the TAPP project as specified by the specific purchase order agreement. The final report shall document TAPP project activities over the entire period of support and shall describe the achievements with respect to stated TAPP project purposes and objectives. Sec. 203.18 Conflict of interest and disclosure requirements. The Department of Defense shall require each prospective assistance provider on any contract to provide, with its bid or proposal: (a) Information on its financial and business relationship with the installation, RAB/TRC members, or any/all potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at the site, and with their parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, subcontractors, contractors, and current clients or attorneys and agents. This disclosure requirement encompasses past and anticipated financial and business relationships, including services related to any proposed or pending litigation, with such parties. (b) Certification that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, it has disclosed such information or no such information exists. (c) A statement that it shall disclose immediately any such information discovered after submission of its bid or after award. The contracting officer shall evaluate such information and shall exclude any prospective contractor if the contracting officer determines the prospective contractor has a potential conflict of interest that is both significant and cannot be avoided or otherwise resolved. If, after award, the contracting officer determines that a conflict of interest exists that is both significant and cannot be avoided or resolved, the contract will be terminated for cause. (d) Contractors and subcontractors may not be technical assistance providers to community members of RABs/TRCs at an installation where they are performing cleanup activities [[Page 354]] for the Federal or State government or any other entity. Sec. 203.19 Appeals process. DoD Components will establish an appeals process to settle potential disputes between the Department of Defense and the public regarding certain decisions arising out of the TAPP process. The Department of Defense recognizes that the RAB/TRC may disagree with the findings of the installation commander that a proposed TAPP project is ineligible, either because of the availability of alternate sources of assistance or because the project does not meet the eligibility criteria established in this part. It is in the best interests of the Department of Defense and the community members of RABs and TRCs to anticipate and avoid disputes and to work cooperatively to resolve potential differences of opinion. However, in certain circumstances, the RAB/TRC community members may feel that their needs were not adequately served by the decisions of the Department of Defense. In this instance, the hierarchical structure and chain-of-command within each DoD Component will serve as the avenue for appeal. Appeals will be considered within the chain-of-command, and, in general, will be resolved at the lowest level possible. The highest level of appeal will be at the DoD Component Deputy Assistant Secretary level with authority over the DERP and BRAC environmental programs. Inherently governmental functions, such as the procurement process governed by the FAR, are not subject to appeal.

This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Unified and Specified Commands, and the Defense Agencies (hereafter referred to collectively as ``DoD Components''). None of the provisions in this part should be construed as providing authority for the sale or lease of property, or the rendering of special services. Actions to convey such special benefits must be authorized by separate authority. The user charge policy is applicable except when other statutes or directives specifically direct other practices or procedures. Sec. 204.3 Definitions. Recipient. One who requests or receives the benefits of the service(s) provided. Sec. 204.4 Policy. (a) General. It is DoD policy not to compete with available commercial facilities (see 32 CFR part 169a) in providing special services or in the sale or lease of property to private parties and agencies outside the Federal Government. However, when a service or sale is made that conveys special benefits to recipients, above and beyond those accruing to the public at large, a reasonable charge shall be made to each identifiable recipient, except as otherwise authorized by the Secretary of Defense. A special benefit will be considered to accrue, and a charge shall be imposed when the service rendered: (1) Enables the recipient to obtain more immediate or substantial gain or values (which may or may not be measureable in monetary terms) than those which accrue to the general public; or (2) Is performed at the request of the recipient and is above and beyond the services regularly received by or available without charge to the general public. (b) Costing. (1) A charge shall be imposed to recover the full cost to the Federal Government of rendering a service or the fair market value of such service, whichever is higher. Fair market value shall be determined in accordance with commercial rates in the local geographical area. In the absence of a known market value, charges shall be made based on recovery of full costs to the Federal Government. (2) When federally owned resources or property are leased or sold, a fair market value shall be obtained. Fair market value shall be determined by the application of sound business management principles and, so far as practicable and feasible, in accordance with comparable commercial practices. Charges based on fair market value need not be limited to the recovery of costs; they may produce net revenues to the Government. (c) Exclusions and exceptions. (1) The provisions of this part do not apply when other statutes or directives require different practices or procedures such as for: (i) Morale, welfare, and recreation services to military personnel and civilian employees of the Department of Defense and other services provided in accordance with Sec. 204.9. (ii) Sale or disposal of surplus property under approved programs (See DoD Instruction 7310.1 \\1\\). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Copies may be obtained, at cost, from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (iii) Services furnished the general public relating to, or in furtherance of, the U.S. Armed Forces recruiting program. [[Page 358]] (iv) Services furnished to representatives of the public information media in the interest of public understanding of the U.S. Armed Forces. (v) U.S. Armed Forces participation in public events. Charges for such participation are governed by the provisions of 32 CFR part 238. (vi) Records made available to the public, under the Freedom of Information Act, pursuant to 32 CFR part 286. Charges for such record searches and copies of records are governed by Sec. 286.61. (vii) Services furnished to non-Federal audio-visual media Charges for such services are governed by the provisions of DoD Instruction 5410.15.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\,3,4 See footnote 1 to Sec. 204.4(c)(1)(ii). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (viii) Government-developed computer programs released to non- Federal customers. Charges for software packages are governed by DoD Instruction 7930.2.\\3\\ (ix) Pricing of performance by industrial fund activities which shall be in accordance with DoD Directive 7410.4.\\4\\ (2) Charges may be waived or reduced when: (i) The recipient of the benefits is engaged in nonprofit activity designed for public safety, health, or welfare. (ii) Payment of the full fee by a state, local government, or nonprofit group would not be in the interest of the program. (iii) Furnishing of the service without charge is an appropriate courtesy to a foreign country or international organization, or comparable fees are set on a reciprocal basis with a foreign country. (iv) The incremental cost of collecting the fees would be an unduly large part of the receipts from the activity. [51 FR 16024, Apr. 23, 1986. Redesignated and amended FR 64482, Dec. 10, FR FR 36992, July 8, 1998] Sec. 204.5 Responsibilities. Head of DoD Components, or designees, shall: (a) Identify each service or activity covered by this part. (b) Determine the extent of the special benefit provided. (c) Determine applicable cost and fair market value. (d) Establish appropriate charges and collect from recipients of special services. (e) Grant cost waivers or reductions consistent with guidance in this part. (f) Recommend to the Comptroller of the Department of Defense necessary additions and revisions to Sec. 204.10. [51 FR 16024, Apr. 23, 1986. Redesignated and 56 FR 64482, Dec. 10, 1991] Sec. 204.6 Charges and fees. (a) General. (1) All charges and fees shall be based on total cost to the U.S. Government or fair market value, whichever is higher. Total cost shall be based on actual cost or replacement cost when property is to be replaced and expense data accumulated in accordance with DoD 7220.9-M.\\5\\ Estimates from the best available records may be used if actual cost or expense data is not available. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5--8\\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 204.4(c)(1)(ii). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (2) Cost accounting systems shall not be established solely for the purpose of determining charges, but the results of existing cost accounting systems shall be used. Total cost shall include all direct and indirect costs (see Chapter 71, DoD 7220.9-M). (3) Charges and fees established in advance must be projected to the midpoint of the future period. Projected amounts shall be reviewed annually or whenever significant changes in cost or value occur. (4) Internal management controls (see DoD Directive 5010.38 \\6\\ must be established to ensure that charges and fees are developed and adjusted, using current, accurate, and complete data, to provide reimbursement conforming to statutory requirements. Such controls also must ensure compliance with cash management and debt collection policies (see DoD Directive 7045.13\\7\\). (b) Services--(1) Basic requirements. The maximum charge for a special service shall be governed by its total cost or fair market value, whichever is higher, and not by the value of the service, to the recipient. The cost computation shall include the direct and indirect costs to the Government of [[Page 359]] carrying out the activity. Typically, a service may involve the following: (i) Civilian salaries or wages, including the full cost of benefits, such as leave, retirement, and medical and life insurance. (ii) The full cost of military personnel services, including retirement, other personnel support, leave, and permanent change of station factors. (iii) The cost of materials, supplies, travel expenses, communications, utilities, equipment and property rental, and maintenance of property and equipment. (iv) Depreciation expense and interest of investment (currently at a 10 percent annual rate) (OMB Circular No. A-94) in DoD-owned, fixed assets. (v) Other operational, administrative, and accessorial (DoD Instruction 7510.4 \\8\\ costs incurred by the activity while estabishing standards and regulations and research in support of the service performed, for example. (2) Fees and rates. Fees and rates shall be based on actual costs. The charges for services provided by data processing activities shall be determined by using the costs accumulated pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-121 and Federal Government accounting Pamphlet No. 4 requirements. Fees and rates for recurring services shall be established in advance, when feasible. Recurring services include, but are not limited to, copying, certifying, and researching records, except when those services are excluded or exempted from charges under Sec. 204.4(c) or Sec. 204.9. (3) DoD-wide fees and rates. Section 204.10 provides a schedule of fees and rates for certain services for use throughout the Department of Defense. Recommendations for additions and revisions to the schedule will be made to the Comptroller of the Department of Defense. (c) Lease or sale of property. Charges for lease or sale of property shall be based on a determination of fair market value. (1) In cases involving the lease or rental of military equipment, when there is no commercial counterpart, fair market value will be based on the computation of an annual rent which will be the sum of the annual depreciation plus interest on investment. The amount of interest on investment is determined by applying the interest rate to the net book value; that is, acquisition cost plus additions less depreciation. The current interest rate in OMB Circular No. A-94 shall be used. Support, if furnished, and applicable general administration expenses will be extra. In determining the value, consideration may be given to the responsibility of the lessee to assume the risk of loss or damage to the property and to hold the Government harmless against claims or liabilities by the lessee or third parties. (2) In cases involving the sale of property when there is no known fair market value, costs shall be based on the total of the standard price of the item carried in inventory, or the reduced price when so authorized for sale within the Department of Defense and the accessorial and administrative costs computed under DoD Instruction 7510.4. [51 FR 16024, Apr. 23, 1986. Redesignated and FR 64482, Dec. 10, FR FR 36992, July 8, 1998] Sec. 204.7 Collections. (a) Collections of charges and fees shall be made in advance of rendering the service, except when preservation of life or property is involved, performance is authorized by law without advance payment, or advance payment is impractical because multiple requests for services are received on a continuing basis from a reliable requester (i.e., consistently prompt payments for services received). When an advance collection exception is approved, an accounts receivable will be established to control collections. The policies in DoD 7220.9-M, DoD Directive 5010.38, and DoD Directive 7045.13 shall be used in accounting, controlling, and managing cash and debt collections. (1) Collections of fees and charges normally will be deposited to Miscellanous Receipts of the Treasury unless otherwise authorized by law or regulation. (2) Collections for utilities and services in connection with the lease of property will be deposited to the appropriation or fund responsible for financing the operations of the equipment or facility. [[Page 360]] Sec. 204.8 Legislative proposals. In cases where collections of fees and charges for services or property are limited or restricted by provisions of existing law, the DoD Component(s) concerned will submit appropriate remedial legislative proposals under applicable legislative procedures.

Source: 56 FR 64194, Dec. 9, 1991, unless otherwise noted. Sec. 205.1 Purpose. This part: (a) Supersedes the Deputy Secretary of Defense Memorandum, ``End Use Certificates,'' April 9, 1991. (b) Establishes policies, assigns responsibilities, and prescribes procedures for signing EUCs on foreign defense items. Sec. 205.2 Applicability. This part applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the Military Departments; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff; the Unified and Specified Commands; the Office of the Inspector General, Department of Defense; the Defense Agencies; and the DoD Field Activities (hereafter referred to collectively as ``DoD Components''). [[Page 364]] Sec. 205.3 Definitions. (a) End Use Certificate (EUC). For the purposes of this part, a written agreement in connection with the transfer of military equipment or technical data to the United States that restricts the use or transfer of that item by the United States. (b) Use for defense purposes. Includes direct use by or for the U.S. Government in any part of the world and transfer by means of grant aid, International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and other security assistance and armaments cooperation authorities. Sec. 205.4 Background and policy. This part is intended to authorize the execution of EUCs when such a certificate is necessary to facilitate purchases of foreign products when the purchase of such products is in the best interest of the United States. (a) The Military Departments and other DoD Components purchase products produced by allies and friendly countries and participate in cooperative development programs to promote interoperability, standardization, and an expanded procurement base, and to obtain products that best meet U.S. needs at the lowest cost. (b) U.S. worldwide security responsibilities are extensive and recognition of these special circumstances has resulted in long-time acceptance in international agreements, by allies and friends, of the need for flexibility in the authorized uses or transfer of purchased or co-developed articles and data. In various circumstances, international agreements have recognized that permissible use of an item or data for U.S. ``defense purposes'' as defined in Sec. 205.3(b). (c) Consistent with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, DoD Components may sign EUCs, in accordance with the policy and procedures outlined below. While most EUCs requested by foreign governments use general language, their effects may be divided into three categories, as described in the following paragraphs. Authority to approve their execution is limited as follows: (1) Category I. Secretaries of the Military Departments and Directors of Defense Agencies may authorize EUCs: (i) For acquisition of items classified for security purposes by a foreign government. (ii) For the acquisition of items covered by the nonproliferation agreements to which the United States is a party, such as missile technology, or (iii) That permit the item to be ``used for defense purposes'' as defined in Sec. 205.3(b), by the United States. (2) Category II. EUCs that are not Category I or III are Category II. Secretaries of the Military Departments and Directors of Defense Agencies may authorize Category II EUCs only after a determination is made through the coordination procedures set forth in Sec. 205.6(a)(1) that, notwithstanding the use or transfer limitations, the purchase is in the U.S. national interest. The least restrictive provisions possible should be negotiated. (3) Category III. Secretaries of Military Departments and Directors of Defense Agencies may not authorize the signature of EUCs which limit the right: (i) For use by or for the U.S. Government in any part of the world, or (ii) To provide the item to allies engaged together with the United States in armed conflict with a common enemy. Waivers to this prohibition may be granted by the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition) (USD(A)). Procedures for requesting such waivers are at Sec. 205.6(a)(1). Sec. 205.5 Responsibilities. (a) The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition) shall: (1) Monitor compliance with this part. (2) Develop procedures to ensure timely review of Category II and III items with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P)). (3) Upon obtaining the concurrence of the USD(P), waive the restrictions in Sec. 205.4(c)(3) when purchase of the item is in the national interest. (4) When requested, and in coordination with the USD(P), assist the Military Departments and Defense Agencies in negotiating the elimination or [[Page 365]] amelioration of an EUC's restrictive language. (b) The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy shall: (1) Consult with the USD(A) on waivers authorized by this part and, if appropriate, coordinate with the Department of State. (2) When requested, and in coordination with the USD(A), assist the Military Departments and Defense Agencies in negotiating the elimination or amelioration of the EUC's restrictive language. (3) Develop procedures for coordination and review of EUC's internally and with the Department of State. (4) Establish, with the concurrence of the USD(A), specific acceptable end use restrictions in addition to those set forth in Category I, which shall be added immediately to Category I and a corresponding administrative change made to Sec. 205.4(c)(1). (c) The Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Directors of the Defense Agencies shall: (1) Authorize the execution of Category I and II EUCs in accordance with the procedures outlined in Sec. 205.6. This responsibility may not be delegated by the Directors of Defense Agencies; it may be delegated by Secretaries of the Military Departments to civilian officers of their respective departments appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Once EUC execution is authorized, the Director of a Defense Agency, or Military Department civilian official who has been delegated authorization authority may delegate the authority to sign individual EUCs. (2) Establish procedures to ensure compliance with this part. These procedures should ensure compliance, for the life of the purchased item, with the transfer or use restrictions agreed to in signing an EUC. They should also ensure 21-calendar day notification to USD(A) before authorizing the execution of a Category II EUC. Sec. 205.6 Procedures. (a) Procedures for the three categories of EUCs established in Sec. 205.4(c) are: (1) Category I. Secretaries of the Military Departments and Directors of Defense Agencies may authorize Category I EUCs. (2) Category II. Not less than 21 calendar days before authorizing the execution of a Category II EUC, Military Departments and Defense Agencies shall provide notification to the USD(A). The notification will contain a description of the item and the limitations to be imposed by the exporting government. The USD(A) shall coordinate with the USD(P), providing at least 14 days for review. If appropriate, the USD(P) shall coordinate with the Department of State. The USD(A) shall notify the submitting DoD Component of any further action required before final authorization of the EUC; otherwise, concurrence may be assumed after expiration of the 21-day period. (3) Category III. To acquire an item requiring a Category III EUC, the Secretary of a Military Department or Director of a Defense Agency must request a waiver from the USD(A). Requests for waivers should specify: (i) Why it is in the interest of the U.S. Government to procure the item. (ii) The limitations to be imposed by the exporting government and a justification for acceptance of those limitations by the U.S. Government. (iii) A statement that no satisfactory alternative to the item, considering cost, schedule, or operational requirements, is available from domestic or foreign sources without equivalent limitations.

[[Page 366]] 206.2 Eligibility. 206.3 Overall program emphasis. 206.4 Proposal development and review. 206.5 Final proposal process. Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1141(a). Source: 59 FR 26116, May 19, 1994, unless otherwise noted. Sec. 206.1 Major characteristics of the NSEP institutional grants program. (a) The Institutional Grants Program provides support in the form of grants to U.S. institutions of higher education. During the 1994-95 and 1995-96 academic years, a program of pilot grants is being initiated with an annual competition for grants held during the spring of each year. Grants to institutions will complement NSEP scholarship and fellowship programs. NSEP encourages the development of programs and curricula which: (1) Improves the quality and infrastructure of international education; (2) Addresses issues of national capacity; and (3) Defines innovative approaches to issues not addressed by NSEP scholarship and fellowship programs. (b) The NSEP Grants Program is designed to address a number of important objectives critical to the United States: (1) To equip Americans with an understanding of less commonly taught languages and cultures and enable them to become integrally involved in global issues. (2) To build a critical base of future leaders in the marketplace and in government service who have cultivated international relationships and worked and studied along-side foreign experts. (3) To develop a cadre of professionals with more than the traditional knowledge of language and culture who can use this ability to help the U.S. make sound decisions and deal effectively with global issues; and (4) To enhance institutional capacity and increase the number of faculty who can educate U.S. citizens toward achieving these goals. (c) Grants will be awarded for initial 1- or 2-year periods. Potential follow-on commitments will be based on a rigorous evaluation and assessment process. Between 15 and 25 awards are expected to be made in the first year ranging from approximately $25,000 to $250,000. These are only estimates and do not bind the NSEP to a specific number of grants or to the amount of the grant. (d) The following key characteristics will be emphasized in the NSEP Institutional Grants Program: (1) Programmatic in emphasis. The purpose of the grants is to address weaknesses and gaps in programs and curricula. The grants should be used to strengthen the national capacity in international education. While ``operational'' support for already existing centers and projects may be a component of a grant, NSEP emphasizes commitment of its limited resources to projects that establish and improve educational programs available to students and teachers. (2) Demand and requirements oriented. Grants are designed to address national needs. These needs must be clearly articulated and defended in a grant proposal. It must be clear that the following questions are addressed: (i) Who will benefit from the program funded by the grant? (ii) What need does the program address? (iii) How will this program augment the capacity of the Federal Government or of the field of education in areas consistent with the objectives of the NSEP? How does it fit the national requirement? (3) Cooperation and collaboration among institutions is mandated in order to ensure that a wider cross-section of colleges and universities benefit from a program funded under NSEP. NSEP is committed to providing opportunities to the widest cross-section of the higher education population as is feasible. Cooperation can be in the form of formal consortia arrangements or less formal but equally effective agreements among institutions. Both vertical (among different types of institutions) and horizontal (among similar institutions across functional areas) integration are encouraged. Outreach to institutions that do not normally benefit from such programs is also strongly favored. (4) Complementary to other Federal programs such as Title VI of the Higher Education Act. NSEP is designed to [[Page 367]] address gaps and shortfalls in Higher Education and to build and expand national capacity. NSEP recognizes that base capacity currently exists in some foreign languages and area studies. It also recognizes that funding shortfalls and other factors have contributed to tremendous gaps and weaknesses. Funding for expansion of the international education infrastructure remains limited. Duplication of effort is not affordable. NSEP encourages new initiatives as well as expansion of existing programs to increase supply in cases where the demand cannot be met and encourages efforts that increase demand. (5) NSEP encourages proposals that address two categories of issues relating to the mission of NSEP: (i) Programs in specific foreign languages, countries or areas; and/ or (ii) Programs addressing professional, disciplinary and/or interdisciplinary opportunities involving international education. (6) NSEP views student funding as portable and hopes that universities will develop ways to move students to programs and to provide credit with these programs. NSEP believes that programs need to be developed that are available to a wider cross-section of students. Thus, they need to be ``open'' to students from other institutions. Programs might also be ``transportable'' from one institution to another. (7) NSEP emphasizes leveraging of funds and cost-sharing in order to maximize the impact of NSEP funding. It encourages institutions to seek other sources of funding to leverage against NSEP funding and to commit institutional resources in support of the program as well. NSEP also emphasizes burden sharing between the institution and the Program. NSEP encourages institutions to demonstrate a commitment to international education and to present a plan for how funding for the proposed program will be achieved over a 3-5 year period so that NSEP can reduce its financial commitment to programs. The funds requested from NSEP should minimize costs allocated to unassigned institutional ``overhead.'' NSEP institutional grants are assumed to be for training programs. Consequently, university/college indirect costs associated with training programs should be used as a general benchmark for determining appropriate overhead rates. (8) NSEP encourages creativity and is responsive to the needs of higher education to expand the capacity to provide more opportunities for quality international education. We do not suggest that the guidelines presented in the grant solicitation will cover all problems and issues. Quite to the contrary, we encourage careful consideration of issues confronting international education in the U.S. and thoughtful proposals that address these issues, consistent with the overall mission of the NSEP. Sec. 206.2 Eligibility. Any accredited U.S. institution of higher education, as defined by section 1201(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1141(a)), may apply for and receive a grant. This includes 2- and 4-year colleges and universities, both public and private. Other organizations, associations, and agencies may be included in proposals but may not be direct recipients of a grant. Foreign institutions may also be included in a proposal but may not be direct recipients of a grant. Only U.S. citizens and U.S. institutions may receive funds through a grant awarded by the NSEP. Sec. 206.3 Overall program emphasis. (a) The NSEP grants to institutions program focuses on two broad program areas that reflect the challenges to building the infrastructure for international education in U.S. higher education: (1) Development and expansion to quality programs in overseas locations. (i) Programs that offer important opportunities for U.S. students, both undergraduate and graduate, to study in critical areas under- represented by U.S. students, and (ii) Development of meaningful competencies in foreign languages and cultures. (2) Development and implementation of programs and curricula on U.S. campuses that provide more opportunities for study of foreign languages and cultures and the integration of these studies into overall programs of study. [[Page 368]] (b) Addressing the need for improving study abroad infrastructure. The NSEP encourages the study of foreign cultures and languages typically neglected or under-represented in higher education. In the foreign language field these are generally referred to as less commonly taught languages. In area studies, these are generally defined as non- Western European in focus. An integral part of any student's international education is a quality study abroad experience that includes a significant portion devoted to gaining functional competence in an indigenous language and culture. Unfortunately, there are only limited opportunities to study abroad in many foreign areas. In addition, many programs lack a quality foreign language component as well as significantly experiential components. Historically, more attention has been paid to the development of programs in Western Europe where the student demand has been greater. NSEP hopes to encourage, through institutional grants, the development and/or expansion of infrastructure for study abroad in critical areas of the world where capacity does not currently exist. Programs are encouraged that: (1) Expand program opportunities in critical countries where limited opportunities currently exist. (2) Establish program opportunities in critical countries where no opportunities exist. (3) Enhance meaningful opportunities for foreign language and foreign culture acquisition in conjunction with study abroad. (4) Create and expand study abroad opportunities for students from diverse disciplines. In all cases, grants to develop study abroad infrastructure must address issues of demand (how to increase demand for study in the proposed countries or regions) and diversity (how to attract a diverse student population to study in the proposed countries or regions). Grants may support start-up of programs or the expansion of a program's capacity to benefit more and/or different student or to improve the quality of study abroad instruction. Proposals can address issues concerning either or both issues of undergraduate and graduate education. (c) Addressing the infrastructure for international education in U.S. higher education. While studying abroad is an integral part of becoming more proficient in one's understanding of another culture and in becoming more functionally competent in another language, the NSEP also emphasizes the development and expansion of programs that address serious shortfalls that provide a stronger domestic program base in areas consistent with the NSEP mission. The NSEP encourages grant proposals that address infrastructure issues. While not limited to these areas, programs might address the following issues: (1) Enhancing foreign language skill acquisition through innovative curriculum development efforts. Such efforts may involve intensive language study designed for different types of students. Less traditional approaches should be considered as well as ways to provide foreign language instruction for the student who may not otherwise have an opportunity to pursue such instruction. Functional competency should be stressed but defined as meaningful for the particular discipline or field. (2) Expanding opportunities for international education in diverse disciplines and fields and in issues that are cross-area or cross- national in character. Efforts are encouraged that offer opportunities for meaningful international education for those in fields where opportunities are not generally available. There are many fields and disciplines that are rapidly becoming international in scope, yet the educational process does not include a meaningful international component. In many cases this is due to a rigid structure in the field itself that cannot accommodate additional requirements, such as language and culture study. There are also issues that involve cross-area or cross-national education or are studied in comparative terms. Students in these areas also need quality opportunities in international education. (3) Provide opportunities for programmatic studies throughout an undergraduate or graduate career. Students frequently study a foreign language or pursue study abroad opportunities as adjuncts to their overall program of study. Innovations in curriculum are [[Page 369]] needed to more thoroughly integrate aspects of international education into curriculum throughout a student's undergraduate or graduate career. The NSEP encourages institutions to address these overall international education curriculum issues in their proposals. (4) Provide opportunities to increase demand for study of foreign areas and languages. Efforts to develop educational programs that offer innovative approaches to increasing demand to include a meaningful international component are encouraged. Proposals are encouraged to address issues of diversity: how to attract students who have historically not pursued opportunities involving international education. Diversity includes geographical, racial, ethnic, and gender factors. (5) Improve faculty credentials in international education. Efforts to create more opportunities for teachers to become competent in foreign cultures and languages are encouraged. While NSEP is a higher education program, it is interested in the potential dynamics of collaborative efforts that recognize the shared responsibility of all educational levels for promoting international education. (6) Uses of new technologies. During the last decade tremendous advances have been made in the application of new educational technologies. Such technologies have enhanced our capacity to improve instruction, broaden access, and assess student learning. NSEP's objective is not to support large technology oriented projects. However, NSEP encourages efforts that integrate innovative uses of technology emphasizing how proposed programs will have significance beyond a local setting. Proposals that include proposed uses of technology will be required to demonstrate detailed knowledge of the technology, how it is to be developed and applied and how student learning will be impacted. Sec. 206.4 Proposal development and review. The purpose of this section is to explain the NSEP review process. [Note: A number of important approaches to proposal development and review have been adapted from guidelines developed by the Department of Education's Office of Postsecondary Education for its ``Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE)''.] This information if intended to aid institutions in the development of proposals and to provide guidance concerning the criteria that may be used in reviewing and evaluating proposals. (a) The grants to institutions program will be administered by the National Security Education Program Office (NSEPO). However, the NSEPO will function as an administrative office much in the same manner as the Institute of International Education and the Academy for Educational Development function in administering NSEP scholarship and fellowship programs, respectively. The NSEPO will not review or evaluate proposals. The proposals will be reviewed and evaluated by national screening panels. (b) The NSEP will use a two-stage review process in order to evaluate a broad range of proposal ideas. In the first stage, applicants will submit a five-page summary (double-spaced) of their proposal. An institution may submit more than one proposal, but each proposal should be submitted and will be evaluated separately and independently. (c) NSEP expects competition for grants to be intense. By implementing a two-stage process, potential grantees are given an opportunity to present their ideas without creating a paperwork burden on both the proposal authors and the reviewers. (d) The preliminary review process. The review of preliminary proposals will be undertaken by panels of external reviewers, not members of the NSEPO. Panels of not less than three will be assembled to review preliminary proposals. Panel members will be drawn primarily from faculty and administration in higher education but might also include representatives from the research, business, and government communities. Every effort will be made to ensure balance (geographical, ethnic, gender, institutional type, subject matter) across the entire competition. (e) Panel members will reflect the nature of the grants program. Each panel will include a recognized expert in a field of international education. [[Page 370]] Other panelists may include experts in area studies, foreign language education, and other fields and disciplines with an international focus. (f) Preliminary proposals will be reviewed according to a set of criteria developed in consultation with representatives from higher education, and provided to the panels. The applicant shall, at a minimum, deal with the following issues in the preliminary proposal: (1) How the proposal addresses issues of national capacity in international education. (2) What area(s), language(s), and discipline(s) the proposal addresses and the importance of these to U.S. national capacity. (3) What the applicant is proposing to do. (4) How the proposal deals with the key characteristics of the NSEP. (5) Demonstration of thorough knowledge of the state of the art in the particular area of the proposal and how this proposal develops or builds capacity, not duplicates existing capacity. (g) The applicant must also include a budget estimate. This budget estimate, for the first year of the proposal, must include the following: (1) A summary of anticipated direct costs including professional salaries, funds for students, travel, materials and supplies, consultants, etc., and how or why these costs are needed. (2) An estimate of institutional indirect costs. The budget estimate must also indicate whether funding is also being requested for a second year and, if so, an estimate of the amount to be requested. (h) Panelists will review and rank proposals and forward their recommendations to the NSEPO. NSEPO will review and analyze these recommendations and inform all applicants of decisions. Sec. 206.5 Final proposal process. NSEPO will provide detailed comments on proposals to all applicants who are invited to prepare a final proposal. (a) Final proposals should be limited to no more than 25 double- spaced pages. Proposals will be reviewed by national panels constructed similarly to those designed to review preliminary proposals. In addition to a field review process, panelists will be assembled in Washington D.C. to discuss and review the independent and competing merits of proposals. (b) Proposals will be evaluated in two basic categories: (1) Proposals that address study abroad infrastructure and (2) Proposals that address domestic infrastructure. Should proposals deal with both of these issues, they will be evaluated in a third category. This grouping of proposals will ensure that all categories of proposals receive funding consideration. (c) In general, final proposals will be considered on the following selection criteria: (1) Importance of the problem. Each proposal will be evaluated according to the merit of how it addresses issue(s) of national capacity. The proposal must articulate the importance of the problem it addresses, how the proposal addresses issues of national capacity in international education, and how it is consistent with the objectives of the NSEP. (2) Importance of proposed foreign language(s), foreign area(s), field(s) or discipline(s). The proposal will be evaluated according to how well it articulates the need for programs in the proposed areas, languages, fields, or disciplines. (3) Identification of need and gaps/shortfalls. The proposal will be evaluated according to its persuasiveness in identifying where the needs exist and where serious shortfalls exist in the capacity to fill the need. The proposal should clearly identify why these gaps exist and provide a strong indication of familiarity with the state of the field in the proposal area. (4) Cost effectiveness. Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of ``educational value for the dollar.'' NSEP is interested in funding proposals in areas where other funding is limited or in areas where NSEP funding can significantly augment or complement other sources. NSEP is not interested in replacing funds available from other sources or in duplicating other efforts. Also, NSEP is interested in projects whose dollar levels and long-range [[Page 371]] budget plans provide for realistic continuation by the grantee institution and adaptation by other institutions. NSEP is interested in proposed approaches to leveraging other funds against the proposed project. (5) Evaluation plans. Proposals will be evaluated on their approach to measuring impact. What impact will the proposed program have on national capacity? How will the proposed program deal with assessing language and foreign cultural competency? In the case of study abroad programs, how will the success and impact of study abroad experiences be assessed. Proposals should not defer the consideration of these issues to a latter stage of the effort. Evaluation and assessment should be an integral part of the entire proposal effort. (6) Prospects for wider impact. Proposals must address national needs and will be evaluated according to how well they are likely to address these needs. What component of the higher education community does the proposal address? How diverse a student population will the proposed program address? What applications to other institutions will be made available, either directly or indirectly, because of the proposed program? (7) Capacity and commitment of the applicant. The proposal will be evaluated according to the evidence provided on the commitment of the institution, and other institutions, to the proposed project. What other institutions are involved and what is their commitment. If there are commitments from foreign institutions, what is the evidence of this commitment? Are their plans for the institution to integrate the efforts of the proposed program into the educational process? What plans are there for eventual self-support? As with many other similar programs, NSEP is particularly interested in the degree to which the institution is willing to bear a reasonable share of the direct and indirect costs of the proposed project. (d) Applicants should also indicate if they currently receive or are seeking support from other sources. Applicants should indicate why support from NSEP is appropriate, if other sources are also being sought. PART 207_IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION 740 OF THE WENDELL H.

Effective Date Note: At 68 FR 27905, May 22, 2003, part 207 was added, effective May 22, 2003, until Sept. 30, 2006. Sec. 207.1 Background and purpose. Section 740 of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, as amended, allows the Department of Defense (DoD), during the period 4 April 2000 through 30 September 2006, to sell aircraft and aircraft parts to a person or entity that provides oil spill response services (including the application of oil dispersants by air). This part implements that section. Sec. 207.2 Applicability. The sections in this part apply to the sale of aircraft and aircraft parts determined to be DoD excess under the definition of the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) or the Federal Management Regulation (FMR), and listed in Attachment 1 of Chapter 4 of DoD 4160.21-M (August 1997) \\1\\ as Category A aircraft authorized for commercial use, to contractors providing oil spill response services. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Copies may be obtained via Internet at http://www.dla.mil/dlaps/ dod/41602lm/guide.asp. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- [[Page 372]] Sec. 207.3 Restrictions. (a) Aircraft and aircraft parts sold under the Act shall be used primarily for oil spill spotting, observation, and dispersant delivery, and may not have a secondary purpose that interferes with oil spill response efforts under an oil spill response plan. Use for a secondary purpose requires the prior written approval of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation, and a certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration, to be obtained in advance, for the proposed secondary use. (b) Aircraft may not be flown outside of or removed from the U.S. except for the purpose of fulfilling an international agreement to assist in oil spill dispersing efforts, for immediate response efforts for an oil spill outside United States waters that has the potential to threaten United States waters, or for purposes that are jointly approved by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation. (c) The DoD sale of aircraft and aircraft parts sold under the Act shall not extend past the time limits of the Act. Sec. 207.4 Qualifications. The Secretary of Transportation must certify in writing to the Secretary of Defense prior to sale that the person or entity is capable of meeting the terms and conditions of a contract to perform oil spill response services by air, and that the overall system to be employed by the person or entity for the delivery and application of oil spill dispersants has been sufficiently tested to ensure that the person or entity is capable of participating in an oil spill response plan that has been approved by the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating. (a) Prior to sales offerings of aircraft or aircraft parts, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT) must provide to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS), in writing, a list or persons or entities eligible to bid under this Act, including expiration date of each DOT contract, and locations covered by the DOT contract. (b) This requirement may not be delegated to the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG). Sec. 207.5 Sale procedures. Sale of aircraft and aircraft parts must be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 of DoD 4160.21-M (August 1997), paragraph B 2, and with other pertinent parts of this manual, with the following changes and additions: (a) Sales shall be limited to the aircraft types listed in Attachment 1 of Chapter 4 of DoD 4160.21-M (August 1997), and parts thereto. (b) Sales shall be made at fair market value (FMV), as determined by the Secretary of Defense and, to the extent practicable, on a competitive basis. (1) DRMS must conduct sales utilizing FMVs that are either provided by the Military Services on the Disposal Turn-In Documents (DTIDs) or based on DRMS's professional expertise and knowledge of the market. Advice regarding FMV shall be provided to DRMS by DOT, as appropriate. (2) If the high bid for a sale item does not equal or exceed the FMV, DRMS is vested with the discretion to reject all bids and reoffer the item: (i) As excess property on another oil spill sale, if there is indication that reoffer may be successful; or, (ii) As surplus property if, after reporting the aircraft to the General Services Administration (GSA) for utilization and donation screening, there are no Federal or State Agency requirements as determined by GSA. (3) Disposition of proceeds from sale of aircraft under the Act, net of DRMS's expenses, will be to the general fund of the United States Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. (c) Purchasers shall certify that aircraft and aircraft parts will be used only in accordance with conditions stated in Sec. 207.3. (1) Sales solicitations will require bidders to submit end-use certificates with their bids, stating the intended use and proposed areas of operation. (2) The completed end-use certificates shall be used in the bid evaluation process. (d) Sales contracts shall include terms and conditions for verifying and enforcing the use of the aircraft and aircraft parts in accordance with provisions of the guidance. [[Page 373]] (1) The DRMS Sales Contracting Officer (SCO) is responsible for verifying and enforcing the use of aircraft and aircraft parts in accordance with the terms and conditions of the sales contract. (i) Sales contracts include provisions for on-site visits to the purchaser's place(s) of business and/or worksite(s). (ii) Sales contracts require the purchaser to make available to the SCO, upon his or her request, all records concerning the use of aircraft and aircraft parts. (2) DOT shall nominate in writing, and the SCO shall appoint, qualified Government employees (not contract employees) to serve as Contracting Officer's Representatives (CORs) for the purpose of conducting on-site verification and enforcement of the use of aircraft and aircraft parts for those purposes permitted by the sales contract. (i) COR appointments must be in writing and must state the COR's duties, the limitations of the appointment, and the reporting requirements. (ii) DOT bears all COR costs. (iii) The SCO may reject any COR nominee for cause, or terminate any COR appointment for cause. (3) Sales contracts require purchasers to comply with the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) requirements in Chapter 4 of DoD 4160.21-M (August 1997), paragraphs B 2 b (4) (d) 2 through B 2 b (4) (d) 5. (4) Sales contracts require purchasers to comply with the Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts regime in Chapter 4 of DoD 4160.21-M (August 1997), paragraph B 26 c and d, and in Attachment 3 to Chapter 4 of DoD 4160.21-M (August 1997). (5) Sales contracts require purchasers to obtain the prior written consent of the SCO for resale of aircraft or aircraft parts purchased from DRMS under this Act. Resales are only permitted to other entities that, at time of resale, meet the qualifications required of initial purchasers. The SCO must seek, and DOT must provide, written assurance as to the acceptability of a prospective repurchaser before approving resale. Resales will normally be approved for oil spill response contractors that have completed their contracts, or that have had their contracts terminated, or that can provide other valid reasons for seeking resale that are acceptable to the SCO. (i) If it is determined by the SCO that there is no interest in the aircraft or aircraft parts being offered for resale among entities deemed qualified repurchasers by DOT, the SCO may permit resale to entities outside the oil spill response industry. (ii) When an aircraft or aircraft parts are determined to be uneconomically repairable and suitable only for cannibalization and/or scrapping, the purchaser shall advise the SCO in writing and provide evidence in the form of a technical inspection document from a qualified FAA airframe and powerplant mechanic, or equivalent. (iii) The policy outlined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section also applies to resales by repurchasers, and to all other manner of proposed title transfer (including, but not limited to, exchanges and barters). (iv) Sales of aircraft and aircraft parts under the Act are intended for principals only. Sales offerings will caution prospective purchasers not to buy with the expectation of acting as brokers, dealers, agents, or middlemen for other interested parties. (6) The failure of a purchaser to comply with the sales contract terms and conditions may be cause for suspension and/or debarment, in addition to other administrative, contractual, civil, and criminal (including, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1001) remedies which may be available to the Department of Defense. (7) Aircraft parts will be made available as follows: (i) DRMS may, based on availability and demand, offer for sale under the Act whole unflyable aircraft, aircraft carcasses for cannibalization, or aircraft parts, utilizing substantially the same provisions outlined in paragraphs (a) through (d)(6) of this section for flyable aircraft. (ii) Sales contracts for unflyable aircraft shall contain a restriction in perpetuity against use for flight. DRMS will not issue a bill of sale for these aircraft. When unflyable aircraft or aircraft residue is to be sold for parts use, the data plates must be removed [[Page 374]] and destroyed by the owning military service prior to releasing the aircraft to the contractor. (iii) If DOT requests that DRMS set aside parts for sale under Act, DOT must provide listings of parts required, by National Stock Number and Condition Code. (iv) Only qualified oil spill response operators who fly the end- item aircraft will be allowed to purchase unflyable aircraft, aircraft carcasses, or aircraft parts applicable to that end-item. (v) FMVs are not required for aircraft parts. DRMS will utilize historic prices received for similar parts in making sale determinations. Sec. 207.6 Reutilization and transfer procedures. Prior to any sales effort, the Secretary of Defense shall, to the maximum extent practicable, consult with the Administrator of GSA, and with the heads of other Federal departments and agencies as appropriate, regarding reutilization and transfer requirements for aircraft and aircraft parts under this Act (see Chapter 4 of DoD 4160.21-M (August 1997), paragraphs B 2 b (1) through B 2 b (3)). (a) DOT shall notify Army, Navy, and/or Air Force, in writing, of their aircraft requirements as they arise, by aircraft type listed in Attachment 1 of Chapter 4 of DoD 4160.21-M (August 1997). (b) When aircraft become excess, the owning Military Service will screen for reutilization requirements within the Department of Defense, and those requirements shall take precedence over DOT requirements under this Act. (c) Federal agency transfer: (1) The Military Service shall report aircraft that survive reutilization screening to GSA Region 9 on a Standard Form 120. The Military Service must advise GSA Region 9 if DOT has lodged a written requirement for the aircraft for use in oil spill response. GSA will screen for Federal agency transfer requirements in accordance with the FMR. (2) If a Federal agency requirement exists, GSA shall advise the owning Military Service, in writing, of its intent to issue the aircraft to satisfy the Federal agency requirement. The Military Service will notify DOT of the competing Federal requirement for the aircraft. If DOT disputes the priority given to the Federal requirement, it shall end a written notice of dispute to the owning Military Service and to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics and Materiel Readiness (DUSD (L&MR)) within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the Military Service. DUSD (L&MR) shall then resolve the dispute, in writing. The aircraft cannot be issued until notification is given and any dispute is resolved. (d) The Military Services shall: (1) Respond to the DOT, in writing, when excess aircraft that can meet DOT's stated requirements have survived reutilization and transfer screening. (2) Report excess aircraft that survive reutilization and transfer screening and are available for sale to Headquarters, Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service, ATTN: DRMS-LMI, Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3092. The Military Services must use a DD Form 1348-1A, DTID, for this purpose. (3) Transfer excess aircraft that survive reutilization and transfer screening to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC), Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ, and place the aircraft in an ``excess'' storage category while aircraft are undergoing oil spill response sale. Aircraft shall not be made available or offered to oil spill response operators from the Military Service's airfield. The Military Service shall be responsible for the AMARC aircraft induction charges. The aircraft purchaser will be liable for all AMARC withdrawal charges, to include any aircraft preparation required from AMARC. Sale of parts required for aircraft preparation is limited to those not required for the operational mission forces, and only if authorized by specific authority of the respective Military Service's weapon system program manager. Sec. 207.7 Reporting requirements. Not later than 31 March 2003, the Secretary of Defense must submit to the Committees on Armed Services and [[Page 375]] Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committees on National Security and Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives a report setting forth the following: (a) The number and type of aircraft sold under this authority, and the terms and conditions under which the aircraft were sold. (b) The persons or entities to which the aircraft were sold. (c) An accounting of the current use of the aircraft sold. (d) DOT must submit to Headquarters, Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service, ATTN: DRMS-LMI, Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan, 49017-3092, not later than 1 February 2006, a report setting forth an accounting of the current disposition of all aircraft sold under the authority of the Act.

Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 133. Source: 44 FR 50598, Aug. 29, 1979, unless otherwise noted. Sec. 211.1 Reissuance and purpose. This part (a) is reissued without substantive change, to correct superseded references; and (b) defines the tax relief policy of the Department of Defense, designates the organizational element which has continuing responsibility for the overall direction of the DoD Foreign Tax Relief Program, delineates the responsibilities of other organizational elements to implement and monitor the program, and requires the preparation and maintenance of specified foreign country tax law studies in order to facilitate the institution of statistical reporting procedures. Sec. 211.2 Applicability and scope. (a) The provisions of this part apply to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments, the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Unified Command, and the Defense Agencies (hereafter referred to as ``DoD Components''). (b) The policy set forth in this part applies to: (1) Military functions expenditures by the Department of Defense, and (2) Expenditures by nonappropriated fund activities of the Department of Defense that are subject to taxes imposed by: (i) Foreign countries in which U.S. military forces are regularly stationed (other than attache and other military personnel assigned to a U.S. diplomatic mission); and (ii) Any other foreign country in which all or most U.S. defense activities, in a collective sense, are conducted in the interest of the common defense or otherwise significantly improve the military security of that country. (c) The policy set forth in this part also applies to Military Assistance Program (MAP) expenditures in all countries. Sec. 211.3 Definitions. (a) Regardless of how a charge is denominated in foreign law or regulation, the words ``tax'' and ``taxes'' include all direct or indirect foreign customs duties, import and export taxes, excises, fees and other charges imposed at the national, local or intermediate level of a foreign country other than charges for services rendered or for other consideration received. (b) For example, taxes include but are not limited to purchase tax, sales tax, use tax, gross receipts tax, stamp tax, transfer tax, transaction tax, turnover tax, value added tax, service tax, trade tax, business tax, license tax, transportation tax, circulation tax, [[Page 377]] luxury tax, possession tax, production tax, registration tax, consumption tax, gasoline tax, real property tax, personal property tax, and gross income tax. (c) The word ``relief'' includes any method, technique, or procedure by which the ultimate economic burden of a tax on DoD funds may be avoided or otherwise remedied, such as exemption, refund, or drawback. Sec. 211.4 Policy. It is the policy of the Department of Defense to secure, to the maximum extent practicable, effective relief from all foreign taxes wherever the ultimate economic burden of those taxes would, in the absence of such relief, be borne by funds appropriated or allocated to the Department of Defense (including MAP appropriations) or under the control of its nonappropriated fund activities. In those cases in which the total economic burden of a tax not readily identifiable in the normal course of business is so small that it may be considered a de minimis matter, or in which the administrative burden of securing effective relief from a tax in a particular instance would be out of proportion to the amount of the relief obtained, tax relief shall be considered impracticable. Sec. 211.5 Responsibilities. (a) The General Counsel of the Department of Defense shall: (1) Provide overall supervision and direction of the DoD Foreign Tax Relief Program. (2) Resolve any significant issues relating to the program. (3) Designate those countries that come within Sec. 211.2(b)(2)(ii) of this part.

Such instructions or regulations shall delegate to the Cognizant Office authority commensurate with its responsibility. (f) Commanders of Unified Commands, as appropriate, shall promulgate management procedures to guide and coordinate the administration of the DoD Foreign Tax Relief Program throughout their respective area commands.

(All such taxes are hereafter referred to as ``applicable taxes.'') The formats of the studies for all countries shall be similar within each Unified Command insofar as practicable, and designed to facilitate statistical reporting procedures. The studies shall be prepared and maintained with a view to the practical utilization of the studies by U.S. contracting officers and activities for purposes of making reliable estimates of the total amount of taxes applicable to any particular contract and the amount thereof for which tax relief is available. (b) Each country tax law study shall consist of the following: (1) A general survey of all applicable taxes, together with translations, as appropriate, of the salient features of the law or regulations imposing those taxes.

Property abandoned by a private organization on its disestablishment or departure from the installation, or donated by it to the installation, may be acquired by the DoD installation under the terms of applicable agreements, statutes, and DoD policy. (i) Adequate insurance, as defined by the Service concerned, shall be secured by the organization to protect against public liability and property damage claims or other legal actions that may arise as a result of activities of the organization or one or more of its members acting in its behalf, or the operation of any equipment, apparatus or device under the control and responsibility of the private organization.

The head of a DoD installation concerned may approve the operation of private organizations, such as investment clubs, in which the investment of members' personal funds result in a return on investment directly and solely to the individual members. (l) No person because of race, color, creed, sex, age, disability or national origin shall be unlawfully denied membership, unlawfully excluded from participation, or otherwise subjected to unlawful discrimination by any private organization on a DoD installation covered by this part.

Authority: Chapter 15 of title 10 U.S.C. (10 U.S.C. 331 et seq.). Source: 37 FR 3637, Feb. 18, 1972, unless otherwise noted. Sec. 215.1 Purpose and scope. This part establishes uniform Department of Defense policies, assigns responsibilities, and furnishes general guidance for utilizing DoD military and civilian personnel, facilities, equipment or supplies: (a) In support of civil authorities during civil disturbances within the 50 States, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. possessions and territories, or any political subdivision thereof. (b) In other related instances where military resources may be used to protect life or Federal property or to prevent disruption of Federal functions. Sec. 215.2 Applicability. This part is applicable to all components of the Department of Defense (the Military Departments, Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Defense Agencies, and the unified and specified commands) having cognizance over military resources which may be utilized in accordance with the policies set forth herein. Sec. 215.3 Definitions. (a) Civil disturbances are group acts of violence and disorders prejudicial to public law and order within the 50 States, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. possessions and territories, or any political subdivision thereof. The term civil disturbance includes all domestic conditions requiring the use of Federal armed forces pursuant to the provisions of chapter 15 of Title 10, United States Code. (b) Federal property is that property which is owned, leased, possessed, or occupied by the Federal Government. (c) Military resources include military and civilian personnel, facilities, equipment, and supplies under the control of a DoD component. (d) A Federal function is any function, operation, or action carried out under the laws of the United States by any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or by an officer or employee thereof. Sec. 215.4 Legal considerations. (a) Under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the protection of life and property and the maintenance of public order are primarily the responsibilities of State and local governments, which have the necessary authority to enforce the laws. The Federal Government may assume this responsibility and this authority only in certain limited instances. (b) Aside from the constitutional limitations of the power of the Federal Government at the local level, there are additional legal limits upon the use of military forces within the United States. The most important of these from a civil disturbance standpoint is the Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. 1385), which prohibits the use of any part of the Army or the Air Force to execute or enforce the laws, except as authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress. (c) The Constitution and Acts of Congress establish six exceptions, generally applicable within the entire territory of the United States, to which the Posse Comitatus Act prohibition does not apply. (1) The constitutional exceptions are two in number and are based upon the inherent legal right of the U.S. Government--a sovereign national entity under the Federal Constitution--to insure the preservation of public order and the carrying out of governmental [[Page 383]] operations within its territorial limits, by force if necessary. (i) The emergency authority. Authorities prompt and vigorous Federal action, including use of military forces, to prevent loss of life or wanton destruction of property and to restore governmental functioning and public order when sudden and unexpected civil disturbances, disasters, or calamities seriously endanger life and property and disrupt normal governmental functions to such an extent that duly constituted local authorities are unable to control the situations. (ii) Protection of Federal property and functions. Authorizes Federal action, including the use of military forces, to protect Federal property and Federal governmental functions when the need for protection exists and duly constituted local authorities are unable or decline to provide adequate protection. (2) There are four exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act based on Acts of Congress. (i) In the cases of each of the first three of those described, paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (a), (b), and (c) of this section, personal Presidential action, including the issuance of a proclamation calling upon insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably within a limited time, is a prerequisite. (a) 10 U.S.C. 331. Authorizes use of the militia and Armed Forces when a State is unable to control domestic violence, and a request for Federal assistance has been made by the State legislature or governor to the President. Implements Article IV, section 4, of the Constitution. (b) 10 U.S.C. 332. Authorizes use of the militia and Armed Forces to enforce Federal law when unlawful obstructions or rebellion against the authority of the United States renders ordinary enforcement means unworkable. Implements Article II, section 3, of the Constitution. (c) 10 U.S.C. 333. Authorizes use of the militia and Armed Forces when domestic violence or conspiracy hinders execution of State or Federal law, and a State cannot or will not protect the constitutional rights of the citizens. Implements Article II, section 3, and the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. (d) House Joint Resolution 1292, June 6, 1968.\\1\\ Directs all departments of the Government, upon the request of the Secret Service, to assist that Service in carrying out its statutory duties to protect Government officials and major political candidates from physical harm. Assistance to the Secret Service is governed by DoD Directive 3025.13, ``Employment of Department of Defense Resources in Support of the United States Secret Service,'' July 15, 1968.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Although this resolution has been placed in the Statutes at Large as Public Law 90-331, 82 Stat. 170, it has not been codified; it is set out in the notes to 18 U.S.C. 3056. \\2\\ Filed as part of original copies available from U.S. Naval Publications and Forms Center, 5801 Tabor Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19120, Code: 300. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (ii) It should be noted that none of the above authorities, in and of itself, provides sufficient legal basis to order members of the Reserve components to active Federal service. Sec. 215.5 Policies. (a) The employment of DoD military resources for assistance to civil authorities in controlling civil disturbances will normally be predicated upon the issuance of a Presidential Executive order or Presidential directive authorizing and directing the Secretary of Defense to provide for the restoration of law and order in a specific State or locality. Exceptions to this condition will be limited to: (1) Cases of sudden and unexpected emergencies as described in Sec. 215.4(c)(1)(i), which require that immediate military action be taken. (2) Providing military resources to civil authorities as prescribed in Sec. 215.9 of this part. (b) The Attorney General of the United States has been designated to receive and coordinate preliminary requests from States for Federal military assistance authorized by 10 U.S.C. 331 (Sec. 215.4(c)(2)(i)(a)). Formal requests from States for such aid will be made to the President, who will determine what Federal action will be taken. (c) The Secretary of the Army is delegated any and all of the authority of the President under chapter 15 of title 10, U.S.C. (Sec. 215.4(c)(2)(i) (a), (b), and (c)) [[Page 384]] which has been or may be hereafter delegated by the President to the Secretary of Defense. (d) The Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Air Force are delegated all that authority which has been or may be hereafter delegated by the President to the Secretary of Defense to order to active duty, units and members of the Reserve Components under their respective jurisdictions, except National Guard units and members, for use pursuant to chapter 15 of title 10, U.S.C. (Sec. 215.4(c)(2)(i) (a), (b), and (c)). (e) DoD components and their subordinate activities will coordinate with local civil authorities or local military commanders as appropriate, to assure mutual understanding of the policies and procedures to be adhered to in an actual or anticipated civil disturbance situation. (f) DoD civilian employees generally should not be used to assist civil authorities in connection with civil disturbances, except as provided for in Sec. 215.9(b)(3). (g) The prepositioning of more than a battalion-sized unit, as authorized in Sec. 215.6(a)(6), will be undertaken only with the approval of the President.

(a) Loan policy. Civil authorities, National Guard, and Federal agencies will be encouraged to provide sufficient resources of their own, so as to minimize the need to rely on DoD assistance. (1) Classification of resources. Military resources will be classified into three groups, as follows: (i) Group One. Personnel, arms, ammunition, tank-automotive equipment, and aircraft. (ii) Group Two. Riot control agents, concertina wire, and other like military equipment to be employed in control of civil disturbances which is not included in Group One. (iii) Group Three. Firefighting resources (to include operating personnel); equipment of a protective nature (such as masks, helmets, body armor vests) and other equipment not included in Group One or Two (such as clothing, communications equipment, searchlights); and the use of DoD facilities. (2) Requests for personnel to be used in a direct law enforcement role are not within the purview of this part and must be made by the legislature or governor of a State in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 331. Pursuant to the Posse Comitatus Act, DoD operating personnel employed in connection with loaned equipment may not be used in a direct law enforcement role. (3) Repair parts and POL items are classified according to the group of the equipment for which the parts or POL are intended. (b) Approval of requests. (1) Requests for Group One military resources may be granted only with the personal approval of the DoD Executive Agent or, when designated by him for that purpose, the Under Secretary of the Army. (2) Requests for Group Two military resources may be granted only with the personal approval of the DoD Executive Agent, or the following individuals when designated by him for that purpose: (i) The Under Secretary of the Army; (ii) The Director and Deputy Director of Military Support; or (iii) A Task Force Commander employed at an objective area during a civil disturbance.

(i) Installation commanders are authorized to provide emergency explosive ordnance disposal service in accordance with applicable regulations of respective military departments. (ii) The Director, Defense Supply Agency, is authorized to approve requests from subordinate agencies for firefighting assistance in connection with civil disturbances. Where installation fire departments have mutual aid agreements with nearby civil communities, the installation commander is authorized to provide emergency civilian or mixed civilian/military firefighting assistance. In the absence of a mutual aid agreement and when it is in the best interest of the United States, a commander with Group Three approval authority is authorized to provide emergency civilian or mixed civilian/military assistance in extinguishing fires and in preserving life or property from fire, within the vicinity of an installation. In either case, civilian firefighters may be used provided: (a) In civil disturbance situations where there is significant danger of physical harm to firefighters, the civilian employees volunteer for the assignment. (DoD civilian employees acting in this volunteer capacity are acting as Federal employees.) [[Page 388]] (b) Firefighting equipment will not be used for riot control. (c) Civil authorities recognize that prior to the commitment of Federal forces to assist in restoring law and order, the protection of firefighting crews and equipment is the responsibility, in ascending order, of municipal, county, and State officials. Failure on the part of such authorities to recognize this responsibility and/or to provide adequate protection will be grounds for refusal to commit installation resources or for withdrawal of resources already committed. (4) Requests for Groups One, Two, or Three resources, and for renewal of outstanding loans, may be denied at any level in the chain of command down to and including commanders delegated Group Three approval authority. (c) Processing of requests. (1) All requests will be promptly submitted through channels to the appropriate approving authorities using the format established by the DoD Executive Agent. (2) Requests will be forwarded and processed in keeping with the degree of urgency dictated by the situation. (3) Requests received by personnel of Defense agencies will be referred to local military commanders for processing, except that DSA subordinate agencies will forward requests for firefighting assistance to DSA. (4) Request from civil law enforcement agencies for training assistance related to the control of civil disturbances will not be approved at the local level. Such requests should be referred to the nearest U.S. attorney, Department of Justice. (d) Reporting of requests. (1) Reports of all requests for military resources (approved, denied, or pending) will be prepared by all appropriate approving authorities, using the format established by the DoD Executive Agent, and forwarded through channels as follows: (i) To the military department headquarters, in the case of requests received in the CONUS by the four Services. (ii) To the DoD Executive Agent, in the case of requests for firefighting assistance received by the Defense Supply Agency. (iii) To the JCS, in the case of requests received by organizations or installations over which the commanders of the unified and specified commands exercise command authority. (2) Reports received by the military department headquarters and JCS will be transmitted to the DoD Executive Agent, who, in turn, will transmit information copies of all approved requests for Groups One and Two military resources to the General Counsel of the DoD and the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. (3) In addition, a weekly summary report of all requests will be compiled by the DoD Executive Agent, showing action taken (approved, denied, or pending) and submitted to the General Counsel of the DoD, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Installations and Logistics), and the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. Negative summary reports are required. (4) The reporting requirements prescribed herein are assigned Report Control Symbol DD-A(AR)1112. Sec. 215.10 Funding.

That decision may affect eligiblity for funding from appropriations of the Departments of Defense, Transportation, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. Should it be determined that ABC College is in violation of the aforementioned statutes, such funding would be stopped, and the school would be ineligible to receive such funds in the future. I regret that this action may have to be taken. Successful recruiting requires that Department of Defense recruiters have reasonable access to students on the campuses of colleges and universities, and at the same time have effective relationships with the officials and student bodies of those institutions. I hope it will be possible to (define the correction to the aforementioned problem area(s). I am available to answer any questions. Sincerely, Appendix B to Part 216--ROTC Sample Letter of Inquiry (Tailor Letter to Situation Presented) Dr. Jane Smith President ABC College Anywhere, USA 12345-9876 Dear Dr. Smith: I understand that ABC College has (refused a request from a Military Department to establish a Senior ROTC [[Page 394]] unit at your institution) (refused to continue existing ROTC programs at your institution) (prevented students from participation at a Senior ROTC program at another institution) by a policy or practice of the College. Current law \\1\\ prohibits funds by grant or contract (including a grant of funds to be available for student aid) from appropriations of the Departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies to schools that have a policy or practice prohibiting or preventing the Secretary of Defense from maintaining, establishing, or efficiently operating a Senior ROTC unit. Those statutes also bar agency funds for schools that prohibit or prevent a student from enrolling in an ROTC unit at another institution of higher education. Implementing regulations are codified at 32 Code of Federal Regulations, part 216. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ 10 U.S.C. 983 and 110 Stat. 3009. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This letter provides you an opportunity to clarify your institution's policy regarding ROTC access on the campus of ABC College.

PART 218_GUIDANCE FOR THE DETERMINATION AND REPORTING OF NUCLEAR RADIATION DOSE FOR DoD PARTICIPANTS IN THE ATMOSPHERIC NUCLEAR TEST PROGRAM (1945-1962)--Table of Contents Sec. 218.1 Policies. 218.2 General procedures. 218.3 Dose reconstruction methodology. 218.4 Dose estimate reporting standards. Authority: Pub. L. 98-542, 98 Stat. 2725 (38 U.S.C. 354 Note.) Source: 50 FR 42521, Oct. 21, 1985, unless otherwise noted. Sec. 218.1 Policies. (a) Upon request by the Veterans Administration in connection with a claim for compensation, or by a veteran or his or her representative, available information shall be provided by the applicable Military Service which shall include all material aspects of the radiation environment to which the veteran was exposed and shall include inhaled, ingested and neutron doses. In determining the veteran's dose, initial neutron, initial gamma, residual gamma, and internal (inhaled and ingested) alpha, beta, and gamma shall be considered. However, doses will be reported as gamma dose, neutron dose, and internal dose. The minimum standards for reporting dose estimates are set forth in Sec. 218.4. (b) The basic means by which to measure dose from exposure to ionizing radiation is the film badge. Of the estimated 220,000 Department of Defense participants in atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, about 145,000 have film badge dose data available. The information contained in the records has been reproduced in a standard format and is being provided to each military service, which can use the film badge dose data to obtain a radiation dose for a particular individual from that service. This is done upon request from the individual, the individual's representative, the Veterans Administration, or others as authorized by the Privacy Act. Upon request, the participant or his or her authorized representative will be informed of the specific methodologies and assumptions employed in estimating his or her dose. The participant can use this information to obtain independent options regarding exposure. (c) From 1945 through 1954, the DoD and Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) policy was to issue badges only to a portion of the personnel in a homogeneous unit such as a platoon of a battalion combat team, Naval ship or aircraft crew. Either one person was badged in a group performing the same function, or only personnel expected to be exposed to radiation were badged. After 1954, the policy was to badge all [[Page 395]] personnel. But, some badges were unreadable and some records were lost or destroyed, as in the fire at the Federal Records Center in St. Louis. For these reasons the Nuclear Test Personnel Review (NTPR) Program has focused on determining the radiation dose for those personnel (about 75,000) who were not issued film badges or for whom film badge records are not available. (d) In order to determine the radiation dose to individuals for whom film badge data are not available, alternative approaches are used as circumstances warrant. All approaches require investigation of individual or group activities and their relationship to the radiological environment. First, if it is apparent that personnel were not present in the radiological environment and had no other potential for exposure, then their dose is zero. Second, if some members of a group had film badge readings and others did not--and if all members had a common relationship with the radiological enviroment--then doses for unbadged personnel can be calculated. Third, where sufficient badge readings or a common relationship to the radiological environment does not exist, dose reconstruction is performed. This involves correlating a unit's or individual's detailed activities with the quantitively determined radiological environment. The three approaches are described as follows: (1) Activities of an individual or his unit are researched for the period of participation in an atmospheric nuclear test. Unit locations and movements are related to areas of radiation. If personnel were far distant from the nuclear detonation(s), did not experience fallout or enter a fallout area, and did not come in contact with radioactive samples or contaminated objects, they were judged to have received no dose. (2) Film badge data from badged personnel may be used to estimate individual doses for unbadged personnel. First, a group of participants must be identified that have certain common characteristics and a similar potential for exposure to radiation. Such characteristics are: Individuals must be doing the same kind of work, referred to as activity, and all members of the group must have a common relationship to the radiological environment in terms of time, location or other factors. Identification of these groups is based upon research of historical records, technical reports or correspondence. A military unit may consist of several groups or several units may comprise a single group. Using proven statistical methods, the badge data for each group is examined to determine if it adequately reflects the entire group, is valid for use in statistical calculations, or if the badge data indicate the group should be sub-divided into smaller groups. For a group that mets the tests described above, the mean dose, variance and confidence limits are determined. An estimated dose equal to 95% probability that the actual exposure did not exceed the estimate is assigned to unbadged personnel. This procedure is statistically sound and will insure that unbadged personnel are assigned doses much higher than the average/mean for the group. (3) Dose reconstruction is performed if film badge data are unavailable for all or part of the period or radiation exposure, if film badge data are partially available but cannot be used statistically for calculations, special activities are indicated for specific individuals, or if other types of radiation exposures are indicated. In dose reconstruction, the conditions of exposure are reconstructed analytically to arrive at a radiation dose. Such reconstruction is not a new concept; it is standard scientific practice used by health physicists when the circumstances of a radiation exposure require investigation. The underlying method is in each case the same. The radiation environment is characterized in time and space, as are the activities and geometrical position of the individual. Thus, the rate at which radiation is accrued is determined throughout the time of exposure, from which the total dose is integrated. An uncertainty analysis of the reconstruction provides a calculated mean dose with confidence limits. The specific method used in a dose reconstruction depends on what type of data are available to provide the required characterizations as well as the nature of the radiation [[Page 396]] environment. The radiation environment is not limited to the gamma radiation that would have been measured by a film badge, but also includes neutron radiation for personnel sufficiently close to a nuclear detonation, as well as beta and alpha radiation (internally) for personnel whose activities indicate the possibility of inhalation or ingestion of radioactive particles. Sec. 218.2 General procedures. The following procedures govern the approach taken in dose determination: (a) Use individual film badge data where available and complete, for determining the external gamma dose. (b) Identify group activities and locations for period(s) of possible exposure. (c) Qualitatively assess the radiation environment in order to delineate contaminated areas. If no activities occurred in these areas, and if no other potential for exposure exists, a no dose received estimate is made. (d) If partial film badge data are available, define group(s) of personnel with common activities and relationships to radiation environment. (e) Using standard statistical methods, verify from the distribution of film badge readings whether the badged sample adequately represents the intended group. (f) Calculate the mean external gamma dose, with variance and confidence limits, for each unbadged population. Assign a dose equal to 95% probability that actual exposure did not exceed the assigned dose. (g) If badge data is not available for a statistical calculation, conduct a dose reconstruction. (h) For dose reconstruction, define radiation environment through use of all available scientific data, e.g., measurements of radiation intensity, decay, radioisotopic composition. (i) Quantitatively relate activities shielding, position, and other factors to radiation environment as a function of time. Integrate dose throughout period of exposure. (j) Where possible, calculate mean dose with confidence limits; otherwise calculate best estimate dose or, if data are too sparse, upper limit dose. (k) Compare calculations with available film badge records to verify the calculated doses. Whether or not film badge data is available, calculate initial and internal doses where identified as a meaningful contribution to the total dose. Sec. 218.3 Dose reconstruction methodology. (a) Concept. The specific methodology consists of the characterization of the radiation environments to which participants through all relevant activities, were exposed. The environments, both initial and residual radiation are corrected with the activities of participants to determine accrued doses due to initial radiation, residual radiation and/or inhaled/ingested radioactive material, as warranted by the radiation environment and the specific personnel activities. Due to the range of activities, times, geometries, shielding, and weapon characteristics, as well as the normal spread in the available data pertaining to the radiation environment, an uncertainty analysis is performed. This analysis quantifies the uncertainties due to time/space variations, group size, and available data. Due to the large amounts of data, an automated (computer-assisted) procedure is often used to facilitate the data-handling and the dose integration, and to investigate the sensitivity to variations in the parameters used. The results of the gamma data calculations are then compared with film badge data as they apply to the specific period of the film badges and to the comparable activities of the exposed personnel, in order to validate the procedure and to identify personnel activities that could have led to atypical doses. Radiation dose from neutrons and dose commitments due to inhaled or ingested radioactive material are not detected by film badges. Where required, these values are calculated and recorded separately. (b) Characterization of the radiological environment. (1) This step describes and defines the radiological conditions as a function of time for all locations of concern, that is, where personnel were positioned or where personnel activities took place. The radiation environment is divided into two standard categories--initial radiation and residual radiation. [[Page 397]] (2) The initial radiation environment results from several types of gamma and neutron emissions. Prompt neutron and gamma radiation are emitted at the time of detonation, while delayed neutrons and fission- product gamma, from the decay of radioactive products in the fireball, continue to be emitted as the fireball rises. In contrast to these essentially point sources of radiation, there is gamma radiation from neutron interactions with air and soil, generated within a fraction of a second. Because of the complexity of these radiation sources and their varied interaction properties with air and soil, it is necessary to obtain solutions of the Boltzmann radiation transport equation. The radiation environment thus derived includes the effects of shot-specific parameters such as weapon type and yield, neutron and gamma output, source and target geometry, and atmospheric conditions. The calculated neutron and gamma radiation environments are checked for consistency with existing measured data as available. In those few cases displaying significant discrepancies that cannot be resolved, an environment based on extrapolation of the data is used if it leads to a larger calculated dose. (3) In determining the residual radiation environment, all possible sources are considered including radioactive clouds, radiation that may have been encountered from other tests, and radioactive debris that may have been deposited in water during oceanic tests. The residual radiation environment is divided into two general components--neutron- activated material that subsequently emits, over a period of time, beta and gamma radiation; and radioactive debris from the fission reaction or from unfissioned materials that emit alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Because residual radiation decays, the characterization of the residual environment is defined by the radiation intensity as a function of type and time. Radiological survey data are used to determine specific intensities at times of personnel exposure. Interpolation and extrapolation are based on known decay characteristics of the individual materials that comprise the residual contamination. In those rare cases where insufficient radiation data exist to adequately define the residual environment, source data are obtained from the appropriate weapon design laboratory and applied in standard radiation transport codes to determine the initial radiation at specific distances from the burst. This radiation, together with material composition and characteristics, leads to description of the neutron-activated field for each location and time of interest. In all cases observed data, as obtained at the time of the operation, are used to calibrate the calculations. (c) Activities of participants. This step uses all official records, augmented by personnel interviews where gaps exist, to depict a scenario of activities for each individual or definable group. When a dose reconstruction is performed for a specific individual, information available from the individual is accepted unless demonstrably inaccurate. For military units, whose operations were closely controlled and further constrained by radiological safety monitors, the scenario is usually well defined. The same is true for observers, who were restricted to specific locations both during and after the nuclear burst. Ships' locations and activities are usually known with a high degree of precision from deck logs. Aircraft tracks and altitudes are also usually well defined. Personnel engaged in scientific experiments often kept logs of their activities; moreover, the locations of their experiments are usually a matter of record. Where the records are insufficiently complete for the degree of precision required to determine radiation exposure, participants' comments are used and reasonable judgements are made to further the analysis. Possible variations in the activities, as well as possible individual deviations from group activities, with respect to both time and location, are considered in the uncertainty analysis of the radiation dose calculations. (d) Calculation of dose. (1) The initial radiation doses to close-in personnel (who were normally positioned in trenches at the time of detonation) are calculated from the above-ground environment by simulating the radiation transport into the trenches. Various calculational approaches, standard in health physics, are employed to relate [[Page 398]] in-trench to above-trench doses for each source of radiation. Detailed modeling of the human body, in appropriate postures in the trench, is performed to calculate the gamma dose that would have been recorded on a film badge and the maximum neutron dose. The neutron, neutron-generated gamma, and prompt gamma doses are accrued during such a short time interval that the posture in a trench could not be altered significantly during this exposure. The fission-product gamma dose, however, is delivered over a period of many seconds. Therefore, the possibility of individual reorientation (e.g., standing up) in the trench is considered. (2) The calculation of the dose from residual radiation follows from the characterized radiation environment and personnel activities. Because radiation intensities are calculated for a field (i.e., in two spatial dimensions) and in time, the radiation intensity is determinable for each increment of personnel activity regardless of direction or at what time. The dose from exposure to a radiation field is obtained by summing the contribution (product of intensity and time) to dose at each step. The dose calculated from the radiation field does not reflect the shielding of the film badge afforded by the human body. This shielding has been determined for pertinent body positions by the solution of radiation transport equations as applied to a radiation field. Conversion factors are used to arrive at a calculated film badge dose, which not only facilitates comparison with film badge data, but serves as a substitute for an unavailable film badge reading. (3) The calculation of the dose from inhaled or ingested radioactivity primarily involves the determination of what radiosotopes entered the body in what quantity. Published conversion factors are then applied to these data to arrive at the radiation dose and future dose commitments to internal organs. Inhalation or ingestion of radioactive material is calculated from the radioactive environment and the processes of making these materials inhalable or ingestible. Activities and processes that cause material to become airborne (such as wind, decontamination or traffic) are used with empirical data on particle lofting to determine airborne concentrations under specific circumstances. Volumetric breathing rates and durations of exposure are used to calculate the total material intake. Data on time-dependent weapon debris isotopic composition and the above-mentioned conversion factors are used to calculate the dose commitment to the body and to specific body organs. (e) Uncertainty analysis. Because of the uncertainties associated with the radiological data or calculations used in the absence of data, as well as the uncertainties with respect to personnel activities, confidence limits are determined where possible for group dose calculations. The uncertainty analysis quantifies the errors in available data or in the model used in the absence of data. Confidence limits are based on the uncertainty of all relevant input parameters, and thus vary with the quality of the input data. They also consider the possible range of doses due to the size of the exposure group being examined. Typical sources of error include orientation of the weapons, specific weapon yields, instrument error, fallout intensity data, time(s) at which data were obtained, fallout decay rate, route of personnel movements, and arrival/stay times for specific activities. (f) Comparison with film badge records. (1) Calculations of gamma dose were compared with film badge records for two military units at Operation PLUMBBOB to initially validate this methodology. Where all parameters relating to radiation exposure were identified, direct comparison of gamma dose calculations with actual film badge readings was possible. Resultant correlations provided high confidence in the methodology. (2) Film badge data may, in some cases, be unrepresentative of the total exposure of a given individual or group; nevertheless, they are extremely useful for direct comparison of incremental doses for specific periods, e.g., validating the calculations for the remaining, unbadged period of exposure. Moreover, a wide distribution of film badge data often leads to more definitive personnel grouping for dose calculations [[Page 399]] and to further investigation of the reason(s) for such distribution. In all cases, personnel film badge data are not used in the dose calculations, but rather are used solely for comparison with and validation of the calculations. For dose reconstructions accomplished to date, comparison has been favorable and within the confidence limits of the calculations. Sec. 218.4 Dose estimate reporting standards. The following minimum standards for reporting dose estimates shall be uniformly applied by the Military Services when preparing information in response to an inquiry by the Veterans Administration, in connection with a claim for compensation, or by a veteran or his or her representative. The information shall include all material aspects of the radiation environment to which the veteran was exposed and shall include inhaled, ingested, and neutron doses, when applicable. In determining the veteran's dose, initial neutron, initial gamma, residual gamma, and internal (inhaled and ingested) alpha, beta, and gamma shall be considered. However, doses will be reported as gamma dose, neutron dose, and internal dose. To the extent to which the information is available, the responses will address the following questions: (a) Can it be documented that the veteran was a test participant? If so, what tests did he attend and what were the specifics of these tests (date, time, yield (unless classified) type, location and other relevant details)? (b) What unit was the man in? What were the mission and activities of the units at the test? (c) To the extent to which the available records indicate, what were his duties at the test? (d) Can you corroborate the specific information relevant to the potential exposure provided by the claimant to the Veterans Administration and forwarded to the Department of Defense? What is the impact of these specific activities on the claimant's reconstructed dose? (e) Is there any recorded radiation exposure for the individual? Does this recorded exposure cover the full period of test participation? What are the uncertainties associated with the recorded film badge dose? (f) If recorded dosimetry data is unavailable or incomplete, what is the dose reconstruction for the most probable dose, with error limits, if available? (g) Is there evidence of a neutron or internal exposure? What is the reconstruction? Upon request, the participant or his or her authorized representative will be informed of the specific methodologies and assumptions employed in estimating his or her dose.

(d) Research means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Activities which [[Page 402]] meet this definition constitute research for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program which is considered research for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may include research activities. (e) Research subject to regulation, and similar terms are intended to encompass those research activities for which a federal department or agency has specific responsibility for regulating as a research activity, (for example, Investigational New Drug requirements administered by the Food and Drug Administration). It does not include research activities which are incidentally regulated by a federal department or agency solely as part of the department's or agency's broader responsibility to regulate certain types of activities whether research or non-research in nature (for example, Wage and Hour requirements administered by the Department of Labor). (f) Human subject means a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains (1) Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or (2) Identifiable private information. Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are gathered (for example, venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes. Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject. ``Private information'' includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a medical record). Private information must be individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information) in order for obtaining the information to constitute research involving human subjects.

In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS, and approved for federalwide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS. (b) Departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has an assurance approved as provided in [[Page 403]] this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB provided for in the assurance, and will be subject to continuing review by the IRB. Assurances applicable to federally supported or conducted research shall at a minimum include: (1) A statement of principles governing the institution in the discharge of its responsibilities for protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects of research conducted at or sponsored by the institution, regardless of whether the research is subject to federal regulation. This may include an appropriate existing code, declaration, or statement of ethical principles, or a statement formulated by the institution itself. This requirement does not preempt provisions of this policy applicable to department- or agency-supported or regulated research and need not be applicable to any research exempted or waived under Sec. 219.101 (b) or (i). (2) Designation of one or more IRBs established in accordance with the requirements of this policy, and for which provisions are made for meeting space and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and recordkeeping duties. (3) A list of IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; representative capacity; indications of experience such as board certifications, licenses, etc., sufficient to describe each member's chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment or other relationship between each member and the institution; for example: full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant. Changes in IRB membership shall be reported to the department or agency head, unless in accord with Sec. 219.103(a) of this policy, the existence of an HHS- approved assurance is accepted. In this case, change in IRB membership shall be reported to the Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS. (4) Written procedures which the IRB will follow (i) for conducting its initial and continuing review of research and for reporting its findings and actions to the investigator and the institution; (ii) for determining which projects require review more often than annually and which projects need verification from sources other than the investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB review; and (iii) for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed changes in a research activity, and for ensuring that such changes in approved research, during the period for which IRB approval has already been given, may not be initiated without IRB review and approval except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject. (5) Written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB, appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head of (i) any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this policy or the requirements or determinations of the IRB and (ii) any suspension or termination of IRB approval. (c) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes. (d) The department or agency head will evaluate all assurances submitted in accordance with this policy through such officers and employees of the department or agency and such experts or consultants engaged for this purpose as the department or agency head determines to be appropriate. The department or agency head's evaluation will take into consideration the adequacy of the proposed IRB in light of the anticipated scope of the institution's research activities and the types of subject populations likely to be involved, the appropriateness of the proposed initial and continuing review procedures in light of the probable risks, and the size and complexity of the institution. (e) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head may approve or disapprove the assurance, or enter into negotiations to develop an approvable one. The department or [[Page 404]] agency head may limit the period during which any particular approved assurance or class of approved assurances shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict approval. (f) Certification is required when the research is supported by a federal department or agency and not otherwise exempted or waived under Sec. 219.101 (b) or (i). An institution with an approved assurance shall certify that each application or proposal for research covered by the assurance and by Sec. 219.103 of this Policy has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted with the application or proposal or by such later date as may be prescribed by the department or agency to which the application or proposal is submitted. Under no condition shall research covered by Sec. 219.103 of the Policy be supported prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Institutions without an approved assurance covering the research shall certify within 30 days after receipt of a request for such a certification from the department or agency, that the application or proposal has been approved by the IRB. If the certification is not submitted within these time limits, the application or proposal may be returned to the institution. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 9999-0020) [56 FR 28012, 28021, June 18, FR 29756, June 28, 1991] Sec. Sec. 219.104-219.106 [Reserved] Sec. 219.107 IRB membership. (a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members, and the diversity of the members, including consideration of race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. In addition to possessing the professional competence necessary to review specific research activities, the IRB shall be able to ascertain the acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice. The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a vulnerable category of subjects, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, or handicapped or mentally disabled persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these subjects. (b) Every nondiscriminatory effort will be made to ensure that no IRB consists entirely of men or entirely of women, including the institution's consideration of qualified persons of both sexes, so long as no selection is made to the IRB on the basis of gender. No IRB may consist entirely of members of one profession. (c) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. (d) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution. (e) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB. (f) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues which require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB. These individuals may not vote with the IRB. Sec. 219.108 IRB functions and operations. In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB shall: (a) Follow written procedures in the same detail as described in Sec. 219.103(b)(4) and, to the extent required by, Sec. 219.103(b)(5). [[Page 405]] (b) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (see Sec. 219.110), review proposed research at convened meetings at which a majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority of those members present at the meeting. Sec. 219.109 IRB review of research. (a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research activities covered by this policy. (b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects as part of informed consent is in accordance with Sec. 219.116. The IRB may require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in Sec. 219.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of subjects. (c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may waive documentation in accordance with Sec. 219.117. (d) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person or in writing. (e) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research covered by this policy at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year, and shall have authority to observe or have a third party observe the consent process and the research. (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 9999-0020) Sec. 219.110 Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research. (a) The Secretary, HHS, has established, and published as a Notice in the Federal Register, a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The list will be amended, as appropriate after consultation with other departments and agencies, through periodic republication by the Secretary, HHS, in the Federal Register. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Protection from Research Risks, National Institutes of Health, HHS, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. (b) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review either or both of the following: (1) Some or all of the research appearing on the list and found by the reviewer(s) to involve no more than minimal risk, (2) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period (of one year or less) for which approval is authorized. Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the non-expedited procedure set forth in Sec. 219.108(b). (c) Each IRB which uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals which have been approved under the procedure. (d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the expedited review procedure. [[Page 406]] Sec. 219.111 Criteria for IRB approval of research. (a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied: (1) Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and (ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. (2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility. (3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted and should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons. (4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by Sec. 219.116. (5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with, and to the extent required by Sec. 219.117. (6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. (7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. (b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, mentally disabled persons, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. Sec. 219.112 Review by institution. Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve the research if it has not been approved by an IRB. "}
