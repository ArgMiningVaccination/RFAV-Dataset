Rituals for cleansing your home work equally well for clearing your energetic body or aura, or even recharging a relationship. Let's begin by exploring the nature of energy, and how it becomes stagnant, or \"toxic,\" in the first place. It's all about energy. We now know that everything within this seemingly material universe, ourselves included, is made up of energy. What appears to your senses as solid matter is simply energy, vibrating at different rates of speed. Your ears translate sound waves into hearing. Your eyes translate light waves into sight. But nothing material actually exists. And this means that the \"stuff\" that makes up the entire universe is actually not stuff at all. It's energy. Energy is the currency of life. It's the force that animates all things. When it's flowing through you with the inhalation and exhalation of each breath, the doctors proclaim you alive. And when the energy that creates all things stops flowing through you, they pronounce you dead. This universe and every physical being living within it is all sourced by this non-physical energy. And whether you refer to it as Life Force, Infinite Intelligence, Mother Nature, Source, Spirit, Soul, or God makes no difference whatsoever. This energy is the force that breathes you, that gives you life and sustains you through this lifetime and beyond. It's the boundless supply of everything you could possibly need or desire. What causes energy alignment of misalignment? In our balanced and aligned state, universal or divine energy moves to and through us in an effortless, un-resisted flow. In our bodies, this means we easily receive the creative impulses that, when followed, promote our health and wellbeing. [Mental and emotion alignment](https://www.christywhitman.com/quantum-success-show-alignment-to-create-our-goals) means we're able to acknowledge the ebb and flow of our feelings, and benefit from the guidance they provide. But when our physical or mental energies are blocked or misaligned, this communication between our physical and non-physical selves is interrupted. We do not easily receive guidance or inspiration, or if we do, we have trouble interpreting or acting on it. A state of lethargy, confusion, or hyperactivity, such that you feel like you're \"spinning in circles,\" are all indications of energetic imbalance. Our homes are an extension of our physical, mental and emotional selves. And as such, they reflect our internal state of alignment or misalignment. By improving the energy flow in your home, you can cause a transformation in your physical, mental and emotional health as well. Here are 3 healing rituals that will help you to bring this transformation about: Healing Ritual #1: Purge your space of clutter and unwanted items. The first principle of energy alignment is to release that which is no longer serving us. This goes for outdated or limiting beliefs, toxic relationships, or even foods that disagree with us. Anything that interrupts the effortless feedback loop between your human self and your divine nature will cause an energy imbalance. If your home is filled with unwanted or forgotten items, those items take up space and prevent the life force from circulating freely. They also keep you anchored to the past and make it more difficult for new opportunities to be drawn into your experience. In clearing out the old, you make space in your life and home for a new frequency of energy. Author and space-clearing [expert Marie Kondo](https://konmari.com/) offers a simple healing ritual to distinguish items that are life-giving from those that are not. She recommends touching each of your belongings one by one in order to feel whether it \"sparks joy\" within you. If it does, then dust it off and energetically welcome it into your home. If it does not spark joy, thank it for having been a part of your life, then pass it on to someone else who can enjoy it. This principle also applies to clothing, relationships - even to the forms of media and entertainment you commonly interact with. Remember that everything carries a frequency. If you are not feeling, looking, or functioning at your highest, it's time to become more discerning about the influences around you. Nature abhors a vacuum. Clearing away that which is no longer serving us is an important healing ritual for eliminating toxic energy at all levels of our being. Healing Ritual #2: Create sacred space. We live in an energetic universe, and we are each extensions of the nonphysical energy that both created and sustains us. You may not be consciously aware of this connection, but your alignment with your source is at the basis of every exalted or inspired moment. It is the basis of joy, of radiant health, and of unbounded energy. Creating sacred space is a powerful healing ritual used to welcome a higher frequency of energy into your life. The space you create can be tangible - like dedicating a portion of your home as a retreat to restore your alignment. Fill this space with things that center and recharge you, such as candles, crystals, pictures, or plants. Sacred space can also be something you create on a subtle or intangible level. For example, you can play uplifting music. You might open all the windows of your home occasionally and allow the fresh breeze to sweep through. You can also smudge your home with sage, frankincense or lavender and allow the aroma to raise the vibration. Dance, sing, or tone to imbue your space with joy. The healing ritual of creating sacred space raises the frequency of your home, which raises your personal vibration as well. Healing Ritual #3: Deliberately invite in the quality of energy you now wish to reside in. As human beings, we are constantly growing, evolving and expanding. And this naturally means that our desires are also in a state of constant evolution. What brings you joy today may be quite different than what brought you joy 5 years or even 5 months ago. With this in mind, perform the healing ritual of inviting in the energy that you now wish to reside in. I recommend visiting each room of your home and asking yourself gently, \"what quality of energy do I want to emanate from this space?\" And you'll find that you naturally crave a different quality of energy for each living space. For example, you may choose a vibe of clarity, efficiency or creativity for your home office. Vibrancy and vitality may be the frequency you desire to feel when you step into your kitchen. And your bedroom may call for a different mood entirely, depending on what you desire at this particular time in your life. Know that you are an energetic being - quite literally an energy transmitter and receiver - and you have the ability to change the frequency of any space you enter. Simply identify the quality of energy you desire, and call it to and through you. Invite in the energy of serenity, of productivity, of inspiration, and feel it anchoring through you and into the room you're in. To take this healing ritual one step further, you can ask yourself for a physical object that reflects the quality of energy you desire. For example, rose quartz is used in Feng Shui as a symbol of romance and love. Purging outworn objects, creating sacred space, and deliberately anchoring high-flying energy into your home are all powerful healing rituals. Apply these in your living spaces, and your home will become a perfect match to all you desire to create.
