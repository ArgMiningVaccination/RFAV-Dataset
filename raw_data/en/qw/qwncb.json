The core is located within the [Institute of Biology Leiden](/en/science/biology) (IBL) of Leiden University and the Fytagoras facilities in the Sylvius Laboratory, for research and development of Chinese herbal medicine and natural compounds. New research directions in medicine will be focused on designing combination therapies or are based on natural product synergistic combinations. Using scientific methods to re-visit Chinese medicine, the LUECCM will promote discovery and understanding of the synergistic and opposing active principles of Chinese herbal medicine and natural compounds by combining scientific technology and novel biological insights. In addition, research on the history and anthropological and botanic aspects as diversity and systematics of traditional herbal medicines will be part of the route to understanding the practice and working mechanism of synergistic medicine of herbal origin. Mission Enhancing health promotion by investigation of synergistic and opposing active principles of (Chinese) medicinal natural compounds from plant origin.
