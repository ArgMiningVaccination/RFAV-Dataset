The creation of UltraSHOT began with the quest to create a concentrated energy supplement that would stand out among the rest -- one that is healthy AND actually delivers remarkable performance.* Vitamin Impact Many energy supplements and drinks list B-vitamins on their packaging, but how many B-vitamins? If you compare brands, you'll find most include 2, perhaps 3, B-vitamins in their ingredient list. Eniva UltraSHOT boasts 7 different B-vitamins in its formula. Why is this a big deal? Since B-vitamins work synergistically with each other to have maximum effect on the body, UltraSHOT is equipped with a full array of energy-producing and stress-fighting vitamins to make a real impact.* VITAMIN B-COMPLEX ADVANTAGE UltraSHOT contains a broad spectrum of B-Vitamins. These 7 different B-Vitamins provide a synergy of nutrients to work together to achieve enhanced energy and performance. One of the reasons you don't get sustained energy from other products is because they are missing the full B-vitamin mix!

Mineral Balance Another unique feature of UltraSHOT is its proprietary liquid mineral blend. The minerals Chromium, Manganese and Vanadium are selected specifically for their support of cellular energy and blood sugar health.* The body burns food, fats and nutrients (fuel) and creates energy in this process. The role of aiding in the metabolism of fat and carbohydrates as well as supporting blood sugar health is significant when it comes to helping re-energize the body. * When the body undergoes stress, it needs to repair, recover and prepare for the next round of exertion. The minerals in UltraSHOT help restore needed nutrients and help regulate blood sugar levels.** ANTIOXIDENT STRENGTH UltraSHOT has the antioxidant equivalent of 2 servings of fresh fruits & vegetables Enhance energy levels and increase stamina* Mental clarity and well-being* 12 DIFFERENT FRUITS/VEGGIES PLUS Carrot Pumpkin Exotic Herbals Extensive research supports the use of botanicals to enhance and support vitality in the body.* This is why you see more and more energy drinks include herbal components for enhanced benefit.
