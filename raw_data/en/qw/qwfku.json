This is one of the ways we might be able to find our way back to one another.\" (Rhode Island Monthly, Sep 19, 2022) Community announcements Sep 5, 2023 Campus update: MOU with the City of Providence Dear students, faculty and staff, I am pleased to update you today on plans RISD and other area colleges and universities have been making with Mayor Brett Smiley for how we will continue to support the City of Providence in the years ahead. In 2003 RISD, Brown University, Johnson & Wales University and Providence College created a 20-year agreement to collectively support the city through voluntary payments in addition to many other financial and in-kind ways our institutions contribute to Providence. To learn about RISD's specific contributions, please see our 2022 economic impact fact sheet. With the 2003 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) expiring this year, we have worked collaboratively with the Mayor's Office and our neighboring institutions of higher education to create a new 20-year agreement that includes voluntary financial payments and other contributions to the city. This proposal will be introduced at the Providence City Council's meeting this week, and we are hopeful that it will be quickly approved. In the proposed agreement, RISD will make annual payments to the city, which start at $600,000 in FY24 and increase by a small percentage (which is in the process of being determined) over the course of the agreement. While our 2003 agreement directed our contributions to a general fund, the payments in our new agreement go to five specific areas that we feel are important priorities to support: - Pre-K-12 education - Equity, diversity and inclusion - Community safety and well-being - Promotion of the city of Providence as a safe, vibrant and inviting place to live, work and learn - Climate change and resiliency and adaptation infrastructure and policy Our annual payments in this new MOU are an increase from our 2003 MOU. Given RISD's current financial challenges, this is not an easy commitment for us to make, but we believe it is the right thing to do to support Providence. We have accounted for it in our current budget projection, which I outlined in my email last week. The MOU also recognizes the broad range of ways RISD has contributed and will continue to contribute to Providence in addition to annual payments. This includes, for example, paying taxes on RISD properties we lease to other tenants, generating jobs as one of Providence's top 20 employers, attracting residents and visitors to Providence who contribute to the local economy, maintaining the city-owned riverwalk area at RISD's expense, providing Public Safety detail during select city event, hosting thousands of K-12 students at the RISD Museum for free education programs and providing art education and mentoring for hundreds of Providence teens through Project Open Door. As a place-based institution, we believe these are important commitments for RISD to make. RISD and its many faculty, staff, students and alumni who live in Providence help foster the city's creative ecosystem and anchor the local economy, playing a critical role in the city's continued growth, success and financial sustainability. When Providence thrives, we all do. Sincerely, David Rosati (he/ him) Senior Vice President, Finance & Administration Aug 31, 2023 Campus update: FY24 budget projection Dear RISD Community, It has been a pleasure learning about RISD and meeting many of you since I joined the institution in May. I'm looking forward to more opportunities to do so as the academic year gets underway. Today, as a follow-up to President Williams' June 20 campus communication that in part addressed our forecasted budget deficit, I am writing to provide additional information regarding the FY24 budget, which began on July 1. As President Williams shared in June, we have a smaller enrollment this year than last (due largely\u2014but not solely\u2014to the end of the COVID-related enrollment spike and not hitting our graduate and transfer student enrollment goals). In addition, we are a tuition-dependent school facing the same inflationary pressures as other institutions. Due to the combination of these factors, we are currently projecting an operating deficit of approximately $1.6 million for FY24. This is an improvement from the original deficit projection of $3.9 million and was primarily achieved through the discretionary budget cuts outlined in President Williams' February 28 communication. While we have made significant progress in reducing the deficit, we will need to continue working to address it. I will be back in touch with more information as it becomes available. In the meantime, I will continue to work closely with campus leaders to identify additional ways to reduce our operating costs while retaining RISD's uniqueness and continuing to provide an exceptional education. One of the pathways towards better fiscal health is consultation and education. So, in the coming months we will be asking colleagues who hold expertise in various areas of our institution's operations to participate in discussions and provide input on our efforts. In addition, throughout the year ahead I plan to meet with various groups to communicate about our budget process and provide opportunities for discussion. I am looking forward to connecting with as many members of our community as I can, and I hope you will share your ideas and feedback with me. Looking ahead at how we strengthen our long-term financial sustainability, this year our Financial Optimization Initiative will examine how we can best maximize our limited resources, decrease expenses and identify ways to increase revenues in support of our mission. As always, our focus remains on providing an exceptional experience for our students while keeping tuition rates as low as possible and increasing financial aid as much as possible. Thank you for your help as we collectively continue to address our financial realities. I wish you a wonderful start to the semester. Sincerely, David Rosati (he/him) Senior Vice President, Finance & Administration Sep 6, 2023 Welcoming a new year and new community members Dear Community, RISD's 146th academic year is upon us, and I am excited to welcome the class of 2027, our returning community members, and RISD's new staff, faculty, and senior leaders to our community! Over the past few weeks, campus has been a cacophony of back-to-school activity\u2014Resident Assistants zipping around campus preparing for returning students, residence hall move-ins, studio set-ups, supply shopping, Providence exploring\u2014and hopefully some friend-making, too. It is exciting to witness the joy, passion and enthusiasm displayed by RISD students, staff and faculty as we prepare for classes and studios to begin. Our community members hail from 60 countries across the globe and represent an extraordinary range of diversity of identities, backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints. As I've said before, I believe that our differences stimulate deeper and more complex thinking, learning, and creativity. Embracing our differences and willingly engaging each other with grace and empathy\u2014even when it is difficult or uncomfortable\u2014supports our ongoing work of building the kind of institution of which we are proud to be a part. Through our collective efforts, I hope we can begin to manifest a reality where RISD is a place where all of us feel we have the opportunity to thrive. Toward that end, I look forward to making progress this semester on several key community and culture initiatives: - The Community and Culture Survey will launch later this month. I hope you will candidly share your experiences and suggestions to improve our campus culture. - The Holistic Student Wellness Initiative will commence in earnest as we nominate two student leaders to serve on the committee. This work will center RISD's students' whole-person experience and make recommendations to ensure that our work and institution is optimally designed and focused on ensuring that all students can thrive. - The Financial Optimization Initiative will continue identifying inefficiencies and opportunities to strengthen our institution's long-term sustainability by making recommendations for maximizing our limited resources. To stay informed of these initiatives and other campus news and updates, I encourage you to read monthly newsletters from my office (News & Notes) and others. Stay connected by following our social media channels (such as @risd1877 on Instagram) and my Instagram, where I have a lot of fun sharing some of my adventures around campus and out in the world, especially when I'm meeting and visiting with RISD alumni, parents, and friends! I wish you a joy-filled and purposeful start to the year. I look forward to running into you around campus.
