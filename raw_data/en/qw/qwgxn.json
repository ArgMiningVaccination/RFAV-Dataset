At least of nonmedical therapy was used by/on 264 (66%), two-this of which was religious. Most respondents perceived benefit (e.g., group prayer, 95%; religious articles, 81%; chiropractic, 69%). Only 17 (4.2%) invested over $200 lifetime (minimal compared with medical costs). These treatments, apparently used by most patients/families, rarely interfered with medical care. Physician openness and empathy toward patients' beliefs might enhance rapport and facilitate discussion of possible helpful or adverse effects of nonmedical treatment. This book is the result of many minds, hearts, and souls who have shared a vision of healing with me. It would not exist without them. It began when Lance Sholdt, then at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, asked if I would work with him to put together a course in complementary and alternative medicine for the medical students. His careful construction of this course helped us outline the contents of the book. This book is the brainchild of Jeff Levin. He was the first to suggest that a textbook like this was needed and could be written. His heartfelt work and attention to detail kept things moving when I was bogged down. Janette Carlucci is the soul of the book, managing both the special features and the day-to-day contact with the many authors. To her, a special thanks on this journey. Ron Chez provided a much needed balance for the book. He was always ready and willing to assist with a critical eye and keep us anchored to how this book could be of benefit for patients. I would also like to thank the editors, Jane Velker, Beth Goldner, and Joyce Murphy, for understanding the complexity of the topic and for a commitment to quality over deadlines. And Tim Hiscock for finally saying that we were going to press\u2014 ready or not. I would just as soon have worked another three years on it as finish.
