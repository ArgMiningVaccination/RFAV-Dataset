The Top 12 DIY Ayurvedic and Natural Beauty Care Ingredients for the Skin - are easily available in your kitchen, your local grocery store or some even in your garden. Most of them are globally available in dried or whole form. Neem and Tulsi are mostly available dry in many countries. I will be explaining why the 12 ingredients are essential for skin care and how or when to use them. I will share more recipes in future blogs. - Neem: A super herb that is bitter and has amazing benefit on the skin. Neem is anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial. Neem can be found in various forms - whole fresh leaves, dried leaves/tea, neem juice, neem powder, neem oil and neem water. Neem is an effective remedy against blackheads, whiteheads, acne, scars, pigmentation and large pores. Neem is amazing for strong hair and fights against dandruff and dry scalp. Use branches from the neem tree as a natural toothbrush and neem powder as a natural tooth powder. Neem water can be used as a facial toner and neem oil can be used for dry skin especially for eczema. Neem oil is also used for nail fungus, ringworm and athlete's foot. Neem juice or tea or capsule can work internally to purify and cleanse the blood. Neem also has anti-aging benefits. You can make a face mask using neem powder and turmeric with yogurt, honey or aloe vera to achieve a glowing skin. Neem is an amazing deodorizer therefore I have used it in my [Herbal Deodorant product](https://conscioushealth.net/product/ayurvedic-herbal-deodorant/). - Turmeric: Another top super herb that is globally known and available in fresh or dried form. Fresh turmeric is less heating and therefore great for making herbal teas or light juicing diluted with water. Dried turmeric can be heating for Pitta individuals and is best taken cooked with food or milk/yogurt. Turmeric reduces inflammation, clears acne, pimples rosacea, eczema, promotes fairness of the skin, reduces wrinkles/skin pigmentation, removes dead skin and is anti-aging. Turmeric is high in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial. Some also claim that turmeric is amazing in reducing unwanted facial hair. Check out my blog for a [coconut oil and turmeric facemask recipe](https://conscioushealth.net/coconut-oil-and-turmeric-face-mask/)I usually purchase organic turmeric for any such recipes but ensure I use a pinch or small amount of turmeric for face masks or scrubs. - Tulsi or Holy Basil: Tulsi is an amazing natural beauty product as well as being one of the best medicinal herbs. Tulsi is available fresh, dried (tea), powder and capsule form. Tulsi is rich in antioxidant and contains antibacterial, antiviral, adaptogenic, antiseptic and immune enhancing properties.Tulsi or Holy Basil is known as one of the \"elixirs of life.\" Tulsi leaf juice and powder can prevent spreading of acne and pimples, tightens skin pores, relieves skin irritation or rashes, reduce stretch marks, scars, anti-aging, reduces skin inflammation and increases glow of the skin. Tulsi is also known reduce the chances of skin infection and ringworms. In South Asian countries making a paste or poultice with Tulsi leaves for wounds, cuts and burns is very common. Drink Tulsi tea for glowing skin, use Tulsi powder in face or hair mask and take Tulsi capsule to reduce stress and anxiety which also has a negative impact on skin. - Aloe Vera: Aloe Vera plant is kept in many homes globally as the benefits of Aloe is nearly endless. It is also popularly known as the \"plant of immortality.\"The inner fillet or aloe gel has number of skin benefits such as prevention of aging, natural skin moisturizer, reduction of acne, pimples and dark spots, prevention from sunburn, reduction of stretch marks and combating insect bites. Aloe vera nourishes the skin from inside out. Therefore intake of aloe juice is just as much beneficial as using it externally. My mother takes aloe juice nearly every day and encourages keeping an aloe plant at home. Like neem leaves, aloe also purifies the body and aids the liver. Aloe also helps with mild cuts, insect bites, poison ivy and eczema. - Chickpea Flour: Also known as gram flour or besan is extremely popular as a natural beauty care product in South Asian countries. It works as one of the best exfoliator for skin. Chickpea flour brightens the skin (increases fairness) of face, arms and neck area, reduces oiliness, and reduces tan (sun tan), fight acne and pimples as well as known to reduce unwanted facial hair along with turmeric. Buy organic chickpea flour (if possible) to use on the skin. The Conscious Health [Turmeric Face Scrub](https://conscioushealth.net/product/ayurvedic-herbal-facemask-with-turmeric-and-rose/)contains chickpea flour as the base. After applying this product on the face, arm or neck, let it dry and then brush it off with your finger like any other exfoliator. You can also try using ripe papaya, turmeric and chickpea as a face mask. Chickpea is known for removing dry skin. Chickpea flour or besan mixed with turmeric and neem can reduce scars from acne, fight dry/flaky skin as well as oily skin (add yogurt for oily skin) and reduce blemishes. - Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth): Multani mittiis popularly used in South Asian countries as an antiseptic as well as a beautifying ingredient to reduce skin issues and attain radiant, blemish-free skin. Women have used Multani mitti to clean, exfoliate and nourish their skin as well as to reduce acne, pimples, remove excess sebum/oil from skin, reduce dark circle, brighten skin, reduce tanning, pigmentation, prevent sunburn, treat rashes, insect bites, and to keep blackheads, whiteheads away. The active ingredients in Multani Mitti can effectively absorb excess skin oil, dirt, and dead skin, leaving the skin soft. I mix it with aloe vera, rose water, milk, yogurt or glycerin and apply it on my face as a mask. - Milk: Milk, preferably raw or organic milk is a natural cleanser as well as a moisturizer that softens the skin. Milk contains many nutrients and protein that is crucial for supple skin. Milk contains AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid) which helps to slow down aging. Combined with oatmeal and honey, milk can be used as a facial mask. Milk can lighten blemishes, dark spots, brighten the skin, reduce pore size, reduces acne scars, fine lines and wrinkles. Many use dried milk powder in their bath to make the skin soft and supple. Add 1 or 2 drops of Jasmine or Rose essential oil or even rose water to make a luxurious bath for yourself. - Yogurt: Yogurt, especially organic, unflavoured and high in active cultures (probiotics) is an amazing skin exfoliator and a moisturizer. Like milk, yogurt also contains AHA that helps to keep a soft and smooth skin. Yogurt contains B vitamins, Zinc, Calcium, Protein, Lactic Acid (AHA) and probiotics that makes it a nutrient dense ingredient for skin care. Yogurt assists with maintaining smaller pores, brighter skin, reduce acne, fine lines and wrinkles. The B vitamins in the yogurt can help with skin regeneration and fade out blemishes, dark circles, and sun damage and reduce skin infections. Mixed with chickpea and honey, yogurt makes one of the best homemade face masks. - Rose Water: Amazing addition to DIY homemade beauty recipes for skin, rose water is the best remedy for Pitta skin types or those who suffer from any skin inflammation. It reduces redness, Rosacea, acne, dermatitis and eczema. It is cooling and maintains the pH balance of the skin, therefore assists those who suffer from irritated skin. Rose water contains anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and anti-bacterial properties and is rich in antioxidants. It is a great cleanser and due to its astringent properties it is also a great toner. Rose water aids in removing excess oil/sebum, dead skins, reduces skin of aging, puffiness in the eyes, impurities, and dirt accumulated in clogged pores. The aroma from rose water can uplift mood. Rose water is a natural make up remover. Antioxidants in rose water reduce wrinkles, tighten the skin and promote regeneration of skin tissues. - Papaya: A favourite in my family - papaya is rich in enzymes (papain) and protein (Arginine) that is absolutely amazing for the skin. Papaya is used as a face mask for increase in fairness of the skin and/or reduce tanning. Papaya is known for its anti-aging properties and promotes skin repair, exfoliation and hydration. Papaya repairs damaged skin (especially due to pollution, smoke, chemicals and excessive fried foods), skin pigmentation and removes dead skin. It is rich in antioxidants such as Vitamin A and C and minerals such as iron, potassium, copper, phosphorus, manganese, calcium and magnesium. Ripe papaya is a great moisturizer and can be used in scars, wounds, and minor burns. Paste made from ripe papaya can be used as a facemask. - Almond Oil: Organic, cold pressed and extra virgin almond oil is a great skin food. However look for the sweet almond oil as it comes from the edible almonds. Almond oil contains generous amount of fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acid), Vitamin A, D, E and B, protein and essential minerals such as zinc. Almond oil has been used in various anti-aging products for its ability to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, it also eases irritation and skin inflammation, prevents dry, flaky skin, preserves skin glow and makes skin soft and smooth. It is used to remove dark circles, dead skin, and impurities. Almond oil is perfect for using as a base for eczema, psoriasis cream and lip balms (as it treats chapped lips). Like rosewater, almond oil also helps as a natural make up remover. - Honey: Honey is the Universe's gift for the skin. Honey contains anti-aging, antioxidant, anti-bacterial and anti-microbial properties. Honey is rich in protein and various nutrients. Honey is a natural moisturizer and cleanser for the skin. It has the ability to absorb and retain moisture. Honey natural protects the skin from sun damage, supports skin regeneration, improves skin complexion, makes skin smooth, prevents dry skin, and reduces the chances of acne. Honey can absorb dirt, dead skin and other impurities from the skin pores. Honey is used as face masks, facial scrubs and in lip balms. In Ayurveda honey is used along with ghee to treat wounds and burns. It is said that Amla (Ayurvedic rejuvenating herb) with honey is a powerful treatment for various skin conditions. My mother in law makes a facemask using Manuka honey for her glowing skin.
