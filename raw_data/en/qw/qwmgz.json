FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The invention relates to compounds useful for inhib \u00ad iting hepatitis C virus (\"HCV \") \u00ad tions of the non-structural 5B (\"NS5B \") protein of HCV. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is a mem \u00ad ber of the Flaviviridae family. The virus shows extensive genetic heterogeneity as there are currently seven identified genotypes and more than 50 identified subtypes. In HCV infected cells, viral RNA is translated into a polyprotein that is cleaved into ten individual proteins. At the amino terminus are structural proteins: the core (C) protein and the envelope glycoproteins, El and E2. p7, an integral membrane protein, follows El and E2. Additionally, there are six non-structural proteins, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B, which play a functional role in the HCV life cycle, (see, for example, B. D. Lindenbach and C. M. Rice, Nature. 436:933-938, 2005). NS5B is the RNA polymerase or replicase of the virus and is responsible for replication of both positive and nega \u00ad tive-strand genomic RNA during the viral replicative cycle. NS5B plays an essential and critical role in viral replication, and a functional NS5B replicase is required for HCV Thus, inhibition of NS5B RNA-depen- dent polymerase activity is believed to be an effective way of treating HCV infection. [0004] Infection by HCV is a serious health issue. It is estimated that 170 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HCV. HCV infection can lead to chronic hepa \u00ad titis, cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic HCV infection is thus a major worldwide cause of liver-related premature mortality. [0005] The current standard of care treatment regimen for HCV infection involves interferon-alpha, alone, or in combi \u00ad nation with ribavirin and a protease inhibtor. The treatment is cumbersome and sometimes has debilitating and severe side effects and many patients do not durably respond to treat \u00ad ment. New and effective methods of treating HCV infection are urgently needed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] Essential functions of the NS5B protein in HCV replication make it an attractive intervention target for treat \u00ad ing HCV infection.

General Synthesis [0216] The compounds of the invention may be prepared by a variety of synthetic routes, samples of which are illustrated in the synthetic schemes outlined below. In general, the syn\u00ad thesis starts with constructing the central scaffolds such as benzofuran, benzothiophene, imidazopyridine or pyrazol- opyridine by employing various synthetic techniques known to those skilled in the art. (e.g. in Heterocyclic Chemistry, J. A. Joule and K. Mills, J Wiley and Sons, 2010.). Once the properly substituted cores are made, further functional group manipulations including but not limited to chain elongation, amidation, esterification, cyclization are performed as neces \u00ad sary to lead to the taiget molecules. When being allowed chemically and in some cases necessary, the central cores may preferably be introduced toward the end of the synthesis . Often, protection-deprotection and, in some cases, orthogo \u00ad nal protection-deprotection strategies are required to accom \u00ad plish the desired transformation. More comprehensive descriptions of these synthetic methodologies and techniques can be in found in these and other references: Comprehensive Organic Transformations, R. C. Larock Ed., Wiley-RCH, 1999. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Yd ed. J Willey and Sons, 1999.

Mass spectrometry results are reported as the ratio of mass over charge, followed by the relative abundance of each ion (in parentheses) or a single m/z value for the M+H (or, as noted, M-H) ion containing the most common atomic iso\u00ad topes. Isotope patterns correspond to the expected formula in all cases. Normally the analyte was dissolved in methanol at 0.1 mg/mL and 5 microliter was infused with the delivery solvent into the mass spectrometer, which scanned from 100 to 1500 daltons. All compounds could be analyzed in the positive ESI mode, using an acetonitrile/water gradient (10%-90%) acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid as delivery solvent. The compounds provided below could also be analyzed in the negative ESI mode, using 2 mM NH4OAc in acetonitrile/water as delivery solvent. Enantiomeric purity was determined using a Hewlett-Packard Series 1050 system equipped with a chiral HLPC column 5:95 isopropanol- hexane as mobile phase. [0291] The compounds were named using the ChemDraw program from Cambridge Soft Inc. [0292] Scheme A describes a general approach to building fused rings with different sizes that are attached to benzazole moieties along with some chemical transformations on these fused rings. Reduction of NO2 substituted benzazole A-I , followed by sulfonylation gives A-3, upon which is installed a substituted terminal alkyne to afford A-5. A [Pd]-mediated ring cyclization (Heck reaction) forms A-6. Alternatively, A-6 can be prepared using A-I as a starting material for the Heck reaction. Hydrogenation of A-6 generates A-8, which can also be obtained from A-10 by hydrogenation. A-10 can be con\u00ad verted from A-6 through an isomerization. Cleavage of the double bond of A-6 using conditions such as onzonolysis gives A-9, which can be readily converted into A-Il to A-21 following typical reduction, -alkylation, O-alkylation, elimination, and/or hydrogenation conditions.

US 2012/0251497 Al 327Oct. 4, 2012 This group includes the compounds identified in Appendix A includes those compounds that have a measured EC50 of between 10 and 100 nM, and includes compounds identified in Appendix A Provided herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more compounds of the invention. The compounds described herein may be formulated in a pharma \u00ad ceutical composition comprising one or more compounds, optionally together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or vehicles, and optionally other thera \u00ad peutic and/or prophylactic ingredients. Such excipients are known to those of skill in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used in the compositions of the present invention and include, for example, mineral acid salts such as hydro \u00ad chlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates, sulfates and the like; acids such as acetates, propionates, malonates, benzoates and the like. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and salts is available in Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition (Eas \u00ad ton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Company, 1990), and in Elandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 6tA Edition, Ed. R. C. Rowe, P J. Sheskey, and . E. Quinn (American Pharmacists Asso \u00ad ciation, 2009). [0957] Depending on the intended mode of administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of solid, semi-solid or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tab\u00ad lets, suppositories, pills, capsules, powders, liquids, suspen \u00ad sions, creams, ointments, lotions orthe like, preferably in unit dosage form suitable for single administration of a precise dosage. The compositions will include an effective amount of the selected drug in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, in addition, may include other phar \u00ad maceutical agents, adjuvants, diluents, \u00ad cal composition includes isomers, racemic or isomers, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and optionally other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients. [0959] For solid compositions, conventional nontoxic solid carriers include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of man \u00adnitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talc, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate and the like. [0960] For oral administration, the composition will gen\u00ad erally take the form of a tablet, capsule, a softgel capsule nonaqueous solution, suspension or syrup. Tablets and cap\u00ad sules are preferred oral administration forms. Tablets and capsules for oral use will generally include one or more commonly used carriers such as lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. When liquid suspensions are used, the active agent may be combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, flavoring, coloring and/or sweetening agents may be added as well. Other optional components for incorporation into an oral formulation herein include, but are not limited to, preservatives, suspending agents, thickening agents and the like. [0961] In yet another aspect, provided herein is the use of the compounds of the invention in the manufacture of a medi \u00ad cament, e.g., for the treatment of hepatitis C. [0962] Also provided is a method of treating hepatitis C. The method comprises administering to a subject in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, optionally contained in a pharmaceutical com\u00ad position. A pharmaceutically or therapeutically effective amount of the composition will be delivered to the subject. Theprecise effective amount will vary from subject to subject and will depend upon the species, age, the subject 's size and health, the nature and extent of the condition being treated, recommendations of the treating physician, and the therapeu \u00ad tics or combination of therapeutics selected for administra \u00ad tion. Thus, the effective amount for a given situation can be determined and optimized by routine experimentation. The subject may be administered as many doses as is required to reduce and/or alleviate the signs, symptoms or causes of the disorder in question, or bring about any other desired alter \u00ad ation of a biological system. One of ordinary skill in the art of treating such diseases will be able, without undue experimen \u00ad tation and in reliance upon personal knowledge and the dis\u00ad closure of this application, to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of this invention for a given disease. [0963] A treatment regimen using one or more of the com\u00ad pounds provided herein, optionally in combination with one or more anti-HCV agents, will generally involve administer \u00ad ing a therapeutically effective dose of the compound, which can readily be determined by one skilled in the art taken into account variables as previously described. A typical dose of a compound as provided herein will generally range from about 10 mg to 1000 mg a day. Representative dosage ranges include from about 10 mg to 900 mg a day, or from about 30 mg to about 700 mg a day, from about 50 mg to about 600 mg a day. A therapeutically effective dosage amount will typi\u00ad cally range from 0.1 mg/kg body weight to about 30 mg/kg body weight, or from about 0.1 mg/kg body weight to about 15 mg/kg body weight. The compound may be administered once or multiple times (two to three times) daily, once a week, twice a week, three times a week, etc., over a time course effective to achieve a positive virologic response. Represen \u00ad tative courses of treatment include but are not limited to 10 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, 48 weeks, and the like. A positive virologic response generally refers to undetectable HCV RNA in serum as measured by PCR and a biochemical response (normalization of aminotransferase levels). US 2012/0251497 Al 328Oct. 4, 2012 Although one may gauge success of treatment by a histologic response (e.g., pathology of liver biopsy), post-treatment biopsies are generally less preferable to an assessment based upon a virologic response. [0964] Generally, treatment by administering a compound as provided herein is effective to result in at least a 2 log reduction in HCV RNA levels over the course of treatment. In some cases HCV RNA will still remain positive (detectable) after a course of treatment, although ideally, treatment is effective to achieve undetectable HCV RNA after completing a round of therapy. Subjects may also be assessed following completion of therapy to confirm maintenance of a positive and sustained virologic response (undetectable HCV RNA levels). Follow-up assessments may be carried out over the course of months or even years following treatment. CombinationTherapy [0965] The compounds of the present invention and their isomeric forms and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are useful in treating and preventing HCV infection alone or when used in combination with other compounds targeting viral or cellular elements or functions involved in the HCV life cycle. Classes of compounds useful in the invention may include, without limitation, all classes of HCV antivirals, both therapies, mecha \u00ad nistic classes of agents that may be useful when combined with the compounds of the present invention include, for example, nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors of \u00ad tors, NS4B and medicinal agents that functionally inhibit the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), other NS5B inhibitors and other medicaments that inhibit HCV cell attachment or virus entry, HCV RNA translation, HCV RNA transcription, replication or HCV maturation, assembly or virus release. [0966] Specific compounds in these classes and useful in the invention include, but are not limited to, linear, macrocy- clic, and polymerase (replicase) inhibitors useful in the invention include, but are not otide analogs and HCV inhibitors including, but not limited to, those derived from 2'-C-methyl modified nucleos(t)ides, 4'-aza modified nucleos(t)ides, and 7'-deaza modified nucleos (t)ides. NS5A inhibitors useful in the invention, include, but inhibitors useful in the invention, include, but are not present inventioninclude BIT-225 and other P7 inhibitors, as well as HCV NS4B inhibitors including but not limited to histamine agents that antagonize HCV NS4B function. [0967] In addition, NS5B inhibitors of the present inven \u00ad tion may be used in combination with cyclophyllin antagonists (eg, without limitation, DEBIO compounds, NM-811, SCY-635, EP-CyP282, as well as cyclosporine and its derivatives), kinase inhibitors, inhibitors of heat shock proteins (e.g., HSP90 andHSP70), other immu \u00ad nomodulatory (PEGIntron), pegylated IFN-a-conl and the like; long act\u00ad ing formulations and derivatizations of interferon compounds such as the albumin-fused interferon, Albuferon Locteron and the like; interferons with various of controlled delivery systems (e.g. ITCA-638, omega-inter \u00ad feron delivered by the DUROS subcutaneous delivery sys\u00ad tem); compounds that stimulate the synthesis of interferon in cells, such as resiquimod and the like; interleukins; com\u00ad pounds that enhance the development of type I helper T cell response, such as SCV-07 and like and prophy \u00ad lactic such as GI-5005, TG-4040, InnoVac C, HCV E1E2/MF59 and the like. In addition, any of the above-described methods involving administering an NS5B inhibitor, a Type I interferon receptor agonist (e.g., an IFN-) and a Type H interferon receptor agonist (e.g., an IFN-) can be augmented by administration of an effective amount of a TNF-a antagonist. Exemplary, non-limiting TNF-a antagonists that are suitable for in such tion therapies include ENBREL, REMICADE and HUMIRA. [0968] NS5B inhibitors of the present invention may also be used with alternative forms of interferons and pegylated interferons, ribavirin or its analogs (e.g., ron), microRNA, small interfering RNA compounds (e.g., SIRPLEX-140-N and the like) and microRNA agents (such as micro-RNA-122), hepatoprotectants, agents and other direct and indirect inhibitors of HCV replication.

[0970] Additionally, inter \u00ad feron, may be administered as multiple combination therapy with at least one of the compounds of the present invention. The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned classes or compounds and contemplates known and new com\u00ad pounds and combinations of biologically active agents (see, for example, Klebl et al. \"Host cell targets in HCV therapy: novel strategy or proven practice, Antiviral Chemistry & Che\u00ad motherapy 16:69-90, which is incorporated by reference herein). It is intended that combination therapies of the present invention include any chemically compatible combi \u00ad nation of a compound of this inventive group with other compounds of the inventive group or other compounds out\u00ad side of the inventive group, as long as the combination does not eliminate the anti-viral activity of the compound of this inventive group or the anti-viral activity of the pharmaceuti \u00ad cal composition itself. [0971] Combination therapy can be sequential, that is treat \u00ad ment with one agent first and then a second agent (forexample, where each treatment comprises a different com\u00ad pound of the invention or where one treatment comprises a compound of the invention and the other comprises one or more biologically active agents) or it can be treatment with both agents at the same time (concurrently). Sequential therapy can include a reasonable time after the completion of the first therapy before beginning the second therapy. Treat \u00ad ment with both agents at the same time can be in the same daily dose or in separate doses. The dosages for both concur \u00ad rent and sequential combination therapy will depend on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion rates of the components of the combination therapy as well as other factors known to one of skill in the art. Dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens and schedules may be adjusted over time according to the individual 's need.
