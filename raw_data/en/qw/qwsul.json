Many of the aspects (carpeting, walls, bathrooms, all fixtures) are fresh, new and very clean. On the Plus Side: The activities have been great. My parents have been getting involved with lots of different activities such as exercising, bingo, blackjack, etc. The food has been good for all of our visits, but my parents have said that a couple times they had to send food back. My dad gets his daily ice cream, so he is mostly happy. The laundry and housekeeping team is great. Two girls come by each week to change the sheets and take their laundry. The transportation has been working out well. They are getting rides to appointments when necessary. My sister grumbles at the work in trying to figure out issues (the bill, the Internet/WiFi) but she has so much freedom now and has had a great relief of the daily stress of taking care of my parents. The medical staff on the floors have been great. My parents are not fully \"Assisted Living\" but the medical staff has come by and provided assistance. They have been extremely helpful. On the Minus Side: The financial people there are rather hopeless. My sister has been working with them every month for the first few months to straighten out every bill. They have been doing things that are so wrong that a child could see their error. I think my sister finally talked to the top local administrator and figured out their errors. I think things have been better for the past month. They must be counting on a bunch of mindless people that will just write them checks every month without understanding what the costs are. The WIFI networking in the building has had issues for months now. The cable-TV is just straight broadcast cable, so I encouraged my sister to set them up with a streaming service that offers more programming. The down side is that the WIFI is so horrible that they have a hard time using the streaming service and it keeps disconnecting and causing other issues. They need to get some networking people in there to resolve the issues. As for Personnel, it's a little mixed. [name removed], the \"salesperson\" that convinced us to sign up, was nice and supportive when we were deciding but I think she only came by once or twice after my parents moved in. We had a MorningStar person come by the house before my parents moved in to \"evaluate\" my parents for the level of care they would need. My parents are on an \"Assisted Living\" floor but they don't really need any assistance at this time but they are on the right floor \"to be ready\" when they do need assistance and so that they do not need to move when they transition to actual \"Assisted Living\". The lady doing the evaluation at one point said \"I don't even know what I am doing here if you don't need assistance\". A rather *outrageous* comment for someone that is an ambassador of the company. Although the facility is being re-worked, there are still Security and Safety issues. Someone came in from outside and was roaming the building. This was very alarming. I am not sure how they fixed this but to say Security is lax is an understatement. My sister was able to pull into the underground parking (gated) only to find she could not get out of the parking area and into the building. Phones and instructions there did *not* work. She was starting to panic and soon her only recourse would have been to pull the fire alarm. Not a very good solution to the problem. Overall, I would recommend MorningStar. We have communicated to them that we will all be better off if we have more residents to drive down the costs and make them more profitable and help keep the price increases down. My parent's floor only has about 3-4 apartments occupied out of about 50-ish apartments on the floor. The other floors seem to have a lot of activity and a lot of occupied rooms. If I did recommend MorningStar, I would warn anyone that the accounting is horrible and that they would need to examine every bill, line by line to understand what the charges are. I would warn them to NOT set up any kind of automatic payment and to manually write checks or manually send payments after receiving any bills. "}
