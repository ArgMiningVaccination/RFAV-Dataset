Requests for services that originate from extended family, friends, community clergy, hospital staff, or any other person must have patient or immediate family approval before services will be rendered. Philosophy of a St. Jude Chaplain - The Chaplain considers the patient and his or her family as individuals with personal value and belief systems, each being worthy of the love of God. - The Chaplain considers it his or her responsibility to advocate for each patient and family in allowing them to express their spiritual beliefs and practices, within the guidelines of the hospital policies and procedures, regardless of religious affiliation. - The Chaplain considers each patient and parent as individuals with the right to religious services including spiritual welfare, support, counsel, and visitation through the spiritual or religious ministry of their choice and at their request. - The Chaplain considers the surrounding religious community as being a valuable resource for providing spiritual care for the St. Jude patients and families. The Chaplain will attempt to help each patient or family to link to one of these resources upon their request. "}
