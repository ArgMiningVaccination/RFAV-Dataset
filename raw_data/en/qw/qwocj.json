The natural world has always fascinated her. As a scientist she became interested in biological systems and emergent properties. The idea that a whole is not the sum of its parts but rather the parts form new properties that emerge from the interaction of living systems shaped the way she saw the world. Always interested in medicine, she found modern medicine too restrictive in its reductionist approach of one treatment for all bodies. When she found Classical Chinese Medicine, it was like coming home. Christine began teaching in 2002 in Waldorf Education. She enjoys teaching students using pedagogy rooted in the natural world from a head, heart, and hands perspective of exploration. She uses the same approach in teaching Classical Chinese Medicine. Her studies and practice have been greatly shaped by the Huangdi Neijing, Anthroposophy, and Systems Biology. She has focused her medical practice on gynecology, fertility, and postpartum care; infant cranial musculoskeletal pain; and addiction recovery. She uses Acupuncture, Moxibustion, Chinese Herbs, Asian Body Work, Cranial Sacral Therapy, and Visceral Manipulation in treatments with patients. She has a private practice in NE Portland. "}
