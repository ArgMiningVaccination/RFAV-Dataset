Explain where responsibilities lie in relation to use of 'over the counter' remedies and supplements. Cultural and Traditonal Issues There are several cultural and traditional issues that can arise because Ella and her huband John have totally different ideas regarding treatment. \"Culture is also dynamic and adaptive. It attempts to maximize the potential for group success in the face of environmental challenges, and there remains today a tension in cultural groups between maintaining shared values and norms and adjusting to forces for change both within and outs:\" (Kreuter & McClure, 2004). Ella is in to alternative remedies and her husband is for traditional methods of treatment. This is a conflict of interest and being that Ella is weak she may leave decision making up to her family which will probably go against the wishes she originally set for herself. \"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), includes a wide range of approaches like herbal medicine, traditional therapies, mind-body intervention etc., and has gained its popularity worldwide in recent years. \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of Conventional Medicine \" (Jaiswal et. al, 2015). Chapter 1 1. The medical care facility should have had an interpreter there at the childbirth. I think it was absolutely ridiculous for Sherry to have to go through natural childbirth and have the incident with the air not being on as well. The doctors and nurses should have also been properly trained and more compassionate. Many years ago, an epileptic Hmong girl named Lia Lee entered a permanent vegetative state due to cross-cultural misunderstanding between her parents and her doctors. An author named Anne Fadiman documented this case and tried to untangle what exactly went wrong with the situation. Two key players in her narrative were Neil Ernst and Peggy Philp, the main doctors on Lia's case. As Fadiman describes, \"Neil and Peggy liked the Hmong, too, but they did not love them... [W]henever a patient crossed the compliance line, thus sabotaging their ability to be optimally effective doctors, cultural diversity ceased being a delicious spice and became a disagreeable obstacle.\" (Fadiman 265) At first glance, this statement seems to implicate Neil and Peggy as morally blameworthy for a failure to be culturally sensitive enough. However, upon further inspection of the rest of the book, it becomes clear that Neil and Peggy's failure to be more culturally sensitive to their Hmong patients was caused by structural issues in the American biomedical system. To prove this point, this paper will first present a background to Lia's case, then discuss possibilities for assigning blame to Neil and Peggy, then show evidence for the structural issues in American biomedicine, before finally concluding. One of the huge mistakes was that the medical profession did not value the family's beliefs and knowledge. Her family was aware of her condition, and they had alternative healing methods for Lia, however, the U.S. medical profession did not value these wishes. Instead, they performed multiple procedures on her that went against her family's beliefs (Fadiman 1997). BOOK In this chapter we get to see how Lia's fate has really taken a toll on her parents. We also see that the Lee's no longer feel like they can rely on the American medical system after what happened to Lia and instead they would use their own at home methods. Lia's pediatric neurologist also believed that the Lee's might have been right about Lia being affected from too much medication. After hearing this and looking at Lia's records, Neil and Peggy came to the realization that there should have treated her differently. This chapter really demonstrates the importance of culture and the need for doctors to be more accepting and understand of them. Unfortunately, there are doctors who are just not willing to comply. It is sad to see how much the Lee's had to suffer in order for people to open their eyes and it is even sadder that even with cases like this, there are doctors who still refuse to believe in anything outside their medical abilities. Grime 1 Carys Grime Professor Faber General Psychology April 21, 2015 Theory Paper Looking at Lamanda, a young, confused and troubled woman, one may find many issues that are present in her life. The psychodynamic, behavioral, humanistic, cognitive, biological, and sociocultural perspectives of psychology each have different concepts within them that can be used to define and find the root of these issues. By looking deeper into Lamanda's life, and applying these concepts and perspectives, a researcher can help her deduce what is causing her these problems, and understand Lamanda's complex situation. One is expected to precisely follow all medication directions and finish all the medication as prescribed. This was an issue when treating Lia Lee, though. Her parents thought that they could just change the prescription based on what they thought was right for their daughter. However, this was considered child abuse, which would require actions with the child protective services (Fadiman, 1997). Albeit, the American health care system strives to not just treat and prescribe medication but also \"involve satisfying the communication gap, interpersonal relationship, counselling and education regarding the disease,\" (Ganesh, A. & Ganesh, K., 2013, para. 1). In following this principle, several steps were taken to try to explain to Lia's parents that they need to give Lia exactly what the doctors had prescribed for her. One nurse even goes as far as drying on lines and suns or moons to indicate how much is to be given and what time during the day (Fadiman, 1997). With Lia's parents being so steadfast on their Hmong culture belief of self-medicating through the spirit, they refused on several occasions to give Lia medicines that they felt were unhealthy. After several methods of trying to explain the reasons as to why Lia should be given the medicine, the local MCMC doctors decided to transfer Lia so she could get the proper care within a larger, more specialized hospital. Often times the majority will even view the minority as a threat to society, illustrated in the history of the Hmong people- as they were kicked out of China due to of their inability to assimilate to the culture. The American doctors disagreed largely with the Hmong beliefs, and vise versa. In fact, even their approaches to medicine differ greatly; while American doctors take a targeted approach with the intention to treat, the Hmong people believe in a more holistic form of medicine (herbs and natural remedies), to prevent disease rather than treat it once it manifests. These misunderstandings caused both parties to question the other's effort and care towards Lia, and ended up being one of the reasons for her debilitating condition. Because of this, both cultures were misinterpreted in different The doctors did not try to understand the viewpoints of Nao Kao and Foua and instead reduced their thoughts and feelings to being inferior. Nao Kao and Foua did not understand what the doctors were doing to their child, let alone understand the instructions that the doctors were giving them. The doctors did not try to understand the Lee's culture and what they were going through. Instead, the doctors proceeded to help Lia in the way that they saw fit. Western medical practices were more invasive than Nao Kao and Foua were accustomed to. I was angry with the Lee's about the treatment that they were receiving from the doctors. There was no communication with Nao Kao and Foua. When Child Protection Services were brought in and Lia was taken away from Nao Kao and Foua I was astounded. I did not understand why Lia's doctors believed that Child Protection Services was necessary. It seemed that if the doctors had taken the time to listen to Nao Kao and Foua about their concerns and not just rely on interpreters to give them information one way, everything would be fine. However, I realized that child abuse and neglect was much more complicated than I had It is sad let alone close to child neglect to allow our 8-year-old son to be forced to walk across the hot Law Enforcement Center asphalt parking lot barefoot with a nickel size wound in Dillan's left heel. It is very disappointing to allow our son to be the victim of an obviously spiteful reaction to a request to replace the \"Croc\" sandals that were purchased while on my parenting time and lost on Adam's parenting time. I purchased two pair of flip flops last night at Wal-Mart for $0.98 each that were similar to the pair Dillan wore home after his Crocs\" were consumed by the lake on Adam's parenting time. It is completely inappropriate to allow Dillan to be injured or to especially allow his new wound open to infection due to a petty footwear On 02/26/2016 client Gregory Spencer came to the SSO for a House Meeting with HS De La Torre. The purpose of the meeting was to develp a Housing Plan and explore other possible housing opportunities. In Chapter 9 we were able to grasp that the Lee's finally began to grasp the concept of keeping Lia current on all prescribed medication. This story in the first 9 chapters talked about the Lee's non compliance. Working in the hospital there was always people who did not follow Once discovering that the Lees are illiterate, it should be obvious that they would not know how to follow directions; yet even if there is some understanding, there is no guarantee that Lia's parents will agree to follow the Western doctor's prescriptions. Throughout the novel, the Lees often make decisions of prescription based on how the medicine affects Lia's spirit and if the treatment conflicts with Hmong spiritual belief. The inconsistency by which Lia's parents follow or disregard medical instructions both angers and frustrates the Western medical doctors by slowing down their ability to heal Lia with Western medicine. Being asked to follow Western practices to heal their daughter, the Lees abide by Hmong culture in the refusal of orders Also, there is not enough evidence to show the benefits of alternative medicine other than people's stories. However, insurance companies still should cover alternative medicine because they have been proven successful around the world and are used in some hospitals and clinics in China. In addition, Western medicine has its faults: \"The patient is a machine composed of individual body parts that when broken or lost, can be fixed or replaced by new parts\"(Marcum, 2008, 105). In other words, they compare us to machines, which is not true and it's a fallacy, because not any parts of our body can be replaced. Thus, the choice for patients should be theirs to satisfy their "}
