First, we want to limit fillers and toxins in our patients' supplements. Second, we want to ensure that our patients see the results they are looking for. Professional supplements are subject to stricter quality control standards than over-the-counter supplements. This is because professional supplements are manufactured in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). GMPs are a set of guidelines that ensure quality on all aspects of supplement production, from raw materials to finished products. To ensure these companies are following GMPs, we also look for third-party certifications. This extra level of assurance means the companies we choose are not making false claims and they do in fact meet the highest quality standards. We always choose professional supplements from companies that are committed to quality so you can feel confident in what you are taking. Another reason why our naturopathic doctors choose professional supplements is efficacy. Simply put, efficacy is the ability of a treatment or intervention to produce the desired effect. When it comes to supplements, we want to be sure that our clients are getting the results they are looking for. There are a number of factors that can affect the efficacy of a supplement, including the quality of the ingredients, the manufacturing process, and how well the body absorbs and metabolizes the nutrients. When we choose quality supplements backed by clinical research we can more confidently guide your treatment plan. When it comes to supplements, more is not always better. In fact, taking too much of certain vitamins and minerals can be harmful. That's why it's important to work with a naturopathic doctor who can help you choose the right supplement regimen for your individual needs.
