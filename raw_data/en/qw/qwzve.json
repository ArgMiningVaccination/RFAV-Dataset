This includes prescription and nonprescription, or over-the-counter (OTC) medications, and any supplements or herbal products. - Read the information that comes with your medication to learn about any drug interactions. - Tell your doctor and pharmacist about any tobacco, alcohol, or other drug use, because these could affect how your medication works.

There are three main platforms that vaccine manufacturers are using to develop COVID-19 vaccines. A central theme is that all vaccine candidates are focusing on developing immunity to the \"S protein,\" a component of the COVID-19 virus that is critical to allow itself to attach to receptors within our body and infect our cells. By developing vaccines that promote an immune response in our body against this specific protein, the available clinical trial data has shown encouraging results in preventing significant disease and/or transmission. Another difference between the candidates is differing storage requirements which could vary from simple refrigeration to deep freezing.

Immunizations, more commonly referred to as vaccines, help protect you, your family and friends, and the community from contracting and spreading vaccine-preventable diseases like seasonal flu, whooping cough, measles, shingles, pneumonia, and COVID-19. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), vaccinations not only protect us from seasonal illnesses like the flu, but they protect us in the future. Vaccinations are one of the best ways to put an end to serious side effects from certain diseases. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines are one of many important tools to help us take control of this pandemic.
