ADHD is a lifelong condition and causes problems like low self-esteem and difficulty with school or work. There is no cure for ADHD, but there are ways to help manage it. Common options include medication and therapy, but some people are turning to diet to help manage their ADHD symptoms. What is an ADHD Diet? An ADHD diet incorporates foods meant to reduce symptoms of ADHD while avoiding foods that may worsen symptoms. The idea is that some foods can help manage ADHD, while others can exacerbate symptoms. It's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all best diet for ADHD, and more research is needed to understand the relationship between [diet](https://www.athleticinsight.com/diet) and ADHD fully. An ADHD diet is not a substitute for medication or other treatments a healthcare professional recommends. How Does an ADHD Diet Work? Science still isn't quite sure what the relationship is between ADHD and food and how diet helps ADHD, but there are some theories. Some research suggests that a diet high in sugar and refined carbohydrates causes spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels, which can lead to inattention and impulsivity. Some studies have also linked a diet high in artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives to increased hyperactivity in children with ADHD.

Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fatty fish and some supplements, have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties that may benefit brain health and reduce ADHD symptoms. Probiotics, beneficial bacteria that live in the gut, can improve gut health and reduce inflammation, potentially benefiting ADHD symptoms. What Are the Health Benefits of an ADHD Diet? The health benefits of an ADHD diet can vary from person to person. However, some potential benefits of following an ADHD diet include improved focus and concentration, reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity, improved mood, better sleep, and reduced inflammation. - Improved focus and concentration: By avoiding foods that may cause spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels, such as those high in sugar and refined carbohydrates, an ADHD diet can help improve focus and concentration. - Reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity: Some studies have linked a diet high in artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives to increased hyperactivity in children with ADHD. - Improved mood: A balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats can provide essential nutrients that support brain function and may help improve mood. - Better sleep: By avoiding foods that can disrupt sleep, such as caffeine and sugar, an ADHD diet can help improve sleep quality, which can in turn, improve ADHD symptoms. - Reduced inflammation: Some dietary factors, such as omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics, have anti-inflammatory properties that have the potential to benefit brain health and reduce ADHD symptoms. What Are the Health Risks of an ADHD Diet? Since ADHD diets work to improve overall health and wellness, there are very few downsides. Many people, regardless of whether or not they have ADHD, have the potential to benefit from an ADHD-type diet. However, there are some potential risks associated with certain dietary interventions for ADHD that should be considered. - Nutritional deficiencies: Some people try to manage ADHD symptoms by eliminating entire food groups, such as gluten or dairy, without consulting a healthcare professional. - Side effects and interactions: Some supplements or herbal remedies marketed for ADHD may have side effects or interact with other medications. - Not a cure-all: While some dietary factors have been shown to have potential benefits for managing ADHD symptoms, there is still limited scientific evidence in this area. How to Do an ADHD Diet While there is no one-size-fits-all ADHD diet, common recommendations for how to do an ADHD diet include the following steps. - A balanced diet includes many fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats. - Eating complex carbohydrates over simple carbohydrates, as complex carbohydrates keep blood sugar stable and prevent spikes and crashes. - Eating regularly throughout the day to maintain stable blood sugar levels. - Eating protein-rich foods can prevent blood sugar spikes and help the body make neurotransmitters. - Avoid foods high in sugar and artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. - Drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated. - Including omega-3 fatty acids in the diet, which can be found in fatty fish like salmon, as well as in supplements. - Considering the use of probiotics to improve gut health, which has been linked to improvements in ADHD symptoms in some studies. An ADHD diet is not meant to help someone lose weight. Generally, a balanced ADHD diet should provide enough calories to meet the body's energy needs while providing essential nutrients for optimal brain function. Because results are mixed, there is no way to know how long it may take someone to feel the positive effects of an ADHD diet. However, if someone does find benefits from the ADHD diet, this may be a diet they want to continue for the rest of their lives. What Are the Foods That You Can Eat While on ADHD Diet? Most foods are safe to eat on an ADHD diet as long as they don't have added sugar, artificial colors, and flavors, and don't cause allergic reactions. However, some options are better than others. An ADHD diet food list often includes: - Fruits: Fruits and vegetables are a great way to get complex carbohydrates into a diet. Fruits like apples, kiwis, grapefruit, oranges, pears, and tangerines are all excellent options. - Vegetables: Like fruit, vegetables provide nutrient-rich complex carbohydrates for an ADHD diet. - Grains: The grains eaten in an ADHD diet should be whole grains with complex carbohydrates, such as whole wheat bread, brown rice, quinoa, and oats. - Legumes: Legumes are a good source of protein, fiber, and other important nutrients that support brain function and overall health. Legumes include foods like beans, peas, lentils, and chickpeas. - Nuts: Nuts are a good source of healthy fats, protein, fiber, and other important nutrients supporting brain function and overall health. They can also help stabilize blood sugar levels. Some nuts, such as walnuts and almonds, are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to benefit brain function. - Seeds: Like nuts, seeds are a good source of healthy fats, protein, fiber, and other important nutrients and can help stabilize blood sugar levels. Flaxseeds and chia seeds are also great sources of omega-3 fatty acids. - Healthy fats: Healthy fats include monounsaturated fats, polyunsaturated fats, and omega-3 fatty acids. - Proteins: Proteins are one of the most important parts of an ADHD diet. Healthy protein sources include lean meats, seafood, low-fat dairy products, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy products.

Foods with high amounts of sugar, artificial colors, or preservatives should be avoided on an ADHD diet. This is especially true in an ADHD diet for kids. People with ADHD are often advised to avoid excess sugar because it can contribute to hyperactivity and other ADHD symptoms. Foods and drinks high in sugar can rapidly spike blood sugar levels, followed by a quick crash. This can lead to various symptoms similar to ADHD, such as restlessness, irritability, and difficulty focusing. A diet high in sugar can also contribute to inflammation in the body and disrupt the balance of neurotransmitters, exacerbating ADHD symptoms. Some studies have suggested that artificial dyes and preservatives may contribute to neurological and behavioral problems, particularly in children. Artificial dyes are found in many processed and packaged foods, such as candy, soda, and snack foods.
