Introducing: CytoFLEX SRT THE NEW BENCHTOP SORTERImmunology News | November 2020A WORD FROM THE EDITOR 3 Welcome to the end-of-year edition of Immunology News . 2020 has been without a doubt an incredibly demanding year, full of uncertainties and complications, but it has also been a year of progress, resilience and inspiration. In this issue, we reflect on the numerous actions we have taken to support our members and raise their voice in the public debate on COVID-19. The immunology community has truly come together to overcome the hurdles from the pandemic, and thrive in advancing our understanding of the disease; this can be seen by our latest report on the ageing immune system from our Immunology and COVID-19 taskforce and by the launch of the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium, which the BSI is proud to support.Over the past couple of months, we have been busy getting ready for our first-ever virtual conference, 'Connecting immunology in the time of COVID-19', taking place in a few days. This is a unique opportunity for immunologists to exchange ideas and hear from leading UK and international researchers in a safe environment. I'm sure this will be a novel and unusual way to attend a scientific conference for many of you (and it's a brand-new concept for us too!) but the team has been working hard to make sure the virtual venue is interactive, fun and easy to use. We're very much looking forward to connecting with all of you online!

Cells: tiny sacs of liquid that form the building blocks of our bodies, Stacks upon stacks of these liquid sacs form our organs: our kidneys, hearts and all the other parts A special army of cells make up the immune system These immune cell soldiers hitch rides down the highways of our bloodstream They meander down blood vessel lanes, passing through doorways into organs Here the immune cells police local cellular communities, Stop and search threats; any crime scene evidence, immune cells will collect! The immune soldier's goal is to keep us healthy, free of germs, Destroying invaders like viruses or parasitic worms Our immune cells protect us from a range of disease, Cancer happens to be one of these See, germs and cancer have a similarity, they both display abnormalities An important group of immune soldiers are called T-cells, They're remarkably sensitive to the abnormal features of a cancer cell And if nothing stops them, they kill cancer pretty well. But in a solid lump of cancer cells which we call a tumour, Cancer cells seem to have a malicious sense of humour. They lock T-cells out or they drug them with chemicals They turn T-cells away, make them drunken or drowsy They lose their sense of duty, their work ethic becomes lousy Some cancer cells even bribe the T-cells to betray! And the T-cells help the cancer to keep other immune cell detectives away Cancer builds its kingdom, evades our body's defence So Drs fire radiation or toxic chemicals against But sometimes cancer lingers so we need more strategies We need more novel therapeutic synergies. Researchers decode the ways cancer tricks our T-cells, Because by targeting those tricks we can flick T-cell switches back on, And eventually prevent cancer being the cause of our last breaths Giving cancer patients hope and strength, when they are face to face with death.

Let us know by emailing t.prados@immunology.org or tagging @britsocimm on Twitter .Our Annual Review showcases the activities and achievements of the Society over our last financial year from July 2019 to June 2020. We are now almost at the end of our current strategic plan and the past 12 months have seen the organisation achieve some important milestones in our support for members and engaging on immunology in the public arena. This year saw us significantly grow our membership base to over 4,300 as well as running our largest ever BSI Congress with 1,400 of you attending. Activity highlights include a packed schedule of Regional and Affinity Group events, having a significant influence on the national debate around childhood vaccination uptake through our Celebrate Vaccines campaign, and strengthening our grants and training programme. When the pandemic hit, we also stepped up to support our membership with the creation of our webinar programme and resources hub and provided a strong voice in the media and to Government around the importance of immunology research and understanding to hastening pandemic control. None of these achievements would have been possible without the support of our members. Be it through volunteering on our committees and boards, editing our journals, running our Regional and Affinity groups or helping us with media, policy and public engagement activities, our members are the lifeblood of the Society. We're incredibly grateful to you all for your help and support throughout the year. Our Annual Reviews can be found on our website at www.immunology.org/ about-us/annual-review-and-accounts.

We're committed to supporting our members - we have been focusing our efforts on representing and helping you during this uncertain time. On the next two pages, we provide you with a brief update on what we've been doing over the past few months to support you and to feed into public discussion around COVID-19. We also invite you to discover our Connect on Coronavirus hub (www.immunology.org/coronavirus) which features a range of resources to keep you informed on the latest developments and to support you in your career. Policy focus The BSI continues its record of thought leadership on the pandemic currently facing us, with the Immunology and COVID-19 Taskforce in particular, working hard to engage with policymakers and officials from across all four home nations of the UK. On 13 August we launched the Taskforce's first briefing note for policymakers on 'Long-term immunological health consequences of COVID-19' which rapidly reviewed the current research in this area and laid out three key recommendations for research; these will be key to ensuring that such long-term health effects are not overly burdensome to the NHS at the time when we need it most. You can read it here: https://bit.ly/3keu2NK. The report was well received and we had notes from almost thirty policymakers from across the UK including Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP (Con, South West Surrey), Chair of the House of Commons Health and Social Care Select Committee; and Jeane Freeman MSP (SNP, Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley), the Scottish Government's Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport; as well as from senior officials in the UK Government including Sir Patrick Vallance, Government Chief Scientific Advisor. We have also had eight parliamentary questions on the long-term effects of COVID-19 tabled across both Houses of Parliament, including on all three of the key research recommendations in our briefing note. You can find out more about our next policy report on 'The ageing immune system and COVID-19' on pages 14-15. We also continue our programme of briefing Members of Parliament and civil servants on aspects of COVID-19. Danny Altmann, a member of the BSI Taskforce, has briefed the Scottish Government's Head of the Antibody Testing and UK Government Engagement Team, Stephen Metcalfe MP, former Chair of the Commons Science and Technology Committee, as well as Jon Ashworth MP (Lab, Leicester South), the Shadow Health and Social Care Secretary on one occasion, and Sir Keir Starmer MP and the rest of the Shadow Cabinet on another, on various aspects of current research, including the length and durability of effective immunity and the progress so far towards an effective and efficacious vaccine. As ever, it remains important to ensure those operating in Government or those scrutinising and challenging it, have the latest information available to make their work more effective. Finally, we have worked hard to make sure that the voice of immunologists is heard clearly in the media. Ensuring that journalists can speak directly with immunologists to put the latest COVID-19 findings into context is one of our key roles at the moment. Over the last few of months, spokespeople from the BSI have been quoted in many national and international news stories including BBC News, Daily Mail , Daily Telegraph , The Sun, The Guardian and New York Times . Webinars We have developed three webinar series to share the latest Coronavirus developments, offer opportunities to develop your professional skills and connect you with the immunology community. Our 'Connecting on Coronavirus' series provides immunologists with a platform to keep informed with the latest COVID-19 research during the pandemic. It brings you expert speakers who discuss relevant and timely information on key topics such as B cells and antibodies, SARS- CoV-2 and airway epithelium, antiviral responses in COVID-19, and much more. Our Careers Development series has now come to an end, but the recordings of all webinars are available via the members' section of the BSI website. This series contains a range of insightful SOCIETY NEWS Connecting on Coronavirus and entertaining webinars to build your skills, including sessions on how to prepare your paper for peer review, how to manage your wellbeing during the COVID-19 period and how to transition out of academia and into industry. Finally, our Regional and Affinity Group webinars are run by and for our wonderful Regional and Affinity Group members. This series showcases a wide range of topics. So far, we've explored the impact of parasites on the human immune system, personalised interception of autoimmune diseases and the role of neutrophils in malaria, to name a few. Take a look at the events section on our website for upcoming sessions and head to www.immunology.org/events/ bsi-events for all our recordings from previous webinars. Our 'Connecting on Coronavirus' series is free for all to watch, and our Careers Development and Regional and Affinity Group series are exclusive for members. Lay summaries We are proud to continue making new COVID-19 research accessible to everyone. All COVID-19 research published in our official journals has an accompanying summary for a general public audience, exploring why and how the research was conducted, what the results can tell us and what further work is needed. We have many excellent summaries to help the public understand the most recent COVID-19 immunology research from our journals Immunology and Clinical & Experimental Immunology . The lay summaries can be viewed on the BSI website at: https://bit.ly/2OIKloE. The BSI is working hard to represent and support the immunology community during this time. We hope that you've found our activities so far useful and we welcome feedback on our activities and any other areas you feel we should focus on.

Our thanks also go to our following Gold Corporate Members who are supporting our November 2020SOCIETY NEWS 12 SOCIETY NEWS Addressing vaccine concerns With the emergence of COVID-19, the crucial role that vaccines play in protecting our health has come into sharp focus. During the pandemic hope comes in the form of a vaccine and immunologists around the world are working to develop a safe and effective one that will protect us against infection by SARS- CoV-2. It's important to understand and address vaccine concerns that are prominent in public discussion and may lead to hesitancy to vaccination. To address common vaccine questions and strengthen public understanding around vaccines, we have produced a series of infographics, a blog and video to discuss the concerns in more detail. One prominent public concern is about what's in vaccines and we've created an easy-to-digest infographic to explain the different ingredients found in vaccines. Alongside the infographic, we've produced a detailed blog, with the help of BSI member Dr Beth Holder. It's crucial to explore the role of each vaccine ingredient to understand that, in the very small amounts used, they are safe and are necessary to ensure a vaccine's high quality. By answering this common vaccine question, we hope to provide evidence-based information to help everyone make informed decisions about vaccines and their health. Another topic high on the media and public agenda is how vaccines can generate long-term immunity and how an effective COVID-19 vaccine might work. Our new informative infographic explains how vaccines take advantage of the natural process of adaptive immunity and what this might mean for COVID-19 vaccine development. The infographic introduces the concept that an effective COVID-19 vaccine might stimulate B cells and specific antibodies or T cells or a combination of both. BSI member, Dayana Hristova, helped produce a video explaining that vaccines are the safest way to gain long-term immunity against a virus that your body has yet to encounter. These infographics are all free to download from the BSI website and we encourage you to share them with your networks to help improve understanding of vaccine ingredients and the role of long-term immunity in effective vaccines.Water The main ingredient.Active ingredient A very small amount of a harmless form of the bacteria or virus you are immunising against.

The start of November saw the launch of a new website dedicated to the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium (UK-CIC; www.uk-cic.org), a valuable information resource that will document the consortium's progress over the coming year. The BSI is a key supporter of UK-CIC, assisting UK immunology to collaborate at a national level to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we highlight some of the key features of the website and provide a look at what's to come. UK-CIC has been designed to bring the UK immunology community together to respond to the pandemic, at pace and at scale, to further our understanding of the immunological features of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. The consortium includes 19 centres of excellence around the UK, and is a unique collaboration in UK immunology. With so many researchers working towards a common goal, and the need to provide clear benefits to patients and public health, it is important that information on the work of the consortium is accessible. There are many stakeholders in this project, from members of the academic immunology community to the general public; growing our understanding of COVID-19 is important to everyone, and so having a central website that details the progress of UK-CIC is incredibly important. Website walkthrough The website is divided into sections (much like the BSI's own website) that should make navigating through it simple and straightforward. About Us contains everything you need to know about UK- CIC and its collaborators. There, you can read a summary of UK-CIC's goals, which institutions are taking part, and profiles on all of the researchers that it includes. This list will be updated as time goes on. You can also read about our Management Team, Scientific Advisory Board and Public Patient Involvement Panel. These groups are key to ensuring that the most relevant and up-to-date scientific methods are being considered, that the consortium is reaching its goals within the 12 months allotted, and that the impact on and interests of patients and the general public are considered at all stages. In News , the most 'exciting' section of the website, you can read the latest updates on the consortium's work as it comes in. Check back here often as over the next year it will fill up with announcements on the latest findings. This section also contains the UK-CIC Blog which will feature more in-depth pieces such as close-up looks at individual centres or research projects (if you are a consortium member and would like to be featured in the blog, get in touch!). The Research section is a key part of the website as it sets out each of UK-CIC's research themes in more detail, and in more accessible language so that everyone can understand the consortium's goals and interests. Not only can you read up on each of the five themes and see who is involved, but it will also be updated with a list of publications linked to each, so that you can quickly get down to the fine details. Tied to that, Publications will host links to each paper and the associated researchers as they appear, along with public summaries where the findings are written in lay terms. Finally, For the Public is a fantastic resource hub that will host links to useful information about immunology and COVID-19. This collection will expand as we identify other great sites worth highlighting so be sure to check back regularly. We are excited to share the consortium's research with you as it is published over the year to come. Keeping the whole immunology community engaged with the work done by UK-CIC is a real priority, as it is at its heart a collaborative project that values the input from a variety of perspectives. By doing this, we hope to deliver meaningful public health benefits that increase our ability to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

The rapid review style document lays out how what we do and don't currently know about how ageing can affect the immune system's response to COVID-19. In this article, our Policy & Public Affairs Manager, Matthew Gibbard, discusses the findings of this report and explains its importance, both for the BSI's policy work and mission, and for optimising patient care, treatment and vaccine approaches. Engaging with policymakers The importance of these reports is two- fold. Firstly, it allows us to communicate with policymakers in a way that few other organisations are able to. By taking topics that are hugely relevant to public discourse at the moment, we hope to improve the level of debate in the public arena, inform decision- making by those in power, and improve the quality of scrutiny of governments by the national legislatures, through presenting the latest science and research in an accessible and informative way. Secondly, by engaging with policymakers on these hugely important topics, we have established ourselves as a thought leader in the COVID-19 and immunology policy space. Through this, we have become an organisation that is actively sought out by senior parliamentarians to provide briefings on other topics, such as COVID-19 vaccine development, and we are working hard to ensure that this name recognition continues beyond the pandemic so that we can better represent the immunology community in the years to come.Focus on ageing Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been apparent that this disease affects different people in different ways. One of the starkest contrasts has been how infection with SARS-CoV-2 can affect people dissimilarly across age groups. The fascinating science behind this combined with the policy implications including but not limited to, transmission and susceptibility, therapeutics and vaccines, durability and longevity of immunity, made this an obvious choice of topic for the taskforce to tackle. The report explores how ageing can affect the immune system's response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This includes the role of ageing in susceptibility to infection; immune memory; what role other medical conditions associated with ageing have to play; what this means for the optimal treatment of COVID-19; and the vaccines that are being developed to prevent this disease. The report outlines five research recommendations to help increase our knowledge of the role played by the ageing immune system in the body's response to COVID-19. A better understanding of the immunological response in older people to COVID-19 infection will help us improve patient care and has implications for treatment and vaccine approaches. COVID-19 severity and ageing It is well established that the immune system changes as we get older. The balance between immune activation, regulation and resolution can be altered as we age, resulting in inadequate protection against infection, along with a greater risk of inflammatory disease. As with many aspects of the human body, there is no one 'cut off' point for this to occur but instead it is a gradual process. Indeed, the shrinkage of the thymus, an organ that produces a type of immune cell known as T cells, begins shortly after birth. Large studies in the UK have confirmed the positive correlation between increasing age and increasing COVID-19 disease severity. Relative to hospitalised patients under 50 years of age, those aged 60-69 are approximately five times more likely to die from COVID-19, while those aged 70-79 are at 8.5 times greater risk.

Find out more: www.immunology.org/ coronavirus/immunology-and-covid-19.BRIEFING NOTE 15 Research priorities 1. Studies on the symptoms and clinical progression of COVID-19 infection should include non-hospitalised individ- uals and be large enough to determine ages at which critical changes occur . Studies should identify correlates that affect initial infection, progression to severe disease, recovery and re-infection. This information is essential to determine which age groups need which interven- tions, enabling targeting of interventions to specific groups. For example, at what age - and with which additional risk factors - is shielding required? What role do antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs have at different ages? 2. Identification of the extent of the immune system contribution to the symptoms and pathology of the disease is required in order to identify areas for possible intervention without compromis- ing anti-infection activity. 3. We urgently need to establish reliable and tractable methods to measure immune responses in patients following infection or vaccination with a specific focus on different age groups. We must include measures of cellular immunity as well as humoral immunity. More studies are needed in the community setting to capture different degrees of disease severity, to identify what 'good' looks like in an asymptomatic immune response. Studies should extend into the convalescent period and beyond to establish factors that affect the duration of effective immunity. 4. Studies are needed to determine the effect of other challenges to the immune system during COVID-19 infection. This includes studies of co- infection, in particular because older people often live with, for example, bacterial urinary tract infections or CMV infections. Similarly, the consequences of acute co-infections with other respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus and RSV, on COVID-19 disease severity needs to be examined. Finally, the effect of vaccination against other pathogens, such as influenza, pneumococcal disease or TB, on the response to SARS-CoV-2 requires clarification. 5. Vaccine protocols need to be optimised for older adults by investigating dose, formulation, boosting and vaccination routes. Different groups of people, by age or by comorbidity, may require different types of vaccine or vaccine formulations. reasons for this are numerous. There are, for example, increased and chronic background levels of inflammation in older individuals, referred to as 'inflammaging', which have been linked to increased risk of disease and increased expression of inflammatory genes which is associated with increased all- cause mortality in older individuals. Factoring in multimorbidity Various factors work in tandem with the ageing immune system to exacerbate effects that are already happening. One feature influencing the age-related severity of COVID-19 is the higher prevalence of chronic disease in this population: by the age of 70 years, 75% of adults have two or more long-term conditions, termed multimorbidity. This can include chronic lung disease, diabetes and hypertension, among other conditions, all of which contribute to a greater risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19. More data is needed to be able to confirm if co-infection with either other viruses or bacteria results in an increase in mortality or morbidity. Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood at any age and more work needs to be done here to determine the correlates of protection and then carry out follow-up studies to determine the lifespan of immunity. Looking at immunity in older people we can, however, look to prior knowledge on other infections and vaccine studies, which could suggest that raising robust immunity may be more difficult or may take longer. Response to vaccines A key aspect of an ageing immune system is a change in its response to vaccines. The decline in immune function in older adults can lead to both a reduced initial response to vaccination and/or reduced efficacy of the vaccine response. Continuing to work on the development of therapeutics for those who have contracted COVID-19 is vitally important because of concerns over the ability of older people to develop effective immunity or to respond to a vaccine. It is as yet unknown whether older people will require different vaccines or altered dosing schedules, but this will have real consequences for the public health response to this pandemic. Such knowledge will affect the deployment of vaccines once one or more is proven to be safe and effective. It is therefore of the utmost urgency that those making policy decisions have an understanding of age differences in immunity and a clear plan for action, including public information and education.

You can be forgiven for not being completely up to speed on the important dates and decisions in the UK's negotiations with the European Union, with COVID-19 drawing almost all public and political focus for the best part of 2020. The first important deadline was 1 July 2020, by which time the UK and the EU had to agree if they wished to extend the transition period beyond 31 December 2020; the decision was made not to extend into 2021. This meant that a second deadline began to be talked about: 15 October 2020. This marked the date of a summit of the European Council (an EU institution comprising the heads of state or government of each EU member country) at which it was thought that a decision would be taken regarding the progress of talks with the UK. Quelle surprise, then, that no decision was taken at these crunch talks and negotiations are still occurring at the time of writing. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has suggested that the next EU summit on 15 November will be the important date. The sticking points are widely reported to be on items such as access to UK waters for fishing, the post-Brexit state aid plans for industry in the UK and the knock-on effect to 'a Our Policy and Public Affairs Manager, Matthew Gibbard, reviews the current political situation around Brexit and reminds us of key moments and decisions in the UK's negotiations with the European Union, including access to EU research funding via Horizon Europe. level playing field' associated with that. Senior figures in UK science however, are said to be expressing doubt that Horizon Europe will be able to provide value for money to UK researchers, based on the access arrangements proposed by the European Union. While the UK is currently overall a net contributor to EU coffers, it has been a net recipient of Horizon 2020 funds, taking billions of euros more out than it has paid in. It is thought that EU negotiators are asking that the UK 'pay to play' contribution to Horizon Europe be based on the size of its GDP in comparison with the EU's (at the moment the UK's GDP is equal to 18% of that of the EU), which will make any contribution in the order of billions rather than millions. On top of this would be administrative and participatory fees. Without a downward corrective mechanism, whereby UK researchers can recoup any money invested by the UK Government that they do not receive back in grants, the question of value for money has quickly arisen. UK negotiators have argued for an arrangement similar to that proposed by Europe in 2018 in which there would be a 'pay as you go' arrangement with a safety net mechanism in place to ensure that no non-EU country is left out of pocket. The EU have been keen to move away from this idea however, no doubt in part due to internal arguments about the budget of Horizon Europe and how this would be funded. The European Commission originally planned an ambitious figure of more than \u20ac100 billion for Horizon, but after infighting between heads of member states, this was pared back to about \u20ac80 billion by the time the whole EU Budget reached the European Parliament for approval, with critics saying that national leaders had treated the Horizon budget as 'cash cow' during talks BSI policy update: Brexit spotlight 'Without a downward corrective mechanism, whereby UK researchers can recoup any money invested by the UK Government that they do not receive back in grants, the question of value for money has quickly arisen.'in July 2020. Even the planned \u20ac13.5 billion earmarked for COVID-19 research was scaled back to \u20ac5 billion by national leaders. It could be that now the EU is hoping third countries will make up the shortfall. At the time of going to print, negotiations between the UK and the EU were ongoing in relation to Horizon Europe. Senior figures in UK universities continued to express concern that the current proposed funding model did not offer value for money without a corrective mechanism and that the UK was unlikely to win back all its contributions as grants. Others in Europe say this isn't necessarily true because the figures the UK is basing its baseline estimate on have been affected adversely by Brexit since 2016 and that Horizon Europe is a new programme that will give far more weight to innovation, impact and open science. The outcome of course remains to be seen, but in chorus with our partners, we will continue to press the case for a settlement that is fair and equitable to both sides, so that the 'winner' in the negotiations is science on both sides of the Channel.

Our Teaching Excellence Award highlights excellent immunology teachers in UK higher education institutes. The award recognises those who show a passion for immunology and education, along with the communication skills to make these complex subjects accessible to their students. Find out more about the award at www.immunology.org/ teachingaward. Nigel is Associate Professor at Swansea University Medical School. He studied Pharmacology at the University of Bath before completing a PhD in Immunology at the University of Birmingham. After a postdoctoral position at Cardiff University he started working at Swansea University, where he has helped establish immunology teaching across all years of their undergraduate programmes. He is a member of the BSI, fellow of the Royal Society of Biology and Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. Nigel is also the co-creator of Immunology Wars, an educational resource aimed at describing the basic functions of the immune system through the Star Wars movies. Read the interview below to find out about how he got involved in teaching, the most rewarding aspects of teaching immunology and his ideas for mitigating the new challenges that immunology educators are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tell us a bit about your academic and professional background. How did you first get involved in teaching? My interest in immunology probably started when I watched Polly Matzinger on BBC Horizon discussing the Danger Model - I was lucky enough to see her talk live several years later. I studied Pharmacology at Bath and during that time I spent an intercalated Masters year studying immunology in Cardiff, which confirmed for me that this was what I wanted to pursue, so I did a PhD in Birmingham and then returned to Cardiff for a postdoc position, both focusing on innate immunity. At the end of this position an opportunity to take a tutor position at Swansea University came up, which was mainly a teaching role, but allowed me some time to continue my research and help expand the scope of immunology within the Medical School at Swansea, FUTURE FOCUS Immunology Teaching Excellence Award Introducing the 2020 winner: Nigel Francis so that we now have modules with immunology elements across all years of the programmes. What aspects of teaching do you find most challenging and what are the most rewarding? The most rewarding aspects are seeing students become enthusiastic about a subject that you are passionate about, those lightbulb moments when things start to make sense and students realise how amazing the immune system is. To then follow students that you have taught as they go on to make their own mark on the field is immensely gratifying. One of the most challenging things about teaching immunology is the complexity of the subject itself. Immunology is one of those subjects where you need to be able to see the big picture, but also need to understand what all the component parts do, so it's a bit like doing a jigsaw puzzle - you have a pretty good idea of what the end product should look like, but until you put those individual pieces in place it can be a bit of a mess! Finding ways to break these concepts down and make them engaging and accessible for students can definitely be a challenge. Can you describe some of the most effective teaching methods you use to inspire the next generation of immunologists? Anything where the students are actively engaged or are thinking about the topics they are studying, whether that is peer teaching through discussions, using polling software in lectures but formatted as a quiz show or having topics decontextualised to make them more memorable or providing a different way to think about the subject, which was really what the Immunology Wars project was aiming to do.Alongside that, helping students to develop their transferrable or soft skills is fundamentally important. At the end of the day we are aiming to produce science practitioners, so they need to have the skills that will allow them to be successful in the workplace as well as the subject- specific knowledge. Can you tell us a bit about the importance of finding innovative teaching methods to engage with a range of students and its potential impact on their careers and the immunology field? For me the first thing to ask is, what is innovative? There are some things that I have done that I wouldn't even think twice about, but when I have described them to others, they have found them to be innovative, so I guess innovation is unique to each individual. What it all comes down to I suppose is passion and enthusiasm for your subject - if you can find new ways to present information you're going to come across as more enthusiastic, which in turn makes your students more interested in the subject you're teaching. Hopefully, coming up with novel ways to teach makes things more memorable and maybe one day those students will go on and teach others by adapting those ideas. Given the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent remote working and learning environment, what do you think are the challenges immunology educators are facing and how can these be mitigated? If I had the solution to this, I would be a very popular academic! The biggest challenge is probably providing students with enough hands-on time in the lab to gain experience in the techniques they will need, so finding ways to maximise what they get out of the limited lab time is key. Based on my involvement with the #DryLabsRealScience network the main ways people are looking to do this is to 27Immunology News | November 202028 EDUCATION & CAREERS cover more of the theoretical knowledge and understanding of why techniques are used pre-lab, allowing students to really focus on what they are doing in the lab. The ways to do this tend to be focused around the use of videos, animations and simulations, so hopefully students will arrive in class asking more of the 'so what does this result mean?' type questions rather than the 'how do I do this?' questions. Can you tell us a little more about the Immunology Wars resource? Well I'm a Star Wars fan, but I guess it really started with a student who always used to sit near the front of my classes, and she had an amazing graphic of Darth Vader taking a bite out of the Apple logo. Congratulations! Everyone here at the BSI would like to congratulate Nigel on his achievement in winning the 2020 Immunology Teaching Excellence Award.

That's the first and only time I've had a round of applause at the end of a lecture. That got me thinking and I knew there were several students who were also big Star Wars fans and the idea of explaining immunology by aligning it to the stories and characters of Star Wars was created. The students have written whole episodes or sections of the website and it's an ongoing project that we hope will continue to grow and gain more interest.

Immunology NLRP3 inflammasome anti-C5 function-blocking antibody, BB5.1 Antibodies that bind complement components were first identified over 30 years ago and are still an area for the development of anti- complement drugs. To date, the focus has been on blocking cleavage of C5, which prevents C5a anaphylatoxin and membrane attack complex linked to inflammation in multiple diseases. Although the mechanism is poorly understood, the anti-C5 blocking monoclonal antibody, BB5.1 is often used to demonstrate complement involvement in mouse disease models and has led to the development of the most successful anti-complement drug to date, eculizumab, which is already used in treatment. Zelek et al. characterised the BB5.1 cross- species binding and inhibition and mechanism of action, showing it binds the C5 -chain with high affinity and slow off-rate. They showed Fab fragments of the antibody are efficient C5 inhibitors, and provide complementarity- determining regions sequencing data that enables binding-site prediction and will facilitate future modifications for drug development. Zelek et al. 2020 Immunology 161 103-113 https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13228 Clinical & Experimental ImmunologyThe BSI journalsImmune Update Excessive DNA is a risk factor for immune activation in psoriasis Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease characterised by excessive growth and aberrant differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes due to persistent inflammation. However, the underlying mechanism that triggers immune activation in psoriasis is not clear. Here Luo et al. explored excessive DNA as a potential trigger of psoriasis using cultured human keratinocytes and psoriatic skin tissues. They found that DNA fragments induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- expression, hyperproliferation and over- expression of growth factors HB-EGF and TGF- , leading to defective expression of keratins, leading to psoriatic skin lesions. They also found evidence that vitamin D inhibited genomic DNA fragment-induced (TNF)- and interleukin-1 (IFNB) expression with the involvement of cathelicidin anti-microbial peptide (CAMP). These results suggest that excessive DNA fragments probably act as a risk factor for immune activation in psoriasis, and the active form of vitamin D can prevent genomic DNA-mediated skin inflammation via CAMP. Luo et al. 2020 Clinical & Experimental Immunology 202 1-10 https:// doi.org/10.1111/cei.13455Microglia are macrophage-like cells that play an integral role in brain development and maintaining brain tissue homeostasis. However, neuroinflammation in the microglia driven by and PYD domain-containing protein (NLRP3) inflammasome brain diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and stroke. Hoyle and team studied the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in organotypic hippocampal slices, allowing them to investigate the 3D structure. They found TLR 2 and 4 activation primed inflammation by increasing NLRP3 and interleukin-1 expression. Inflammasome activation triggered downstream caspase-1, gasdermin cleavage, pyroptotic cell death and interleukin-1 release, indicating NLRP3 has different stimuli. These findings will aid future mechanistic insights and drug discovery. Hoyle et al. 2020 Immunology 161 39-52 https://onlinelibrary.wiley. com/doi/10.1111/imm.13221 Suppressed immune profile in children with type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and coeliac disease (CD) are complex T cell-driven-mediated autoimmune diseases, including several components of both the innate and adaptive immune system. Children diagnosed with a combination of both diseases show a diminished T helper type 1 (Th1)-like profile and dysregulated Th17 response. Tompa et al. analysed 28 immune markers in sera collected from children with T1D and CD. They found the patients had lower levels of immune markers indicating a supressed immune profile including Th17 cytokines, chemokines, APPs, adipocytokines and MMPs. These markers are of importance for future investigations of the heterogeneous immune processes in patients with both T1D and CD.

Written by Edd James, Louisa James, Donald Palmer and Mihil Patel. Interleukin1 enhances interferon alpha-induced antiviral responses IFN is an important component of the innate immune response to viral infections. Using Huh7.5 cells and hepatotropic viruses, the mRNA stability of IFN and the negative regulator IRF2 were found to control the expression of IFN -induced antiviral genes. The knockdown of IRF2 amplified key IFN -induced genes. The result was functionally mimicked by addition of IL1, which acted synergistically with IFN to repress viral replication. In an in vivo setting, IL1R KO mice displayed increased viral replication. This study shows that IL1 is an important enhancer of IFN -induced antiviral responses. Robichon et al. 2020 Plos Pathogens 16 e1008461 Critical role for liver X receptors in thymic integrity and function Liver X receptors and (LXR and LXR) are nuclear receptors which are involved with cholesterol homeostasis, but also have immune activity. Interestingly, Chan and colleagues show that mice deficient in both these receptors exhibit accelerated thymic involution and a defect in thymocyte development. Using tissue-specific LXR-deficient mice along with transplantation studies, the authors identify that absence of LXR has a differential effect on the many cells within the thymus. There is an impaired TEC proliferation and regeneration; for thymocytes there is a defect in negative cells; while macrophages exhibit reduced capacity to reduce lipid accumulation. These findings highlight the important role of LXR in thymic activity and function. Chan et al. 2020 Journal of Experimental Medicine 217 e20200318 Predicting the clinical efficacy of PD-1 blockade therapies Neutrophilic inflammation predisposes to RSV infection Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common respiratory pathogen that can cause disease despite previous exposure. To understand this natural variation, 58 healthy adults were inoculated with RSV to examine the immune response in the airway mucosa. Participants who effectively cleared the virus and remained asymptomatic mounted a robust early IL-17 response following exposure, a response which was diminished in the group who went on to develop active infection. In this latter group symptomatic infection was associated with neutrophil activation in the mucosa, prior to RSV exposure. Using a mouse model of RSV infection, the authors found that the neutrophilic inflammation disrupts the induction of protective IL-17-mediated viral clearance during the early asymptomatic phase, resulting in viral replication and enhanced CD8+ T cell driven disease. This work demonstrates that pre-existing neutrophilic inflammation can predispose individuals to symptomatic infection, which may explain why people with chronic neutrophilic inflammation (e.g. asthma and COPD) are more susceptible to respiratory viruses. Habibi et al. 2020 Science 370 DOI: 10.1126/ science.aba9301\u00a9Shutterstock/SOrawan Pattarawimonchai The use of immune checkpoint blockade has allowed significant advancement in the treatment of cancer. However, the therapeutic efficacy is very variable and the ability to predict response in patients is needed. Here, Kumagai and colleagues use mass and flow cytometry analysis of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes to reveal that the balance between PD-1+ CD8+ T cells and PD-1+ regulatory T cells (T regs) in tumours is able to predict the efficacy of PD-1 blocking immunotherapy and is a better predictor than other methods such as PD-L1 expression and tumour mutational burden. Interestingly, they show that while PD-1 blockade enables recovery of PD- 1+ CD8+ T cells, it also enhances the immunosuppressive activity of PD-1+ Tregs. Therefore, this study reveals a biomarker that could predict responses in PD-1 blocking therapies and provides an intriguing prospect of being able to modulate the activity of T regs in other diseases such as autoimmune disease.
