This alternative medical system has evolved over thousands of years, says Michelle Zhang, a TCM practitioner at Balanced Health in Hong Kong. \"TCM has its roots in the Shang dynasty period's shamanistic era, between 1766BC and 1122BC,\" she says.

Qi is what keeps our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health in balance. TCM therapies aim to restore the body's balance between the forces of yin and yang. Imbalances are believed to \"block\" the flow of qi and cause disease. [acupuncture](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3012480/acupuncture-athletes-clinic-uses-chinese-medicine-sports?module=inline&pgtype=article), meditation, physical exercise and massage. TCM differs from other medical systems in several ways, says Lee. [mental health](https://www.scmp.com/topics/mental-health?module=inline&pgtype=article)are highly correlated. \"This is why practitioners address illnesses not only with medication and procedures, but also recommendations on lifestyle, diet and so on. We don't just focus on relieving the symptoms but try to attend to the cause. \"Treatments are individualised because everyone is unique and has different needs. Even if two people have the same condition or symptoms, their treatments will not be identical. \"We take a preventive approach, meaning that we don't just treat illness but also try to prevent it.\" The different forms of TCM There are many different TCM therapies. Acupuncture, for example, involves the painless insertion of ultra-thin, single-use needles into specific points on the body called acupoints, to \"rebalance\" the flow of qi. It is used for a range of diseases and problems, including chronic and acute pain. \"By re-establishing good energy flow, the body can begin to heal itself and restore health,\" Zhang explains. [Cupping involves the suctioning of sections of the body using glass cups](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-beauty/article/2002783/five-things-you-should-know-about-cupping-chinese-medicine?module=inline&pgtype=article). The cups are first warmed with a flame to create a vacuum, which anchors the cup to the skin and pulls it upwards, opening the skin's pores. Zhang says that this encourages blood flow to the area, balancing the flow of qi and easing toxin removal. Cupping is useful for asthma, anxiety and pneumonia, among other conditions. \"And then there's tui na, a mix between acupressure and shiatsu,\" Zhang says. Tui means \"to push\" and na means \"to grab or squeeze\". \"This uses rhythmic compression along energy channels of the body, as well as techniques to manipulate and lubricate the joints. Like acupressure, tui na affects the flow of qi by holding and pressing the body at acupressure points. \"Tui na can restore digestive function and help the lungs to discharge phlegm.\" [Gua sha is another common TCM therapy](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3133858/gua-sha-benefits-techniques-skin-prep-what-avoid-and-why?module=inline&pgtype=article). Lee says it's useful in anti-ageing facial treatments and for muscular pain. This therapy involves \"scraping\" lubricated skin with a special tool using specific strokes and levels of pressure. The tools are typically made from jade, rose quartz, amber, bullhorn or medical-grade stainless steel. [Gua sha: why the ancient TCM practice is now a viral skincare trend](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3133858/gua-sha-benefits-techniques-skin-prep-what-avoid-and-why?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) \"The unidirectional scraping and scratching of the skin causes light bruising, which often appears as purple or red spots known as petechiae or sha,\" Lee adds. \"The 'sha blemishes' can look frightful but are mostly painless and resolve after a while.\" Herbal formulas are also common in TCM treatments. They're often customised from hundreds of ingredients and work to address the patient's specific condition. \"Despite the fact that TCM is an ancient practice, the technology involved in the production of herbal medicines these days is advanced,\" says Lee. \"The granulated herbal extracts are high in quality and are a convenient alternative to raw herbs.\" What TCM can be used for TCM has shown to be effective on a range of conditions, from neck pain because of stress, to symptoms of the common cold and even cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) has given its approval for the use of TCM.

Zhang says TCM not only strengthens the therapeutic effects of the Western medicine or therapy but also offers soothing side effects. \"TCM herbs may reduce the negative side-effects of chemotherapy, such as [vomiting], nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and fatigue. However, the herbs must be prescribed and the patient's condition monitored by qualified practitioners.\" Side effects and risks Herbs may seem harmless, but Zhang says that they can be toxic if taken in high concentrations or large amounts or for an extended period. Common side-effects may include dizziness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. She advises getting guidance from a qualified TCM practitioner before using herbs, even if you just want to make an herbal soup using a recipe you found online. The risks of using herbs are especially high if you suffer from liver or kidney ailments.

Cupping usually leaves marks that take about a week to disappear.\" If your skin is swollen or inflamed, if you have skin wounds or broken bones or are taking blood thinning medication, then cupping may not be suitable for you.
