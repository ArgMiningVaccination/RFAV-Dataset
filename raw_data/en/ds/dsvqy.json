THE PROBLEM: In today's fast-paced, high stress world, we all have a lifetime of toxins built up in our bodies. These are substances that are ingested (alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, refined sugar), inhaled (pesticides, heavy metals from cosmetics, cigarette smoke, dry cleaning and other chemicals) or internally produced (hormonal by-products). SYMPTOMS THEY PRODUCE: Acne, rashes, dark circles under the eyes, swollen or painful joints, skin changes, arthritis and every day aches and pains are examples of signals our bodies give when exposed to toxins. THE ION FOOT DETOX SOLUTION: The IonCleanse detoxification system has been shown to reduce symptoms of \"toxic overload\" through a series of detox sessions. Simply relax with your feet in water for about 30 minutes. The procedure is painless and comfortable. We use a basin containing sea salt dissolved in purified water and then place an electrical unit, called an array, in the water. The array generates alternating positive and negative ions around the feet. The ions enter the body through your feet and begin neutralizing the toxins. Benefits our patients have experienced: Increased energy Decreased allergy symptoms Clearer skin Improved sleep patterns Weight loss Increased circulation *The IonCleanse is not intended to treat, cure, prevent or diagnose any disease or ailment.* ILLNESSES THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED W/ ION FOOT DETOX Toxic Heavy Metals: \"THE WAY TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE IS TO BE PROACTIVE AND ACTIVE\" OCTAVIA SPENCER Getting Started is Simple 1 Request Appointment or complete an online request form for a new patient appointment. 2 Experience Our Clinic your integrative consultation or treatment session. 3 Choose a Membership Choose one of our membership tiers to receive discounted rates and complimentary services each month.
