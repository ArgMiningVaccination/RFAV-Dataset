In spite of the availability of a large number of effective vaccines for children, the decreased acceptance with regard to various specific vaccines or underutilization of the vaccination programs both at the level of the individuals and communities, is a problem that is emerging not only in high income but also in low-and middle-income countries. Both a delay and/or refusal of childhood vaccination are growing challenges for countries seeking to close the immunization gap. VH is found to be influenced by various factors such as misleading or wrong information, complacent nature, inconvenience, and low level of confidence in the program. There is a growing challenge of VH, especially for countries seeking to close this immunization gap.[ [4-6]] Hence, considering the importance of timely vaccination, knowledge regarding the hesitancy of parents toward timely uptake of routine vaccination is important to provide improved vaccination services. Objective The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of VH and its determinants Methods Study design It was a cross-sectional study. Study setting The study was conducted at the immunization clinic of KIMS, Bhubaneswar. Study period The period of study was from May to July 2019. Study participants The study participants were parents of children <18 years categorized as pro-vaccine and vaccine-hesitant. Study tool A predesigned, semi-structured schedule was used to collect relevant information such as sociodemographic profile of the respondent, potential VH survey questions: Version 1.0,[ [3]] determinants of VH, attitude of the respondents toward vaccination, and belief of the respondents toward vaccination. Ethical considerations The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee of the institution before the initiation of the study. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before data collection. Adequate privacy was provided during the interviews, and the details of the participants were maintained in strict confidentiality. Sampling technique Convenience sampling technique was used for the selection of study participants. Sample size A total of 117 partipants were contacted, 29 of whom declined to receive any vaccinations .They were therefore excluded. Thus the remaining 88 participants were included and studied. Inclusion criteria - All the parents with children below 18 years of age - All parents with children who are categorized in the \"vaccine-hesitant\" group. Exclusion criteria - Parents whose children were medically unfit to take vaccine - Those whose children were in the other three groups - \"accepters,\" \"late vaccinators,\" and \"rejecters.\" Statistical methods Relevant data were collected, coded, and entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. It was tabulated and analyzed using Epi Info 7 version 7.3.2.1. Results were expressed as frequencies, means, and standard deviations, proportions as appropriate. The t-test and Chi-square were used as the test of association and a P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Operational definitions - VH: This was defined as a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccination services - \"Pro-vaccine\": This comprised those who agreed with or did not question vaccination - \"Vaccine-hesitant\": This comprised those who accepted vaccination but had significant concerns about vaccinating their infants or purposely delayed vaccinating or chose only some vaccines - \"Anti-vaccine\": This group comprised those who completely rejected vaccination. Results This study included 88 study participants, and the proportion of VH was found to be 45.3%; among whom 39.8% (35) were pro-vaccine and 60.2% (53) were the vaccine-hesitant. The mean age of the children was 3.65 \u00b1 1.96 years (range: 1-10 years). Around 58% (51) were males and 42% (37) were female children. Majority of the respondents were Hindus 94.3% (83) and around 3.4% (3) were Muslims. Around 56.8% (50) of the respondents were from the general caste whereas 27.3% (24) belonged to the Odisha backward caste. [Table 1](javascript:void(0)) shows the association of VH with the sociodemographic characteristics of the study population. The above table depicts that the father's education, mother's education, and socioeconomic status were found to have a statistically significant association with VH (P < 0.05). Other sociodemographic variables such as place of residence and gender of the child were not found to be statistically significantly associated with VH. [Figure 1](javascript:void(0)) depicts the most trusted source of information regarding vaccines. It was found in the present study that around 66% of the pro-vaccine category of study participants preferred family pediatricians as the source for vaccine-related information, followed by ASHA, ANM, and Anganwadi workers (31%). Of those who were vaccine-hesitant, majority (49%) of them preferred the family pediatrician. Around 17% of the VH group preferred a government hospital for vaccine-related information whereas as few as 3% from the pro-vaccine group preferred a government hospital for the same. Discussion This study was done among 88 parents accompanying their children, who were <18 years of age, in the immunization clinic of a tertiary care hospital. Around 45.3% of the contacted participants were vaccine-hesitant; among the parents included in the study, 39.8% were pro-vaccine and 60.2% were vaccine-hesitant. The mean age of the children was 3 years, 58% of the children were males and the majority of them were Hindus. In a study done by Dasgupta, et al. in Siliguri, West Bengal, in slum areas, 83% of the families were vaccine-hesitant and this difference could be due to different study area settings.[ [7]] In another study done by Narayanan et al. in Chennai, 21% of the study participants reported hesitancy to vaccinate and 10% reported refusal to at least one vaccine (mostly outside the Universal Immunization Program schedule). The main factors influencing VH were skepticism against newer vaccines, concerns about adverse events, and the feeling that vaccines against uncommon diseases are not necessary. It was also observed that VH is inversely proportional to attitudes toward vaccines. These findings are lower than that of the present study.[ [8]] While studying the association between various demographic variables such as education and socioeconomic status of the study participants (parents of the children), it was found that the majority of the vaccine-hesitant parents (both father and mother) were either illiterate or had studied up to primary school and they belonged to lower socioeconomic status (upper lower and lower middle) as compared to the pro-vaccine group who were more educated and belonged to higher socioeconomic status. Similar results were found in the study by Dasgupta et al., which showed that around 73.7% of the mothers had 5 years of schooling and belonged to lower socioeconomic status.[ [7]] Educational status of parents, especially mothers, who are the prime caregiver has been associated with better immunization coverage in previous studies conducted in India as well as abroad,[ [9], [10]] most likely reason being educated mothers are more likely to remember dates, understand the importance of timely vaccination, and interact more freely with health workers.[ [11]] In the present study, lower socioeconomic status showed a higher likelihood of VH, vaccines are supplied free of cost in India in all government facilities on fixed days and dates, so parents who are economically weak and fail to attend the immunization sessions due to work engagement cannot afford to attend private facilities to vaccinate their child whereas the economically better group can visit private facilities and tend to be vaccine complacent. With regard to the opinion about the most trusted source of information regarding vaccines, the majority of the study participants both in the vaccine-hesitant and pro-vaccine group trusted their family pediatrician, followed by community-level health-care workers such as ASHA or ANM or Anganwadi workers and the least trusted source were government health facilities. The most likely reason might be being able to interact and communicate directly on convenient times and places with the family doctors, followed by field-level health-care workers who frequently pay home visits. Important individual-level influences were low awareness of the benefits of vaccination, safety concerns, especially related to mild adverse events following immunization, and mistrust in government and health service quality. Being a single-center study, the study findings cannot be generalized to the state at large. The growing concerns of VH need further planning of community-based larger research studies. Conclusion The study helped identify and prioritize the vaccine-hesitant population in this group. It later helped design evidence - informed responses to VH appropriate to the setting, context, and hesitant population. Vaccine safety is perceived as a concern by all parents, although more so by hesitant parents. Training health professionals on better communication skills and providing homogenous information about vaccination to all parents understandable by all, in line with national recommendations can help responding to their concerns. Access to additional sources of reliable information should be provided. Listening to critical parents is useful for developing communication strategies that suit their concerns and reduce their feelings of ambivalence in decision-making about childhood vaccinations. Further study is needed on how such information could best reach the parents who need it. Financial support and sponsorship Nil. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.
