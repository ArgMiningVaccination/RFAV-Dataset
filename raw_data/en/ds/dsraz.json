Indigenous Knowledge Keepers and the Ongomiizwin Institute of Health and Healing have worked together to create a list of recommendations meant to be a starting point for anyone who is new to engaging in cultural practices. Tobacco offerings Many first Nations and M\u00e9tis communities offer tobacco when asking an Elder or Knowledge Keeper for assistance, whether it be teaching, facilitating a sharing circle or leading a ceremony. Some Knowledge Keepers may accept any form of tobacco, including cigarettes. Others may prefer pipe or natural tobacco or that tobacco ties or flags be made as an offering. It is ideal to meet with the Knowledge Keeper or Elder in-person in advance of an event. Be specific about what you are asking of them and offer the tobacco. It is also ideal to state (if appropriate) what support for the event you can offer or clarify expectations from the Knowledge Keeper or Elder. For example, you might describe the number of honorariums you would be able to provide and if you could host a feast. If you cannot meet the Knowledge Keeper or Elder ahead of time, it is still ideal to offer them tobacco before the event starts. For example, if you are asking them to open an event with a traditional prayer or welcome, you can offer the tobacco in a quiet moment before the event starts. Planning a ceremony When requesting a ceremony, the institution or individual requesting the ceremony should be prepared to fund all aspects of the ceremony. Honoraria The amount of a respectful honoraria should be discussed ahead of time and should consider the time spent preparing for and conducting the ceremony. This may include: - Preparing medicine - Obtaining supplies - Constructing ceremonial spaces Honoraria should be available to the Knowledge Keeper leading the ceremony and any helpers without whom the ceremony couldn't happen. This may include: - Interpreters - Singers - Drummers - Fire keepers It is important to make cash advances available. Knowledge Keepers and helpers may not have the means to offset personal expenses incurred while preparing for the ceremony. As of January 2019, our guideline for honorariums is: - $250 per half day - $500 per full day We have also implemented a practice of distributing 50 per cent of the honoraria in cash at the time of the event and 50 per cent of the honoraria by cheque immediately after the event. This practice has met the needs of the Knowledge Keepers and satisfied university accountability processes. Reconciling the cash advance will be done through Concur. Venue Venue requirements vary by ceremony. A ceremony may be held at the lodge of a Knowledge Keeper or at an external venue, in which case the Knowledge Keeper may provide guidance on what is required of a venue (for example, ability to cover all windows and doors). There are several spaces within Winnipeg, particularly in Indigenous community organizations, that can be used as ceremonial spaces. This is an excellent way to build relationships with and support these organizations. It is important to remember that, while a ceremony may be held at the lodge of a Knowledge Keeper, there may still be costs associated with the facility. Feasting It should be expected that any ceremony will include a feast at its conclusion. These feasts are often potluck style; however, it is still important to be prepared to fully supply the feast. Pre-planning and ensuring the appropriate university hospitality processes are followed will minimize any challenges. Ceremonial supplies It is important to clarify with the Knowledge Keeper what supplies are needed for the ceremony. At times, the Knowledge Keeper may supply everything needed for the ceremony and should be compensated for these expenses. At other times, the gathering of supplies is an important part of preparing for the ceremony. This may include purchasing cloth and tobacco, making tobacco ties or flags and other activities as directed by the Knowledge Keeper. Giveaways There are some ceremonies where having a giveaway at the end is important. On some occasions - in celebration or gratitude - the giveaway is the ceremony itself. In this case, the practice may be purchasing or collecting a variety of gifts that will be distributed to everyone at the ceremony. If a giveaway is a part of the ceremony, it is important to work with the Knowledge Keeper to anticipate the number of people at the event and to purchase or collect gifts as an expression of gratitude and generosity to everyone at the ceremony. In addition to a cash honorarium, it can also be thoughtful to provide a meaningful gift to the Knowledge Keeper and Elders. Protocols for the ceremony Individual Knowledge Keepers have different teachings about protocol. When inviting people to a ceremony, ask the Knowledge Keeper about expectations for the ceremony so that information may be passed on to attendees. Once ceremony expectations are known, an email or letter should be sent out to all who are invited to provide the guidance required for their participation in the ceremony. Clothing Some Knowledge Keepers may have strict teachings about clothing and footwear. For example, some may require that women wear skirts. However, it is also important to clarify with the Knowledge Keeper how two-spirit, non-binary or gender diverse people will be made to feel safe within these protocols. Substance use Asking the Knowledge Keeper about expectations regarding substance will help determine what is required from attendees leading up to the ceremony. Expectations may vary depending on the type of ceremony and the Knowledge Keeper's own teachings. Some may have no requirements, and some may ask participants to abstain in the days leading up to the ceremony.
