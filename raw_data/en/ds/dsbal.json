Beginning next week, a full-service vaccination experience will be available in Spanish, Mandarin, and Haitian Creole, with more languages anticipated to be available on the growing fleet of mobile units by the end of this month. \"As rates of COVID-19 infection fall across the city, our fight against the virus is focused on tearing down barriers to vaccination, and with our mobile language teams, we can now reach more New Yorkers based on the understanding and trust of a shared language,\" said Dr. Ted Long, Executive Director of the NYC Test & Trace Corps and Senior Vice President for Ambulatory Care and Population Health at NYC Health + Hospitals. \"This new initiative builds on the strength of our COVID-19 mobile testing infrastructure to expand access to the vaccine with welcoming service across our communities.\" Starting next week, six mobile language teams will be serving New Yorkers in the languages of Spanish, Mandarin and Haitian Creole. By the end of this month, with the projected addition of teams in Russian, French and Yiddish, it is anticipated that 10 mobile language teams will be available in six languages, to coincide with the expansion of the mobile vaccination fleet of vans to 30 units. With this development, one-third of the mobile vaccination fleet is expected to offer full-service, bilingual language capacity in English and another language. Operated in partnership with DocGo, the mobile language teams will assist New Yorkers with every step of the vaccination process in their own language. Each team includes registration staff to help with check-in and check-out, and clinical staff to administer the vaccine and monitor patients on site during the post-vaccination observation period. Mobile language teams are assigned to locations according to need and what languages are predominantly spoken in an area. Walk-up vaccinations with no appointments required will be available at the following locations next week.

To date, more than 35,000 New Yorkers have been fully vaccinated through the program at 120 unique mobile and pop-up locations including public housing developments, houses of worship and consulates across the five boroughs. \"As we continue our fight against COVID-19, it is critical we eliminate any barriers when it comes to vaccine accessibility and education,\" said Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. \"The launch of this new initiative, having mobile language teams assisting New Yorkers with every step of the vaccination process, is an integral step towards reaching more Bronx residents. I would like to thank NYC Health + Hospitals and NYC Test & Trace Corps for their continued work to get New Yorkers vaccinated and for their efforts to keep us healthy.\" \"With hundreds of languages spoken in Queens alone, reaching our historically underserved and immigrant neighborhoods with a culturally and linguistically competent COVID-19 vaccination effort is an absolute necessity in order to truly put this pandemic behind us,\" said Queens Borough President Donovan Richards, Jr. \"We've endured too much loss and have come too far in our recovery to fall short. We are confident this vital new vaccination initiative will help make these life-saving shots more accessible than ever before for so many of our Queens residents.\" \"New Yorkers from all backgrounds no matter what language they speak should be able to receive COVID-19 vaccination information and services and I'm glad that Spanish, Mandarin, Haitian Creole, and Russian as well as French and Yiddish mobile language teams for mobile vaccinations will be available to meet the needs of these diverse linguistic communities,\" said Manhattan Borough President Gale A. Brewer. All mobile vaccination teams in the Community Vaccine Clinic program offer language access resources. For more information on community clinic locations, "}
