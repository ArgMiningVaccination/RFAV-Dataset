Reversed as to BOLI's conclusion that the Kleins violated ORS 659A.409 and the related grant of injunctive relief; reversed and remanded as to damages; otherwise affirmed. Pet.App.3 LAGESEN, C.J. This case is on remand to us from the United States Supreme Court. The Court vacated and remanded our previous decision, Klein v. BOLI , 289 Or App 507, 410 P3 d 1051 (2017), rev den , 363 Or 224 (2018) ( Klein I ), \"for further consideration in light of Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm'n , 584 US ___, 138 S Ct 1 719, 201 L Ed 2d 35 (2018).\" Klein v. Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries , ___ US ___, 139 S Ct 2713, 2713, 204 L Ed 2d 1107 (2019) ( Klein II ). It subsequently decided Fulton v. Philadelphia , ___ US ___, 141 S Ct 1868, 210 L Ed 2d 137 (2021), and petitioners argue that Fulton too requires reconsideration of our prior analysis. Given this procedural hi story, the particular issue before us is whether the Supreme Court's approach to the Free Exer cise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution in Fulton and Masterpiece Cakeshop calls into question our previous determinations that (1) petitioner Aaron Klein, who operates a bakery, unlawfully discriminated against complainants Rachel and Laurel Bowman-Cryer based on their sexual orientation, in violation of ORS 659A.403, when he refused to provide them with a wedding cake because of his religious beliefs about marriage of couples of the same sex; (2) the Free Exercise Clause does not bar the enforcement of that statute against Aaron; and (3) the Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) permissibly awarded noneconomic damages to Rachel Pet.App.4 and Laurel based in part on a conversation about faith between Aaron and Rachel's mother, Cheryl McPherson, that, according to BOLI's factual findings, Cheryl recounted inaccurately to Rachel and Laurel. 1 Ultimately, we reaffirm our prior decision except insofar as it upheld the damages award. Specifically, we adhere to our prior decision upholding BOLI's determinations that Aaron unlawfully discriminated against the Bowman-Cryers based on sexual orientation, in violation of ORS 659A.403, and concluding that neither the state constitution nor the federal constitution precludes the enforcement of the statute against Aaron, even though the enforcement of the statute burdens Aaron's practice of his faith. We reach a different conclusion with respect to our prior affirmance of BOLI's noneconomic damages award. In so doing, we conclude that Fulton does not displace our previous conclusion that ORS 659A.403 is a generally applicable and neutral law and, consequently, that, under Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith , 494 US 872, 110 S Ct 1595, 108 L Ed 2d 876 (1990), the Free Exercise 1 In our prior decision, we al so concluded that BOLI erred when it determined that peti tioners Aaron and Melissa Klein violated a different statute, ORS 659A.409, through statements that they made after Aaron re fused to supply the Bowman- Cryers with a wedding cake. No party suggests that the Supreme Court's recent decisions displace that aspect of our previous decision. Pet.App.5 Clause does not preclude its enforcement even where, as here, a person's failure to comply with the law stems from the person's adherence to faith obligations. We conclude further, though, that, when viewed in the light of Masterpiece Cakeshop , BOLI's handling of the damages portion of the case does not reflect the neutrality toward religion required by the Free Exercise Clause. We therefore set aside the damages portion of the order and remand for further proceedings related to remedy. I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND The first time it was before us, this case required us to resolve a range of issues. Now, the procedural history has landed our focus on a narrower question: whether the agency order on review comports with the Free Exercise Clause, in view of the Supreme Court's later decisions in Fulton and Masterpiece Cakeshop. To provide context for our analysis, we set forth the substantive and procedural facts relevant to that question. As is our usual practice, we draw the substantive facts from the unchallenged factual findings in the order on review, \"together with facts in the record consistent with those findings.\" OROSHA v. United Parcel Service, Inc. , 312 Or App 424, 425 n 2, 494 P3d 959 (2021); see Klein I , 289 Or App at 511 n 1 (explaining that, under Oregon law, an agency's unchallenged factual findings supply the facts for the purpose of judicial review). When drawing facts from the testimony at the damages hearing, some of which was conflicting, we do so in a manner that resolves conflicts in accordance with the express credibility Pet.App.6 findings contained in the order on review. This matter arose after petitioners Melissa and Aaron Klein, doing business as a bakery called Sweetcakes by Melissa, declined to provide a wedding cake to the Bowman-Cryers. The Kleins did so in accordance with their religious beliefs, which do not recognize marriages be tween two persons of the same sex and treat the celebration of marriages between two persons of the same sex as sinful. The Bowman-Cryers met in college in 2004 and soon became a couple. In 2011, they became foster parents to two children and, in 2012, they decided to get married. Excited about getting married, they began to plan their wedding. Sometime after getting engaged, Rachel and her mother, Cheryl, attended a bridal show in Portland. Melissa had a booth for Sweetcakes by Melissa, advertising the bakery's wedding cakes. Two years earlier, Sweetcakes by Melissa had made the wedding cake for Cheryl's wedding; Rachel liked the cake. Rachel told Melissa that she wanted to order a wedding cake from her and, following the show, made an appointment for a cake tasting at Sweetcakes by Melissa. Both Rachel and Laurel were excited about getting a cake from Sweetcakes by Melissa because of how much they liked the cake that the bakery had made for Cheryl's wedding. On the scheduled date, Rachel and Cheryl went to Sweetcakes by Melissa for the tasting. At the time, Aaron and Melissa had infant twins and, that day, had arranged for Aaron to handle the cake tasting while Melissa cared for the twins at home. During Pet.App.7 the tasting, Aaron asked for the names of the bride and the groom. Rachel responded that there would be two brides and their names were \"Rachel and Laurel.\" Upon hearing that, Aaron, because of his religious beliefs, apologized and stated that they \"do not do cakes for same-sex weddings.\" Rachel started to cry. She felt that she had humiliated her mother, and worried that her mother was ashamed of her, because Cheryl had believed that being gay was wrong until a few years earlier. Cheryl took Rachel by the arm and walked her to the car; Rachel remained distraught and kept apologizing to her mother. Once in the car, Cheryl hugged Rachel and told her that they would find someone to make a wedding cake. They drove a short distance away, but then Cheryl decided she wa nted to return to the bakery to talk to Aaron about the change in her own religious perspective. Although Rachel did not want her to do so, Cheryl wanted to make it, in her words, a \"teaching moment\" because \"but for the grace of God, that was me just a few years ago.\" On returning to the bakery, Cheryl went in by herself while Rachel remained in the car. Cheryl explained to Aaron that she used to share his views, but that her truth had changed when God gave her two gay children. In response, Aaron asked about what the Bible said on the topic and then quoted Leviticus 18:22 to Cheryl: \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\" Recognizing that Aaron was \"not ready to hear [her] truth,\" Cheryl left the bakery. She returned to Pet.App.8 the car and reported to Rachel that Aaron had said that \"her children were an abomination unto God.\" Hearing that Aaron had called her \"an abomination,\" Rachel cried harder. Rachel, who had been raised Southern Baptist, felt \"like they were saying God made a mistake when he made me, that I wasn't supposed to be, that I wasn't supposed to love or be loved or have a family or live a good life and one day go to heaven.\" Rachel and Cheryl returned home, where Rachel immediately went to her bedroom crying. Cheryl told Laurel what had happened, including that Aaron had said \"your children are an abomination.\" Laurel, who was raised Catholic, recognized Aaron's statement as a reference to Leviticus. She took it as an assertion that \"this is a creature not created by God, not created with a soul; they are unworthy of holy love; they are not worthy of life.\" Laurel felt shame and anger and was unable to console Rachel. Laurel submitted a cons umer complaint to the Oregon Department of Justice. Later, Rachel filed a verified complaint with BOLI, alleging that Sweetcakes by Melissa had discriminated against her based on her sexual orientation, in violation of ORS 659A.403. A few months after Rachel, Laurel filed her own BOLI complaint, also alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation. BOLI investigated the complaints. Upon completing the investigation and determining the complaints to be supported by evidence, it filed formal charges against the Kleins. The charges Pet.App.9 alleged violations of both ORS 659A.403, which prohibits a place of public accommodation from discriminating based on sexual orientation, and ORS 659A.409, which, generally speaking, prohibits a place of public accommodati on from publishing any notice \"to the effect\" that th e place will deny services for impermissibly discriminatory reasons, or otherwise engage in unlawful discrimination. The charges also alleged that Aaron had aided and abetted unlawful discrimination by Melissa, in violation of ORS 659A.406. The case was assigned to the Office of Administrative Hearings for a contested case hearing. On cross-motions for summary determination, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that the undisputed facts demonstrated, as a matter of law, that Aaron had violated ORS 659A.403, but had not violated ORS 659A.409. The ALJ determined that Melissa had not violated either statute and, further, that Aaron, consequently, had not aided and abetted Melissa, in violation of ORS 659A.406. In making those determinations, the ALJ rejected the Kleins' contentions that the speech and religion clauses of the First Amendment precluded them from being held liable under Oregon's antidiscrimination laws. The ALJ similarly rejected a contention that three provisions of the Oregon Constitution, Article I, sections 2 and 3, which protect religious rights, and Article I, section 8, which protects speech rights, precluded the application of Oregon's antidiscrimination laws to the Kleins' conduct. Having resolved the issue of liability on Pet.App.10 summary determination, the case proceeded to a six- day contested hearing on damages. BOLI sought a minimum of $150,000 in noneconomic damages against the Kleins, at least $75,000 each for Rachel and Laurel. One disputed factual issue at the damages hearing was what Aaron had said to Cheryl when she returned to the bakery to tell him about how her views had changed. Cheryl testified that Aaron had said, \"Well, I'm sorry, ma'am, but your children are an abomination.\" Aaron, in contrast, testified that, in r e s p o n s e t o C h e r y l ' s e x p l a n a t i o n a s t o h o w h e r religious views had changed, he \"simply stated, 'Why would the Bible say'\u2014and I quoted Leviticus. I did not say it to harm her kids. I did not say it to belittle anybody.\" In closing argument, the parties addressed the role of the Kleins' religious views, and, in particular, what damages, if any, should be awarded in connection with Aaron's quotation of Leviticus. Addressing the issue of the Kleins' right to hold their own religious beliefs, the prosecutor asserted that the public accommodations law was not a restriction on the freedom to have \"prejudices\" but, instead, a restriction on acting on those \"prejudices\" in providing a public accommodation: \"I wanted to end on talking about public accommodation, in general. This was enacted in 1953 in an effort to end a long history of racial segregation in Oregon. And when I was looking through the history, I came across a quote that was cited to an editorial by an Pet.App.11 unknown author called 'Missing the Point on \"Freedom\"' and appeared in 'The Oregonian' on May 21st, 1953, and it said, 'Oregonians are free to harbor what ever prejudices they choose. The civil rights law does not attempt to control prejudice, rather it outlaws overt acts of discrimination in public accommodation.' \"That's exactly what's going on in this case. The Kleins, of course, are allowed to feel and hold whatever beliefs they hold dear to them. But when they operate in a public place and provide goods and services to the public, they have to do so with out discrimination.\" Both sides also addressed the issue of what damages, if any, should be awarded based on the emotional distress that Rachel and Laurel suffered upon Cheryl's recounting of Aaron's alleged statement. With respect to Rachel, the prosecutor argued that the conversation \"made her feel like she was a mistake, that she wasn't entitled to love, that she wasn't entitled to a family, and that she'd be barred from heaven.\" With respect to Laurel, the prosecutor argued: \"When I asked her how it made her feel to hear the word 'abomination,' she said she couldn't imagine someone who didn't know them basically saying they were unworthy of love and unworthy of life. She also feared that it would affect this tenuous new relationship with Cheryl and having Cheryl in their lives.\" Pet.App.12 Responding to the poin t, the Kleins' lawyer pointed out both that neither Rachel nor Laurel had been present when Aaron made the statement and that, according to Aaron, he had not made the statement that Cheryl reported. Instead, Aaron \"quot[ed] a scripture verse.\" In rebuttal, the BOLI prosecutor disputed that Aaron had quoted a Bible verse but asserted that it \"doesn't really matter\" what he actually said. The prosecutor argued that what mattered was that Aaron used the word \"abomination,\" and how that word affected Rachel and Laurel: \"The reference to 'abomination.' We specifically asked what that word made them feel like, and that's important because how it was couched doesn't really matter; the word is what resonated with the Complainants.\" In his proposed order, the ALJ credited Aaron's testimony about what he had said to Cheryl. The ALJ did so based on the fact that he had previously determined the content of Aaron's statement during the summary determination phase of the case, something that, in the ALJ's view, obviated the need to address the conflict presented by Cheryl's testimony. The ALJ, in addition, made explicit credibility findings. Regarding Aaron, the ALJ found that he was a credible witness in all but the part of his testimony that addressed a Facebook post made after the date he refused service to the Bowman- Cryers. Regarding Cheryl, the ALJ declined to credit portions of her testimony, explaining that because of \"exaggerations\" in her testimony, \"the forum has only Pet.App.13 credited [Cheryl's] testimony when it was either (a) undisputed, or (b) disputed but corroborated by other credible testimony.\" Despite those credibility findings, the ALJ, nevertheless, proposed awarding damages in part to compensate Rachel and Laurel for the emotional distress that they experienced upon Cheryl telling them that Aaron had said that her children were abominations. Discussing the emotional suffering that it caused Rachel, the ALJ determined: \"When [Cheryl] told her that [Aaron] had called her 'an abomination,' this made [Rachel] cry even more. [Rachel], who was brought up as a Southern Baptist, interpreted [Aaron's] use of the word 'abomination' [to] mean that God made a mistake when he made her, that she wasn't supposed to exist, and that she had no right to love or be loved, have a family, or go to heaven.\" Discussing the emotional su ffering that it caused Laurel, the ALJ determined: \"When [Cheryl] and [Rachel] arrived home on January 17, 2013, after their cake tasting at Sweetcakes, [Cheryl] told [Laurel] that [Aaron] had told them did 'not do same-sex weddings' and that [Aaron] had told Cheryl that 'your children are an abomination.' [Laurel] was 'flabbergasted' and she became very upset and very angry. [Laurel], who was raised as a Roman Pet.App.14 Catholic, recognized [Aaron's] statement as a reference from Leviticus. She was 'shocked' to hear that [Aaron] had referred to her as an 'abomination.' Based on her religious background, she understood the term 'abomination' to mean 'this is a creature not created by God, not created with a soul. They are unworthy of holy love. They are not worthy of life.' Her immediate thought was that this would never have happened, had she not asked [Rachel] to marry her. Because of that, she felt shame. Like [Rachel], she also worried about how it would affect [Cheryl's] relatively recent acceptance of [Rachel's] sexual orientation.\" Ultimately, the order proposed awarding a total of $135,000 in noneconomic damages, $75,000 to Rachel and $60,000 to Laurel. The Kleins and BOLI both filed numerous exceptions to the proposed order with the BOLI commissioner. Among other things, the Kleins asserted that damages were not appropriate for the distress caused by Cheryl's report about what Aaron had said, considering that the ALJ's own factual findings determined that Aaron had not said what Cheryl reported he had: \"Finally, the findings concerning [Cheryl's] false statement attributed to [Aaron] 'that your children are an abomination' and [Laurel's] reactions to it, are not a result of the denial of cake services and are therefore irrelevant in their entirety, especially since Pet.App.15 they are inconsistent with the earlier finding that [Aaron] made no such statement to [Cheryl]. Even worse, it was error for the ALJ to attribute legal responsibility to [Aaron and Melissa] for the false statement by Cheryl, an intervening cause which could not conceivably result in damage to Complainants, who weren't present to hear it.\" (Record citations omitted.) The commissioner largely adopted the ALJ's order as BOLI's final orde r, including the proposed damages award, although he rejected the ALJ's determination on summary determination that the Kleins had not violated ORS 659A.409. On that point, BOLI determined to the contrary that both Aaron and Melissa violated that statute by making certain statements during a television interview about the case, and by taping a statement addressing their intent to adhere to their religious beliefs to the door of the bakery. On the disputed point of what Aaron had said to Cheryl, BOLI adopted the finding that Aaron had quoted Leviticus to Cheryl. In so doing, BOLI eliminated the statement, contained in the ALJ's proposed order, that suggested the summary determination ruling obviated the need to resolve the conflict between Cheryl's version of events and Aaron's. BOLI also adopted credibility findings that the ALJ had made, including the ones specifically Pet.App.16 addressing the credibilit y of Aaron and Cheryl. Finally, BOLI adopted the ALJ's determinations about the emotional distress suffered by Rachel and Laurel upon being told by Cheryl of Aaron's statement. The Kleins petitioned our court for judicial review of the final order, as permitted by the Oregon Administrative Procedures Act (APA). On review, we upheld BOLI's determination that Aaron engaged in unlawful discrimination, in violation of ORS 659A.403, by refusing to provide a cake to Rachel and Laurel on account of their sexual orientation. Klein I , 289 Or App at 510-11. In so doing, we rejected a range of arguments asserting that the speech and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment, and Article I, sections 2, 3, and 8, of the Oregon Constitution, precluded the application of the statute to the Kleins because of the burden that it imposed on their ability to express and practice their religious views. Id. We reversed the final order insofar as it concluded that the Kleins violated ORS 659A.409 by making the statements identified by the commissioner as the basis for liability. Id. at 511. We also rejected the Kleins' argument that the order did not satisfy the substantial evidence or substantial reason standards imposed by ORS 183.482(8)(c). Id. at 559. In particular, we rejected the Kleins' argument that the order lacked substantial reason because it awarded damages \"for harm attributable to being called 'abomination[s],'\" but had found, as fact, that Aaron had not said that. Id. Pointing to the fact that the BOLI prosecutor had argued in closing that it did not matter exactly how it Pet.App.17 was \"couched,\" as well as aspects of the final order that appeared focused on the effect of the word \"abomination\" on the Bowman-Cryers, we reasoned that BOLI's order was not premised on a finding that Aaron had, in fact, ca lled Rachel and Laura \"abomination[s].\" Id. (alterations in Klein I ). Rather, we concluded, it was based on a finding that Aaron had used the term \"abomination\" in the course of explaining why he was denying service to the complainants on account of their sexual orientation, and that his use of the word caused harm, regardless of what he had actually said to Cheryl. Klein I , 289 Or App at 559-60. Relying on that line of reasoning, we rejected the Kleins' contention that the damages award was inconsistent with BOLI's credibility determinations, and that it otherwise was not supported by substantial reason. Id. The Kleins petitioned the Oregon Supreme Court for review of our decision but that court denied review. Klein v. Bureau of Labor and Industries , 363 Or 224, 434 P3d 25 ( 2018). They then petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari . That court granted certiorari , vacated our decision, and remanded to us for reconsideration in light of its decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop . Klein II , ___ US at ___, 139 S Ct at 2713. On remand, the parties submitted supplemental briefs and provided oral argument, addressing what bearing Masterpiece Cakeshop has on our review on reconsideration of BOLI's final order. Following the United States Supreme Court's decision in Fulton , the Kleins moved for leave to file a memorandum of additional authorities to address the potential Pet.App.18 application of the Free Exercise Clause analysis in that case. We allowed the motion. II. ANALYSIS This procedural histor y gives us two related Free Exercise Clause issues to resolve: (1) whether, in view of Fulton , ORS 659A.403 is a \"generally applicable\" law for purposes of the Smith framework; and (2) whether, in view of Masterpiece Cakeshop , the order on review comports with the First Amendment's requirement that government action be neutral toward religion. Both questions are legal questions, implicating the agency's interpretation and application of the requirements of the First Amendment. That means our review is for errors of law. 2 ORS 183.482(8)(a); Green Thumb Landscape and 2 Although the Kleins' briefing before BOLI and in their initial briefing to us did not fu lly anticipate the direction the law would take in either Fulton or Masterpiece Cakeshop, this case, from the start, has centered on the question of whether the application of the law to the Kleins' conduct is consistent with their rights under the First Amendment, including the Free Exercise Clause. In particular, the Kleins asserted in their opening brief to us that BOLI's application of ORS 659A.403 to the Kleins \"was, at best, discretionary and done for the specific purpose of forcing business owners with moral reservations about same-sex marriage to eith er violate their consciences or go out of business. That is impermissible targeting.\" (Emphasis in original.) They also questioned whether the law, as written or as applied, was neutral and ge nerally applicable for purposes of the Free Exercise Clause. Under those circumstances, we consider it appropriate to consider the Kleins' arguments on remand about how Fulton and Masterpiece Cakeshop bear on the Free Exercise Clause issues that they raised in their initial appellate brief to us. Pet.App.19 Maintenance v. BOLI , 304 Or App 349, 350, 467 P3d 43, rev den , 366 Or 826 (2020). A.Fulton We start with the Kleins' argument that Fulton requires reversal. In our original opinion, we rejected the Kleins' contention that the application of ORS 659A.403 to their conduct violated their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, as it applies to the states via the doctrine of incorporation. Relying on Smith , we concluded that ORS 659A.403 is a \"neutral\" and \"generally applicable\" law and, conseque ntly, did \"not offend the Free Exercise Clause simply because\" of its incidental effect of burdening the Kleins' practice of religion. Klein I , 289 Or App at 544-45. In their memorandum of a dditional authorities, the Kleins argue that Fulton requires a different conclusion. In particular, they assert that, under Fulton , ORS 659A.403 is not a \"generally applicable\" law for purposes of the Free Exercise Clause analysis under Smith . We disagree. In Fulton , the Court considered a free exercise challenge to the City of Philadelphia's foster-care contract policy, which prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation. Under the policy, the city required an organization contracting with the city to provide foster care services to agree to a standard contractual provision stating that the organization \" 'shall not reject a child or family including, but not limited to, * * * prospective foster or adoptive parents, for Services Pet.App.20 based upon * * * their * * * sexual orientation * * * unless an exception is granted by the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee, in his/her sole discretion.' \" Fulton , ___ US at ___, 141 S Ct at 1878. The plaintiff, Catholic Social Services (CSS), a foster care agency in the city, argued that the policy, as applied to it, violated its free exercise rights because CSS's religious views prohibited it from certifying married couples of the same sex as foster care providers. Id. ___ at ___, 141 S Ct at 1875-76. The Court agreed with CSS. It reasoned that the policy's allowance of discreti onary exceptions to the nondiscrimination bar meant that the policy was not \"generally applicable\" for purposes of Smith . Id. at ___, 141 S Ct at 1878. In other words, under Fulton , to be \"generally applicable,\" a la w cannot have carved-out individual exceptions; individual exceptions defeat the notion of generality. Further, when a law \"incorporates a system of individual exemptions\" that are discretionary, the Free Exercise Clause mandates the provision of a religious-hardship exemption, unless there is a compelling reason not to supply a religious-hardship exemption. Id. The Court concluded that the city had identified no such compelling interest in that case. Id. at ___, ___141 S Ct at 1881-82. It reasoned that the city's interest \"in the equal treatment of prospective foster parents and foster children,\" although a \"weighty one,\" was not an interest that could justify the denial of a religious- hardship exemption to CSS in light of the exceptions available to others. Id. at ___, 141 S Ct at 1 882. In their memorandum of a dditional authorities, the Kleins urge us to conclude that Fulton controls Pet.App.21 this case. Notably, however, the Kleins do not argue\u2014 and could not argue\u2014that the prohibition on discrimination based on sexual orientation by places of public accommodation in ORS 659A.403 allows for individual exceptions. As written, ORS 659A.403 (2011), 3 without exception or allowances for discretionary exceptions, bars discrimination based on sexual orientation by places of public accommodation: \"(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any place of public accommodation, without any distinction, discrimination or restriction on account of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age if the individual is 18 years of age or older. \"(2) Subsection (1) of this section does not prohibit: \"(a) The enforcement of laws governing the consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors and the frequenting by minors of places of public accommodation where alcoholic beverages are served; or 3 The legislature has amended ORS 659A.403 several times since BOLI initiated this case; none of the amendments bears on the issues presented here. Pet.App.22 \"(b) The offering of spec ial rates or services to persons 50 years of age or older. \"(3) It is an unlawful practice for any person to deny full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any place of public accommodation in violation of this section.\" ORS 659A.403 (2011). Faced with this exception-free statute when it comes to the prohibition on discrimination based on sexual orientation, 4 the Kleins look elsewhere for exceptions: the Oregon Constitution. They point out\u2014correctly\u2014that the Oregon Supreme Court has stated in several cases, originating with Cooper v. Eugene Sch. Dist. No. 4J , 301 Or 358, 36869, 723 P2d 298 (1986), that Article I, sections 2 and 3, of the Oregon Constitution allow for an individual claim to a religious exemption from the application of a general law: \"With regard to rules that are generally applicable and neutral toward religion, however, the only issues for us to cons ider are whether there was 4 We acknowledge that the text of the statute contains exceptions to the prohibition on age discrimination. See Dalbeck v. Bi-Mart Corp. , 315 Or App 129, 131-40, 500 P3d 711 (2021) (analyzing the scope of the statutory exceptions to the bar on age discrimination contained in ORS 659A.403). The Kleins do not suggest that the exceptions to the bar on age discrimination supply an exception to the bar on discrimination based on sexual orientation and, in any event, any such suggestion would be implausible as a textual matter. Pet.App.23 'statutory authority to make such a regulation,' or whether we should grant 'an individual claim to exemption on religious grounds.' \" See State v. Hickman , 358 Or 1, 15-16, 358 P3d 987 (2015) (quoting , 301 Or at 368-69); State v. Brumwell , 350 Or 93, 108, 249 P3d 965 (2011) (reiterating that where a law is neutral toward religion and generally applicable, the only issues under Article I, sections 2 and 3, are the authority to promulgate the law and an individual claim to an exemption on religious grounds). From that Oregon Supreme Court mention of individual claims to exemptions on religious grounds, the Kleins reason that (1) ORS 659A.403 allows for exceptions by way of Article I, sections 2 and 3, if not its own text; and (2) under Fulton , a religious exemption to ORS 659A.403 must be extended to them because, also under Fulton , the state's interest in nondiscrimination is insufficient to justify the denial of a religious exemption. We do not read Cooper , Hickman , Brumwell , or any of the other cases that have quoted Cooper on the point, to stand for the proposition that Article I, sections 2 and 3, 5 grant Oregon courts the discretion to grant religious exemptions from generally applicable, neutral statutes that do not contain their 5 Article I, section 2, of the Oregon Constitution states: \"All men shall be secure in the Natural right, to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences.\" Article I, section 3, of the Oregon Constitution states: \"No law shall in any ca se whatever control the free exercise, and enjoyment of religeous (sic) opinions, or interfere with the rights of conscience.\" Pet.App.24 own, legislatively-crafted exceptions. That would be a potentially vast, and unusual, conferral of legislative authority on the courts, and is not something that follows in any obvious way from the text of Article I, sections 2 and 3, or the structure of the government under the Oregon Constitution. Instead, we read the Oregon Supreme Court's cases to stand for the proposition that an individual may be able to make a case that those provisions, as a matter of law , require the grant of a religious exemption to a generally applicable and neutral law. To make a case that either Article I, section 2, or Article I, section 3, compelled the recognition of individual religious exemptions from a generally applicable, neutral statute, an individual would need to demonstrate, under Oregon's well-established methodology for construing th e original provisions of our state constitution, that one or both of those provisions require an individual exemption to a generally applicable law. See generally Priest v. Pierce , 314 Or 411, 416, 840 P2d 65 (1992). That is, the individual would need to demonstrate that, in light of \"[i]ts specific wording, the case law surrounding it, and the historical circums tances that led to its creation,\" either Article I, section 2, or Article I, section 3, requires a grant of an individual religious exemption under the circumstances present here. Id. at 415-16; see Hon. Jack L. Landau, An Introduction to Oregon Constitutional Interpretation , 55 Willamette L Rev 261, 318 (2019) (explaining that Oregon courts discern the meaning and application of state constitutional provisions through \"analysis of the text of a provision in its historical context, with a view to discerning how that provision would have Pet.App.25 been understood at the time of its adoption and what general principles animated that understanding\"). In this case, as we observed in our original opinion, the Kleins have not developed an argument under the Priest framework that Article I, sections 2 and 3, require the grant of a religious exemption from ORS 659A.403. Klein I , 289 Or App at 549 (\"The Kleins have not offered a focused argument for why the Oregon Constitution requires an exemption in this case, under the methodology for interpreting our constitution.\"). They did not do so in their original briefs to us, and they have not done so now. Beyond that, if the Kleins had developed and prevailed on an argument in accordance with the Priest framework that Article I, section 2 or 3, requires that they be granted an exemption from ORS 659A.403, then there would be no need to consider Fulton or the First Amendment at all. That is, if the Kleins had shown under the applicable interpretive framework that those provisions require th e grant of an individual exemption, then the Kleins would have obtained the relief they sought under the provisions of the Oregon Constitution, without regard to Fulton . 6 6 By omitting to develop stat e constitutional analysis in presenting their claims to us, the Kleins overlooked Oregon's longstanding and preferred approach to constitutional questions, under which claims are to be addressed under the state constitution before they are addressed under the federal constitution. Although preferred, Oregon's approach to resolving constitutional questions under the state constitution before considering the federal co nstitution generally is not a b a s i s o n w h i c h t o d e p a r t f r o m \"the bedrock principle of Pet.App.26 For those reasons, the Kleins have not demonstrated that Fulton alters our prior conclusion that ORS 659A.403 is a \"generally applicable\" law for purposes of Smith , nor our related conclusion that, under Smith , the application of the law to Aaron's conduct of denying cake-making services based on sexual orientation does not violate the Kleins' rights under the Free Exercise Clause. Klein I , 289 Or App at 543-50. B.Masterpiece Cakeshop The remaining question is how, if at all, the Supreme Court's decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop bears on our assessment of the order on review. Before addressing the parties' competing arguments about how that case affects this one, we set forth the key facts of that case and, then, our understanding of the job the United States Supreme Court has given us. Much like this case, Masterpiece Cakeshop involved a Colorado agency's determination that a baker, Phillips, and his bakery, Masterpiece Cakeshop, violated the state's antidiscrimination laws by refusing to supply a wedding cake to a same-sex couple. Masterpiece Cakeshop , 584 US at ___, 138 S Ct at 1723. As here, the agency rejected Phillips' appellate jurisprudence that co urts generally should decide cases as framed by the parties' properly raised and preserved arguments,\" particularly where an appellant has multiple opportunities to deve lop the state constitutional argument but has not done so. State v. Link , 367 Or 625, 640-42, 482 P3d 28 (2021). Pet.App.27 claim that the application of the state's prohibition on discrimination violated his free exercise rights, relying on Smith . Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1726. The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed, also relying on Smith , and the Colorado Supreme Court denied review. Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1727. On Phillips' petition, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari . Id. Ultimately, though, the Court never addressed the question of the legal correctness of the agency's (and the court's) ruling. Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1 729. Instead, the Court set aside the agency's decision based on its determination that the agency's \"treatment of Ph illips' case violated the State's duty under the First Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint.\" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1731. The court explained that the \"requisite religious neutrality * * * must be strictly observed,\" and determined that \"the Commission's consideration of Phillips' case was neither tolerant nor respectful of Phillips' religious beliefs.\" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1731-32. In reaching that conclusion, the Court stressed that \"[t]he Free Exercise Clause bars 'even subtle departures from neutrality' on matters of religion,\" and cautioned that \"[t]he Constitution 'commits government itself to religious tolerance, and upon even slight suspicion that proposals for state intervention stem from animosity to religion or distrust of its practices, all officials must pause to remember their own high duty to the Constitution and the rights it secures.' \" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1731 (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Pet.App.28 Hialeah , 508 US 520, 534, 547, 113 S Ct 2 217, 124 L Ed 2d 472 (1993)). The Court expanded on its decision in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc . That case addressed whether a legislative decision\u2014a city ordinance\u2014comported with the First Amendment's neutrality requirement. In Masterpiece Cakeshop , the Court projected the principles of Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. onto a different field: direct appellate review of an adjudicative decision. The Court explained that in evaluating the religious neutrality of a legislative or adjudicative action, \"[f]actors relevant to the assessment of government neutrality include 'the historical background of the decision under challenge, the specific series of events leading to the enactment or official policy in question, and the legislative or administrative history, including contemporaneous statements made by members of the decisionmaking body.' \" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1731 (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. , 508 US at 540). Considering the whole record of the proceedings, the Court determined that \"[t]he Civil Rights Commission's treatment of [Phillip's] case has some elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs that motivated his objection.\" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1729. The Court identified two primary things that led it to \"draw the inference that Phillips' religious objection was not considered with the neutralit y that the Free Exercise clause requires\": (1) statements by the commissioners during the proceedings that were dismissive of the baker's religious beliefs and that were not discussed or Pet.App.29 disavowed on review by the Colorado Court of Appeals; and (2) the commission's differential treatment and allowance of other conscience-based objections to application of the antidiscrimination law. Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1730-32. As to statements, the Court observed that, during the course of the pr oceedings, members of the commission \"endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial domain, implying that religious beliefs and persons are less than fully welcome in Colorado's business community.\" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1729. It supported that observation by pointing to statements by some of the commissioners during the public hearings on the case. At the first hearing, \"One commissioner suggested that [the baker] can believe 'what he wants to believe,' but cannot act on his religious beliefs 'if he decides to do business in the state.' A few moments later, the commissioner restated the same position: '[I]f a business man wants to do business in the state and he's got an issue with the\u2014the law's impacting his personal belief system, he needs to look at being able to compromise.' \" Id. (record citations omitted). The Court noted that although those statements were susceptible to a benign interpretation, they also \"might be seen as inappropriate and dismissive comments showing lack of due consideration for [the baker's] free exercise rights and the dilemma he faced.\" Id. Then, at the second hearing, another commissioner said \"far Pet.App.30 more\" disparaging things about Phillips' beliefs: \" 'I would also like to reiterate what we said in the hearing or the last meeting. Freedom of religion and religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, whether it be slavery, whether it be the holocaust, whether it be\u2014I mean, we\u2014 we can list hundreds of situations where freedom of religion has been used to justify discrimination. And to me it is one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use to\u2014to use their religion to hurt others.' \" Id. The Court explained that the statement disparaged the baker's \"religion in at least two distinct ways: by describing it as despicable, and also by characterizing it as merely rhetorical\u2014something insubstantial and even insincere.\" Id. Noting that none of the other commissioners objected to those statements, and that the state appellate court neither mentioned nor expressed concern about their content, the Court could not \"avoid the conclusion that these statements cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the Commission's adjudication of [the baker's] case.\" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1729-30. As for differential treatment, the Court noted that the commission on three prior occasions had \"considered the refusal of bakers to create cakes with images that conveyed disapproval of same-sex marriage, along with religious text,\" and, on each Pet.App.31 occasion, determined that the bakers were justified in refusing service based on their views that the messages they were asked to convey were hateful and discriminatory. Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1730. In contrast, in Phillips' case, the commission ruled that he was not justified in refusing to provide the wedding cake, taking the opposite view: \"that any message the requested cake would carry would be attributed to the customer, not to the baker.\" Id. Although Phillips pointed out that difference in treatment to the Colorado Court of Appeals, that court addressed the differential treatment only \"in passing,\" and accepted the rationale that the difference in treatment was warranted because the bakers in the prior cases had denied service based on the offensiveness of the message that they were being asked to convey, not based on impermissible discrimination. Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1730-31. That analysis was problematic as a constitutional matter because it was not viewpoint neutral: \"The Colorado court's attempt to account for the difference in treatment elevates one view of what is offensive over another and itself sends a signal of official disapproval of Phillips' religious beliefs.\" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1731. Because of those features of the Colorado adjudication, the Court held that the commission's decision was the product of a hostility that \"was inconsistent with the First Amendment's guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion.\" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1732. It emphasized \"that the government, if it is to respect the Constitution's guarantee of free exercise, cannot impose regulations that are hostile to the religious Pet.App.32 beliefs of affected citizens and cannot act in a manner that passes judgment upon or presupposes the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices.\" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1731. The Court concluded by observing: \"The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market.\" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1732. From the perspective of an intermediate appellate court called upon to apply the holding of Masterpiece Cakeshop on direct judicial review of an agency adjudication, it is difficult to discern, precisely, the rule of law announced or how to apply it. The Court did not identify an applicable standard of review, and its opinion poses different alternatives. Those range from a \"slight suspicion\" that the proceeding was not neutral to religious beliefs, to \"elements of a clear and impermissible hostility\" to religious beliefs, to indica tions of \"subtle departures from neutrality.\" Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1729, 1731. The Court also did not iden tify what party bears the burden of persuasion on a claim that an adjudication was not neutral when the case is in a direct review Pet.App.33 posture.7 It did not explain whether the question is primarily one of law or one of fact. To the extent the issue presents a factual question, the Court did not identify a standard of proof, or explain how fact-finding accords with the usual role of an appellate court, a role that typically does not encompass fact-finding. Must the government persuade the court that it acted in compliance with the neutrality requirement, or must the party claiming the lack of neutral treatment persuade the court of the non-neutral treatment? How convinced must a reviewing tribunal be of the presence or absence of non- neutrality to set aside or sustain an agency's decision? Despite all these questions about how to conduct the review required under Masterpiece Cakeshop , we discern three principles to guide our review on remand. The first is that, in evaluating on direct review a litigant's claim that an adjudication is premised, in whole or in part, on unconstitutional hostility to religious beliefs, a reviewing court must examine the entire record of the case, including each 7 In Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. , the Court confronted a claim of nonneutral ity in a different procedural posture. The plaintiffs in that case brought a civil rights action under 42 USC \u00a7 1983 to challenge the ordinance at issue, and they requested a number of remedies, including a declaration that the ordinance unlawfully targeted their religion, in violation of the Free Exercise Clause. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. , 508 US at 528-29. The trial court held a 9-day bench trial to develop the factual record related to the plaintiffs' claim that the ordinance was not religiously neutral. Id. at 528. Pet.App.34 stage of the case. The second is that, where, as here, a governmental adjudicator is called upon to determine whether a person's conduct violates a generally applicable, neutral law, and that conduct was motivated by a religious be lief, the adjudicator must walk a tightwire, acting scrupulously to ensure that the adjudication targets only the unlawful conduct, and is not, in any way, the product of the adjudicator's hostility toward the belief itself. Third, and finally, because even \"subtle departures\" from neutrality violate the First Amendment, even \"subtle departures\" require some form of corrective action from a reviewing court. Id. at ___, 138 S Ct at 1731. When the whole record of this case is considered in light of those principles, and the specific aspects of the Colorado adjudication that the Supreme Court deemed problematic in Masterpiece Cakeshop , one portion of it evidences the type of subtle departure from neutrality that the Supreme Court identified in that case. 8 For reasons that we elaborate on, the prosecutor's closing argument apparently equating the Kleins' religious beliefs with \"prejudice,\" together with the agency's reasoning for imposing damages in connection with Aaron's quotation of Leviticus, reflect that the agency acted in a way that passed judgment on the Kleins' religious beliefs, something that is 8 In their supplemental briefing, the Kleins discuss a range of things that, in their view, demonstrate that the proceeding was not religiously neutral. We address only those that, upon our whole record review, have convinced us that BOLI handled this matter in a way that deviated from the strict neutrality required under Masterpiece Cakeshop . Pet.App.35 impermissible under Masterpiece Cakeshop . First, the prosecutor's closing argument suggests that the Kleins' religious beliefs equate to \"prejudice,\" in a way that resembles how one of the Colorado commissioners equated Phillips' religious beliefs to \"rhetoric.\" The prosecutor discussed the history of the public accommodations law, and how it left Oregonians \" 'free to harbor whatever prejudices they choose' \" but simply outlawed acts of discrimination in public accommodations. She then asserted: \"That's exactly what's going on in this case . The Kleins, of course, are allowed to feel and hold whatever beliefs they hold dear to them. But when they operate in a public place and provide goods and services to the public, they have to do so with out discrimination.\" (Emphasis added.) One way to understand that line of argument is as identifying the Kleins' religious beliefs with the pejorative term \"prejudice.\" In that way, the argument appears to pass judgment on the Kleins' beliefs, treating the beliefs as the equivalent of mere prejudice, and dismissing the dilemma of conscience faced by persons who believe that their faith demands one thing of them, while the law demands another. Although the BOLI prosecutor's statements were made in closing argument, and the BOLI commissioner, not the prosecutor, ultimately rendered the final order on review, the prosecutor was acting on behalf of BOLI in making those statements, and Pet.App.36 the commissioner did nothing to disavow them in the final order that he issued on behalf of the agency. Cf. Masterpiece Cakeshop , 584 US at ___, 138 S Ct at 1729-30 (observing that Colorado Court of Appeals did not mention troubling statements or express concern, and that briefs to the Supreme Court did not disavow or express concern about troubling statements). In cases in which a prosecutor is independent from the ultimate adjudicator, we do not think there would be a basis to attribute the prosecutor's statements to the adjudicator. For example, if an executive-branch prosecutor made a disparaging statement about religion in a criminal case tried in a judicial-branch court, because of the independence of the branches, there likely would not be a basis to attribute the executive-branch actor's potential hostility to religion to the judicial-branch actor, even if the judicial-branch actor did not specifically disavow the executive-branch actor's statement. But under BOLI's statutory structure, BOLI's prosecutor is not independent of the final adjudicator, the commissioner. By statute, the commissioner is the head of BOLI. ORS 651.030(1) (\"[BOLI] shall be under the control of the Commissioner of [BOLI] which office hereby is created.\"). By statute, the commissioner also is the one who has the authority to initiate the formal charges that start a case like this one. ORS 659A.845. By statute, even when the case is tried to the Office of Administrative Hearings initially, as it was here, the commissioner retains full control over the content of the order that results: \"The commissioner may affirm, reverse, modify or supplement the determinations, conclusions or order Pet.App.37 of any special tribunal or hearing officer appointed under this subsection.\" ORS 659A.850(1)(a). Because the BOLI prosecut or acts on behalf of BOLI, which is under the control of the commissioner, absent a disavowal by the commissioner of a prosecutor's position in the context of deciding a contested case, it is infer able that the prosecutor's position is the position of the agency, including its commissioner. Our initial decision in this case underscores that lack of independence. There, we implicitly relied on the interdependence of BOLI and its prosecutor in rejecting the Kleins' substantial- reason argument when we pointed to the prosecutor's closing argument as indicative of BOLI's reasoning, although BOLI's order di d not make the reasoning explicit. Klein , 289 Or App at 557-60. In so doing, we effectively recognized that the prosecutor represented the agency's viewpoint. In any event, given the agency's structure, that the prosecutor took that position, and the commissioner did not disavow it, gives rise to at least a \"slight suspicion\" that the position is one shared by the agency, including its head and final adjudicator, the commissioner. Similarly to what happened in Masterpiece Cakeshop , that specter of non-neutrality materializes into the affirmative conclusion that BOLI at least subtly departed from princi ples of neutrality when it awarded noneconomic damages based on Aaron's quotation of Leviticus. BOLI found as fact that Aaron quoted Leviticus during a discussion with Cheryl about their differing reli gious perspectives on marriage by couples of the same sex. It also found as fact that Aaron's testimony about what he said in Pet.App.38 that discussion, and his intention in saying it, was credible. Cheryl had returned to the store in the hopes of a \"teaching moment\" to share with Aaron how she used to share his be liefs but, as a result of her experience, no longer believes the same things. It was in response to Cheryl's sharing of her perspective that Aaron asked why the Bible states what it does, and he quoted Leviticus. Aaron testified that he did not call Cheryl's children abominations or make the statement with the intention of doing so, testimony that BOLI credited over Cheryl's competing version of events. Cheryl nonetheless told Rachel and Laurel that Aaron had said that her children were abominations, and BOLI sought and imposed noneconomic damages based on the distress that Rachel and Laurel suffered upon hearing Cheryl's characterization of what Aaron had said. As we recognized the first time this matter was before us, in so doing, BOLI adopted the perspective of its prosecutor that it did no t really matter what Aaron actually had said, because of the distress caused by Aaron's use of the word \"abomination,\" and because Aaron had made those statements in the course of denying services. BOLI's determination that it did not matter whether Aaron had, in fact, called Cheryl's children abominations or, instead, quoted Leviticus in response to Cheryl's explanation of her change in perspective, could be understood to indicate the same kind of dismissiveness the Supreme Court found impermissible. Taking the position that it did not matter factually what Aaron had said tends to suggest hostility or dismissiveness because it is not typical to hold someone liable in damages for Pet.App.39 something they did not, in fact, say or do. On the contrary, the facts matter when imposing liability for damages, and there is a significant difference, factually, between a person who quotes a topically relevant Bible passage that contains an inflammatory word to respond to a suggestion that they might change their beliefs, and a person who calls another person a name using that same inflammatory word. Although that hostility could be a general hostility toward Aaron based on the harm his words caused, rather th an hostility toward his religious beliefs, the prosecutor's prior apparent equation of Aaron's religious beliefs with prejudice, points at least somewhat in the direction of the latter. Additionally, BOLI never distinguished or explained why it was equating Aaron's identification of a portion of the Bible that informs his religious beliefs\u2014in the context of a discussion explicitly about religious beliefs\u2014with calling the other person's children a horrible name. Instead, BOLI rested its decision on the fact that in his conversation with Cheryl, Aaron uttered the inflammatory word \"abomination.\" Similar to what happened in Masterpiece Cakeshop , BOLI appears to have treated Aaron's expression of his beliefs as something closer to \"rhetoric\" than an attempt to explain the source for his beliefs, even though it credited Aaron's version of the exchange with Cheryl. Ultimately, what indicates that BOLI at least subtly departed from the requirement of strict neutrality in its damages award is the fact that it expressly awarded damages in part based on what it found as fact to be Aaron's expression of his views in the context of a religious dialogue. The conversation Pet.App.40 that Cheryl and Aaron had when she returned to the store is a conversation that is dividing faith communities. See, e.g. , Campbell Robertson & Elizabeth Dias, United Methodist Church Announces Plan to Split Over Same-Sex Marriage , NY Times (Jan 3, 2020), https:// www. nytimes.com/2020/01/03/us/methodist-split-gay- marriage. html (accessed Jan 18, 2022) (reporting that leaders of the United Methodist Church, \"the second-largest Protestant denomination in the United States,\" had announced \"a plan that would formally split the church, citing 'fundamental differences' over same-sex marriage after years of division\"). According to BOLI's findings and the evidence in the record consistent with those findings, Cheryl and Aaron were talking about their respective religious beliefs when Aaron, in response to Cheryl's explanation about why her religious perspective had changed, asked why the Bible says what it does in Leviticus. Given that circumstance, to the extent that it both pleaded (as prosecutor), then proved to itself and ordered the Kleins to pay monetary damages based on Aaron's statements in that conversation, BOLI effectively took a side in an ongoing religious discussion. That does not square with the obligation of government to remain strictly neutral toward religion and strictly neutral toward particular religious beliefs. Rather, given BOLI's overarching and multifaceted role in this case, it directly suggests a governmental preference for one faith perspective over another in what remains an ongoing, emotionally hard discussion within American communities of faith. In reaching this conclusion, we do not mean to Pet.App.41 suggest that the use of a Bible quote immunizes a speaker from liability for emotional distress damages. It is easy to envision circumstances in which, as a factual matter, a speaker might employ biblical references to engage in name-calling and inflict emotional distress. We also do not mean to suggest that Aaron's statement, as recounted to them, did not cause the Bowman-Cryers the severe emotional distress that BOLI found it caused them. The record amply supports the finding that Aaron's statement, as communicated to them by Cheryl, made the Bowman-Cryers feel alienated from their faith, causing them significant emotional distress. But, in this instance, according to BOLI's factual findings, in the context of a conversation about religious beliefs, Aaron did not say what Cheryl reported him saying, and did not intend to communicate to that effect when he quoted Leviticus to her. Yet BOLI awarded damages based on the use of the term \"abomination\" without engaging with, or even recognizing, Aaron's right to express his own belief within the specific context of a conversation that Cheryl, having experienced her own change in religious perspective, initiated with the hope that Aaron could learn from her experience and see that a change in religious perspective is possible. In view of the foregoing, we conclude that, under Masterpiece Cakeshop , the damages portion of the proceedings before BOLI did not comport with the First Amendment's requirement of strict neutrality toward religion. The remaining question is disposition. As for the issue of liability\u2014our conclusion that Pet.App.42 BOLI properly determined that Aaron violated ORS 659A.403 by refusing service to the Bowman-Cryers and that neither the state nor federal constitution prohibits the application of that neutral, generally-applicable law to his conduc t of denying cake-making services based on sexual orientation\u2014we adhere to our prior decision in its en tirety. We do so for two reasons. First, the liability issues were resolved on summary determination before the agency on undisputed facts. As a result, any non-neutrality on the part of the agency did not affect a fact-finding process. Second, as for the law, our court reviewed all the legal questions concerning liability for legal error. Applying the operative standard of review under the APA, we did so without deference to BOLI on those questions of law, and we do not understand the Kleins to contend that we conducted that nondeferential review in a non-neutral way. In that regard, by noting in Masterpiece Cakeshop that the Colorado Court of Appeals failed to address the statements by the members of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission that th e Court found concerning, the Court implicitly indicated that, at times, appellate-level review can ensure that a proceeding is neutral in the face of potential non-neutrality by an agency adjudicator. See Masterpiece Cakeshop , 584 US at ___, 138 S Ct at 1729-30 (\"And the later state-court ruling reviewing th e Commission's decision did not mention those comments, much less express concern with their content.\"). Pet.App.43 We recognize that when this case was first before us, we, like the Colorado Court of Appeals, did not address the aspects of the agency adjudication that we have determined to be non-neutral on remand. That is because the significance of those aspects of the adjudication to the Klei ns' free exercise claim was not readily apparent until the Supreme Court's decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop provided a lens to see that significance. Although throughout this entire case the Kleins have challenged BOLI's award of damages based on Aaron's quotation of Leviticus, and also have argued that BOLI's order reflected unconstitutional targeting of religion, it was not until their supplemental briefing on remand that they first linked the two arguments and pointed to the damages award as indicative of that targeting. Along the same lines, as noted, Masterpiece Cakeshop appears to represent an expansion of Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. , advancing the analysis in that case, which involved a claim of nonneutrality that was adjudicated on its facts in a trial court, to the context of direct appellate review of agency adjudications. As a result, it would not have been readily apparent to the parties when they briefed this case initially to frame their arguments in that way, or to us that we should conduct that type of religious-neutrality review the first time we saw this case. In other words, we do not view the failure to anticipate the approach taken by Masterpiece Cakeshop , and to conduct the review that case now appears to require, as indicative of non-neutrality. We reverse and remand the order's damages award. For the reasons identified above, the damages portion of the case had the same or similar hallmarks Pet.App.44 of non-neutrality that caused the Supreme Court to set aside the Colorado order at issue in Masterpiece Cakeshop , and we read that case to require us to take appropriate corrective acti on to address that non- neutrality. In contrast with the liability portion of the case, which turns on qu estions of law, any non- neutrality in the damages portion of the decision is not something we can remedy through appellate review. The appropriate amount of damages is something highly fact intensive and we are not, in this instance, empowered to engage in fact-finding ourselves. On remand, BOLI should conduct any further proceedings on the remedy for Aaron's violation of ORS 659A.403 in a manner consistent with Masterpiece Cakeshop and this decision. In that regard, we take note that BOLI now has a different commissioner, so there is no reason to think that any hostility toward the Kleins' religious beliefs reflected in the prior decision will affect the remedy case on remand. Reversed as to BOLI's conclusion that the Kleins violated ORS 659A.409 and the related grant of injunctive relief; reversed and remanded as to damages; otherwise affirmed.

Reversed as to BOLI's conclusion that the Kleins \u0001 violated ORS 659A.409 and the related grant of \u0001 injunctive relief; otherwise affirmed. *James, J., vice Duncan, J. pro tempore.Pet.App.49GARRETT, J. Melissa and Aaron Klein, the owners of a bakery \u0001 doing business as Sweetcakes by Melissa (Sweetcakes), \u0001 seek judicial review of a final order of the Bureau of \u0001 Labor and Industries (BOLI) finding that the Kleins' \u0001 refusal to provide a wedding cake to the complainants, \u0001 a same-sex couple, violated ORS 659A.403, which \u0001 prohibits a place of public accommodation from denying \u0001 \"full and equal\" service to a person \"on account of * * * \u0001 sexual orientation.\" The order further concluded that \u0001 the Kleins violated another of Oregon's public \u0001 accommodations laws, ORS 659A.409, by \u0001 communicating an intention to unlawfully discriminate \u0001 in the future. BOLI's order awarded damages to the \u0001 complainants for their emotional and mental suffering \u0001 from the denial of service and enjoined the Kleins from \u0001 further violating ORS 659A.403 and ORS 659A.409. In their petition for judicial review, the Kleins argue \u0001 that BOLI erroneously concluded that their refusal to \u0001 supply a cake for a same-sex wedding was a denial of \u0001 service \"on account of\" sexual orientation within the \u0001 meaning of ORS 659A.403; alternatively, they argue \u0001 that the application of that statute in this circumstance \u0001 violates their constitutional rights to free expression \u0001 and to the free exercise of their religious beliefs. The \u0001 Kleins also argue that they were denied due process of \u0001 law because BOLI's commissioner did not recuse \u0001 himself in this case after making public comments \u0001 about it, that the damages award is not supported by \u0001 substantial evidence or substantial reason, and that \u0001 BOLI erroneously treated the Kleins' public statements \u0001 about this litigation as conveying an intention to \u0001 violate public accommodation laws in the future.Pet.App.50As explained below, we reject the Kleins' \u0001 construction of ORS 659A.403 and conclude that their \u0001 denial of service was \"on account of\" the complainants' \u0001 sexual orientation for purposes of that statute. As for \u0001 their constitutional arguments, we conclude that the \u0001 final order does not impermissibly burden the Kleins' \u0001 right to free expression under the First Amendment to \u0001 the United States Constitution. We conclude that, \u0001 under Employment Division, Oregon Department of \u0001 Human Resources v. Smith , 494 US 872, 110 S Ct 1595, \u0001 108 L Ed 2d 876 (1990), the final order does not \u0001 impermissibly burden the Kleins' right to the free \u0001 exercise of their religion because it simply requires \u0001 their compliance with a neutral law of general \u0001 applicability, and the Kleins have made no showing \u0001 that the state targeted them for enforcement because \u0001 of their religious beliefs. For substantially the same \u0001 reasons for which we reject their federal constitutional \u0001 arguments, we reject the Kleins' arguments under the \u0001 Oregon Constitution. We also reject the Kleins' \u0001 arguments regarding the alleged bias of BOLI's \u0001 commissioner and their challenge to BOLI's damages \u0001 award. We agree with the Kleins, however, that the \u0001 evidence does not support BOLI's conclusion that they \u0001 violated ORS 659A.409. Accordingly, we reverse the \u0001 order as to that determination and the related grant of \u0001 injunctive relief. BOLI's order is otherwise affirmed. I.\u0001BACKGROUND We will discuss the relevant evidence and factual \u0001 findings in greater detail within our discussion of \u0001 particular assignments of error, but the followingPet.App.51overview provides context for that later discussion.1\u0001 The complainants, Rachel Bowman-Cryer and Laurel \u0001 Bowman-Cryer, met in 2004 and had long considered \u0001 themselves a couple. In 2012, they decided to marry. As part of the wedding planning, Rachel and her \u0001 mother, Cheryl, attended a Portland bridal show.2\u0001 Melissa Klein had a booth at that bridal show, and she \u0001 advertised wedding cakes made by her bakery \u0001 business, Sweetcakes. Rachel and Cheryl visited the \u0001 booth and told Melissa that they would like to order a \u0001 cake from her. Rachel and Cheryl were already familiar \u0001 with Sweetcakes; two years earlier, Sweetcakes had \u0001 designed, created, and decorated a wedding cake for \u0001 Cheryl's wedding, paid for by Rachel. After the bridal show, on January 17, 2013, Rachel \u0001 and Cheryl visited the Sweetcakes bakery shop in \u0001 Gresham for a cake-tasting appointment, intending to \u0001 order a wedding cake. At the time of the appointment, \u0001 Melissa was at home providing childcare, so her \u0001 husband, Aaron, conducted the tasting. 1 Because the Kleins do not challenge BOLI's findings of historical fact, we take those facts\u2014as described here and within particularassignments of error\u2014from the findings set forth in BOLI's finalorder. Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and Industries , 322 Or 132, 134, 903 P2d 351 (1995), abrogated on other grounds by State v. Hickman/Hickman , 358 Or 1, 24, 358 P3d 987 (2015) (unchallenged factual findings are the facts for purposes of judicialreview of an administrative agency's final order). 2 Because multiple parties and witnesses share the same last names, we at times use first names throughout this opinion forclarity and readability.Pet.App.52During that tasting, Aaron asked for the names of \u0001 the bride and groom. Rachel told him that there were \u0001 two brides and that their names were Rachel and \u0001 Laurel. At that point, Aaron stated that he was sorry, \u0001 but that Sweetcakes did not make wedding cakes for \u0001 same-sex ceremonies because of his and Melissa's \u0001 religious convictions. Rachel began crying, and Cheryl \u0001 took her by the arm and walked her out of the shop. On \u0001 the way to their car, Rachel became \"hysterical\" and \u0001 kept apologizing to her mother, feeling that she had \u0001 humiliated her. Cheryl consoled Rachel once they were in their car, \u0001 and she assured her that they would find someone to \u0001 make the wedding cake. Cheryl drove a short distance \u0001 away, but then turned around and returned to \u0001 Sweetcakes. This time, Cheryl reentered the shop by \u0001 herself to talk with Aaron. During their conversation, \u0001 Cheryl told Aaron that she had previously shared his \u0001 thinking about homosexuality, but that her \"truth had \u0001 changed\" as a result of having \"two gay children.\" In \u0001 response, Aaron quoted a Bible passage from the Book \u0001 of Leviticus, stating, \"You shall not lie with a male as \u0001 one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\" Cheryl left \u0001 and returned to the car, where Rachel had remained, \u0001 \"holding [her] head in her hands, just bawling.\" When Cheryl returned to the car, she told Rachel \u0001 that Aaron had called her \"an abomination,\" which \u0001 further upset Rachel. Rachel later said that \"[i]t made \u0001 me feel like they were saying God made a mistake \u0001 when he made me, that I wasn't supposed to be, that I \u0001 wasn't supposed to love or be loved or have a family or \u0001 live a good life and one day go to heaven.\"Pet.App.53When Rachel and Cheryl arrived home, Cheryl told \u0001 Laurel what had happened. Laurel, who had been \u0001 raised Catholic, recognized the \"abomination\" reference \u0001 from Leviticus and felt shame and anger. Rachel was \u0001 inconsolable, which made Laurel even angrier. Later \u0001 that same night, Laurel filled out an online complaint \u0001 form with the Oregon Department of Justice (DOJ), \u0001 describing the denial of service at Sweetcakes. In addition to the DOJ complaint, Laurel eventually \u0001 filed a complaint with BOLI, as did Rachel, alleging \u0001 that the Kleins had refused to make them a wedding \u0001 cake because of their sexual orientation. BOLI initiated \u0001 an investigation. Meanwhile, the controversy had become the subject \u0001 of significant media attention. The Kleins were \u0001 interviewed by, among others, the Christian Broadcast \u0001 Network (CBN) and later by a radio talk show host, \u0001 Tony Perkins. In the CBN interview, which was \u0001 broadcast in September 2013, the Kleins explained that \u0001 they did not want to participate in celebrating a same-sex marriage, wanted to live their lives in the service of \u0001 God, and that, although they did not want to see their \u0001 bakery business go \"belly up,\" they had \"faith in the \u0001 Lord and he's taken care of us up to this point and I'm \u0001 sure he will in the future.\" The CBN broadcast also \u0001 showed a handwritten sign, taped to the inside of the \u0001 bakery's front window, which stated: \"Closed but still in business. You can reach me by email or facebook.www.sweetcakesweb.com or Sweetcakes by Melissa facebook page. New phone number willbe provided on my website and facebook. Thisfight is not over. We will continue to standPet.App.54strong. Your religious freedom is becoming not \u0001 free anymore. This is ridiculous that we cannot \u0001 practice our faith. The LORD is good and we will \u0001 continue to serve HIM with all our heart [heart \u0001 symbol].\" (Uppercase and underscoring in original; spacing altered). In the Perkins interview, which occurred in February 2014, Aaron explained that he and Melissa\"had a feeling that [requests for same-sex weddingcakes were] going to become an issue\" and that theyhad discussed the issue. During the interview, Aaronstated that \"it was one of those situations where wesaid 'well I can see it is going to become an issue but wehave to stand firm. It's our belief and we have a rightto it, you know.'\" BOLI's investigation determined that substantial evidence supported the complaints, and the agencyeventually issued formal charges against the Kleinsthat described the initial refusal of service as well asthe Kleins' subsequent participation in the CBNbroadcast and Perkins interview. Specifically, BOLIalleged that the Kleins had violated ORS 659A.403,which entitles all persons \"to the full and equalaccommodations, advantages, facilities and privilegesof any place of public accommodation, without anydistinction, discrimination or restriction on account of* * * sexual orientation,\" ORS 659A.403(1), and furthermakes it \"an unlawful practice for any person to denyfull and equal accommodations, advantages, facilitiesand privileges of any place of public accommodation inviolation of this section,\" ORS 659A.403(3). BOLIfurther alleged that the Kleins' subsequent statementsPet.App.55had violated another provision of the state's public \u0001 accommodations laws, ORS 656A.409, which makes it \u0001 unlawful to communicate an intention to discriminate \u0001 in the future on account of sexual orientation. After the issuance of formal charges, BOLI \u0001 designated an ALJ to handle the contested case \u0001 proceedings, and the Kleins and BOLI engaged in \u0001 extensive motions practice before the ALJ. Among \u0001 those motions, the Kleins sought to disqualify BOLI's \u0001 commissioner, Brad Avakian, on the ground that he \u0001 was biased against them, as evidenced by his public \u0001 statements about the cake controversy. In a Facebook \u0001 post shortly after Laurel filed the DOJ complaint, \u0001 Avakian had provided a link to a story on \u0001 www.kgw.com related to the refusal of service; in that \u0001 post, he wrote, \"Everyone has a right to their religious \u0001 beliefs, but that doesn't mean they can disobey laws \u0001 that are already in place. Having one set of rules for \u0001 everybody ensures that people are treated fairly as \u0001 they go about their daily lives.\" Later, shortly after the \u0001 first of the BOLI complaints was filed, an article in The\u0001 Oregonian quoted Avakian as saying that \"[e]veryone \u0001 is entitled to their own beliefs, but that doesn't mean \u0001 that folks have the right to discriminate.\" According to \u0001 the Kleins, those statements and others indicated that \u0001 Avakian had prejudged their case before the hearing. \u0001 The ALJ disagreed and denied the motion to disqualify. The Kleins and BOLI also filed cross-motions for \u0001 summary judgment on multiple issues involving the \u0001 merits of the case, including, as relevant on judicial \u0001 review: (1) whether the complainants were denied \u0001 service \"on account of\" their sexual orientation for \u0001 purposes of Oregon's public accommodation laws; (2) ifPet.App.56so, whether the application of those laws violates the \u0001 Kleins' rights to free expression and religious worship \u0001 under the state and federal constitutions; and \u0001 (3)\u0001whether Aaron Klein's statements during the CBN \u0001 and Perkins interviews, and the note on the \u0001 Sweetcakes window, were the kinds of statements of a \u0001 future intention to discriminate that are prohibited by \u0001 ORS 659A.409. In an interim order on the cross- motions, the ALJ agreed with BOLI on the first two \u0001 questions, concluding that the Kleins' refusal to provide \u0001 a wedding cake violated ORS 659A.403, and that the \u0001 statute was constitutional, both facially and as applied \u0001 under the circumstances.3 However, the ALJ agreed \u0001 with the Kleins that Aaron's statements during the \u0001 CBN and Perkins interviews had not been prospective; \u0001 rather, the ALJ determined that those statements \"are \u0001 properly construed as the recounting of past events \u0001 that led to the present Charges being filed,\" and \u0001 therefore did not violate ORS 659A.409. 3 The formal charges had alleged that Melissa and Aaron each violated ORS 659A.403, and that Aaron had aided and abettedMelissa's violation. See ORS 659A.406 (making it an unlawful practice for any person to aid or abet unlawful discrimination by any place of public accommodation). The ALJ granted the Kleins'motion for summary judgment on the allegations that Melissa hadviolated ORS 659A.403, and on the allegations that Aaron hadaided and abetted her in violation of ORS 659A.406. However, the ALJ, and later BOLI, concluded that the Kleins were jointly and severally liable for Aaron's violation of ORS 659A.403, and theparties have not distinguished between Aaron's and Melissa'sliability for purposes of judicial review. For readability, we likewisediscuss the Kleins' liability jointly and do not further discusstheories of aiding and abetting, which are not at issue before us.Pet.App.57After the ALJ's rulings on the various motions, only \u0001 the issue of damages remained to be decided at a \u0001 hearing. BOLI alleged that each complainant was \u0001 claiming damages of \"at least $75,000,\" and it adduced \u0001 evidence at the hearing\u2014through testimony of the \u0001 complainants and others\u2014concerning emotional harm \u0001 that the complainants suffered in the wake of the \u0001 Kleins' refusal to make their wedding cake. During \u0001 closing arguments, BOLI also asked that the ALJ \u0001 award damages for the distress that the complainants \u0001 suffered as a result of media and social-media attention \u0001 after the denial of service. In response, the Kleins \u0001 argued that the complainants were not credible but \u0001 that, even if the ALJ were to find them credible, their \u0001 emotional distress was attributable to sources other \u0001 than the denial of service that were not lawful bases for \u0001 a damages award, such as media attention and family \u0001 conflicts. The Kleins also argued that the amount of \u0001 damages requested by BOLI far exceeded anything that \u0001 the agency had previously sought for similar violations. After six days of testimony and argument regarding \u0001 the damages issue, the ALJ issued a proposed final \u0001 order that encompassed his earlier summary judgment \u0001 and procedural rulings and also addressed the question \u0001 of damages. With respect to damages, the ALJ found \u0001 that Rachel had testified credibly about her emotional \u0001 distress, but that Laurel had not been present at the \u0001 cake refusal and had, in some respects, exaggerated the \u0001 extent and severity of her emotional suffering. The ALJ \u0001 concluded that there was no basis in law for awarding \u0001 damages to the complainants for their emotional \u0001 suffering caused by media and social-media attention. \u0001 Ultimately, the ALJ determined that $75,000 was an \u0001 appropriate award to compensate Rachel for herPet.App.58suffering as a result of the denial of service, and that a \u0001 lesser amount, $60,000, was appropriate to compensate \u0001 Laurel. Both the Kleins and the agency filed exceptions to \u0001 the ALJ's proposed final order. BOLI, through its \u0001 commissioner, Avakian, then issued its final order that, \u0001 for the most part, was consistent with the ALJ's \u0001 reasoning in his proposed order. Specifically, BOLI's \u0001 final order affirmed the ALJ's determinations that the Kleins violated ORS 659A.403, it affirmed the ALJ's \u0001 conclusion that application of that statute did not \u0001 violate the Kleins' constitutional rights, and it affirmed \u0001 the damages awards. However, the final order departed \u0001 from the ALJ's determination in one respect: whether \u0001 the Kleins had violated ORS 659A.409 by conveying an \u0001 intention to discriminate in the future. On that \u0001 question, the final order determined that, based on \u0001 Aaron's statements during the CBN and Perkins \u0001 interviews, and the handwritten sign taped to the \u0001 bakery's window (stating that the \"fight is not over\" \u0001 and vowing to \"continue to stand strong\"), the Kleins \u0001 had conveyed an intention to unlawfully discriminate \u0001 in the future by refusing service based on sexual \u0001 orientation. Thus, BOLI reversed the ALJ's ruling on \u0001 that matter and concluded that the Kleins violated \u0001 ORS 659A.409; but, BOLI did not award any damages \u0001 based on that particular violation \"because there is no \u0001 evidence in the record that Complainants experienced \u0001 any mental, emotional, or physical suffering because of \u0001 it.\" This petition for judicial review followed. II.\u0001ANALYSIS In their petition, the Kleins raise four assignments \u0001 of error. In their first assignment, they argue thatPet.App.59BOLI erred by applying ORS 659A.403 to their refusal \u0001 to make the wedding cake. Within that assignment, \u0001 they argue that BOLI misinterpreted the statute to \u0001 apply to the refusal; alternatively, they argue that, as \u0001 applied under these circumstances, the statute \u0001 abridges their rights to freedom of expression and \u0001 religious exercise under the federal and state \u0001 constitutions. In their second assignment, the Kleins \u0001 argue that their due process rights were violated by the \u0001 commissioner's failure to recuse himself. The Kleins' \u0001 third assignment asserts that BOLI's damages award \u0001 is not supported by substantial evidence or substantial \u0001 reason. And, in their fourth assignment, they argue \u0001 that BOLI erred by applying ORS 659A.409 because \u0001 their statements after the refusal did not communicate \u0001 an intention to discriminate in the future. We address \u0001 each assignment of error in turn. A.First Assignment: Interpretation and Application of ORS 659A.403 1.Meaning and scope of ORS 659A.403 In their first assignment of error, the Kleins argue that BOLI misinterpreted ORS 659A.403\u2014specifically, what it means to deny equal service \"on account of\"sexual orientation. According to the Kleins, they didnot decline service to the complainants \"on account of\"their sexual orientation; rather, \"they declined tofacilitate the celebration of a union that conveysmessages about marriage to which they do not[subscribe] and that contravene their religious beliefs.\"BOLI rejected that argument, reasoning that theKleins' \"refusal to provide a wedding cake forComplainants because it was for their same-sexwedding was synonymous with refusing to provide aPet.App.60cake because of Complainants' sexual orientation.\" We, \u0001 like BOLI, are not persuaded that the text, context, or \u0001 history of ORS 659A.403 contemplates the distinction \u0001 proposed by the Kleins. We review BOLI's interpretation of ORS 659A.403 \u0001 for legal error, without deference to the agency's \u0001 construction of the statute. ORS 183.482(8)(a); 969 (2017) (where statutory terms \u0001 are inexact, courts determine the meaning of the \u0001 statute most likely intended by the legislature that \u0001 enacted it, without any deference to an agency charged \u0001 with enforcing the statute). To determine the \u0001 legislature's intended meaning of ORS 659A.403, we \u0001 use the analytic framework set forth in State v. Gaines ,\u0001 346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009), whereby we \u0001 look to the text of the statute in its context, along with \u0001 any helpful legislative history. The text of ORS 659A.403(1) leaves little doubt as \u0001 to its breadth and operation. It provides, in full: \"(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are entitled to the full and equalaccommodations, advantages, facilities andprivileges of any place of public accommodation, without any distinction, discrimination or restriction on account of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation , national origin, marital status or age if the individual is of age, asdescribed in this section, or older.\" (Emphases added.) The phrase \"on account of\" is unambiguous: In ordinary usage, it is synonymous withPet.App.61\"by of\" or \"because of.\" at 194 (defining \u0001 \"because of\" as \"by reason of : on account of\"). And it \u0001 has long been understood to carry that meaning in the \u0001 context of antidiscrimination statutes. E.g., 18 USC \u0001 \u00a7\u0001242 (1948) (making it unlawful to deprive a person of \u0001 \"any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or \u0001 protected by the Constitution or laws of the United \u0001 States, or to different punishments, pains, or penalties, \u0001 on account of such inhabitant being an alien, or by\u0001 reason of his color, or race\" (emphases added)). Thus, by its plain terms, the statute requires only \u0001 that the denial of full and equal accommodations be \u0001 causally connected to the protected characteristic or \u0001 status\u2014in this case, \"sexual orientation,\" which is \u0001 perceived \u0001 heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality or \u0001 identity, regardless of whether the individual's gender \u0001 identity, appearance, expression or behavior differs \u0001 from that traditionally associated with the individual's \u0001 sex at birth.\" Former ORS 174.100(6) Accord Hopper v.\u0001SAIF , 265 Or App 465, 470, 336 P3d 530 (2014) (explaining that, because the ordinary meaning of the \u0001 term \"for\" in context was \"because of\" or \"on the workers' compensation statute at issue \u0001 \"requires a worker to prove that any failure to \u0001 cooperate was because of\u2014in other words, causally \u0001 connected to \u2014reasons beyond the worker's control\" 4 On judicial review, the Kleins do not dispute that Sweetcakes is a \"place of public accommodation\" within the meaning of ORS659A.403. See ORS 659A.400 (defining \"a place of public accommodation\" for purposes of ORS chapter 659A). Pet.App.62(first emphasis in original; second emphasis added)); \u0001 Elk Creek Management Co. v. Gilbert , 353 Or 565, 580- 81, 303 P3d 929 (2013) (explaining that \u0001 antidiscrimination statutes often use the term \u0001 \"retaliation\" \"in conjunction with the word 'because' or \u0001 other words that require a causal connection between \u0001 one party's acts and another party's protected activity\" \u0001 (emphasis added)). In this case, Sweetcakes provides a service\u2014making \u0001 wedding cakes\u2014to heterosexual couples who intend to \u0001 wed, but it denies the service to same-sex couples who \u0001 likewise intend to wed. Under any plausible \u0001 construction of the plain text of ORS 659A.403, that \u0001 denial of equal service is \"on account of,\" or causally \u0001 connected to, the sexual orientation of the couple \u0001 seeking to purchase the Kleins' wedding-cake service. The Kleins do not point to any text in the statute or \u0001 provide any context or legislative history suggesting \u0001 that we should depart from the ordinary meaning of \u0001 those words. What they argue instead is that the \u0001 statute is silent as to whether it encompasses \"gay \u0001 conduct\" as opposed to sexual orientation. The Kleins \u0001 state that they are willing to serve homosexual \u0001 customers, so long as those customers do not use the \u0001 Kleins' cakes in celebration of same-sex weddings. As \u0001 such, according to the Kleins, they do not discriminate \u0001 against same-sex couples \"on account of\" their status ;\u0001 rather, they simply refuse to provide certain services \u0001 that those same-sex couples want. The Kleins contend \u0001 that BOLI's \"broad equation of celebrations (weddings) \u0001 of gay conduct (marriage) with gay status rewrites and \u0001 expands Oregon's public accommodations law.\"Pet.App.63We see no evidence that the drafters of Oregon's \u0001 public accommodations laws intended that type of \u0001 distinction between status and conduct. First, there is \u0001 no reason to believe that the legislature intended a \u0001 \"status/conduct\" distinction specifically with regard to \u0001 the subject of \"sexual orientation.\" When the \u0001 legislature in 2007 added \"sexual orientation\" to the \u0001 list of protected characteristics in ORS 659A.403, Or \u0001 Laws 2007, ch 100, \u00a7 5, it was unquestionably aware of \u0001 the unequal treatment that gays and lesbians faced in \u0001 securing the same rights and benefits as heterosexual \u0001 couples in committed relationships. During the same \u0001 session that the legislature amended ORS 659A.403 \u0001 (and other antidiscrimination statutes) to include \u0001 \"sexual orientation,\" it adopted the Oregon Family \u0001 Fairness Act, which recognized the \"numerous \u0001 obstacles\" that gay and lesbian couples faced and was \u0001 intended to \"extend[ ] benefits, protections and \u0001 responsibilities to committed same-sex partners and \u0001 their children that are comparable to those provided to \u0001 married individuals and their children by the laws of \u0001 this state.\" Or Laws 2007, ch 99, \u00a7\u00a7 2(3), (5). To that \u0001 end, section 9 of that law provided: \"Any privilege, immunity, right or benefit granted by statute, administrative or court rule,policy, common law or any other law to anindividual because the individual is or wasmarried, or because the individual is or was anin-law in a specified way to another individual,is granted on equivalent terms, substantive andprocedural, to an individual because theindividual is or was in a domestic partnership orbecause the individual is or was, based on aPet.App.64domestic partnership, related in a specified way \u0001 to another individual.\" Or Laws 2007, ch 99, \u00a7 9(1). The Kleins have not provided us with any persuasive explanation for whythe legislature would have intended to grant equalprivileges and immunities to individuals in same-sexrelationships while simultaneously excepting thosecommitted relationships from the protections of ORS659A.403. 5 Nor does the Kleins' proposed distinction find support in the context or history of ORS 659A.403 moregenerally. As originally enacted in 1953, the statute(then numbered ORS 30.670) prohibited \"anydistinction, discrimination or restriction on account ofrace, religion, color or national origin.\" Or Laws 1953,ch 495, \u00a7 1. One of the purposes of the statute, the 5 At the time that the Oregon Family Fairness Act was enacted, Article XV, section 5a, of the Oregon Constitution defined \"marriage\" to be limited to the union of one man and one woman,and the Oregon Family Fairness Act expressly states that it \"cannot bestow the status of marriage on partners in a domesticpartnership.\" Or Laws 2007, ch 99, \u00a7 2(7). Nonetheless, the actcontemplated, but did not require, the performance of \"solemnization ceremony[ies]\" and left it to the \"dictates andconscience of partners entering into a domestic partnership to determine whether to seek a ceremony or blessing over thedomestic partnership.\" Or Laws 2007, ch 99, \u00a7 2(8). Thus, thelegislature was aware that same-sex couples would be participating in wedding ceremonies, and when it simultaneously chose to extend the protections of ORS 659A.403 to cover sexualorientation, there is no reason to believe that it intended to exemptplaces of public accommodation\u2014such as cake shops, dress shops,or flower shops\u2014so as to permit them to discriminate with regard to services related to those anticipated ceremonies.Pet.App.65Supreme Court has observed, was \"to prevent \u0001 'operators and owners of businesses catering to the \u0001 general public to subject Negroes to oppression and \u0001 humiliation.'\" Schwenk v. Boy America , 275\u0001 Or 327, 332, 551 P2d 465 (1976) (quoting a statement \u0001 by one of the principal sponsors of the statute \u0001 (emphasis removed)). Yet, under the distinction \u0001 proposed by the Kleins, owners and operators of \u0001 businesses could continue to oppress and humiliate \u0001 black people simply by recasting their bias in terms of \u0001 conduct rather than race. For instance, a restaurant \u0001 could refuse to serve an interracial couple, not on \u0001 account of the race of either customer, but on account \u0001 of the conduct\u2014interracial dating\u2014to which the \u0001 proprietor objected. In the absence of any textual or \u0001 contextual support, or legislative history on that point, \u0001 we decline to construe ORS 659A.403 in a way that \u0001 would so fundamentally undermine its purpose. See\u0001 King v. Greyhound Lines, Inc. , 61 Or App 197, 203, 656 \u0001 P2d 349 (1982) (adopting an interpretation of Oregon's \u0001 public accommodation laws that recognizes that \"the \u0001 chief harm resulting from the practice of discrimination \u0001 by establishments serving the general public is not the \u0001 monetary loss of a commercial transaction or the \u0001 inconvenience of limited access but, rather, the greater \u0001 evil of unequal treatment, which is the injury to an \u0001 individual's sense of self-worth and personal \u0001 integrity\"). Kleins' argument for distinguishing \u0001 between \"gay conduct\" and sexual orientation is rooted \u0001 in principles that they derive from United States \u0001 Supreme Court cases rather than anything in the text, \u0001 context, or history of ORS 659A.403. Specifically, the \u0001 Kleins draw heavily on the Supreme Court's reasoningPet.App.66in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic , 506 US \u0001 263, 113 S Ct 753, 122 L Ed 2d 34 (1993), which \u0001 concerned the viability of a federal cause of action \u0001 under 42 USC section 1985(3) against persons \u0001 obstructing access to abortion clinics. In that case, the \u0001 Supreme Court addressed, among other things, \u0001 whether the petitioners' opposition to abortion reflected \u0001 an animus against women in general\u2014that is, whether, \u0001 because abortion is \"an activity engaged in only by \u0001 women, to disfavor it is ipso facto to discriminate \u0001 invidiously against women as a class.\" Id. at 271\u0001 (footnote omitted). In rejecting that theory of ipso facto discrimination, \u0001 the Court observed: \"Some activities may be such an irrational object of disfavor that, if they are targeted, and if theyalso happen to be engaged in exclusively orpredominantly by a particular class of people, anintent to disfavor that class can readily bepresumed. A tax on wearing yarmulkes is a taxon Jews. But opposition to voluntary abortioncannot possibly be considered such an irrationalsurrogate for opposition to (or paternalismtowards) women. Whatever one thinks ofabortion, it cannot be denied that there arecommon and respectable reasons for opposing it,other than hatred of, or condescension toward(or indeed any view at all concerning), women asa class\u2014as is evident from the fact that men andwomen are on both sides of the issue, just asmen and women are on both sides of petitioners'unlawful demonstrations.\" Id. at 270.Pet.App.67The Kleins argue that \"[t]he same is true here. \u0001 Whatever one thinks of same-sex weddings, there are \u0001 respectable reasons for not wanting to facilitate them.\" \u0001 They contend that BOLI simply \"ignores Bray \" that BOLI's construction of ORS the \u0001 test for equating conduct with status\" that the \u0001 Supreme Court announced in that case. Bray , which involved a federal statute, does not \u0001 inform the question of what the Oregon legislature \u0001 intended when it enacted ORS 659A.403. But beyond \u0001 that, Bray does not articulate a relevant test for \u0001 analyzing the issue presented in this case. Bray\u0001 addressed the inferences that could be drawn from \u0001 opposition to abortion as a \"surrogate\" for sex-based \u0001 animus, and it was in that context that the Supreme \u0001 Court described \"irrational object[s] of disfavor\" that \u0001 \"happen to be engaged in exclusively or predominantly \u0001 by a particular class of people,\" 506 US at 270, such \u0001 that intent to discriminate against that class can be \u0001 presumed. Here, by contrast, there is no surrogate. The Kleins \u0001 refused to make a wedding cake for the complainants \u0001 precisely and expressly because of the relationship \u0001 between sexual orientation and the conduct at issue (a \u0001 wedding). And, where a close relationship between \u0001 status and conduct exists, the Supreme Court has \u0001 repeatedly rejected the type of distinction urged by the \u0001 Kleins. See Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of \u0001 Cal., Hastings College of Law v. Martinez , 561 US 661, \u0001 689, 130 (2010) (\"[Christian \u0001 Legal Society] contends that it does not exclude \u0001 individuals because of sexual orientation, but rather on \u0001 the basis of a conjunction of conduct and the belief thatPet.App.68the conduct is not wrong. Our decisions have declined \u0001 to distinguish between status and conduct in this \u0001 context.\" (Citation and internal quotation marks \u0001 omitted.)); Lawrence v. Texas , 539 US 558, 575, 123 S \u0001 Ct 2472, 156 L Ed 2d 508 (2003) (\"When homosexual \u0001 conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that \u0001 declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject \u0001 homosexual persons to discrimination both in the \u0001 public and in the private spheres.\"). We therefore reject \u0001 the Kleins' proposed distinction between status and \u0001 conduct, and we hold that their refusal to serve the \u0001 complainants is the type of discrimination \"on account \u0001 of * * * sexual orientation\" that falls within the plain \u0001 meaning of ORS 659A.403.6 The reasons for the Kleins' discrimination on \u0001 account of sexual orientation\u2014regardless of whether \u0001 they are \"common and respectable\" within the meaning \u0001 of Bray\u2014 raise questions of constitutional law, not \u0001 statutory interpretation. The Kleins, in the remainder \u0001 of their argument concerning the construction of ORS \u0001 659A.403, urge us to consider those constitutional \u0001 questions and to interpret the statute in a way that \u0001 avoids running afoul of the \"Speech and Religion \u0001 Clauses of the Oregon and United States \u0001 constitutions.\" See generally State v. McNally 314, 337, 392 P3d 721 (2017) (describing the 6 In doing so, we join other courts that have declined to draw a \"status/conduct\" distinction similar to that urged by the Kleins.See, e.g. , State v. Arlene's Flowers, Inc. our own\u2014have rejected this kind of status/conduct distinction in cases involving statutory and constitutional claims of discrimination,\"and citing cases to that effect).Pet.App.69interpretive canon by which courts will \"avoid an \u0001 interpretation that would raise constitutional problems \u0001 in application, if another reasonable interpretation of \u0001 the statute would not\"). However, that canon applies \u0001 only where the court is faced with competing plausible \u0001 constructions of the statute. See State v. Lane , 357 Or\u0001 619, 637, 355 P3d 914 (2015) (\"The canon of \u0001 interpretation that counsels avoidance of \u0001 unconstitutionality applies only when a disputed \u0001 provision remains unclear after examination of its text \u0001 in context and in light of its enactment history.\"). Here, \u0001 the Kleins have not made that threshold showing of \u0001 ambiguity. Accordingly, we affirm BOLI's order with \u0001 regard to its construction of ORS 659A.403, and we \u0001 turn to the merits of the Kleins' constitutional \u0001 arguments. 2.\u0001Constitutional challenges to ORS 659A.403 The Kleins invoke both the United States and the \u0001 Oregon constitutions in arguing that the final order \u0001 violates their rights to free expression and the free \u0001 exercise of their religion. Oregon courts generally seek \u0001 to resolve arguments under the state constitution \u0001 before turning to the federal constitution. See State v. \u0001 Babson , 355 Or 383, 432-33, 326 P3d 559 (2014) (discussing policy reasons for analyzing state \u0001 constitutional claims first) . In this case, however, the \u0001 Kleins draw almost entirely on well-developed federal \u0001 constitutional principles, and they do not meaningfully \u0001 develop any independent state constitutional theories. \u0001 Accordingly, in the discussion that follows, we address \u0001 the Kleins' federal constitutional arguments first and \u0001 their state arguments second. See Church at 295 S. \u0001 18th St. v. Employment Dept. , 175 Or App 114, 123 n 2,Pet.App.7028 P3d 1185, rev den , 333 Or 73 (2001) (noting that \u0001 \"[t]he Supreme Court likewise does not always pause \u0001 to consider state constitutional arguments before \u0001 addressing federal constitutional arguments, \u0001 particularly when the parties have not asserted any \u0001 independent state constitutional analysis\"); see also\u0001 Neumann (2016) (\"Ordinarily, we would look to our state \u0001 constitution before addressing any federal \u0001 constitutional issues. As noted, however, the parties to \u0001 this case have argued this issue solely under the First \u0001 Amendment and have not invoked Article I, section 8, \u0001 of the Oregon Constitution.\"). a.\u0001Free expression The Kleins argue that BOLI's final order violates \u0001 their First Amendment right to freedom of speech. \u0001 BOLI argues that the order simply enforces ORS \u0001 659A.403, a content-neutral regulation of conduct that \u0001 does not implicate the First Amendment at all. And \u0001 each side argues that United States Supreme Court \u0001 precedent is decisively in its favor. The issues before us arise at the intersection of two \u0001 competing principles: the government's interest in \u0001 promoting full access to the state's economic life for all \u0001 of its citizens, which is expressed in public \u0001 accommodations statutes like ORS 659A.403, and an \u0001 individual's First Amendment right not to be compelled \u0001 to express or associate with ideas with which she \u0001 disagrees. Although the Supreme Court has grappled \u0001 with that intersection before, it has not yet decided a \u0001 case in this particular context, where the public \u0001 accommodation at issue is a retail business selling aPet.App.71service, like cake-making, that is asserted to involve \u0001 artistic expression.7 It is that asserted artistic element that complicates \u0001 the First Amendment analysis\u2014and, ultimately, \u0001 distinguishes this case from the precedents on which \u0001 the parties rely. Generally speaking, the First \u0001 Amendment does not prohibit government regulation \u0001 of \"commerce or conduct\" whenever such regulation \u0001 indirectly burdens speech. Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc. ,\u0001 564 US 552, 567, 131 S Ct 2653, 180 L Ed 2d 544 \u0001 (2011). When, however, the government regulates \u0001 activity that involves a \"significant expressive \u0001 element,\" some degree of First Amendment scrutiny is \u0001 warranted. Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc. , 478 US 697, \u0001 (reasoning that the \"crucial distinction\" between \u0001 government actions that trigger First Amendment \u0001 scrutiny and those that do not is whether the regulated \u0001 activity \"manifests\" an \"element of protected \u0001 expression\"). In the discussion that follows, we conclude that the \u0001 Kleins have not demonstrated that their wedding cakes \u0001 invariably constitute fully protected speech, art, or \u0001 other expression, and we therefore reject the Kleins' \u0001 position that we must subject BOLI's order to strict \u0001 scrutiny under the First Amendment. At most, the 7 The issue is currently before the Supreme Court in a case involving a Colorado bakery that similarly refused to make awedding cake for a same-sex couple. Craig v. Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc. , 370 P3d 272 (Colo App 2015), cert den , No. 15SC738, 2016 WL 1645027 (Colo Apr 25, 2016), cert granted sub nom Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm'n , 137 S Ct 2290 (2017).Pet.App.72Kleins have shown that their cake-making business \u0001 includes some arguably expressive elements as well as \u0001 non-expressive elements, so as to trigger intermediate \u0001 scrutiny. We assume (without deciding) that that is \u0001 true, and then conclude that BOLI's order nonetheless \u0001 survives intermediate scrutiny because any burden on \u0001 the Kleins' expressive activities is no greater than is \u0001 essential to further Oregon's substantial interest in \u0001 promoting the ability of its citizens to participate \u0001 equally in the marketplace without regard to sexual \u0001 orientation. (1) \"Public accommodations\" and the First Amendment Oregon enacted its Public Accommodation Act in 1953. See Or Laws 1953, ch 495. The original act guaranteed the provision of \"full and equalaccommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges* * * without any distinction, discrimination orrestriction on account of race, religion, color, ornational origin.\" Former ORS 30.670 (1953), renumbered as ORS 659A.403 (2001). It applied to \"any hotel, motel or motor court, any place offering to thepublic food or drink for consumption on the premises,or any place offering to the public entertainment,recreation or amusement.\" Former ORS 30.675 (1953), renumbered as ORS 659A.400 (2001). Oregon's statute was thus similar in scope to Title II of the federal CivilRights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination \"onthe ground of race, color, religion, or national origin\" inthree broad categories of public accommodations: thosethat provide lodging to transient guests, those that sellfood for consumption on the premises, and those thathost \"exhibition[s] or entertainment,\" such as theatersPet.App.73and sports arenas. Pub L 88-352, Title II, \u00a7 201, 78 Stat \u0001 243 (1964), codified as 42 USC \u00a7 2000a(b). When the \u0001 United States Supreme Court upheld the public \u0001 accommodations provisions of Title II in 1964, it \u0001 observed that the constitutionality of state public \u0001 accommodations laws at that point had remained \u0001 \"unquestioned,\" citing previous instances in which it \u0001 had \"rejected the claim that the prohibition of racial \u0001 discrimination in public accommodations interferes \u0001 with personal liberty.\" Atlanta Motel v. United States ,\u0001 379 US 241, 260-61, 85 S Ct 348, 13 L Ed 2d 258 \u0001 (1964). Over two decades, the Oregon legislature \u0001 incrementally expanded the definition of \"place of to include \"trailer \"campground[s],\" Or Laws 1957 ch 724, \u00a7 1, and then to \u0001 places \"offering to the public food or drink for \u0001 consumption on or off the premises,\" Or Laws 1961, ch \u0001 247, \u00a7 1 (emphasis added). Then, in 1973, the \u0001 legislature significantly expanded the definition to \u0001 include \" any place or service offering to the public \u0001 accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges \u0001 whether in the nature of goods, services, lodgings, \u0001 amusements or otherwise,\" subject to an exception for \u0001 \"any institution, bona fide club or place of \u0001 accommodation which is in its nature distinctly \u0001 private.\" Or Laws 1973, ch 714, \u00a7 2 (emphasis added). \u0001 Other states similarly enlarged the scope of their \u0001 public-accommodations laws over time. See, e.g. , Hurley\u0001 v.\u0001Irish-American Lesbian and Bisexual , 515 US 557, 571-72, 115 S Ct 2338, 132 L \u0001 Ed 2d 487 (1995) (describing the ways in which the \u0001 Massachusetts legislature had \"broaden[ed] the scope \u0001 of\" 3244, \u0001 82 L Ed 2d 462 (1984) (observing that Minnesota had \u0001 \"progressively broadened the scope of its public \u0001 accommodations law in the years since it was first \u0001 enacted, both with respect to the number and type of \u0001 covered facilities and with respect to the groups against \u0001 whom discrimination is forbidden\"). First Amendment challenges to the application of \u0001 public-accommodations laws\u2014and other forms of anti-discrimination laws\u2014have been mostly unsuccessful. \u0001 See, e.g. , Roberts , 468 US at 625-29 (rejecting argument \u0001 that a private, commercial association had a First \u0001 Amendment right to exclude women from full \u0001 membership); Hishon v. King & Spalding , 467 US 69, \u0001 78, 104 S Ct 2229, 81 L Ed 2d 59 (1984) (rejecting law \u0001 firm's claim that prohibiting the firm from \u0001 discriminating on the basis of gender in making \u0001 partnership decisions violated members' First \u0001 Amendment rights to free expression and association); \u0001 Runyon v. McCrary Ct 2586, \u0001 49 L Ed 2d 415 (1976) (rejecting private schools' claim \u0001 that they had a First Amendment associational right to \u0001 discriminate on the basis of race in admitting \u0001 students). The United States Supreme Court has \u0001 repeatedly acknowledged that public accommodations \u0001 statutes in particular are \"well within the State's usual \u0001 power to enact when a legislature has reason to believe \u0001 that a given group is the target of discrimination.\" \u0001 Hurley , 515 US at 572. The Court has further \u0001 acknowledged that states enjoy \"broad authority to \u0001 create rights of public access on behalf of [their] \u0001 citizens,\" in order to ensure \"wide participation in \u0001 political, economic, and cultural life\" and to prevent the \u0001 \"stigmatizing injury\" and \"the denial of equalPet.App.75opportunities\" that accompanies invidious \u0001 discrimination in public accommodations. Roberts , 468\u0001 US at 625. And the Court has recognized a state's \u0001 interest in preventing the \"unique evils\" that stem from \u0001 \"invidious discrimination in the distribution of publicly \u0001 available goods, services, and other advantages.\" Id. at\u0001 628. However, as states adopted more expansive \u0001 definitions of \"places of public accommodation,\" their \u0001 antidiscrimination statutes began to reach entities that \u0001 were different in kind from the commercial \u0001 establishments that were the original target of public \u0001 accommodations laws. As a result, on two occasions, \u0001 the Court held that the application of such laws \u0001 violated the First Amendment. First, in Hurley , the court held that Massachusetts's \u0001 public accommodations law could not be applied to \u0001 require a St. Patrick's Day parade organizer to include \u0001 a gay-rights group in its parade. 515 US at 573. \u0001 Observing that state public accommodations laws do \u0001 not, \"as a general matter, violate the First or \u0001 Fourteenth Amendments,\" the Court went on to \u0001 conclude that the Massachusetts law had been \"applied \u0001 in a peculiar way\" to a private parade, a result that \u0001 \"essentially requir[ed]\" the parade organizers to \"alter \u0001 the expressive content of their parade\" by \u0001 accommodating a message (of support for gay rights) \u0001 that they did not want to include. Id. at 572-73 \u0001 (emphasis added). The Court further reasoned that \u0001 such an application of the statute \"had the effect of \u0001 declaring the [parade] sponsors' speech itself to be the \u0001 public accommodation,\" which violated \"the \u0001 fundamental rule of protection under the FirstPet.App.76Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to \u0001 choose the content of his own message.\" Id. at 573. Following Hurley , the Court decided Boy Scouts of \u0001 America v. Dale , 530 US 640, 120 S Ct 2446, 147 L Ed \u0001 2d 554 (2000) ( Dale ), in which it held that applying \u0001 New Jersey's public accommodations law to require the \u0001 Boy Scouts to admit a gay scoutmaster violated the \u0001 group's First Amendment right to freedom of \u0001 association. The Court observed that, over time, public \u0001 accommodations laws had been expanded to cover more \u0001 than just \"traditional places of public accommodation\u2014 like inns and trains.\" Id. at 656. According to the \u0001 Court, New Jersey's definition of a \"place of public \u0001 accommodation\" was \"extremely broad,\" particularly \u0001 because the state had \"applied its public \u0001 accommodations law to a private entity without even \u0001 attempting to tie the term 'place' to a physical \u0001 location.\" Id. at 657. The court distinguished Dale from\u0001 prior cases in which it held that public accommodations \u0001 laws posed no First Amendment problem, observing \u0001 that, in those prior cases, the law's enforcement did not \u0001 \"materially interfere with the ideas that the \u0001 organization sought to express.\" Id. Thus, Hurley and Dale demonstrate that the First \u0001 Amendment may stand as a barrier to the application \u0001 of state public accommodations laws when such laws \u0001 are applied to \"peculiar\" circumstances outside of the \u0001 usual commercial context. See Dale , 530 US at 657 (\"As \u0001 the definition of 'public accommodation' has expanded \u0001 from clearly commercial entities, such as restaurants, \u0001 bars, and hotels, to membership organizations such as \u0001 the Boy Scouts, the potential for conflict between statePet.App.77public accommodations laws and the First Amendment \u0001 rights of organizations has increased.\"). In this case, the Kleins concede that Sweetcakes is \u0001 a \"place of public accommodation\" under Oregon law \u0001 because it is a retail bakery open to the public. But the \u0001 Kleins contend that, as in Hurley and Dale , application \u0001 of ORS 659A.403 in this case violates their First \u0001 Amendment rights. (2)\u0001First Amendment precedent BOLI and the Kleins offer competing United States \u0001 Supreme Court precedent that, they argue, clearly \u0001 requires a result in their respective favors. We begin \u0001 our analysis by explaining why we do not regard the \u0001 authorities cited by the parties as controlling. The Kleins argue that the effect of BOLI's final \u0001 order is to compel them to express a message\u2014a \u0001 celebration of same-sex marriage\u2014with which they \u0001 disagree. They primarily draw on two interrelated lines \u0001 of First Amendment cases that, they contend, preclude \u0001 the application of ORS 659A.403 here. First, the Kleins rely on cases holding that the \u0001 government may not compel a person to speak or \u0001 promote a government message with which the speaker \u0001 does not agree. See, e.g. , Board of Education v. \u0001 Barnette , 319 US 63 S Ct 1178, 87 L Ed 1628 \u0001 (1943) (holding that a state may not sanction a public- school student or his parents for the student's refusal \u0001 to recite the Pledge of Allegiance or salute the flag of \u0001 the United States); Wooley v. Maynard , 430 US 705, 97 \u0001 S Ct 1428, 51 L Ed 2d 752 (1977) (holding that New \u0001 Hampshire could not force a person to display the \"Live \u0001 Free or Die\" state motto on his license plate).Pet.App.78We do not consider that line of cases to be helpful \u0001 here. In \"compelled speech\" cases like Barnette and\u0001 Wooley , the government prescribed a specific message \u0001 that the individual was required to express. ORS \u0001 659A.403 does nothing of the sort; it is a content-neutral regulation that is not directed at expression at \u0001 all. It does not even regulate cake-making; it simply \u0001 prohibits the refusal of service based on membership in \u0001 a protected class. The United States Supreme Court \u0001 has repeatedly held that such content-neutral \u0001 regulations\u2014although they may have incidental effects \u0001 on an individual's expression\u2014are an altogether \u0001 different, and generally permissible, species of \u0001 government action than a regulation of speech . See\u0001 Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Institutional \u0001 Rights, Inc. , 547 US 47, 62, 126 S Ct 1297, 164 Ed 2d \u0001 156 (2006) ( ) (\"[I]t has never been deemed an \u0001 abridgement of freedom of speech or press to make a \u0001 course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct \u0001 was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by \u0001 means of language, either spoken, written, or printed.\" \u0001 (Internal quotation marks omitted.)); R. A. V. v. St. \u0001 Paul , 505 US 377, 385, 112 S Ct 2538, 120 L Ed 2d 305 \u0001 (1992) (\"We have long held * * * that nonverbal \u0001 expressive activity can be banned because of the action \u0001 it entails, but not because of the ideas it expresses \u0001 * * *.\"). In short, we reject the Kleins' analogy of this \u0001 case to Barnette and Wooley . Second, the Kleins rely heavily on Hurley and Dale ,\u0001 which, as discussed above, invalidated the application \u0001 of public accommodations statutes in \"peculiar\" \u0001 circumstances outside of the usual commercial context. \u0001 The difficulty with that analogy is that this case does\u0001 involve the usual commercial context; Sweetcakes isPet.App.79not a private parade or membership organization, and \u0001 it is hardly \"peculiar,\" as that term was used in Hurley ,\u0001 to apply ORS 659A.403 to a retail bakery like \u0001 Sweetcakes that is open to the public and that exists \u0001 for the purpose of engaging in commercial transactions. \u0001 Indeed, the Kleins accept the premise that Sweetcakes \u0001 is a place of public accommodation under Oregon law, \u0001 and that, as such, it must generally open its doors to \u0001 customers of all sexual orientations, regardless of the \u0001 Kleins' religious views about homosexuality. Thus, if \u0001 the Kleins are to succeed in avoiding compliance with \u0001 the statute, it cannot be because their activity occurs \u0001 outside the ordinary commercial context that the \u0001 government has wide latitude to regulate, as was the \u0001 case in Hurley and Dale . The Kleins must find support \u0001 elsewhere. In BOLI's view, on the other hand, the Kleins' \u0001 arguments are disposed of by the United States \u0001 Supreme Court's decision in FAIR . In that case, an \u0001 association of law schools and law faculty (FAIR) \u0001 sought to enjoin the enforcement of the Solomon \u0001 Amendment, a federal law that requires higher-education institutions, as a condition for receiving \u0001 federal funds, to provide military recruiters with the \u0001 same access to their campuses as non-military \u0001 recruiters. 547 US at 52-55. Because FAIR opposed the \u0001 military's policy at that time regarding homosexual \u0001 service-members, FAIR argued that the equal-access \u0001 requirement violated the schools' First Amendment \u0001 rights to freedom of speech and association. Id. at 52- 53. The Court rejected FAIR's compelled-speech \u0001 argument, reasoning that the Solomon AmendmentPet.App.80\"neither limits what law schools may say nor requires \u0001 them to say anything,\" and, therefore, the law was a \u0001 \"far cry\" from the compulsions at issue in Barnette and\u0001 Wooley . Id. at 60, 62. The Court acknowledged that \u0001 compliance with the Solomon Amendment would \u0001 indirectly require the schools to \"speak\" in a sense \u0001 because it would require the schools to send emails and \u0001 post notices on behalf of the military if they chose to do \u0001 so for other recruiters. Nevertheless, the Court found \u0001 it dispositive that the Solomon Amendment did not \u0001 \"dictate the content of the speech at all, which is only \u0001 'compelled' if, and to the extent [that,] the school \u0001 provides such speech for other recruiters.\" Id. The\u0001 Court distinguished that situation from those where \u0001 \"the complaining speaker's own message was affected \u0001 by the speech it was forced to accommodate.\" Id. at 63- 64 (citing, inter alia , Hurley , 515 US at 568). In BOLI's view, this case is like FAIR because ORS \u0001 659A.403 does not directly compel any speech; even if \u0001 one considers the Kleins' cake-making to involve some \u0001 element of expression, the law only compels the Kleins \u0001 to engage in that expression for same-sex couples \"if, \u0001 and to the extent\" that the Kleins do so for the general \u0001 public. This case is distinguishable from FAIR , however, in \u0001 a significant way. Essential to the holding in FAIR was\u0001 that the schools were not compelled to express a \u0001 message with which they disagreed. The schools \u0001 evidently did not assert, nor did the Supreme Court \u0001 contemplate, that there was a meaningful ideological or \u0001 expressive component to the emails or notices \u0001 themselves, which merely conveyed factual information \u0001 about the presence of recruiters on campus. The CourtPet.App.81thus distinguished the case from Barnette and Wooley ,\u0001 cases that addressed the harm that results from true \u0001 compelled speech\u2014that is, depriving a person of \u0001 autonomy as a speaker and \"inva[ding]\" that person's \u0001 US at 637); see Hurley , 515 US \u0001 at 576 (\"[W]hen dissemination of a view contrary to \u0001 one's own is forced upon a speaker intimately \u0001 connected with the communication advanced, the \u0001 speaker's right to autonomy over the message is \u0001 compromised.\"). Here, unlike in FAIR , the Kleins very much do\u0001 object to the substantive content of the expression that \u0001 they believe would be compelled. They argue that their \u0001 wedding cakes are works of art that express a \u0001 celebratory message about the wedding for which they \u0001 are intended, and that the Kleins cannot be compelled \u0001 to create that art for a wedding that they do not believe \u0001 should be celebrated. And there is evidentiary support \u0001 for the Kleins' view, at least insofar as every wedding \u0001 cake that they create partially reflects their own \u0001 creative and aesthetic judgment. Whether that is \u0001 sufficient to make their cakes \"art,\" the creation of \u0001 which the government may not compel, is a question to \u0001 which we will turn below, but even the Kleins' \u0001 subjective belief that BOLI's order compels them to \u0001 express a specific message that they ideologically \u0001 oppose makes this case different from FAIR . That fact is also what makes this case difficult to \u0001 compare to other public accommodations cases that the \u0001 United States Supreme Court has decided. It appears \u0001 that the Supreme Court has never decided a free-speech challenge to the application of a publicPet.App.82accommodations law to a retail establishment selling \u0001 highly customized, creative goods and services that \u0001 arguably are in the nature of art or other expression. To put the problem into sharper focus, we see no \u0001 reason in principle why the services of a singer, \u0001 composer, or painter could not fit the definition of a \u0001 \"place of public accommodation\" under ORS 659A.400. \u0001 One can imagine, for example, a person whose business \u0001 is writing commissioned music or poetry for weddings, \u0001 or producing a sculpture or portrait of the couple \u0001 kissing at an altar. One can also imagine such a person \u0001 who advertises and is willing to sell those services to \u0001 the general public, but who holds strong religious \u0001 convictions against same-sex marriage and would feel \u0001 her \"freedom of mind\" violated if she were compelled to \u0001 produce her art for such an occasion. Cf. Barnette , 319\u0001 US at 637. For the Kleins, this is that case. BOLI \u0001 disagrees that a wedding cake is factually like those \u0001 other examples, but the legal point that those examples \u0001 illustrate is that existing public accommodations case \u0001 law is awkwardly applied to a person whose \"business\" \u0001 is artistic expression. The Court has not told us how to \u0001 apply a requirement of nondiscrimination to an artist. We believe, moreover, that it is plausible that the \u0001 United States Supreme Court would hold the First \u0001 Amendment to be implicated by applying a public \u0001 accommodations law to require the creation of pure \u0001 speech or art. If BOLI's order can be understood to \u0001 compel the Kleins to create pure \"expression\" that they \u0001 would not otherwise create, it is possible that the Court \u0001 would regard BOLI's order as a regulation of content, \u0001 thus subject to strict scrutiny, the test for regulating \u0001 fully protected expression. See Hurley , 515 US at 573Pet.App.83(application of public accommodations statute violated \u0001 the First Amendment where it \"had the effect of \u0001 declaring the sponsors' speech itself to be the public \u0001 accommodation,\" thus infringing on parade organizers' \u0001 \"autonomy to choose the content of [their] own \u0001 message\"); see also Riley v. National Federation of the \u0001 Blind , 487 US 781, 795-98, Ed 2d 669 (1988) (explaining that \"[m]andating speech that a \u0001 speaker would not otherwise make necessarily alters \u0001 the content of the speech,\" and subjecting such \u0001 regulation to \"exacting First Amendment scrutiny\"). Although the Court has not clearly articulated the \u0001 extent to which the First Amendment protects visual \u0001 art and its creation, it has held that the First \u0001 Amendment covers various forms of artistic expression, \u0001 including music, Ward v. Rock Against Racism , 491 US \u0001 781, 790, 109 \"live such as musical and dramatic \u0001 performances, Schad v. Mount Ephraim , 452 US 61, \u0001 65, 101 S Ct 2176, 68 L Ed 2d 671 (1981); and video \u0001 games, Brown v. Entertainment 564\u0001 US 790, 131 L Ed 2d 708 (2011). \u0001 See also Kaplan v. California , 413 US 115, 119-20, 93 \u0001 Ed 2d 492 (1973) (\"[P]ictures, films, \u0001 paintings, drawings, and engravings * * * have First \u0001 Amendment protection.\"). The Court has also made \u0001 clear that a particularized, discernible message is not \u0001 a prerequisite for First Amendment protection.8 See 8 The First Amendment's protection of artwork is distinct from the protections that extend to so-called \"expressive conduct.\"Expressive conduct involves conduct that may be undertaken forany number of reasons but, in the relevant instance, is undertaken for the specific purpose of conveying a message. See, e.g. , Texas v.Pet.App.84Hurley , 515 US at 569 (\"[A] narrow, succinctly \u0001 articulable message is not a condition of constitutional \u0001 protection, which if confined to expressions conveying \u0001 a particularized message, would never reach the \u0001 unquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollock, \u0001 music of Arnold Schoenberg, or Jabberwocky verse of \u0001 Lewis Carroll.\" (Citation and internal quotation marks \u0001 omitted.)); see also Ward , 491 US at 790 (concluding \u0001 that music is protected expression, due to \"its capacity \u0001 to appeal to the intellect and to the emotions\"). In short, although ORS 659A.403 is a content- neutral regulation that is not directed at expression, \u0001 the Kleins' arguments cannot be dismissed on that \u0001 ground alone. Rather, we must decide whether the \u0001 Kleins' cake-making activity is sufficiently expressive, \u0001 communicative, or artistic so as to implicate the First \u0001 Amendment, and, if it is, whether BOLI's final order \u0001 compelling the creation of such expression in a \u0001 particular circumstance survives First Amendment \u0001 scrutiny. Johnson , 491 US 397, 405, 109 S Ct 2533, 105 L Ed 2d 342 (1989) (reasoning that not every action taken with respect to the flag ofthe United States is necessarily expressive); United States v. O'Brien , 391 US 367, 375, 88 S Ct 1673, 20 L Ed 2d 672 (1968) (recognizing that a person may knowingly destroy a draft cardwithout necessarily intending to express any particular view) . For example, a person may camp in a public park for any number ofreasons, only some of which are intended to express an idea. See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence , 468 US 288, 104 S Ct 3065, 82 L Ed 2d 221 (1984). In contrast (as we understand theSupreme Court to have held), because the creation of artwork andother inherently expressive acts are unquestionably undertakenfor an expressive purpose, they need not express an articulablemessage to enjoy First Amendment protection.Pet.App.85(3) Whether these cakes implicate the First Amendment If, as BOLI argues, the Kleins' wedding cakes are just \"food\" with no meaningful artistic orcommunicative component, then, as the foregoingdiscussion illustrates, BOLI's final order does notimplicate the First Amendment; the Kleins' objection tohaving to \"speak\" as a result of ORS 659A.403 is nomore powerful than it would be coming from the sellerof a ham sandwich. On the other hand, if and to theextent that the Kleins' wedding cakes constituteartistic or communicative expression, then the FirstAmendment is implicated by BOLI's final order. Inshort, we must decide whether the act that the Kleinsrefused to perform\u2014to design and create a weddingcake\u2014is \"sufficiently imbued with elements ofcommunication\" so as to \"fall within the scope\" of theFirst Amendment. Spence v. Washington , 418 US 405, 409, 94 S Ct 2727, 41 L Ed 2d 842 (1974). On this point, BOLI makes a threshold argument that we must address, which is that, because theKleins refused service to Rachel and Laurel before evenfinding out what kind of cake the couple wanted, thereis no basis for assessing the \"artistic\" component ofwhatever cake might have resulted. For all we know,BOLI reasons, Rachel and Laurel might have wanteda standardized cake that would not have involved anymeaningful expressive activity on the part of theKleins. However, we believe the fair interpretation ofthis record is that the Kleins do not offer such\"standardized\" or \"off the shelf\" wedding cakes; theytestified that their practice for creating wedding cakesincludes a collaborative and customized design processPet.App.86that is individual to the customer. According to the \u0001 Kleins, they intend\u2014and their \"clients expect\"\u2014that \u0001 \"each cake will be uniquely crafted to be a statement of \u0001 each customer's personality, physical tastes, theme and \u0001 desires, as well as their palate.\" According to Melissa, \u0001 she \"almost never make[s] a cake without creating a \u0001 unique element of style and customization.\" \u0001 Furthermore, the complainants expressly stated that \u0001 they wanted a cake \"like\" the one that the Kleins had \u0001 created for Rachel's mother's wedding, which was a \u0001 custom-designed cake. On this record, we therefore \u0001 assume that any cake that the Kleins made for Rachel \u0001 and Laurel would have followed the Kleins' customary \u0001 practice. Consequently, the question is whether that \u0001 customary practice, and its end product, are in the \u0001 nature of \"art.\" As noted above, if the ultimate effect of \u0001 BOLI's order is to compel the Kleins to create \u0001 something akin to pure speech, then BOLI's order may \u0001 be subject to strict scrutiny. If, on the other hand, the \u0001 Kleins' cake-making retail business involves, at most, \u0001 both expressive and non-expressive components, and if \u0001 Oregon's interest in enforcing ORS 659A.403 is \u0001 unrelated to the content of the expressive components \u0001 of a wedding cake, then BOLI's order need only survive \u0001 intermediate scrutiny to comport with the First \u0001 Amendment. See United States v. O'Brien , 391 US 367, \u0001 376, 88 S Ct Ed 2d 672 (1968) (\"[W]hen \u0001 'speech' and 'nonspeech' elements are combined in the \u0001 same course of conduct, a sufficiently important \u0001 governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech \u0001 element can justify incidental limitations on First \u0001 Amendment freedoms.\"); see also Turner Broadcasting \u0001 System, Inc. v. FCC , 512 US 622, 662, 114 S Ct 2445,Pet.App.87129 L Ed 2d 497 (1994) (applying intermediate scrutiny \u0001 to a content-neutral regulation that compelled cable \u0001 operators to carry certain channels). The record reflects that the Kleins' wedding cakes \u0001 follow a collaborative design process through which \u0001 Melissa uses her customers' preferences to develop a \u0001 custom design, including choices as to \"color,\" \"style,\" \u0001 and \"other decorative detail.\" Melissa shows customers designs \"as inspiration,\" and she then draws \u0001 \"various designs on sheets of paper\" as part of a \u0001 dialogue with the customer. From that dialogue, \u0001 Melissa \"conceives\" and customizes \"a variety of \u0001 decorating suggestions\" as she ultimately finalizes the \u0001 design. Thus, the process does not simply involve the \u0001 Kleins executing precise instructions from their \u0001 customers; instead, it is clear that Melissa uses her \u0001 own design skills and aesthetic judgments. Therefore, on this record, the Kleins' argument that \u0001 their products entail artistic expression is entitled to be \u0001 taken seriously. That being said, we are not persuaded \u0001 that the Kleins' wedding cakes are entitled to the same \u0001 level of constitutional protection as pure speech or \u0001 traditional forms of artistic expression. In order to \u0001 establish that their wedding cakes are fundamentally \u0001 pieces of art, it is not enough that the Kleins believe\u0001 them to be pieces of art. See Nevada Comm'n on Ethics \u0001 v.\u0001Carrigan , 564 US 117, S 180 L Ed \u0001 2d 150 (2011) (\"[T]he fact that a nonsymbolic act is the \u0001 product of deeply held personal belief\u2014even if the actor \u0001 would like to convey his deeply held personal \u0001 belief\u2014does not transform action into First \u0001 Amendment speech.\" (Emphasis in original.)); see also\u0001 for Creative Non-Violence USPet.App.88288, 293 n 5, 104 S 82 L Ed 2d 221 (1984) (the \u0001 burden of proving that an activity is protected \u0001 expression is on the person asserting First Amendment \u0001 protection for that activity). For First Amendment \u0001 purposes, the expressive character of a thing must turn \u0001 not only on how it is subjectively perceived by its \u0001 maker, but also on how it will be perceived and \u0001 experienced by others. See Spence , 418 US at 409-10 \u0001 (looking to subjective and objective considerations in \u0001 assessing whether an act constitutes First Amendment \u0001 protected expression, including \"the factual context and \u0001 environment in which it was undertaken\"). Here, \u0001 although we accept that the Kleins imbue each \u0001 wedding cake with their own aesthetic choices, they \u0001 have made no showing that other people will \u0001 necessarily experience any wedding cake that the \u0001 Kleins create predominantly as \"expression\" rather \u0001 than as food. Although the Kleins' wedding cakes involve \u0001 aesthetic judgments and have decorative elements, the \u0001 Kleins have not demonstrated that their cakes are \u0001 inherently \"art,\" like sculptures, paintings, musical \u0001 compositions, and other works that are both intended \u0001 to be and are experienced predominantly as expression. \u0001 Rather, their cakes, even when custom-designed for a \u0001 ceremonial occasion, are still cakes made to be eaten. \u0001 Although the Kleins themselves may place more \u0001 importance on the communicative aspect of one of their \u0001 cakes, there is no information in this record that would \u0001 permit an inference that the same is true in all cases \u0001 for the Kleins' customers and the people who attend \u0001 the weddings for which the cakes are created. \u0001 Moreover, to the extent that the cakes are expressive, \u0001 they do not reflect only the Kleins' expression. Rather,Pet.App.89they are products of a collaborative process in which \u0001 Melissa's artistic execution is subservient to a \u0001 customer's wishes and preferences. For those reasons, \u0001 we do not agree that the Kleins' cakes can be \u0001 understood to fundamentally and inherently embody \u0001 the Kleins' expression, for purposes of the First \u0001 Amendment.9 We also reject the Kleins' argument that, under the \u0001 facts of this case, BOLI's order compels them to \"host \u0001 or accommodate another speaker's message\" in a \u0001 manner that the Supreme Court has deemed to be a \u0001 violation of the First Amendment. See FAIR , 547 US at \u0001 63 (listing cases). In the only such case that involved \u0001 the enforcement of a content-neutral public \u0001 accommodations law, Hurley , the problem was that the \u0001 speaker's autonomy was affected by the forced \u0001 intermingling of messages, with consequences for how \u0001 others would perceive the content of the expression. \u0001 515 US at 576-77 (reasoning that parades, unlike cable \u0001 operators, are not \"understood to be so neutrally \u0001 presented or selectively viewed,\" and \"the parade's \u0001 overall message is distilled from the individual 9 To be clear, we do not foreclose the possibility that, on a different factual record, a baker (or chef) could make a showing that aparticular cake (or other food) would be objectively experiencedpredominantly as art\u2014especially when created at the baker's orchef's own initiative and for her own purposes. But, as we havealready explained, the Kleins never reached the point of discussingwhat a particular cake for Rachel and Laurel would look like; theyrefused to make any wedding cake for the couple. Therefore, in order to prevail, the Kleins (as they implicitly acknowledge) must demonstrate that any cake that they make through their customary practice constitutes their own speech or art. They havenot done so.Pet.App.90presentations along the way, and each unit's expression \u0001 is perceived by spectators as part of the whole\" \u0001 (emphasis added)). Here, because the Kleins refused to \u0001 provide their wedding-cake service to Rachel and \u0001 Laurel altogether, this is not a situation where the \u0001 Kleins were asked to articulate, host, or accommodate \u0001 a specific message that they found offensive. It would \u0001 be a different case if BOLI's order had awarded \u0001 damages against the Kleins for refusing to decorate a \u0001 cake with a specific message requested by a customer \u0001 (\"God Bless This Marriage,\" for example) that they \u0001 found offensive or contrary to their beliefs. Cf. Craig \u0001 Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc. , 370 P3d 272, 282 n 8 (Colo \u0001 App cert den , No. 15SC738, 2016 WL 1645027 \u0001 (Colo 25, 2016), cert granted sub nom Masterpiece \u0001 Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Rights Comm'n , 137\u0001 S Ct 2290 (2017) (distinguishing the refusal to create a \u0001 custom wedding cake for a same-sex couple from the \u0001 refusal to decorate a cake with a specific message, such \u0001 as \"Homosexuality is a detestable sin. Leviticus 18:2.\"). The Kleins' additional concern, as we understand it, \u0001 is that a wedding cake communicates a \"celebratory \u0001 message\" about the wedding for which it is intended, \u0001 and the Kleins do not wish to \"host\" the message that \u0001 same-sex weddings should be celebrated. But, unlike in \u0001 Hurley , the Kleins have not raised a nonspeculative \u0001 possibility that anyone attending the wedding will \u0001 impute that message to the Kleins. We think it more \u0001 likely that wedding attendees understand that various \u0001 commercial vendors involved with the event are there \u0001 for commercial rather than ideological purposes. \u0001 Moreover, to the extent that the Kleins subjectively feel \u0001 that they are being \"associated\" with the idea that same-sex marriage is worthy of celebration, the KleinsPet.App.91are free to engage in their own speech that disclaims \u0001 such support. Cf. FAIR , 547 US at 65 (rejecting \u0001 argument that law schools would be perceived as \u0001 supporting any speech by recruiters by simply \u0001 complying with the Solomon Amendment; noting that \u0001 nothing prevented the schools from expressing their \u0001 views in other ways). In short, we disagree that the Kleins' wedding cakes \u0001 are invariably in the nature of fully protected speech or \u0001 artistic expression, and we further disagree that \u0001 BOLI's order forces the Kleins to host, accommodate, or \u0001 associate with anyone else's particular message. Thus, \u0001 because we conclude that BOLI's order does not have \u0001 the effect of compelling fully protected expression, it \u0001 does not trigger strict scrutiny under the First \u0001 Amendment. As noted above, however, BOLI's order is still \u0001 arguably subject to intermediate First Amendment \u0001 scrutiny if the Kleins' cake-making activity involves \u0001 both expressive and non-expressive elements. 391 US at 376 (\"[W]hen 'speech' and 'nonspeech' \u0001 elements are combined in the same course of conduct, \u0001 a sufficiently important governmental interest in \u0001 regulating the nonspeech element can justify incidental \u0001 limitations on First Amendment freedoms.\"); see also\u0001 Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. , 512 US at 661-62. \u0001 Here, we acknowledge that the Kleins' cake-making \u0001 process is not a simple matter of combining ingredients \u0001 and following a customer's precise specifications. \u0001 Instead, based on the Kleins' customary practice, the \u0001 ultimate effect of BOLI's order is to compel them to \u0001 engage in a collaborative process with a customer and \u0001 to create a custom product that they would notPet.App.92otherwise make. The Kleins' argument that that \u0001 process involves individualized aesthetic judgments \u0001 that are themselves within the realm of First \u0001 Amendment protected expression is not implausible on \u0001 its face. Ultimately, however, we need not resolve whether \u0001 that argument is correct. That is because, even \u0001 assuming (without deciding) that the Kleins' cake-making business involves aspects that may be deemed \u0001 \"expressive\" for purposes of the First Amendment, \u0001 BOLI's order is subject, at most, to intermediate \u0001 scrutiny, and it survives such scrutiny, as explained \u0001 below. (4) BOLI's final order survives First Amendment scrutiny Neither ORS 659A.403 nor BOLI's order is directed toward the expressive content of the Kleins' business.When a content-neutral regulation indirectly imposesa burden on protected expression, it will be sustainedif \"'it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the governmentalinterest is unrelated to the suppression of freeexpression; and if the incidental restriction onalleged First Amendment freedoms is no greaterthan is essential to the furtherance of thatinterest.'\" Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. , 512 US at 662 (quoting O'Brien , 391 US at 377). We address each factor in turn. Pet.App.93We first address the state's interest in enforcing its \u0001 public-accommodations law. As noted above, the United \u0001 States Supreme Court has consistently acknowledged \u0001 that states have a compelling interest both in ensuring \u0001 equal access to publicly available goods and services \u0001 and in preventing the dignitary harm that results from \u0001 discriminatory denials of service. That interest is no \u0001 less compelling with respect to the provision of services \u0001 for same-sex weddings; indeed, that interest is \u0001 particularly acute when the state seeks to prevent the \u0001 dignitary harms that result from the unequal \u0001 treatment of same-sex couples who choose to exercise \u0001 their fundamental right to marry. See Obergefell v. \u0001 Hodges , ___ US ___, ___, 135 S Ct 2584, 2600, 192 L Ed \u0001 2d 609 (2015) (\"The right to marry thus dignifies \u0001 couples who wish to define themselves by their \u0001 commitment to each other.\" (Internal quotation marks \u0001 omitted.)). Thus, we readily conclude that BOLI's order \u0001 furthers \"an important or substantial governmental \u0001 interest.\" Furthermore, Oregon's interest is in no way related \u0001 to the suppression of free expression. Rather, Oregon \u0001 has an interest in preventing the harms that result \u0001 from invidious discrimination that is \"wholly apart \u0001 from the point of view such conduct may transmit.\" \u0001 Roberts , 468 US at 628. BOLI's order reflects a concern \u0001 with ensuring equal access to products like wedding \u0001 cakes when a seller chooses to sell them to the general \u0001 public, not a concern with influencing the expressive \u0001 choices involved in designing or decorating a cake. Finally, we conclude that any burden imposed on \u0001 the Kleins' expression is no greater than essential to \u0001 further the state's interest. Again, it is significant thatPet.App.94BOLI's order does not compel the Kleins to express an \u0001 articulable message with which they disagree; rather, \u0001 their objection is to being compelled to engage in any \u0001 conduct that they regard as expressive. \"'[A]n \u0001 incidental burden on speech is no greater than is \u0001 essential, and therefore is permissible'\" if \"'the neutral \u0001 regulation promotes a substantial government interest \u0001 that would be achieved less effectively absent the \u0001 regulation.'\" FAIR , 547 US at 67 (quoting United States v. Albertini , 472 US 675, 689, 105 S Ct 2897, 86 L Ed 2d 536 (1985)). Given that the state's interest is toavoid the \"evil of unequal treatment, which is theinjury to an individual's sense of self-worth andpersonal integrity,\" King , 61 Or App at 203, there is no doubt that that interest would be undermined ifbusinesses that market their goods and services to the\"public\" are given a special privilege to exclude certaingroups from the meaning of that word. Thus, weconclude that the final order in this case survives FirstAmendment scrutiny. (5) Oregon Constitution, Article I, section 8 The Kleins assert that BOLI's final order also violates their rights under Article I, section 8, of theOregon Constitution, which provides that \"[n]o lawshall be passed restraining the free expression ofopinion, or restricting the right to speak, write, or printfreely on any subject whatever[.]\" The Kleins'argument is limited to the observation that Article I,section 8, has been held to establish broader protectionfor speech than the First Amendment, a premise fromwhich they conclude that, \"since BOLI's Final Orderviolates the federal Constitution's Speech Clause, itPet.App.95also violates the Oregon Constitution's broader \u0001 counterpart a fortiori .\" We have rejected the First \u0001 Amendment predicate for that derivative argument, \u0001 and the Kleins do not offer any separate analysis under \u0001 the state constitution. Accordingly, we reject their \u0001 argument under Article I, section 8, without further \u0001 discussion. See, e.g. , State v. Dawson , 277 Or App 187, 189-90, 369 P3d 1244, rev den , 359 Or 847 (2016) (declining to consider inadequately developedargument under the state constitution on appeal). b. Free exercise of religion We turn to the Kleins' contention that BOLI's order violates their constitutional right to the free exercise oftheir religion. The Kleins advance two argumentsunder the United States Constitution: (1) BOLI's finalorder is not merely the application of a \"neutral andgenerally applicable\" law because it impermissibly\"targets\" religion, and (2) order implicates theKleins' \"hybrid rights,\" subjecting it to heightenedscrutiny that The Kleins also invokethe Oregon Constitution's free-exercise clauses inArticle I, sections 2 and 3, contending that: (1) as underthe federal constitution, the final order impermissiblytargets religion, and (2) even if the final order does notimpermissibly target religion, they should be grantedan exemption to ORS 659A.403 on religious grounds.For the reasons explained below, we reject the Kleins'arguments. The First Amendment proscribes laws \"prohibiting the free exercise of\" religion. The question presented bythis case is whether BOLI's final order enforcing ORS659A.403 against the Kleins runs afoul of thatconstitutional guarantee; if it does, the order is invalidPet.App.96unless it can survive strict scrutiny. See Church of the \u0001 Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 US 520, 546- 47, 113 S Ct 2217, 124 L Ed 2d 472 (1993); United\u0001 States v. Lee , 455 US 252, 257-58, 102 S Ct 1051, 71 L \u0001 Ed 2d 127 (1982) . The answer begins with Employment Division, \u0001 Oregon Department of Human Resources v. Smith , in\u0001 which the United States Supreme Court held that \"the \u0001 right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of \u0001 the obligation to comply with a 'valid and neutral law \u0001 of general applicability on the ground that the law \u0001 proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion \u0001 prescribes (or proscribes).'\" 494 US at 879 (quoting Lee,\u0001 455 US at 263 n 3 (Stevens, J., concurring)). Put \u0001 another way, neutral and generally applicable laws do \u0001 not offend the Free Exercise Clause simply because \u0001 \"the law has the incidental effect of burdening a \u0001 particular religious practice.\" Church of Lukumi \u0001 Babalu Aye, Inc. , 508 US at 531. To determine whether a law is \"neutral,\" courts first \u0001 ask whether \"the object of [the] law is to infringe upon \u0001 or restrict practices because of their religious \u0001 motivation.\" Id. at 533. To determine a law's object, we \u0001 begin with the text, as \"the minimum requirement of \u0001 neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face.\" Id.\u0001 \"A law lacks facial neutrality if it refers to a religious \u0001 practice without a secular meaning discernible from \u0001 the language or context.\" Id. \"Apart from the text, the \u0001 effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence of \u0001 its object.\" Id. at 535; see id. (cautioning that mere \u0001 \"adverse impact will not always lead to a finding of \u0001 impermissible targeting\"). Additionally, whether a law \u0001 is \"generally applicable\" depends on whether thePet.App.97government selectively seeks to advance its interests \u0001 \"only against conduct with a religious motivation.\" Id.\u0001 at 543. Nothing in the text of ORS 659A.403 or BOLI's final \u0001 order is facially discriminatory towards the exercise of \u0001 religious beliefs. Rather, the statute prohibits any\u0001 \"place of public accommodation\" from discriminating characteristics, including \"sexual orientation.\" Similarly, BOLI's order is, on its \u0001 face, a neutral application of ORS 659A.403 that gives \u0001 no indication that the result would have been different \u0001 if the Kleins' refusal of service was based upon secular \u0001 rather than religious convictions. A law that is written in neutral terms may still \u0001 violate the Free Exercise Clause, however. In Church\u0001 of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. , the Court concluded that \u0001 the city ordinances in question\u2014which prohibited \u0001 certain animal slaughtering for \"ritual[s]\" and \u0001 \"sacrifice\"\u2014were not neutral because some important \u0001 terms, as the ordinances defined them, targeted the \u0001 Santeria religion's practice of ritualistic animal \u0001 sacrifice while exempting other secular and religious \u0001 practices like hunting and kosher slaughter. 508 US at \u0001 535-36. The laws were also not \"generally applicable\" \u0001 because they were substantially underinclusive in \u0001 advancing the government's stated interests of \u0001 protecting the public health and preventing cruelty to \u0001 animals. Id. at 543. Rather, the laws were \"drafted \u0001 with care to forbid few killings but those occasioned by \u0001 religious sacrifice.\" Id. Here, the Kleins advance a similar argument that \u0001 BOLI's order violates the Free Exercise Clause because \u0001 it applies ORS 659A.403 in a way that impermissiblyPet.App.98\"targets\" religion for disfavored treatment. They \u0001 contend that the final order was a \"novel expansion\" of \u0001 ORS 659A.403 that \"was, at best, discretionary and \u0001 done for the specific purpose of forcing business owners \u0001 with moral reservations about same-sex marriage to \u0001 either violate their consciences or go out of business.\" \u0001 (Emphasis removed.) BOLI responds that no evidence \u0001 exists to support the Kleins' assertions, which are \u0001 \"pure speculation and utterly without merit.\" On review of the record, we agree with BOLI. The \u0001 Kleins have directed us to no evidence whatsoever that \u0001 ORS 659A.403 was enacted for the purpose of singling \u0001 out religiously motivated action, or that BOLI has \u0001 selectively targeted religion in its enforcement of the \u0001 statute. The Kleins likewise fail to support their \u0001 assertion that BOLI's final order constitutes a \"novel \u0001 expansion\" of the stat ute, rather than a \u0001 straightforward application of a facially neutral statute \u0001 to the facts of this case. For those reasons, the Kleins' \u0001 \"targeting\" argument is meritless. The Kleins' second argument under the federal Free \u0001 Exercise Clause is that the final order burdens their \u0001 \"hybrid rights.\" That is, the final order burdens both\u0001 Free Exercise rights and other constitutional rights, a \u0001 combination that purportedly triggers an exception to \u0001 Smith and subjects even neutral laws of general \u0001 applicability to strict scrutiny. The Kleins' argument \u0001 relies on the following passage from Smith : \"The only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment bars application of aneutral, generally applicable law to religiouslymotivated action have involved not the FreeExercise Clause alone, but the Free ExercisePet.App.99Clause in conjunction with other constitutional \u0001 protections, such as freedom of speech * * *. * * * \"The present case does not present such a \u0001 hybrid situation, but a free exercise claim \u0001 unconnected with any communicative activity * * *.\" 494 US at 881-82. We have previously expressed skepticism about whether a \"hybrid-rights \"doctrine\" exists, and, to theextent it does, how it could be properly applied. InChurch at 295 S. 18th Street, St. Helens , we referred to the Smith passage as \" dictum ,\" observing that it merely \"noted\u2014without reference to any particularstandard\u2014that, in the past, the Court had struck downneutral, generally applicable laws when a case'involved' both the Free Exercise Clause and someother constitutional protection.\" 175 Or App at 114,127-28. We questioned whether that dictum could be soundly applied as a legal standard in other cases: \"Why the addition of another constitutional claim would affect the standard of review of afree exercise claim is not immediately obvious.Indeed, if the mere allegation of an additionalconstitutional claim has the effect of altering thestandard articulated in Smith , then the 'hybrid' exception likely would swallow the Smith rule; free exercise claims will frequently also pose atleast a colorable free speech claim. On the otherhand, if the Court meant that strict scrutinypertains only when an additional constitutionalclaim is successfully asserted, then the rule ofSmith becomes mere surplusage, as the churchPet.App.100already would win under the alternate \u0001 constitutional theory.\" Id. at 127-28. Other courts have similarly called the Smith passage dictum and have declined to follow it. See, e.g. , Combs v. Homer-Ctr. Sch. Dist. , 540 F3d 231, 247 (3d Cir 2008) (\"Until the Supreme Court provides direction,we believe the hybrid-rights theory to be dicta .\"); Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of New York, Inc. v. Vill.of Stratton , 240 F3d 553, 561 (6th Cir 2001), rev'd on other grounds , 536 US 150, 122 S Ct 2080, 153 L Ed 2d 205 (2002) (\"That language was dicta and therefore not binding.\"); Knight v. Conn. Dep't of Pub. Health , 275 F3d 156, 167 (2d Cir 2001) (\"[T]he language relating tohybrid claims is dicta and not binding on this court.\"). But see Miller v. Reed , 176 F3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir 1999) (applying a \"colorable claim\" approach, underwhich strict scrutiny applies if the person asserting afree-exercise claim brings an additional constitutionalclaim that has a \"fair probability or likelihood, but nota certitude, of success on the merits\" (internalquotation v. Johnson , 356 F3d 1277, 1295 (10th Cir 2004). The intervening years have given us no reason to reconsider our view that the Smith passage was dictum . Despite the considerable doubts about the \"hybrid-rights doctrine\" that have been expressed incase law and academic commentary, 10 the United 10 See, e.g. , Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. , 508 US at 567 (Souter, J., concurring) (dismissing the doctrine as \"ultimatelyuntenable\"); Kissinger v. Bd. of Trs. of the Ohio State Univ. , 5 F3d 177, 180 (6th Cir 1993) (calling the \"hybrid-rights doctrine\"Pet.App.101States Supreme Court has taken no further steps to \u0001 embrace such a doctrine. We therefore agree with the \u0001 Sixth Circuit's reasoning that, \"at least until the \u0001 Supreme Court holds that legal standards under the \u0001 Free Exercise Clause vary depending on whether other \u0001 constitutional rights are implicated, we will not use a \u0001 stricter legal standard than that used in Smith to\u0001 evaluate generally applicable, exceptionless state \u0001 regulations under the Free Exercise Clause.\" Kissinger \u0001 v.\u0001Bd. of Trs. of Ohio State Univ. , 5 F3d 177, 180 (6th \u0001 Cir 1993). Accordingly, we reject the Kleins' \"hybrid- rights doctrine\" argument. As noted, the Kleins also invoke Article I, sections \u0001 2 and 3, of the Oregon Constitution (the free-exercise \u0001 clauses).11 Under those clauses, when a law is not \u0001 neutral and expressly targets religion, courts examine \u0001 the law with \"exacting scrutiny\"; when the law is \u0001 \"neutral toward religion,\" Oregon Supreme Court \"completely Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies \u00a7 12.3.2.3 at 1261-62 (3d ed 2006) (describing the doctrine's status as unclear); Michael W.McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism and the Smith Decision , 57 U Chi L Rev 1109, 1122 (1990) (\"[A] legal realist would tell us * * *that the Smith Court's notion of 'hybrid' claims was not intended to be taken seriously.\"). 11 Article I, sections 2 and 3, provide: \"Section 2. Freedom of worship. All men shall be secure in the Natural right, to worship Almighty Godaccording to the dictates of their own consciences. \"Section 3. Freedom of religious opinion . No law shall in any case whatever control the free exercise, andenjoyment of religeous [ sic] opinions, or interfere with the rights of conscience.\"Pet.App.102has framed the proper inquiry as whether there is \u0001 \"statutory authority to make such a regulation\" and \u0001 whether an individual claims \"exemption on religious 358 P3d 987 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted) (applying only a \"targeting\" analysis). The Kleins' first argument is that the statute and \u0001 final order are not neutral toward religion because they \u0001 \"target\" the Kleins' religious practice. In support of \u0001 that contention, the Kleins essentially incorporate their \u0001 arguments under the federal Free Exercise Clause; \u0001 they do not contend that the analysis meaningfully \u0001 differs under the state constitution, and we therefore \u0001 reject that argument for the same reasons discussed \u0001 above. Second, the Kleins argue that, even in the absence \u0001 of impermissible targeting, they should be granted a \u0001 religious exemption from compliance with ORS \u0001 659A.403. They rely on two cases\u2014 Hickman and\u0001 Cooper v. Eugene Sch. Dist. , 301 Or 358, 723 P2d 298 \u0001 (1986). As BOLI correctly points out, however, neither \u0001 of those cases actually created a religious exemption to \u0001 a neutral law, or discussed the criteria, methodology, or \u0001 standards that a court would use in determining \u0001 whether to grant one. Cooper dealt with a law that was \u0001 \"not neutral toward religion,\"12 which the Supreme \u0001 Court distinguished from a \"general\" and \"neutral\" 12 Former ORS 342.650 (1965), repealed by Or Laws 2010, ch 105, \u00a7 3 (spec sess), provided: \"No teacher in any public school shall wear any religious dress while engaged in the performance of his duties as ateacher.\"Pet.App.103regulation that could present an issue of an \"individual \u0001 claim to exemption on religious grounds.\" 301 Or at \u0001 368-69. Nearly two decades later, Hickman simply\u0001 cited Cooper , see 358 Or at 15-16 in a case that \u0001 similarly did not present the issue of whether to grant \u0001 a religious exemption, see id. at 17 (\"The issue before \u0001 us, then, is not whether and under what circumstances \u0001 religiously motivated conduct is entitled to an \u0001 exemption from a generally applicable and neutral law. \u0001 Nor is the issue before us the more specific one of \u0001 whether the defendants in this case are entitled to an \u0001 exemption * * *.\"). In short, although the Kleins argue that the Oregon \u0001 Constitution requires that they be granted an \u0001 exemption on religious grounds to an otherwise neutral \u0001 law, the cases on which they rely did not impose such \u0001 a requirement, but merely acknowledged an abstract \u0001 possibility that it could happen in a future case. The \u0001 Kleins have not offered a focused argument for why the \u0001 Oregon Constitution requires an exemption in this \u0001 case, under the methodology for interpreting our \u0001 constitution. See, e.g. , Priest v. Pearce , 314 Or 411, 415- 16, 840 P2d 65 (1992) (identifying \"three levels\" on \u0001 which to interpret the Oregon Constitution: its \"specific \u0001 wording, the case law surrounding it, and the historical \u0001 circumstances that led to its creation\"). They simply \u0001 assert that a religious exemption to ORS 659A.403's \u0001 requirement of nondiscrimination on account of sexual \u0001 orientation would impair the state's nondiscrimination \u0001 goals \"minimally, if at all,\" while furthering goals of \u0001 \"respect and tolerance for people of different beliefs.\" \u0001 That argument does not amount to solid constitutional \u0001 ground in which to root an individual exemption to a \u0001 valid and neutral statute.Pet.App.104Moreover, it is far from clear that a religious \u0001 exemption as proposed by the Kleins would have only \u0001 a \"minimal\" effect on the state's antidiscrimination \u0001 objectives. The Kleins seek an exemption based on \u0001 their sincere religious opposition to same-sex marriage; \u0001 but those with sincere religious objections to marriage \u0001 between people of different races, ethnicities, or faiths \u0001 could just as readily demand the same exemption. The \u0001 Kleins do not offer a principled basis for limiting their \u0001 requested exemption in the manner that they propose, \u0001 except to argue that there are \"decent and honorable\" \u0001 reasons, grounded in religious faith, for opposing same-sex marriage, as recognized by the United States \u0001 Supreme Court in Obergefell , ___ US at ___, 135 S Ct at \u0001 2602. That is not in dispute. But neither the sincerity, \u0001 nor the religious basis, nor the historical pedigree of a \u0001 particular belief has been held to give a special license \u0001 for discrimination. See, e.g ., Bob Jones Univ. v. United \u0001 Ed 2d \u0001 157 (1983) (a religious school's interests in practicing \u0001 its sincerely held religious beliefs by prohibiting \u0001 interracial dating and marriage did not outweigh the \u0001 government's \"overriding interest in eradicating racial \u0001 discrimination in education\" (internal quotation marks \u0001 omitted)). For the foregoing reasons, we reject the Kleins' \u0001 arguments that BOLI's final order violates the federal \u0001 Free Exercise Clause or Article I, sections 2 and 3, of \u0001 the Oregon Constitution. B.Second Assignment: Commissioner's Failure to Recuse Himself In their second assignment of error, the Kleins assert that BOLI's commissioner, Avakian, \"thePet.App.105ultimate [d]ue [p]rocess rights by failing to recuse \u0001 himself despite numerous public comments revealing \u0001 his intent to rule against them.\" Specifically, they \u0001 argue that Avakian's comments about the cake \u0001 controversy in a Facebook post and in an article that \u0001 appeared in The Oregonian show that he judged the \u0001 Kleins' case before giving them an opportunity to \u0001 present their version of the facts and the law. We agree \u0001 with BOLI that Avakian's comments reflect, at most, \u0001 his general views about the law and public policy, and \u0001 therefore are not the kind of comments that require \u0001 disqualification. To establish a due-process violation, \"[o]ne claiming \u0001 that a decision[ ]maker is biased has the burden of \u0001 showing actual bias.\" Becklin v. Board of Examiners for \u0001 Engineering , 195 Or App 186, 207-08, 97 P3d 1216 \u0001 (2004), rev den , 338 Or 16 (2005); see Teledyne Wah \u0001 Chang v. Energy Fac. Siting Council , 298 Or 240, 262, \u0001 692 P2d 86 (1984) (same) (citing Boughan v. Board of \u0001 Engineering Examiners , 46 Or App 287, 611 P2d 670, \u0001 rev den , 289 Or 588 (1980)). When that claim of bias is \u0001 based on prejudgment, the relevant inquiry is whether \u0001 \"the decision maker has so prejudged the particular \u0001 matter as to be incapable of determining its merits on \u0001 the basis of the evidence and arguments presented.\" \u0001 Columbia Riverkeeper v. Clatsop County \u0001 578, 602, 341 P3d 790 (2014). Importantly, in assessing bias, courts have long \u0001 distinguished between a decision-maker's prejudgment \u0001 of facts as opposed to preconceptions about law or \u0001 policy, particularly in the context of quasi-judicial \u0001 decisions. See 1000 Friends of Oregon v. Wasco Co.Pet.App.106Court , 304 Or 76, 82-83, cert den ,\u0001 486 US 1007 (1988) (explaining that the combination of \u0001 executive, legislative, and adjudicative functions within \u0001 a single government body \"leaves little room to demand \u0001 that an elected [official] who actively pursues a \u0001 particular view of the community's interest in his \u0001 policymaking role must maintain an appearance of \u0001 having no such view when the decision is to be made by \u0001 an adjudicatory procedure\"). As we explained in \u0001 Samuel v. Board of Chiropractic Examiners , 77 Or App \u0001 53, 60, 712 P2d 132 (1985), rev den , 302 Or 36 (1986), \u0001 \"[a] preconceived point of view concerning an issue of \u0001 law * * * is not an independent basis for \u0001 disqualification.\" (Citing, inter alia , , 333 68 S Ct 793, 92 L Ed 1010 \u0001 (1948).). In Cement Inst. , the United States Supreme \u0001 Court articulated that principle in the context of a \u0001 challenge to the impartiality of the Federal Trade \u0001 Commission: \"[No previous] decision of this Court would require us to hold that it would be a violation ofprocedural due process for a judge to sit in acase after he had expressed an opinion as towhether certain types of conduct were prohibitedby law. In fact, judges frequently try the samecase more than once and decide identical issueseach time, although these issues involvedquestions both of law and fact. Certainly, theFederal Trade Commission cannot possibly beunder stronger constitutional compulsions inthis respect than a court.\" 333 US at 702-03 (footnote omitted); accord Rombough F2d 893, 900 (2d Cir 1979)Pet.App.107(\"[I]t is not improper for members of regulatory \u0001 commissions to form views about law and policy on the \u0001 basis of their prior adjudications of similar issues \u0001 which may influence them in deciding later cases. An \u0001 agency's conclusions as to general principles of law do \u0001 not require disqualification.\" (Citing, inter alia , Cement\u0001 Inst. , 333 US at 700-03; citations omitted.).). Accordingly, public comments that convey \u0001 preconceptions about law or policy related to a dispute \u0001 do not automatically disqualify a decision-maker from \u0001 judging that controversy. As Judge Jerome Frank \u0001 succinctly observed in In re J.P. Linahan, Inc. , 138 F2d \u0001 650, 651 (2d Cir 1943), if \"'bias' and 'partiality' be \u0001 defined to mean the total absence of preconceptions in \u0001 the mind of the judge, then no one has ever had a fair \u0001 trial and no one ever will.\" The touchstone of bias, \u0001 instead, is whether the comments show that the \u0001 decision maker is not capable of judging the \u0001 controversy fairly on its own facts. See Hortonville Dist. \u0001 v.\u0001Hortonville Educ. Ass'n , 426 US 482, 96 S Ct \u0001 2308, 49 L Ed 2d 1 (1976) (\"Nor is a decision[ ]maker \u0001 disqualified simply because he has taken a position, \u0001 even in public, on a policy issue related to the dispute, \u0001 in the absence of a showing that he is not 'capable of \u0001 judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of \u0001 its own circumstances.'\" (Quoting United States v. \u0001 Morgan , 313 US 409, 421, 61 S Ct 999, 85 L Ed 1429 \u0001 (1941), and citing Cement Institute , 333 US at 701 .)). In assessing a decision-maker's capability in that \u0001 regard, we presume that public officials will perform \u0001 their duties lawfully. Gilmore v. Board of Psychologist \u0001 Examiners , 81 Or App 321, 324, 725 P2d 400, rev den ,\u0001 302 Or 460 (1986) (citing ORS 40.135(1)(j)); seePet.App.108Morgan , 313 US at 421 (\"Cabinet officers charged by \u0001 Congress with adjudicatory functions are not assumed \u0001 to be flabby creatures any more than judges are. Both \u0001 may have an underlying philosophy in approaching a \u0001 specific case. But both are assumed to be men of \u0001 conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of \u0001 judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of \u0001 its own circumstances.\"). In this case, Avakian's comments on Facebook and \u0001 in the The Oregonian fall short of the kinds of \u0001 statements that reflect prejudgment of the facts or an \u0001 impermissibly closed-minded view of law or policy so as \u0001 to indicate that he, as a decision maker, cannot be \u0001 impartial. On Facebook, before a BOLI complaint had \u0001 been filed, Avakian posted: \"Everyone has a right to their religious beliefs, but that doesn't mean they can disobeylaws that are already in place. Having one set ofrules for everybody ensures that people aretreated fairly as they go about their daily lives.\" Below that paragraph, Avakian provided a link to \"'Ace of Cakes' [13] offers free wedding cake for Ore. Gay couple www.kgw.com.,\" followed by another paragraph: \"The Oregon Department of Justice is looking into a complaint that a Gresham bakery refusedto make a wedding cake for a same sexmarriage. * * * It started when a mother anddaughter showed up at Sweet Cakes by Melissalooking for a wedding cake.\" 13 \"Ace of Cakes\" refers to a television show, the host of which provided the complainants with a free wedding cake.Pet.App.109Viewed in context with the rest of the post, \u0001 Avakian's statements that \"[e]veryone has a right to \u0001 their religious beliefs, but that doesn't mean they can \u0001 disobey laws that are already in place,\" and that \u0001 \"[h]aving one set of rules for everybody ensures that \u0001 people are treated fairly as they go about their daily \u0001 lives,\" are comments about the controversy between the \u0001 Kleins and the complainants. However, they do not \u0001 describe particular facts of the case, suggest that \u0001 Avakian has already investigated or decided those \u0001 facts, or even suggest that he has fixed views as to any \u0001 defenses or interpretations of the law that might be \u0001 advanced in the context of a contested proceeding. That \u0001 is, they reflect his general views of law and policy \u0001 regarding public accommodations laws, but not the \u0001 type of prejudgment that casts doubt on whether he is \u0001 capable of judging the controversy fairly in an official \u0001 proceeding. Avakian's statements in The Oregonian article\u0001 likewise fail to demonstrate that he was incapable of \u0001 fairly judging this case. As BOLI points out, the Kleins \u0001 selectively quote from that article to create an \u0001 impression that Avakian was commenting specifically \u0001 on their conduct. For instance, in quoting excerpts, the \u0001 Kleins argue that Avakian \"said that 'folks' in Oregon \u0001 do not have a 'right to discriminate' and stated that \u0001 those who use their 'beliefs' to justify discrimination \u0001 need to be 'rehabilitate[d].'\" (Alterations by the Kleins.) \u0001 Later, the Kleins characterize Avakian as stating that \u0001 \"the Kleins * * * needed to be 'rehabilitate[d].'\" The full quotations from that article, viewed in \u0001 context, present a different picture. The article states, \u0001 \"'Everybody is entitled to their own beliefs, but thatPet.App.110doesn't mean that folks have the right to discriminate,' \u0001 Avakian said, speaking generally .\" (Emphasis added.) \u0001 That sentence follows a paragraph in which the author \u0001 describes the antidiscrimination law generally. Given \u0001 that context, and the author's express qualification \u0001 that Avakian was \"speaking generally,\" there is no \u0001 basis on which to conclude that Avakian was \u0001 commenting specifically on the merits of the Kleins' \u0001 case. Similarly, and contrary to the Kleins' suggestion, \u0001 the article does not quote Avakian as saying that the\u0001 Kleins must be \"rehabilitated.\" Rather, the article \u0001 quotes Avakian concerning a more general proposition: \u0001 \"'The goal is never to shut down a business. The goal is \u0001 to rehabilitate,' Avakian said. 'For those who do violate \u0001 the law, we want them to learn from that experience \u0001 and have a good, successful business in Oregon.'\" \u0001 Again, nothing in that quote suggests that Avakian \u0001 was responding to a question about the Kleins in \u0001 particular, as opposed to BOLI investigations in \u0001 general. Indeed, the context again suggests the latter. \u0001 The next sentence in the article states, \"The bureau's \u0001 civil rights division conducts about 2,200 investigations \u0001 a year on all types of discrimination, Avakian said.\" There is, in fact, only one quote attributed to \u0001 Avakian in The Oregonian article that appears to relate \u0001 specifically to the Kleins' case\u2014one that they do not \u0001 mention. With regard to BOLI's investigation of the \u0001 complaint against the Kleins, Avakian is quoted as \u0001 saying, \"'We are committed to a fair and thorough \u0001 investigation to determine whether there's substantial \u0001 evidence of unlawful discrimination.'\"Pet.App.111In sum, the public comments on which the Kleins \u0001 rely do not demonstrate anything more than Avakian's \u0001 general views about law and policy related to \u0001 antidiscrimination statutes.14 Because those types of \u0001 public comments do not establish a lack of impartiality \u0001 for purposes of due process, we reject the Kleins' second \u0001 assignment of error. C.Third Assignment: Damages Award In their third assignment of error, the Kleins argue that BOLI's damages award of $75,000 and $60,000 toRachel and Laurel, respectively, is not supported bysubstantial evidence or substantial reason. See ORS 183.482 (8)(c) (\"The court shall set aside or remand theorder if the court finds that the order is not supportedby substantial evidence in the record.\"); Hamilton v. Pacific Skyline, Inc. , 266 Or App 676, 680, 338 P3d 791 (2014) (explaining that the \"substantial reasonrequirement inheres in our substantial evidencestandard of review under ORS 183.482(8)(c)\"). Withinthe assignment of error, they make three distinctcontentions: (1) the damages award is inconsistent with BOLI's findings and ignores the Kleins' mitigatingevidence and evidence of the complainants' discoveryabuses; (2) the damages award is \"internallycontradictory\" with regard to recovery for emotionaldistress resulting from publicity of the case; and (3) thedamages award is out of line with BOLI's awards in 14 The Kleins' opening brief appears to include, by way of an appendix, material that was not part of the administrative record.We have confined our review to public comments by Avakian thatwere raised in the Kleins' motion to disqualify and that were before the ALJ and BOLI in the proceedings below.Pet.App.112other cases. As discussed below, we reject each of those \u0001 challenges. To better frame the arguments, we provide \u0001 additional context for the damages award. Under ORS \u0001 659A.850(4)(a)(B), BOLI is authorized to \"[e]liminate \u0001 the effects of the unlawful practice that the respondent \u0001 is found to have engaged in, including but not limited \u0001 to paying an award of actual damages suffered by the \u0001 complainant and complying with injunctive or other \u0001 equitable relief[.]\" In this case, BOLI's formal charges \u0001 alleged that, pursuant to that statute, each \u0001 complainant claimed \"[d]amages for emotional, mental, \u0001 and physical suffering in the amount of at least$75,000.\" At the hearing on damages, BOLI offered evidence \u0001 of the emotional distress that the complainants \u0001 suffered as a result of the Kleins' denial of service, \u0001 including testimony from Rachel and Laurel. The \u0001 Kleins offered evidence to rebut BOLI's evidence that \u0001 the refusal of service was the source of the \u0001 complainants' distress, including evidence that, during \u0001 the relevant time period, the complainants were \u0001 engaged in a custody dispute for their two foster \u0001 children. They also elicited testimony from Rachel's \u0001 brother to support their theory that the complainants \u0001 were pursuing the case for political reasons rather than \u0001 to remedy emotional distress. During closing arguments, BOLI's prosecutor \u0001 explained that the agency was seeking damages related \u0001 to two different causes: \"There are two distinct causes of emotional distress damages in this case. The first is thePet.App.113damage that's based on the refusal itself, and for \u0001 that the Agency is seeking $75,000 for each \u0001 Complainant. There is also the damages that \u0001 resulted from the media scrutiny of this case, \u0001 and for that amount we would defer to the \u0001 forum's discretion.\" BOLI's prosecutor then proceeded to argue the two causes separately, first recounting testimony about thefeelings of embarrassment, depression, sadness, andanger that Rachel and Laurel experienced around thetime of the refusal and thereafter, including the strainthat it put on their relationship and their relationshipswith others. The prosecutor then argued that \"[t]hesecond cause of emotional distress is this mediascrutiny.\" She contended that the media coverage hadmade Rachel and Laurel fearful for their lives, afraidfor the safety of their foster children, and anxious thatit would jeopardize their then-pending efforts to adoptthe children. Anticipating a challenge to the amount of the damages sought, BOLI's prosecutor argued thatemotional distress damages are \"very fact specific,\" andthat \"$75,000 for the refusal itself is very well within the parameters of what's appropriate.\" (Emphasisadded.) The Kleins responded that the complainants had not told a consistent story throughout; that there wasno credible evidence that the emotional distresssuffered by the complainants was actually caused bythe denial of service as opposed to other factors in thecomplainants' lives, such as the custody dispute; thatneither Rachel nor Laurel was present for Aaron's\"abomination\" statement when Cheryl returned to thePet.App.114shop and that, in any event, there was disagreement as \u0001 to what he actually said; and that the previous cases \u0001 referenced by BOLI's prosecutor involved more severe \u0001 instances of discriminatory treatment. In rebuttal, BOLI's prosecutor emphasized that \u0001 whether Aaron called the complainants \"an \u0001 abomination\" or quoted a Bible verse using that word \u0001 was \"beside the point\": \"[H]ow it was couched doesn't \u0001 really matter; the word is what resonated with the \u0001 Complainants.\" In his proposed final order, the ALJ set forth \u0001 extensive factual findings, including express credibility \u0001 determinations regarding the witnesses at the hearing. \u0001 The ALJ found that Rachel, despite being an \u0001 \"extremely emotional witness,\" had \"answered \u0001 questions directly in a forthright manner\" and \"did not \u0001 try to minimize the effect of media exposure on her \u0001 emotional state as compared to how the cake denial \u0001 affected her.\" The ALJ explained that it credited \u0001 Rachel's testimony \"about her emotional suffering in its \u0001 entirety,\" but that he \"only credited her testimony \u0001 about media exposure when she testified about specific \u0001 incidents.\" The ALJ found Laurel less credible. That was \u0001 because Laurel \"was a very bitter and angry witness \u0001 who had a strong tendency to exaggerate and over-dramatize events,\" argued with the Kleins' attorney \u0001 and \"had to be counseled by the ALJ to answer the \u0001 questions asked of her instead of editorializing about \u0001 the cake refusal and how it affected her,\" and her \u0001 \"testimony was inconsistent in several respects with \u0001 more credible evidence.\" Thus, the ALJ \"only credited \u0001 her testimony about media exposure when she testifiedPet.App.115about specific incidents\" and otherwise credited her \u0001 testimony only \"when it was either (a) undisputed, or \u0001 (b)\u0001disputed but corroborated by other credible \u0001 testimony.\" The ALJ then set forth his reasoning regarding a \u0001 damages award, describing specific aspects of each \u0001 complainant's emotional suffering and distinguished \u0001 \"suffering from the cake refusal\" from \"suffering from \u0001 publicity about the case.\" With regard to the latter, the \u0001 ALJ ultimately concluded that, as a factual matter, the \u0001 Kleins were \"responsible\" for at least some of the \u0001 publicity that had followed the initial refusal, but that \u0001 \"there is no basis in law for awarding damages to \u0001 Complainants for their emotional suffering caused by \u0001 media and social media attention related to this case.\" The ALJ's proposed final order then set forth his \u0001 conclusion on the amount of damages related to the \u0001 initial refusal: \"In this case, the forum concludes that $75,000 and $60,000, are appropriate awards tocompensate Complainants [Rachel] and for the emotional suffering theyexperienced from Respondents' cake refusal.[Laurel] is awarded the lesser amount becauseshe was not present at the cake refusal and theforum found her testimony about the extent andseverity of her emotional suffering to beexaggerated in some respects.\" BOLI, in its final order, largely adopted the reasoning and conclusions proposed by the ALJ,including his credibility determinations. BOLI, like theALJ, separately discussed the emotional suffering ofPet.App.116each complainant with regard to the denial of service \u0001 and from publicity. And, like the ALJ, BOLI concluded \u0001 that damages for emotional suffering caused by media \u0001 attention were not recoverable. BOLI's final order also adopted the ALJ's analysis \u0001 of the amount of damages to each complainant. The \u0001 order states: \"In this case, the ALJ proposed that are appropriate awards tocompensate and Laurel], respectively,for the emotional suffering they experiencedfrom Respondents' denial of service. Theproposal for [Laurel] is less because she was notpresent at the denial and the ALJ found hertestimony about the extent and severity of heremotional suffering to be exaggerated in somerespects. In this particular case, the demeanor ofthe witnesses was critical in determining boththe sincerity and extent of the harm that wasfelt by [Rachel and Laurel]. As such, theCommissioner defers to the ALJ's perception ofthe witnesses and evidence presented at hearingand adopts the noneconomic award as proposed,finding also that this noneconomic award isconsistent with the forum's prior orders.\" In a footnote to that paragraph, the order cites specific BOLI cases in which damages were awarded, in amounts ranging from $50,000 to $350,000 percomplainant. With that background, we return to the issues presented by the Kleins' third assignment of error. 1.Countervailing evidencePet.App.117The Kleins assert that its credibility determinations\"\u2014specifically, \u0001 BOLI's findings regarding what Aaron actually said to \u0001 Cheryl when she returned to Sweetcakes after the \u0001 initial refusal of service. According to the Kleins, BOLI \u0001 found as fact that Aaron did not actually refer to \u0001 Rachel as an \"abomination\" but had only quoted a verse \u0001 from the Book of Leviticus, stating, \"You shall not lie \u0001 with a male as one lies with a female; it is an \u0001 abomination.\" Yet, BOLI awarded damages to both \u0001 complainants \"for harm attributable to being called \u0001 'abomination[s].'\" We do not read BOLI's order to rest on a finding \u0001 that Aaron specifically called the complainants \"an \u0001 abomination\" as opposed to quoting a biblical verse. As \u0001 described above, BOLI argued during the damages \u0001 hearing that exactly how the word was \"couched\" was \u0001 beside the point. BOLI's final order likewise reflects a \u0001 focus on the effect of the word \"abomination\" on the \u0001 complainants, including their recognition of that \u0001 biblical reference and their associations with the \u0001 reference. For instance, the order states that Rachel, \u0001 who was brought up as a Southern Baptist, \u0001 \"interpreted [Aaron's] use of the word 'abomination' [to] \u0001 mean that God made a mistake when he made her, \u0001 that she wasn't supposed to exist, and that she had no \u0001 right to love or be loved[.]\" Similarly, the order states \u0001 that Laurel recognized the statement as a reference \u0001 from Leviticus and, based on her religious background, \u0001 \"understood the term 'abomination' to mean 'this is a \u0001 creature not created by God, not created with a soul. \u0001 They are unworthy of holy love. They are not worthy of \u0001 life.' \"Pet.App.118Viewing the final order as a whole, we see no \u0001 inconsistency. BOLI found that Aaron used the term \u0001 \"abomination\" in the course of explaining why he was \u0001 denying service to the complainants on account of their \u0001 sexual orientation, and further found that the \u0001 complainants experienced emotional distress based on \u0001 the use of that term. It is that nexus that underlies \u0001 BOLI's damages award. The Kleins also argue that the final order does not \u0001 account for certain evidence that undermined the \u0001 damages case, including evidence that the \u0001 complainants were pursuing the case out of a desire for \u0001 political change and that they were experiencing stress \u0001 from their custody dispute at the time. The Kleins also \u0001 argue that the final order fails to account for ways in \u0001 which the complainants frustrated the Kleins efforts to \u0001 \"discover the true extent of their alleged emotional \u0001 harm.\" According to the Kleins, the final order \u0001 therefore lacks substantial reason. The Kleins' argument in that regard \"misconceives \u0001 the nature of the substantial reason requirement.\" \u0001 Jenkins v. Board of Parole , 356 Or 186, 208, 335 P3d \u0001 828 (2014). As the Supreme Court explained in \u0001 Jenkins , an order satisfies the substantial reason \u0001 requirement so long as it \"provide[s] an explanation \u0001 connecting the facts of the case and the result reached, \u0001 and [there is] no indication that, in making its decision, \u0001 the [agency] relied on evidence that did not qualify as \u0001 substantial evidence.\" Id. Beyond that, an agency \u0001 generally is not required to explain why it was not \u0001 persuaded by particular evidence. See D. T. v. Dept. of \u0001 Human Services , 247 Or App 293, 304 269 P3d \u0001 (2011) (\"The 'substantial reason' test does not requirePet.App.119an agency to expressly reject each of a petitioner's \u0001 arguments or recount all the evidence that the agency \u0001 considered; rather, it requires that an agency \u0001 adequately explain 'the reasoning that leads * * * from \u0001 the facts that it has found to the conclusions that it \u0001 draws from those facts.'\" (Quoting Drew v. PSRB Or App \u0001 287, 291, 249 P3d 158, rev den , 350 Or 573 (2011) (\"[T]he board relied primarily on Stigler's opinion, and \u0001 adequately explained why it found his opinion to be the \u0001 most persuasive. The board was not required to explain \u0001 why all the other opinions were less persuasive. \u0001 Stigler's opinion constitutes substantial evidence and \u0001 supports the board's findings.\"); see also Jenkins , 356\u0001 Or at 200 n 6 (\"Nothing in [a previous decision, Gordon\u0001 v.\u0001Board of Or 618, 175 P3d 461 (2007),] \u0001 suggests that, for purposes of substantial reason review \u0001 under ORS 183.482(8)(c), the court believed that the \u0001 board was required to identify specific evidence in the \u0001 record that supported its ultimate determinations of \u0001 fact and law.\"). In this case, BOLI's order includes extensive factual \u0001 findings regarding the emotional suffering that the \u0001 complainants experienced and it connects the amount \u0001 of damages to that suffering. That is sufficient to \u0001 satisfy the substantial reason requirement, and we \u0001 decline to reweigh, under the guise of substantial \u0001 reason, the competing evidence as to the extent of the \u0001 complainants' damages. See Multnomah County \u0001 Sheriff's Office v. , 277 Or 540, 562, 373 \u0001 P3d 1099 (2016), aff'd, 361 Or 761, 399 P3d 969 (2017) (explaining that \"the amount of damages that aPet.App.120complainant is entitled to is an issue of fact,\" which we \u0001 review for substantial evidence). 2.\u0001Damages from publicity and media attention Next, the Kleins argue that the damages award is \u0001 internally inconsistent in its treatment of harm caused \u0001 by media attention from the case. According to the \u0001 Kleins, BOLI's formal charges \"sought $150,000 in total\u0001 damages based on alleged emotional suffering \u0001 stemming from the denial of service and subsequent \u0001 media exposure.\" (Emphases by the Kleins.) But then, \u0001 despite concluding that the complainants were not\u0001 entitled to recover for harm attributable to media \u0001 exposure, the final order awards an amount close to the \u0001 prayer. The Kleins' argument proceeds from a mistaken \u0001 premise. BOLI's formal charges did not seek \"$150,000 \u0001 in total damages based on alleged emotional suffering \u0001 stemming from the denial of service and subsequent \u0001 media exposure.\" (Emphases by the Kleins.) Rather, \u0001 the formal charges sought damages in \"the amount of \u0001 at least $75,000 \" for each complainant. (Emphasis \u0001 added.) And, as described above, BOLI's prosecutor \u0001 clearly expressed during the damages hearing\u2014and \u0001 the ALJ plainly understood\u2014that BOLI was seeking$75,000 for each complainant for the refusal itself and \u0001 additional damages, at the ALJ's discretion, for harm \u0001 attributable to media and social media attention. Both \u0001 the ALJ's preliminary order and BOLI's final order \u0001 reflect that understanding of the damages request. 15 15 The ALJ's order states, \"The Formal Charges seek damages for emotional, mental and physical suffering in the amount of 'at leastPet.App.121Thus, there is no plausible basis on which to infer that, \u0001 by awarding $75,000 to Rachel and $60,000 to Laurel, \u0001 BOLI relied to any extent on emotional suffering from \u0001 media attention, particularly when BOLI's order \u0001 expressly says otherwise. The Kleins' alternative contention regarding \u0001 publicity damages is based on a statement that BOLI \u0001 made in the context of denying recovery for those \u0001 damages. In that part of the order, BOLI concluded \u0001 that \" complainants' emotional harm related to the \u0001 denial of service continued throughout the period of \u0001 media attention and that the facts related solely to \u0001 emotional harm resulting from media attention do not \u0001 adequately support an award of damages.\" (Emphases \u0001 added.) According to the Kleins, that emphasized text \u0001 reflects that BOLI \"awarded damages for harm lasting \u0001 over twenty-six months\" related solely to the initial \u0001 denial of service, yet the proposed final order and final \u0001 order \"note a near total lack of any such evidence\" \u0001 regarding persistent harm from the initial refusal. $75,000' for each Complainant. In addition to any emotional suffering experienced by Complainants as a direct result ofSweetcakes' refusal to bake them a cake ('cake refusal'), the Agency also seeks damages for suffering caused to Complainants by media publicity and social media responses to this case.\" The final order likewise explains that the formal charges sought \"at least $75,000\" for each complainant and, \"[i]n additionto any emotional suffering experienced by Complainants as adirect result of Sweetcakes' refusal to bake them a cake ('denial ofservice'), the Agency also seeks damages for suffering caused toComplainants by media publicity and social media responses tothis case.\"Pet.App.122The Kleins' mischaracterize the relevant orders. In \u0001 his proposed final order, the ALJ distinguished \u0001 testimony about specific incidents involving emotional \u0001 suffering from testimony about emotional suffering \u0001 more generally. The ALJ credited Laurel's testimony \u0001 that she \"still feels emotional effects from the denial of \u0001 service because [Rachel and their two children] 'were' \u0001 still suffering and that 'was' tearing me apart.\" The \u0001 ALJ also specifically found that Rachel had not tried \u0001 \"to minimize the effect of media exposure on her \u0001 emotional state as compared to how the cake denial \u0001 affected her,\" and he credited Rachel's testimony \u0001 \"about her emotional suffering in its entirety.\" His \u0001 order further states: \"Without giving any specific examples, [Rachel] credibly testified that, in a general sense, the cake refusal has caused her continuedemotional suffering up to the time of hearing . Other than that, she did not testify as to anyspecific suffering she experienced after February1 that was directly attributable to the cakerefusal.\" (Emphasis added; footnote omitted.) In adopting the ALJ's reasoning, BOLI's final order similarly distinguished between generalized testimonyand testimony about specific instances of suffering, andit repeated the ALJ's findings in that regard. Viewed in context, BOLI's findings and conclusions demonstrate that it credited Laurel's and Rachel'stestimony that, at the time of the hearing, theycontinued to experience some degree of emotionalsuffering from the initial refusal, but the final orderPet.App.123also reflects that BOLI understood that evidence to be \u0001 generalized and limited. Nothing in the final order \u0001 indicates that BOLI gave that evidence more weight \u0001 than it could bear, or suggests that the agency relied on \u0001 evidence that was not substantial when determining \u0001 damages. Rather, the complainants' generalized \u0001 evidence of continued suffering until the time of the \u0001 hearing is one among the many facts on which the \u0001 agency relied to support the damages award in the \u0001 final order. See Edwards , 277 Or App at 563 (\"[A] \u0001 complainant's testimony, if believed, is sufficient to \u0001 support a claim for emotional distress damages.\"); id. (citing Peery v. Hanley , 902 P2d 602 \u0001 (1995), for the proposition that a \"plaintiff's testimony, \u0001 if believed, is sufficient to establish [the] causation \u0001 element of [an] emotional distress claim\")). 3.\u0001Consistency with other BOLI awards Finally, the Kleins argue that BOLI's award lacks \u0001 substantial reason because it is \"out of line with \u0001 comparable cases.\" The Kleins contend, as they did \u0001 below, that the complainants' suffering relates to a \u0001 single, discrete incident, whereas past BOLI cases with \u0001 such significant damages awards involved ongoing \u0001 harassment and typically involved emotional suffering \u0001 so severe that it required medical treatment. Fact-matching, when considering emotional distress \u0001 damages, is of limited value. As we explained in \u0001 Edwards , BOLI must consider \"the type of \u0001 discriminatory conduct, and the duration, frequency, \u0001 and severity of the conduct. It also considers the type \u0001 and duration of the mental distress and the \u0001 vulnerability of the [c]omplainant.\" 277 Or App at 563Pet.App.124(internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in \u0001 original). The actual amount of any award, therefore, \u0001 depends on the facts presented by each complainant. \u0001 Id. As BOLI notes in its final order, the agency has \u0001 awarded far greater damages than $75,000 and$60,000 to a complainant in cases involving invidious \u0001 discrimination. E.g., In the Matter of Andrew W. Engel, \u0001 DMD , 32 BOLI 94, 114, 140-41 (2012) (awarding $325,000 in damages for \"emotional, mental, and \u0001 physical suffering\" to a complainant subjected to \u0001 harassment for religious beliefs, which resulted in \u0001 anxiety, stress, insomnia, gastrointestinal problems \u0001 and weight loss requiring medical treatment); In the\u0001 Matter of From the Wilderness, Inc. , 30 BOLI 227, 284- 85, 292-93 (2009) (awarding $125,000 in damages for \u0001 \"mental and emotional suffering\" to a complainant \u0001 subjected to verbal and physical sexual harassment for \u0001 more than two months before being fired and then \u0001 retaliated against, and who then suffered panic attacks \u0001 requiring medical treatment). BOLI has also awarded \u0001 lesser amounts in cases involving significant trauma, \u0001 e.g., In the Matter of Charles Edward Minor , 31 BOLI \u0001 88, 99, 104-05 (2010) (awarding $50,000 in damages for \u0001 \"emotional, mental, and physical suffering\" to a \u0001 complainant subjected to verbal and physical sexual \u0001 harassment, with the abuse culminating in the \u0001 respondent striking her in the head with his fist, and \u0001 the abuse caused anxiety, reclusiveness, and fear). \u0001 Nonetheless, given BOLI's detailed factual findings \u0001 about the effect of the refusal of service on these \u0001 particular complainants\u2014including anger, depression, \u0001 questioning their own identity and self-worth, \u0001 embarrassment, shame, frustration, along with anxietyPet.App.125and reduced excitement about the wedding itself\u2014we \u0001 cannot say that the order is so far out of line with \u0001 previous cases that it lacks substantial reason. See\u0001 Edwards , 277 Or App at 542-43, 564-65 (reaching a \u0001 similar conclusion with regard to BOLI's $50,000 \u0001 emotional-distress award to a complainant who had not \u0001 received the veterans' preference during a hiring \u0001 process, and the complainant experienced physical \u0001 symptoms of stress, was \"upset,\" \"felt that he was not \u0001 receiving the respect to which he was entitled,\" and his \u0001 \"relationships suffered\"; and observing that the award \u0001 \"was comparable to the awards given in [one previous \u0001 BOLI case] and significantly less than the award given \u0001 in [another case] to a complainant who suffered similar \u0001 symptoms of emotional distress\"). For the foregoing reasons, we reject the third \u0001 assignment of error and affirm the damages award. D.Fourth Assignment: Application of ORS 659A.409 In their fourth assignment of error, the Kleins contend that BOLI erred in concluding that theyviolated ORS 659A.409. That statute provides, aspertinent here, that \"it is an unlawful practice for any person acting on behalf of any place of public accommodationas defined in ORS 659A.400 to publish, circulate, issue or display, or cause to be published,circulated, issue or displayed, anycommunication, notice, advertisement or sign ofany kind to the effect that any of theaccommodations, advantages, facilities, servicesor privileges of the place of publicaccommodation will be refused, withheld from orPet.App.126denied to, or that any discrimination will be \u0001 made against, any person on account of race, \u0001 color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national \u0001 origin, marital status or age * * *.\" ORS 659A.409. In essence, the statute makes it unlawful to threaten to commit unlawfuldiscrimination. In its final order, BOLI concluded thatthe Kleins did so through several statements, asdiscussed below, and enjoined them from committingfurther violations. The Kleins acknowledge that BOLI \"may enjoin people from threatening to discriminate on the basis ofsexual orientation,\" without implicating the FirstAmendment. Cf. FAIR , 547 US at 62 (observing that Congress may, for example, require employers to \"takedown a sign reading 'White Applicants Only'\").However, the Kleins argue that the statements thatBOLI found objectionable did not communicate anyintention to discriminate in the future, but merelyexpressed the Kleins' views about the ongoingcontroversy and their belief in the validity of their legaland moral position. The final order describes three discrete statements attributed to the Kleins. First, in the February 2014interview with Tony Perkins, Aaron described his briefconversation with Rachel at Sweetcakes that led to himtelling her, \"[W]e don't do same-sex marriage, same-sexwedding cakes.\" Second, at a different point in thatsame interview, Aaron related an earlier conversationthat he had had with Melissa regarding the prospect oflegalized same-sex marriage; in that conversation,according to Aaron, he and Melissa agreed that theycould \"see it is going to become an issue but we have toPet.App.127stand firm.\" Third, BOLI relied on the handwritten \u0001 sign that was taped to the inside of Sweetcakes' front \u0001 window, which read, in part, \"Closed but still in \u0001 business. * * * This fight is not over. We will continue \u0001 to stand strong. Your religious freedom is becoming not \u0001 free anymore. This is ridiculous that we cannot practice \u0001 our faith. The LORD is good and we will continue to \u0001 serve HIM with all our heart.\" In the final order, BOLI reasoned that the above \u0001 statements, considered in \"text and context,\" were \u0001 properly construed as \"the recounting of past events,\" \u0001 but also \"constitute notice that discrimination will be \u0001 made in the future by refusing such services.\" As a \u0001 result, BOLI's final order included language ordering \u0001 the Kleins \"to cease and desist\" from making any \u0001 communication \"to the effect that\" they would \u0001 discriminate in the future \"on account of sexual \u0001 orientation.\" The language in the order precisely tracks \u0001 the statutory language in ORS 659A.409, quoted above. On judicial review, the Kleins essentially make two \u0001 arguments. First, they argue that BOLI erred in \u0001 concluding that the three statements, individually or \u0001 collectively, violated ORS 659A.409 by communicating \u0001 an intention to discriminate in the future. In the \u0001 Kleins' view, those statements simply describe \"the \u0001 facts of this case, their view of the law, and their intent \u0001 to vindicate that view.\" Second, the Kleins argue that \u0001 BOLI's injunction is overbroad to the extent that it \u0001 purports to restrict the Kleins from expressing those \u0001 views. We agree with the Kleins' first point. Aaron's \u0001 statements in the February 2014 interview can be \u0001 reasonably understood only one way: as describing pastPet.App.128events. BOLI's order states that Aaron \"did not say \u0001 only that he would not do complainants' specific \u0001 marriage and cake but, that respondents 'don't do' \u0001 same-sex marriage and cakes.\" But regardless of \u0001 whether his words can be understood to refer generally \u0001 to same-sex marriage and cakes, BOLI ignores the \u0001 context in which he made that remark during the \u0001 interview. Aaron was asked by the interviewer, \"Tell us \u0001 how this unfolded and your reaction to that.\" He \u0001 responded by describing what had happened on the day \u0001 of the refusal , including, \" I said , 'I'm very sorry, I feel \u0001 like you may have wasted your time. You know we \u0001 don't do same-sex marriage, same-sex wedding cakes.' \u0001 And she got upset, noticeably, and I understand that.\" \u0001 (Emphasis added.) Viewed in that context, Aaron's \u0001 recounting of those historical events cannot be \u0001 understood as a statement that he would deny service \u0001 in the future. Likewise, Aaron's recounting, during the interview, \u0001 of past conversations that he and Melissa had engaged \u0001 in before the denial of service cannot reasonably be \u0001 understood as an assertion of their plans to \u0001 discriminate in the future. Aaron was asked by the \u0001 interviewer whether the controversy with the \u0001 complainants had caught him off guard, and he \u0001 responded, \"[I]t was one of those situations where we \u0001 said 'well I can see it is going to become an issue but we \u0001 have to stand firm.'\" That statement plainly recounted \u0001 his past thinking and cannot reasonably be construed \u0001 as the kind of threat of prospective discrimination that \u0001 ORS 659A.409 prohibits. That leaves the note taped to the Sweetcakes \u0001 window. Again, that note read:Pet.App.129\"Closed but still in business. You can reach \u0001 me by email or facebook. \u0001 www.sweetcakesweb.com or Sweetcakes by \u0001 Melissa facebook page. New phone number will \u0001 be provided on my website and facebook. This \u0001 fight is not over. We will continue to stand \u0001 strong. Your religious freedom is becoming not \u0001 free anymore. This is ridiculous that we cannot \u0001 practice our faith. The LORD is good and we will \u0001 continue to serve HIM with all our heart [heart \u0001 symbol].\" (Uppercase and underscoring in original; spacing altered.) BOLI concedes that the statement could referto their intention to stand strong in their legal fight,but argues that it \"also could refer to the denial ofservices to same-sex couples.\" We are not persuaded that, given the ambiguity in the note, it can serve as an independent basis forBOLI's determination that the Kleins violated ORS659A.409\u2014and, indeed, BOLI did not purport to relyon the note alone. As explained above, in overturningthe ALJ's determination regarding ORS 659A.409,BOLI relied heavily on statements in the Perkinsinterview\u2014taken out of context\u2014to conclude that theKleins had communicated an intention to discriminatein the future. When those statements and the note areviewed in their proper context, the record does notsupport BOLI's conclusion that the Kleins violatedPet.App.130ORS 659A.409. We therefore reverse that part of \u0001 BOLI's order.16 Reversed as to BOLI's conclusion that the Kleins \u0001 violated ORS 659A.409 and the related grant of \u0001 injunctive relief; otherwise affirmed. 16 BOLI expressly declined to award damages based on the violation of ORS 659A.409, so our decision affects only the part ofBOLI's order that grants injunctive relief.Pet.App.131 APPENDIX D [July 12, 2022] BEFORE THE COMMISSIONER OF THE BUREAU OF LABOR AND INDUSTRIES OF THE STATE OF OREGON In the Matter of: MELISSA ELAINE KLEIN, dba SWEETCAKES BY MELISSA, and AARON WAYNE KLEIN, dba SWEETCAKES BY MELISSA, and, in the alternative, individually as an aider and abettor under ORS 659A.406, Respondents. Case Nos. 44-14 & 45-14 AMENDED FINDINGS OF FACT ULTIMATE FINDINGS OF FACT CONCLUSIONS OF LAW OPINION ORDER Pet.App.132 SYNOPSIS The Agency's Formal Charges alleged that Respondents refused to make a wedding cake for two Complainants based on their sexual orientation and that Respondents published and displayed a communication to that effect, in violation of ORS 659A.403 and ORS 659A.409. In addition, the Formal Charges alleged that Aaron Klein aided and abetted Melissa Klein in the commission of those violations. In this Amended Final Order, the Commissioner concludes that: (1) A. Klein, acting on behalf of Sweetcakes by Me lissa, refused to make a wedding cake for Complainants based on their sexual orientation, thereby violating ORS 659A.403; (2) M. Klein did not violate ORS 659A.403; (3) A. Klein did not aid and abet M. Klein in violation of ORS 659A.406 and (4) neither A. nor M. Klein violated ORS 659A.409. The Commissioner held that, as partners, A. Klein and M. Klein are jointly and severally liable for all violations. On remand, the Commissioner awards Complainants $20,000 and $10,000, respectively, in damages for emotional and mental suffering resulting from the denial of service. Following issuance of the original Final Order in this matter, that order was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals reversed the order in part and affirmed in part. Klein v. Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries , 289 Or. App. 507, 410 P.3d 1051 (2017) rev. den., 363 Or. 224, 434 P.3d 25 (2018) ( Klein I ). The Court of Appeals reversed that order as to the findings that Respondents Aaron Pet.App.133 Klein and Melissa Klein violated ORS 659A.409 and the related injunctive relief. On further appeal, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and vacated and remanded th e judgment back to the Oregon Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of its decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm'n , 584 U.S. __, 138 S. Ct. 1719, 201 L. Ed. 2d 35 (2018). Klein v. Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, __ U.S. __, 139 S. Ct. 2713, 204 L. Ed. 2d 1107 (2019) ( Klein II ). On January 26, 2022, the Oregon Court of Appeals issued its opinion on remand, again reversing the findings that Aaron Klein and Melissa Klein violated ORS 659A.409 and the related injunctive relief, reversing and remanding the order as to damages, and otherwise affirming the order. Klein v. Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries , 317 Or. App. 138, 140-41, 506 P.3d 1108 (2022) ( Klein III ). This Amended Final Order is issued on remand from the Oregon Court of Appeals. In this Amended Final Order, the findin g of a violation of ORS 659A.409 and the associated injunctive relief has been amended consistent with the Court of Appeal's ruling. Further findings on the damages award are made below, reducing the noneconomic damages awarded to Complainants to $20,000 and $10,000 respectively and clarifying the basis for the commissioner's award. Otherwise, the original final order is affirmed. NOTE: The procedural history of this case is extensive and includes the ALJ's lengthy ruling on Respondents' motion and the Agency's cross-motion for summary judgment. For ease of reading, all Pet.App.134 procedural facts, pre-hearin g motions, and rulings on those motions are included as an Appendix to this Final Order. The Appendix immediately follows the \"Order\" section of this Fi nal Order that bears the Commissioner's signature. IMPORTANT: The Judicial Review Notice that customarily follows the \"Order\" section of Commissioner's Final Orders may be found on the last page of this Final Order. The above-entitled case came on regularly for hearing before Alan McCullough, designated as Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") by Brad Avakian, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries for the State of Oregon. The hearing was held at the Office of Administrative Hearings, located at 7995 S. W. Mohawk Street, Entrance B, Tualatin, Oregon. The evidentiary part of the hearing was conducted on March 10-13, and 17, 2015, and closing arguments were made on March 18, 2015. The Bureau of Labor and Industries (\"BOLI\" or \"the Agency\") was represented by BOLI's chief prosecutor, Jenn Gaddis, and Cristin Casey, administrative prosecutor , both employees of the Agency. Paul Thompson, Complainants' attorney, was present throughout the hearing. Complainants Rachel Bowman-Cryer and Laurel Bowman-Cryer were both present throughout the hearing. Respondents Melissa Klein and Aaron Wayne Klein were both present throughout the hearing and were represented by Herbert Grey, Tyler Smith, and Anna Harmon, attorneys at law. Pet.App.135 The Agency called the following witnesses: Rachel Bowman-Cryer, La Bowman-Cryer, Ponaman, Candice Ericksen, Laura Widener, Aaron Klein, and Melissa Klein. Respondent called the following witnesses: Aaron Klein, Melissa Klein, and Rachel Bowman- Cryer. At hearing, the forum received into evidence: a) Administrative exhibits X1 through X95. b) Agency exhibits A1 through A12, A23 (pp. 1- 4), A25, and A27 through A29 were received. Exhibit A30 was offered but not received. c) Respondents' exhibits R2 (selected \"posts\" on pp. 3 and R1, R14, and R17 were offered but not received.

They met in 2004 while they attended the same college and considered themselves a \"couple\" for the 11 years preceding the hearing. They lived together in Texas until 2009, when they moved to Portland, Oregon, and have lived together continuously since moving to Portland. (Testimony of LBC, RBC, McPherson) 2) LBC first asked RBC to marry her soon after they met and was turned down. LBC continued to propose on a regular basis until October 2012, when RBC finally agreed to marry her. (Testimony of RBC, LBC) 3) Before October 2012, RBC did not want to get married because of her person al experience of failed marriages that \"tended to do more damage than good.\" (Testimony of RBC, LBC, McPherson) 4) In November 2011, Complainants became foster parents for \"E\" and \"A,\" 11 two disabled children with 10 Except for Finding of Fact #43 - The Merits, the findings of fact relevant to the foru m's determination of whether Respondents violated ORS 659A.403, ORS 659A.406, and ORS 659A.409 are set out in the foru m's ruling on Respondents' Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment and the Agency's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgme nt.

Pet.App.138 very high special needs, after the death of their mother, LBC's best friend. At the time, Complainants were already the children's godparents. When they beca me the children's foster parents, Complainants deci ded that they wanted to adopt the children. Subsequently, Complainants became involved in a bitter and emotional custody battle for the children with the children's great- grandparents that continued until sometime after December 2013, when Complainants' December 2013 adoption application was formally approved by the state of Oregon. 12 (Testimony of LBC, RBC, McPherson) 5) In October 2012, RBC decided that she and LBC should get married in order to give their foster children \"permanency and commitment\" by showing them how much she and LBC loved one another and were committed to one another. RSC told LBC that she wanted to get ma rried, which made LBC \"extremely happy.\" After her long-standing matrimonial reticence, RBC then became excited to get married and to start planning the wedding, wanting a wedding that was as \"big and grand\" as they could afford. (Testimony of RBC, LBC) 6) Sometime between October 2012 and January 17, 2013, RBC and Cheryl Mc Pherson (\"CM\"), RBC's mother, attended a Portland bridal show. MK had a 12 Although it is undisputed that Complainants eventually adopted the children, there is no evidence as to what date the adoptions were finalized. Pet.App.139 booth at the show to advertise wedding cakes made by Sweetcakes by Melissa (\"Sweetcakes\"). Two years earlier, Sweetcakes had designed, created, and decorated a wedding cake for CM and RBC that RBC really liked. At the show, RBC and CM visited Sweetcakes's booth and told MK they would like to order a cake from her. Af ter the show, RBC made an appointment via email for a cake tasting at Sweetcakes. (Testimony of RBC, CM, MK; Ex. R16) 7) Complainants were both excited about the cake tasting at Sweetcakes because the cake Respondents had made for CM's wedding had been so good and RBC wanted to order a cake like GM's cake. (Testimony of RBC, A. Cryer) 8) On January 17, 2013, RBC and CM visited Sweetcakes's bakery shop in Gresham, Oregon for their cake tasting appointment, intending to order a cake for RBC's wedding to LBC. (Respondents' Admission; Affidavit of AK; Testimony of RBC, CM, AK) 9) In January 2013, AK and MK were alternately caring for their infant tw ins at their home. At the time of the tasting, MK was at home and AK conducted the tasting. During the tasting, AK asked for the names of the bride and groom, and RBC told him there would be two brides and their names were \"Rachel and Laurel.\" Atthat point, AK stated that he was sorry, but that Sw eetcakes did not make wedding cakes for same-sex ceremonies because of AK's and MK's religious co nvictions. In response, RBC began crying. She felt that she had humiliated her mother and was anxious whether CM was Pet.App.140 ashamed of her, in that CM had believed that being a homosexual was wrong until only a few years earlier. CM then took RBC by the arm and walked her out of Sweetcakes to their car. On the way out to their car and in the car, RBC became hysterical and kept telling CM \"I'm sorry\" because she felt that she had humiliated CM. (Respondents' Admission; Affidavit of AK; Testimony of RBC, CM) 10) In the car, CM hugged RBC and assured her they would find someone to make a wedding cake. CM drove a short distance, then returned to Sweetcakes and re-entered Sweetcakes by herself to talk to AK. During their subsequent conversation, CM told AK that she used to think like him, but her \"truth had changed\" as a result of having \"two gay children.\" AK quoted Leviticus 18:22 to CM, saying \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\" CM then left Sweetcakes and returned to the car. While CM was in Sweetcakes, RBC remained sitting in the car, \"holding [her] head in her hands, just bawling.\" (Affidavit of AK; Testimony of RBC, CM) 11) When CM returned to the car, she told RBC that AK had told her that \"her children were an abomination unto God.\" (Testimony of RBC; CM) 12) When CM told RBC that AK had called her \"an abomination,\" this made RBC cry even more. RBC was raised as a Southern Baptist. The denial of service in this manner made her feel as if God made a mistake when he made her, that she wasn't supposed to be, and that she wasn't supposed to love or be loved, have a family, or go to heaven. Pet.App.141 (Testimony of RBC) 13) CM and RBC then dr ove home. RBC was crying when they arrived home and immediately went upstairs to her bedroom, followed by LBC and CM, where she lay in her bed, crying. 13 In the bedroom, LBC asked CM what had happened, and CM told her that AK had told them that Sweetcakes did \"not do same-sex weddings\" and that AK had told CM that \"your children are an abomination.\" LBC was \"flabbergasted\" at AK's statement about same-sex weddings. This upset her and made her very angry. (Testimony of RBC, LBC, CM) 14) LBC, who was raised as a Catholic, recognized Klein's statement as a reference from Leviticus. She was \"shocked\" to hear that AK had referred to her as an \"abomination,\" and thought CM may have heard wrong. She took the denial of service in this manner to mean \" ... this is a creature not created by God, not created with a soul; they are unworthy of holy love; they are not worthy of life.\" She immediately thought that this never would have happened if she had not asked RBC to marry her and felt shame because of it. She also worried that this might negatively impact CM's acceptance of RBC's sexual orientation. (Testimony of LBC) 13 RBC credibly testified as follows: \"I was beyond upset. I just wanted everybody to leave me alone. I couldn't face looking at my mom, and I didn't even know if I still wanted to go through with getting married anymore. So I just told everybody to leave me alone as much as po ssible, and I went to my room.\" Pet.App.142 15) LBC, who had always viewed herself as RBC's protector, got into bed with RBC and tried to soothe her. RBC became even mo re upset and pushed RBC away. In response, BC lost her temper and started yelling that she \"could not believe this had happened\" and that she could \"fix\" things if RBC would just let her. After LBC left the room, RBC continued crying and spent much of that evening in bed. (Testimony of RBC, LBC, CM) 16) Back downstairs, E, the older of Complainants' foster daughters was extremely agitated from events at school that day. LBC tried to calm her, but she refused to be calmed, repeat edly calling out for RBC, with whom she had a special bond. Eventually, E cried herself to sleep. LBC' s inability to calm E was very frustrating to her. She felt overwhelmed because she didn't know how to handle the situation. That night, LBC was very up set, cried a lot, and was hurt and angry. (Testimony LBC, A. Cryer) 17) After CM returned home on January 17, 2013, she telephoned \"Lauren\" at the West End Ballroom (\"WEB\"), the venue where Complainants planned to have their commitment ceremony and told Lauren that Sweetcakes had refused them cake service for their wedding. CM also posted a review on Sweetcakes Facebook wedding page and on another wedding website with a message stating: \"If you're a gay couple and having a commitment ceremony or wedding, don't go to this place because they discriminate against gay people.\" (Testimony of CM; Ex. R22) 18) At 8:22 p.m. on January 17, 2013, Lauren from Pet.App.143 WEB emailed RBC and LBC to say she had heard from CM and wanted to know the details of the refusal at Sweetcakes. (Testimony of LBC; Ex. R32) 19) At 9:10 p.m. on January 17, 2013, RBC sent a return email to Lauren at WEB in which she stated: \"Hi Lauren, \"I am sorry to have to bring this to your attention. I want to assure you that we would have gone with Sweet Cakes reguardless (sic) of your recommendation, because we purchased my mother's wedding cake from them and were very happy with the cake. My girlfriend and I purchased my mother's cake as a wedding gift for her. At that time Melissa said nothing about not wanting to work for us because we were gay. \"I even spoke with them at the Portland Wedding Show and made an appointment then for 1 pm today. When we showed up for the appointment it was with Melissa's husband. I did not catc h his name because the appointment did not last long enough for me to ask. He took us in the office and asked what the bride and groom names were. When we told him that our names were Rachel and Laurel, he quickly said that they don't do gay weddings because they are Christians and don't believe same-sex marriage is right. My mother asked why they had no problem taking my money when I purchased her cake. She told them that we are a Christian family as well and that she used to believe like he believed until God Pet.App.144 blessed her with two gay children. \"I was stunned and crying. This is twice in this wedding process that we have faced this kind of bigotry. It saddens me because we moved from Texas so that my brother and I could be more accepted in the community. \"We wanted to inform you of all of this because you have a right to know so that other same-sex couples don't have to go through this in the future. It surprisingly that both the West End Ballroom and the caterers we chose, Premier Catering, reccommend (sic) Sweet Cakes and yet neither mentioned to us that they don't do gay weddings. I figure that this must be because no one ever speaks up to let you know. I didn't want to let this pass without saying something. \"My fiance and I have been together for 10 years. We are adopting our two foster children and wanted to get married as a sign of our commitment to each other and the family that we are creating. It saddens me that my children will grow up in a world where people are an abomination because they love each other. It is my responsibility to set an example for them that you should speak up when you see injustice because that is how we make progress. 'Thank you for your fast response to both my mother and I realize that you are not Pet.App.145 responsible for their poor behavior, and thank you for your understanding. If there is anymore info that I can provide for you please let me know. \"Sincerely, Rachel Cryer & Laurel Bowman\" (Testimony of LBC; Ex. R32) 20) Later that same evening, LBC filled out an \"Oregon Department of Justice (\"DOJ'') Consumer Complaint Form,\" using her smart phone to access DOJ's website. In hard copy, 14 the complaint was two pages long. On the first page, she provided her name, address, phone number and email address, Sweetcakes's name, address, and phone number. On the first page, immediately above the space where LBC wrote her name, the following text was printed: \"By submitting this complaint, I understand a) this complaint will become part of DOJ's permanent records and is subject to Oregon's Public Records Law; b) this complaint may be released to the business or person about whom I am complaining; c) this complaint may be referred to another governmental 14 The record lacks substantial evidence to establish what the digital format for the complaint form looked like, but Ex. R3 is a hard copy of the complain t that Respondents received. The forum relies on that copy in de scribing the contents and format of the complaint. Pet.App.146 agency. By submitting this complaint, I authorize any party to release to the DOJ any information and documentation relative to this complaint\" This public records disclaimer was not visible on LBC's smart phone view of DOJ's form. On the second page, LBC described the details of her complaint as follows: \"In november of 2011 my fiance and I purchased a wedding cake from this establishment for her mother's wedding. We spent 250. When we decided to get married ourselves chose to back and purchase a second cake. Today, January 17, 2013, we went for our cake tasting. When asked for a grooms name my soon to be mother in law informed them of my name. The owner then proceeded to say we were abominations unto the lord and refused to make another cake for us despite having already paid 250 once and having done business in the past. We were then informed that our money was not equal, my fiance reduced to tears. This is absolutely unacceptable.\" (Testimony of LBC; Exhibit R3) 21) Aaron Cryer, RB C's brother, also lived with Complainants at this time. Later on the evening of January 17, 2013, he arrived home from school and work and he and Complainants had a 30 minute Pet.App.147 conversation about what happened at Sweetcakes that day. (Testimony of A. Cryer) 22) On January 18, 2013, RBC felt depressed and questioned whether there was something inherently wrong with the sexual orientation she was born with and if she and LBC deserv ed to be married like a heterosexual couple. She spent most of her day in her room, trying to sleep . (Testimony of RBC) 23) In the days following January 17, 2013, RBC had difficulty controlling her emotions and cried a lot, and Complainants argued because of RBC's inability to control her motions. They had not argued previously since moving to Oregon. RBC also became more introverted and distant in her family relationships. She and A. Cryer have always been very close, and their connection was not as close \"for a little bit\" after January 17, 2013. RBC questioned whether she had the ability to be a good mother because of the difficulty she was having in controlling her emotions. A week later, RBC still felt \"very sad and stressed,\" felt concerned about still having to plan her wedding and felt less exuberant about the wedding. Previous to that time, she had been \"very friendly and happy\" in her communications with Candice Ericksen, A and E's great aunt, about her wedding. After January 17, 2013, although RBC relied on CM to contact potential wedding vendors, she experienced anxiety over possible rejection because her wedding was a same-sex wedding. (Testimony of RBC, LBC, CM, A. Cryer, Ericksen) 24) In the days following January 17, 2013, LBC Pet.App.148 experienced extreme anger, outrage, embarrassment, exhaustion, frustration, in tense sorrow, and shame as a reaction to AK's refusal to provide a cake. She felt sorrow because she couldn't console E, she could not protect RBC, and beca use RBC was no longer sure she wanted be married. Her excitement about getting married was also lessened because she was not sure she could protect RBC if any similar incidents occurred. (Testimony of RBC, LBC, Ericksen) 25) After January 17, 2013, CM assumed the responsibility for contacting the vendors who would be needed for Complainants' ceremony. Shortly thereafter, she arranged for a cake tasting at Pastry Girl (\"PG\"), another local bakery. While making the appointment, CM asked Laura Widener, PG's owner/baker, if she was okay with providing a cake for a same-sex wedding ceremony. Widener assured her that this was not a problem. (Testimony of RBC, CM, Widener; Ex. R4) 26) On January 21, 2013, CM and RBC went to PG and met with Widener. While at PG, CM and RBC were both anxious, and CM did most of the talking, while RBC tried not to cry until they started talking about the design of the cake. At that point, RBC became more animated and was able to explain the design she wanted on the cake. By the end of the meeting, the design they se ttled on was a cake with three tiers that had a peacock's body on top and the peacock's tail feathers traili ng down over tiers to the cake plate. When completed, the peacock and its feathers were hand-created and hand-painted by Widener. Widener charged Complainants $250 for Pet.App.149 the cake. (Testimony of Widener, RBC, CM) 27) Respondents would have charged $600 for making and delivering the same cake. (Testimony of AK) 28) On January 28, 2013, DOJ mailed a copy of LBC's Consumer Complaint to Respondents, along with a cover letter. In pertinent part, DOJ's cover letter stated: \"We have received the enclosed consumer complaint about your business. We understand that there are often two sides to a problem, and we would appreciate your prompt review of this matter. \"We do not represent the complainant. We do, however, review all complaints to determine whether grounds exist to warrant action by us. Your response to the allegations in the complaint would help us to make that determination. \"In the interest of efficiency, we prefer that you respond directly to the complainant and e-mail copy of the response to our office. Please include the file number shown above on the subject line of your e-mail. Alternatively, you may respond to us by regular mail.\" On January 29, AK posted a copy of the first page of LBC's DOJ complaint on hi s Facebook page, prefaced by his comment \"[t]his is what happens when you tell Pet.App.150 gay people you won't do their 'wedding cake.\"' At that time, AK only had 17 \"frien ds\" on his Facebook page. (Testimony of LBC, AK; Exs. R3, A4) 29) On the AK posted LB C's DOJ complaint, LBC received an email telling her of the posting and that she should look at it. LBC did so, then called Paul Thompson, Complainants' attorney in this proceeding. Later that day, the posting was removed. (Testimony of LBC, AK) 30) On February 1, 2013, LB C went to the emergency room of a local hospital at approximately 8:00 p.m. because of an injury to her shoulder that she had suffered three weeks earlier when lifting one of her foster children above her head when they were playing. While in the hospital, she became aware that AK's refusal to make thei r wedding cake was on the news. This made her very upset and she cried when she was examined by a doctor, telling the doctor that she had an \"unpleasant interaction with a business owner, and now this information is on the news.\" (Testimony of LBC; Exs. A6, R7) 31) On February 1, 2013, RBC became aware that the media was aware of AK's refusal to make a wedding cake for Complainants when she received a telephone call from Lars Larson, an American conservative talk radio show host based in Portland, Oregon, who told her that he had spoken with AK and wanted to see what RBC \"had to say-about the pending case.\" RBC refused to talk with Larson and called LBC, who was at the hospital having her Pet.App.151 shoulder examined. (Testimony of RBC, LBC) 32) As soon as they became aware that LBC's DOJ complaint had become public knowledge through the media, both Complainants greatly feared that E and A would be taken away from them by the state of Oregon's foster care system. 15 Earlier, they had been instructed that it was th eir responsibility to make sure that the girls' information was protected and that the state would \"have to readdress placement\" of the girls with complainants if any information was released concerning the girls. (Testimony of RBC, LBC) 15 The level of Complainants' concern over their foster parent status was vividly illustrated in RBC's and LBC's testimony on direct examination by the Agency: R. Bowman-Cryer Q: \"So how did you react? How did you react to hearing about your case, l guess, or your situation in the news?\" A: \"My first concern was that nobody could know that we had these children and that whatever we did had to be to protect them. We did not want their names in the media. We did not want any information about them or our foster parent status or the status of their case to be public knowledge to anyone.\" L. Bowman-Cryer Q: \"Was the fear from that initial media release ever lessened for you?\" A: \"No, ma1am. That fear was paramount to everything.\" Q: 1When you say paramount, was it greater for you than the actual refusal of service? A: \"At that point in time, yes, ma'am.\" Q: \"Did you still feel emotiona l effects from the refusal of service?\" A: \"Absolutely, yes, ma'am. My ch ildren were still suffering. My wife was still suffering, and that was tearing me apart.\" Pet.App.152 33) Based on the media or potential media exposure about the case after February 1, 2013, LBC's headaches increased. She felt intimidated and became fearful. (Testimony of LBC; Ex. A12) 34) At some point after February 1, 2013, one of RBC's Facebook \"friends\" saw an article about the case in her local Florida paper and posted it on Facebook, adding in her comments that RBC and LBC had children. RBC immediately responded, writing: \"Jessica - I know you were trying to defend us, but you released information about our kids. The public doesn't know we have kids; that is the whole point of being silent. Please remove your comment immediately.\" RBC's \"friend\" responded and said she removed her comment as soon as she read RBC's response. (Testimony of RBC; Ex.A26) 35) On February 8, 2013, Paul Thompson sent a letter regarding Complainants and their situation to the following media sources: KGW, KOIN, The Oregonian, OPB, KATU, KPTV, the Lars Larson Radio Show, The Wall Street Journal, Willamette Week, and Reuters. The le tter read as follows: \"Members of the Media: \"I would like to begin by thanking each of you for your interest in this story. As you know, I represent the lesbian couple who were denied a wedding cake by Sweet Cakes by Melissa. I ask that their names not be printed in regards to this statement, as they would appreciate privacy in this matter. Pet.App.153 \"The Press Release reads: \"We are grateful for the outpouring of support we have received from friends, family, members of the LGBT community, and our allies. We are especially thankful that LGBT-supportive companies have graciously offered their services to make our special day perfect \"At this time, the support of the community and other well-wishers is all we require. We ask that individuals and companies that want to provide support, direct their donations in our name to Pride Northwest, our pride organization in Portland, Oregon. They have accepted our request to direct donations and gifts to further awareness of issues affecting the LGBT community, including marriage equality and families. Interested parties can contact Cory L Murphy of Pride Northwest with any questions. * * * \"We have decided to accept the gracious offer from Mr. Duff Goldman of Charm City Cakes and the TV show 'Ace of Cakes.' At the time Mr. Goldman made his offer we had already contracted with and paid for another local bakery, Pastrygirl, to make our wedding cake. It is extremely important to us to honor that contract With that in mind we have humbly asked Mr. Goldman and Charm City Cakes to prepare a Brid e's cake for us in place of the traditional Groom's cake. We are Pet.App.154 grateful to both bakeries for being a part of making our wedding date incredibly special. \"While we are humbled by the support and mindful of people's inte rest, this matter has placed us in the media spotlight against our wishes. In order to maintain our privacy, we will not be granting interviews and are asking everyone to respect our privacy at this time. \"Please direct any media inquiries to our attorney, Paul Thompson[.]\" (Exs. A7, R28) 36) On February 9, 2013, there was an organized protest outside Respondents' bakery that was reported by KATU.com. The protest was organized by a person or persons who started a Facebook page called \"BoycottSweetCakesByMelissaGRESHAM\" (\"Boycott\") on February 6, 2013 and posted a photo from KATU.com that shows \"protesters gathered Saturday outside a Gresham bakery that's at the center of a wedding cake controversy.\" Complainants were not involved in the protest or subsequent boycott. However, on February 10, 2013, both Complainants made comments on Boycott's Facebook page in which they indirectly identified themselves as the persons who sought the wedding cake and thanked people for their support. (Exs. R9, R13) 37) On February 8, 2013, He rbert Grey, Respondents' lead counsel in this case, sent a letter to DOJ that responded to LBC's January 17, 2013, consumer Pet.App.155 complaint. In the letter, Grey identified himself as representing Respondents concerning the complaint filed by \"Laurel Bowman\" and addressed the issues raised in the complaint. Grey also cc'd a copy of his letter to LBC. (Ex. R10) 38) On February 12, 2013, DOJ emailed a copy of LBC's DOJ consumer complaint to a number of media sources, along with a note stating: \"Hey everyone, \"Please pardon the mob email. But it seems the most efficient and fair thing to do. Attached is the initial Sweet Cakes complaint as well as the newly received response from the bakery owners' lawyer. The other new development is that the complainants have informed the DOJ and BOLI that they plan on filing a complaint with BOLI. That has yet to happen as early this afternoon. But we're told it's the plan. At that point, the DOJ's involvement in the saga will end.\" On February 13, 2013, this email was forwarded to Herb Grey, Respondents' attorney, by Tony King, the executive producer of the Lars Larson Show. (Ex. R15) 39) After LBC's DOJ complaint was publicized in the media, Complainants both had negative confrontations from relatives who learned about their complaint against Respondents through the media. In January 2013, LBC had just begun to re-Pet.App.156 establish a relationship with an aunt who had physically and emotionally abused her as a child and also owned all of the family property. Shortly after LBC's complaint became public, the aunt insisted through social media that LBC drop the complaint. She also called LBC and told her she was not welcome on family property and she would shoot LBC \"in the face\" if LBC ever set foot on the family's property in Ireland or the United States. This threat \"devastated\" LBC, as it meant she could not visit her mother or grandmother, both of whom lived on family property. RBC's sist er, who believed that homosexuals should not be allowed to get married, wrote a Facebook message to the Kleins to tell them that she supported them. This was a \"crushing blow\" to RBC, and it hurt her and made her very angry at her sister. (Testimony of LBC, RBC, CM; Ex. A 16) 40) On June 27, 2013, Complainants had a commitment ceremony at the West End Ballroom, a venue located at 1220 S.W. Taylor in downtown Portland. On the day of the ceremony, the words \"ROMANCE BY CANDLELIGHT - STARRING RACHEL AND LAUREL - JUNE 27, 2013\" were posted on a large billboard on the street-facing wall of the WEB. Only invited guests were allowed to attend the ceremony. Just prior to the ceremony, Duff Goldman's free cake was delivered by an incognito motorcyclist. At the ceremony, Complainants and their gues ts celebrated with their cakes from Pastry Girl and Goldman. After the ceremony, Complainants considered themselves to be married even though they could not be legally married in the state of Oregon at that time. (Testimony of RBC, LBC, Widener; Exs. R18, R19) Pet.App.157 41) On August 8, 2013, RBC filed a verified complaint with BOLI alleged that Sweetcakes by Melissa had discriminated against her by refusing to make her a wedding cake because of her sexual orientation. (Testimony of RBC; Ex. A27) 42) On August 14, 2013, BOLI's Communications Director issued a press release related to RBC's complaint. The first paragr aph read: \"Portland, OR-A same-sex couple has filed an antidiscrimination complaint with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) against a Gresham bakery, Sweet Cakes by Melissa, for a llegedly refusing service based on sexual orientation.\" (Ex. R20) 43) During the CBN video interview described in Finding of Fact #12 in the ALJ's Summary Judgment Ruling, CBN broadcast a picture of a handwritten note taped on the inside of a front window at Sweetcakes' bakery in Gresham. The note read: \"Closed but still in business. You can reach me by email or facebook. www.sweetcakesweb.com or Sweetcakes by Melissa facebook page. New phone number will be provide on my website and facebook. This fight is not over.We will continue to stand strong. Your religious freedom is becoming not free anymore. This is ridiculous that we cannot practice our faith. The LORD is good and we will continue to serve HIM with all our heart. [heart symbol]\" (Ex. 1-1, Respondents' Motion for Summary Pet.App.158 Judgment) 44) On November 7, 2013, LBC filed a verified complaint with BOLI alleging that Sweetcakes by Melissa had discriminated against her by refusing to make her a wedding cake because of her sexual orientation. (Testimony of LBC; Ex. A28) 45) On January 17, 2014, BOLI's Communications Director issued a press release that began and ended with the following statements: \"BOLI finds substantial evidence of unlawful discrimination in bakery civil rights complaint Sweet Cakes complaint will now move into conciliation to determine whether settlement can be reached \"Portland, OR - A Gresham bakery violated the civil rights of a same-sex couple when it denied service based on sexual orientation, a Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) investigation has found. \"The couple filed the complaint against Sweetcakes by Melissa under the Oregon Equality Act of 2007, a law that protects the rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender Oregonians in employment, housing and public places. \"* * * * * \"Copies of the complaint are available upon request. * * *\" Pet.App.159 (Ex. R24) 46) Complainants were legally married by signing a \"legal document of marriage\" in 2014, a few days after Oregon's ban on same-sex marriage was struck down in federal court. (Testimony of RBC) 47) From February 1, 2013, until the time of the hearing, many people have made \"hate-filled\" comments through social media and in the comments sections of various websites that were supportive of Respondents and critical of or threatening to Complainants. These comments and the media attention caused RBC stress, anger, pain, frustration, suffering, tort ure, shame, humiliation, degradation, fear that she would be harassed at home because the DOJ complaint with Complainants' home address had been posted on Facebook, and the feeling that her reputation was being destroyed. (Testimony of RBC, LBC, CM; Ex. A24) 48) The publicity from the case and accompanying threats from third parties on social media made RBC \"scared\" for the lives of A, E, LBC, and herself. (Testimony of RBC) 49) Although AK has been interviewed by the media on a number of occasions about the case, he did not initiate any contacts with the media. Other than posting LBC's DOJ complaint on his Facebook page, there is no evidence that AK gave Complainants' names to the media. Finally, there is no evidence in Pet.App.160 the record of any untruthful statements that AK or MK made to public media regarding their case.16 (Testimony of AK; Entire Record) 50) Except for Paul Thompson's February 8, 2013, press release, Complainants have never solicited media attention nor been interviewed by the media with regard to this case. (Testimony of RBC, LBC) 51) Candice Ericksen, Laura Widener, Melissa Klein, Jessica Ponaman, and Aaron Cryer were credible witnesses and the forum has credited their testimony in its entirety. (Testimony. of Ericksen, Widener, M. Klein, RBC, Ponaman) 52) For the most part, CM's testimony was credible, even though her answers frequently strayed from the subject of the questions. However, the forum did not believe her earlier statements to Ponaman that RBC was \"throwing up\" because she was so nervous and that \"for days [RBC] couldn't get out of bed\" because RBC did not testify to those facts and because RBC spent 30 minutes talking with LBC and A. Cryer the night of January 17, 2013 and went to a cake tasting at Pastry Girl on January 21, 2013. Due to these exaggerations, the forum has only credited CM's testimony when it was either (a) undisputed, or (b) 16 Complainants testified th at they were upset by Respondents' repeated untruthful statements about them in the media, but did not testify as to any specific incident in which Respondents made untruthful statements of which they were aware and the Agency presented no other evidence of any such statements. Pet.App.161 disputed but corroborat ed by other credible testimony. (Testimony of CM) 53) AK was a credible witness-except for his testimony that he did not realize that LBC's name and address were on the DOJ complaint that he posted on his Facebook pa ge. LBC's name, address, and phone number are conspicuously printed on the complaint immediately above Sweetcakes's name, address, and phone number, and the forum finds- it extremely unlikely that AK would have posted the complaint without reading it, particularly since he posted a comment immediately above it that read: \"This is what happens when you tell gay people you won't do their 'wedding' cake.\" Apart from that testimony, the forum has credited AK's testimony in its entirety. (Testimony of AK) 54) RBC was an extremel y emotional witness who was in tears or close to tears during most of her testimony. Despite her emotional state, she answered questions directly in a forthright manner. She did not try to minimize the effect of media exposure on her emotional state as compared to how the denial of service affected her. The forum has credited RBC's testimony about her emotional suffering in its entirety. However, the forum has only credited her testimony about media exposure when she testified about specific incidents. (Testimony of RBC) 55) LBC was a very bitter and angry witness who had a strong tendency to exaggerate and over- dramatize events. On cross examination, she argued repeatedly with Respondents' counsel and had to be Pet.App.162 counseled by the ALJ to answer the questions asked of her instead of editoriali zing about the denial of service and how it affected her. Her testimony was inconsistent in several respects with more credible evidence. First, she testified that she had a \"major blowout\" and \"really bad fight\" with A. Cryer between January 17 and January 21, 2013. In contrast, A. Cryer testified, when asked if he fought with LBC, \"I wouldn't say we fought.\" He also testified that this case did not affect his relationship with LBC. Second, she testified that her blood pressure spiked in the hospital to 210/165 on February 1, 2013, when she learned that her DOJ complaint had hit the media, requiring the immediate attention of a doctor and four nurses. Her treating doctor's report notes that she was upset and crying about her situation hitting the news, but there is no mention of a blood pressure spike. Third, she testified that the media were standing outside her and RBC's apartment on February 1, 2013, when she talked to RBC from the hospital. RBC, who was at the apartment at that time, testified that the media were not outside their apartment at that time. Fourth, LBC testified that RBC stayed in bed the rest of the day after she returned from the cake tasting at Sweetcakes. In contrast, A. Cryer testified that he, LBC, and RBC had a 30-minute conversation that evening. Like RBC, the forum has only credited her testimony about media exposure when she testified about specific incidents.

OPINION Introduction In his ruling on Respondents' motion and the Agency's cross-motion for summary judgment, the ALJ concluded that Respondents did not violate ORS 659A.409. 17 This amended final order accepts that decision consistently with the Court of Appeals opinion in Klein I . Damages The Formal Charges seek damages for 17 See Finding of Fact #28 - Procedural, infra. In the AU's ruling on the motions for summar y judgment, he noted that the Agency did not allege that AK violated ORS 659A.409, but did not consider this paragraph. See footnote 26. Pet.App.165 emotional, mental and physical-suffering in the amount of \"at least $75,000\" for each Complainant. In addition to any emotiona l suffering experienced by Complainants as a direct result of Sweetcakes' refusal to bake them a cake (\"denial of service\"), the Agency also seeks damages for suffering caused to Complainants by media publicity and social media responses to this case. In Klein III , the Court of Appeals again affirmed that BOLI's finding of a violation of ORS 659A.403 was correct. However, the Court found that the noneconomic damages were based on what was said by AK and how that was relayed to complainants, which according to BOLI's own ALJ, differed from the statement and AK made to Cheryl. The Court of Appeals found that the \"specter of non-neutrality materializes into the affirmative conclusion that BOLI at least subtly depa rted from principles of neutrality when it awarded noneconomic damages based on Aaron's quotation of Leviticus.\" Klein III at 163. Therefore, BOLI's remaining responsibility in this Amended Final Order is to review and reassess the amount, if any, of non- economic damages to be awarded to Complainants. This is a public accommodations case. Complainants were denied full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges in violation of Oregon Law. Noneconomic damages, if assessed, eliminate the effects of that unlawful practice by compensating complainants' actual damages. The forum, on review of the record, evaluates Pet.App.166 whether an award of damage s is appropriate, and considers whether an amount is consistent with awards in instances of finding similar violations in similar circumstances. The forum expressly disavows the statements of the administrative prosecutor in the hearing that identify Respondents' religious beliefs with \"prejudice\". These statements do not reflect the position of the Commissioner in the application of Oregon law within this order. The forum further expressly disavows any award of damages in connection with Aaron Klein's quotation of Leviticus. Damages are awarded based on consideration of the harm resulting from the denial of service alone, as described below, and on the need of the forum to act consistently in similar circumstances. 1. EXTENT AND CAUSE OF COMPLAINANTS' EMOTIONAL SUFFERING A. R. Bowman-Cryer a. Emotional suffering from the denial of service Prior to the cake tasting, LBC had been asking RBC to marry her for nine years. Until October 2012, RBC did not want to be married because of her personal experience of fail ed marriages. At that time, RBC decided that they shou ld get married to give their foster children a sense of \"permanency and commitment.\" After her long-standing matrimonial Pet.App.167 reticence, RBC became exci ted to get married and to start planning the wedding,18 wanting a wedding that was as \"big and grand\" as they could afford. Obtaining a cake from Sweetcakes like the one purchased for CM's weddin g two years earlier was part of that grand scheme, and both Complainants were excited about the ca ke tasting at Sweetcakes because of how much they liked the cake Respondents had made for CM's wedding. The record shows two causes of RBC's emotional suffering: 1) the denial of services by AK and 2) CM's recitation of AK's comments following the denial of services. RBC's emotional suffering began at the January 17, 2013, cake tasting when AK told RBC and CM that Sweetcakes did not make wedding cakes for same-sex ceremonies. In response, RBC began to cry. She felt that she had humiliated her mother and was concerned that CM, who had believed that homosexuality was wrong until only a few years earlier, was ashamed of her. Walking out to the car and in the car, RBC became hysterical and kept apologizing to CM. When CM returned to the car after talking with AK, RBC was still \"bawling\" in the car. When CM told her that AK had called her \"an 18 The forum acknowledges th at Complainants1 \"wedding\" on June 27, 2013, was only a co mmitment ceremony, not a legal \"marriage.\" See, infra. Pet.App.168 abomination,\" this made RBC cry even more. RBC, who was brought up as a Southern Baptist, interpreted AK's use of the word \"abomination\" to mean that God made a mistake when he made her, that she wasn't supposed to exist, and that she had no right to love or be loved, have a family, or go to heaven. She continued to cry all the way home and after she arrived at home, where she immediately went upstairs to her bedroom and-lay in her bed, crying. On January 18, 2013, RBC felt depressed and questioned whether there was something inherently wrong with the sexual orientation she was born with and if she and LBC deserved to be married like a heterosexual couple. She spent most of that day in her room, trying to sleep. In the days following January 17, 2013, RBC had difficulty controlling her emotions and cried a lot, and Complainants argued with each other because of RBC's inability to control her emotions. They had not argued previously since moving to Oregon. In addition, RB C also became more introverted and distant in her family relationships. She and A. Cryer have always been very close, and their connection was not as close \"for a little bit\" after January 17, 2013. A week later, RBC still felt \"very sad and stressed,\" felt concerned about still having to plan her wedding, and felt less exuberant about the wedding. On January 21, 2013, she experienced anxiety during her cake tasting at Pastry Girl because of AK's January 17, 2013, refusal and her fear of subsequent refusals. After January 17, 2013, although RBC relied on CM to contact Pet.App.169 potential wedding vendors, RBC still experienced some anxiety over possible rejection because her wedding was a same-sex wedding. During this same period of time, A. Cryer credibly analogized RBC's demeanor as similar to that of a dog who had been abused. b. Emotional suffering from publicity about the case On February 1, 2013, RBC became aware that the media was aware of AK's refusal to make a wedding cake for Complainants when she received a telephone call from Lars Larson, an American conservative talk radio show host based in Portland, Oregon, who told her that he had spoken with AK and wanted to see what RBC \"had to say about the pending case.\" This upset RBC, and she became greatly concerned that E and A would be taken away from them by the foster care system because they had been told that the girls' information had to be protected and that the state would \"have to readdress placement\" of the girls with Complainants if any information was released concerning the girls. This concern continued until their adoption became final sometime after December 2013. From February 1, 2013, until the time of the hearing, many people have made \"hate-filled\" comments through social media and in the comments sections of various websites that were supportive of Respondents and critical of or threatening to Complainants. These comments and the media attention caused RBC stress, anger, pain, frustration, suffering, tort ure, shame, humiliation, Pet.App.170 degradation, fear that she would be harassed at home because the DOJ complaint with Complainants' home address had been posted on Facebook, and the feeling that her reputation was being destroyed. The publicity from the case and accompanying threats on social media from third parties made RBC \"scared\" for the lives of A, E, LBC, and herself. In addition, RBC was also upset by a confrontation with her sister who learned about the DOJ complaint through the media and posted a comment in support of Respondents on Respondents' Facebook. Without giving any specific examples, RBC credibly testified that, in a general sense, the denial of service has caused her continued emotional suffering up to the time of hearing. 19 19 The following is RBC's only testimony about her emotional suffering due to the denial of service after the case began to be publicized. It occurr ed during the Agency's redirect examination: Q: \"You testified earlier about th e media attention being sort of a secondary layer of stress, and I believe that that term you used during Mr. Smith's cross ex amination of you. During my examination of you, you testified at length as to the emotional harm that you suffered directly from the refusal of service alone. Do you still feel that harm from the refusal itself -- the January 17, 2013 refusal?\" \"***** A. \"Yes, I still experience that.\" Q. \"Was the primary harm, the harm that resulted from the refusal of service itself, persis tent throughout the times where you experienced media attention?\" \"***** A. \"Yes, the harm was still present during the media attention.\" Pet.App.171 B. L. Bowman-Cryer a. Emotional suffering from the denial of service LBC had been asking RBC to marry her for nine years before RBC finally ac cepted in October 2012. RBC's acceptance in Octob er 2012 of LBC's marriage proposal made LBC \"extremely happy.\" Both Complainants were excited about the cake tasting at Sweetcakes because of how much they liked the cake Respondents had made- for CM's earlier wedding. However, LBC, unlike RBC, did not go to the cake tasting. As with RBC, the record shows two causes of LBC's emotional suffering: 1) the denial of services by AK and 2) CM's recitation of AK's comments following the denial of services. When CM and RBC arrived home on January 17, 2013, after their cake tasting at Sweetcakes, CM told LBC that AK had told them that Sweetcakes did \"not do same-sex weddings\" and that AK had told CM that \"your children are an abomination.\" LBC was \"flabbergasted\" at AK's statement about same-sex weddings. This upset her and made her very angry. LBC, who was raised as a Roman Catholic, recognized AK's statement to CM as a reference from Leviticus. She was \"shocked\" to hear that AK had referred to her as an \"abomination.\" Based on her religious background, she understood the term \"abomination\" to mean \"this is a creature not created Pet.App.172 by God, not created with a soul. They are unworthy of holy love. They are not worthy of life.\" Her immediate thought was that this never would have happened, had she had not asked RBC to marry her. Because of that, she felt shame. Like RBC, she also worried about how it would affect CM's relatively recent acceptance of RBC's sexual orientation. LBC views herself as RBC's protector. After RBC climbed into bed, crying, LBC got into bed with RBC and tried to soothe he r. RBC became even more upset and pushed RBC away. In response, LBC lost her temper because she could not \"fix\" things. When LBC went back downstairs, E, the older of Complainants' foster daughters was extremely agitated from events at school that day. LBC tried to calm her, but she refused to be calmed, repeatedly calling out for RBC, with whom she had a special bond. Eventually, E cried herself to sleep. LBC's inability to calm E was very frustrating to her. That night, LBC was very upset, cried a lot, and was hurt and angry. Later that same evening, she filed her DOJ complaint. In the days immediately following January 17, 2013, LBC experienced anger, outrage, embarrassment, exhaustion, frustration, sorrow, and shame as a reaction to AK's denial of service. She felt sorrow because she couldn't console E, she could not protect RBC, and because RBC was no longer sure she wanted to be married . Her excitement about getting married was also lessened because she was Pet.App.173 not sure she could protect RBC if any similar incidents occurred. b. Emotional suffering from publicity about the case. On February 1, 2013, LBC went to the emergency room of a local hospital because of pain from a shoulder injury th at she had suffered three weeks earlier and her concern that she might have a broken shoulder. While in the hospital, she heard that AK's refusal to make their wedding cake was on the news. This made her very upset and she was crying when she was examined by a doctor. Based on the media, potential media exposure, and social media attention related to her DOJ complaint after February 1, 2013, LBC's headaches increased. She also felt intimidated and became fearful. After LBC's DOJ complaint was publicized in the media, LBC also had an \"devastating\" confrontation with her aunt who had learned about her DOJ complaint against Respondents through the media and threatened to shoot LBC in the face if she ever set foot on LBC's fa mily's property again. 20 After February 1, 2013, LBC, like RBC, was also greatly concerned that their foster children would be taken away from them be cause of media exposure. 20 LBC's intense and visceral display of emotions while testifying about her aunt's be havior made it clear that her aunt's behavior caused her extreme upset. Pet.App.174 LBC testified that she still feels emotional effects from the denial of service because E, A, and RBC \"were\" still suffering an d that \"was\" tearing me apart.21 2. EMOTIONAL SUFFERING DAMAGES BASED ON MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA ATTENTION. In its closing argument, the Agency asked the forum to award Complainants $75,000 each in emotional suffering damages stemming directly from the denial of Service. In addition, the Agency asked the forum to award damage s to Complainants for emotional suffering they experienced as a result of the media and social media attention generated by the case from January 29, 2013, the date AK posted LBC's DOJ complaint on hi s Facebook page, up to the date of hearing. The Agency's theory of liability is that since Respondents brought the case to the media's attention and kept it there by repeatedly appearing in public to make statements deriding Complainants, it was foreseeable that this attention would negatively impact Complainants, making Respondents liable for any resultant emotional suffering experienced by Complainants. The Agency also argues that Respondents are liable for negative third-party social media directed at Complainants because it was a foreseeable consequence of the media attention. 21 See footnote 7, supra. LBC testified in the past tense. Pet.App.175 The Commissioner concludes that complainants' emotional harm related to the denial of service continued throughout the period of media attention and that the facts related solely to emotional harm resulting from media attention do not adequately support an award of damages. No further analysis regarding the media attention as a causative factor is, therefore, necessary. 3. AMOUNT OF DAMAGES There is ample evidence in the record of specific, identifiable types of emotional suffering both Complainants experienced because of the denial of service. In determining an award for emotional and mental suffering, the forum considers the type of discriminatory conduct, an d the duration, frequency, and severity of the conduct. It also considers the type and duration of the ment al distress and the vulnerability of th e aggrieved persons. The actual amount depends on the facts presented by each aggrieved person. An aggrieved person's testimony, if believed, is sufficient to support a claim for mental suffering damages . In the Matter of C. C. Slaughters, Ltd., 26 BOLI 186, 196 (2005). In public accommodation cases, \"the duration of the discrimination does not determine either the degree or duration of the effects of discrimination .\" In the Matter of Westwind Group of Oregon, Inc. , 17 BOLI 46, 53 (1998). In this case, the ALJ proposed that $75,000 and $60,000, are appropriate awards to compensate Complainants RBC and LBC, respectively, for the emotional suffering they experienced from Pet.App.176 Respondents' denial of serv ice. The proposal for LBC is less because she was not present at the denial and the ALJ found her testimony about the extent and severity of her emotional suffering to be exaggerated in some respects. In this particular case, the demeanor of the witnesses was critical in determining both the sincerity and extent of the harm that was felt by RBC and LBC. The ALJ's previous damages award, which BOLI accepted, was based on th e emotional harms caused to RBC and LBC by 1) the denial of services itself and 2) CM's recitation of AK 's quotation of Leviticus. In light of the Court of Appeals opinion in Klein II, the forum reassesses the damages award based solely on the emotional harms caused by the denial of services itself and does not award any damages for the emotional suffering that resulted from CM's conversation with AK after the denial of services. Based on the facts found by the ALJ, the forum finds that $20,000 is an appropriate award to compensate Rachel Bowman-Cryer and $10,000 is an appropriate award to compensate Laurel Bowman-Cryer for the emotional suffering that they each experienced as a result of Respondents' unlawful denial of services. The forum further finds that this non-economic award is consistent with the forum's prior orders, specifically in public accommodations discrimination proceedings. 22 22 See In the Matter of Kara Johnson dba Duck Stop Market , 34 BOLI 2 (2014) (Complainant, an individual with multiple disabilities who has been prescribed a service dog and Pet.App.177 uses service dogs to mitigate her disabilities, was not allowed to shop in Respondent's convenie nce store in April 2013 while accompanied by her service do gs.

By this action, Respondent Penner also aided and abetted Blachana in its denial, thereby violating ORS 659A.406. Through the voice mails, Penner and Blachana issued a discriminatory \"notice\" or \"communication\" in violation of ORS 659A.409. The forum awarded a total of $400,000 in mental, emotional, and physical suffering damages to 11 members of the T-Girls who testified at hearing.

DA TED this _ 12_day of _JULY __ , 2022. Val Hoyle, Commissioner Labor and Industries Issued on: July 12, 2022 APPENDIX FINDINGS OF FACT - PROCEDURAL 1) On August 8, 2013, R. Bowman-Cryer (\"RBC\") filed a verified complaint with the Agency's Civil Rights Division (\"CRD\") alleging that Aaron Klein and Melissa Klein, dba Sweetcakes by Melissa, refused to make her a wedding cake based on her sexual orientation and published and displayed a communication to that effect, in violation of ORS 659A.403 and ORS 659A.409. RBC's complaint was subsequently amended to name both Kleins as aiders Pet.App.180 and abettors under ORS 659A.406. (Ex. A-27) 2) On November 7, 2013, L. Bowman-Cryer (\"LBC\") filed a verified complaint with the Agency's Civil Rights Division (\"CRD\") alleging that Aaron Klein (\"AK\") and Melissa Klein (\"MK\"), dba Sweetcakes by Melissa, refused to make her a wedding cake based on her sexual orientation and published and displayed a communication to that effect, in violation of ORS 659A.403 and ORS 659A.409. LBC's complaint was subsequently amended to name AK and MK as aiders and abettors under ORS 659A.406. (Ex. A-28) 3) On January 15, 2014, after investigating RBC's and LBC's complaints, the CRD issued a Notice of Substantial Evidence Determination in each case in which the CRD found substantial evidence of unlawful discrimination in public accommodation against Respondents in violation of ORS 659A.403, ORS 659A.406, and ORS 659A.409 (Ex. A29) 4) On June 4, 2014, the Agency issued two sets of Formal Charges, one alleging unlawful discrimination against RBC (case no. 44-14) and the other alleging unlawful di scrimination against LBC (case no. 45-14) that alleged the following: (a) At all times material, Sweetcakes by Melissa (\"Sweetcakes\") was an assumed business name of Respondent MK doing business in Gresham, Oregon, that offered goods and services to the public, including wedding cakes; (b) At all times material, AK was registered with Pet.App.181 the Oregon Sec. of State Business Registry as the authorized representative of MK, dba Sweetcakes by Melissa; (c) On January 17, 2013, RBC and her mother went to Sweetcakes for a cake tasting related to RBC's wedding ceremony to LBC; (d) AK conducted the tasting and asked for the names of a bride and groom . RBC said there would be two brides for her ceremony and gave her name and LBC's name. AK told RBC that Sweetcakes did not do \"same-sex couples\" because it \"goes against our religion\"; (e) Complainants were injured by Respondents' refusal to provide them with a wedding cake. (f) MK discriminated against Complainants based on their sexual orientation, in violation of ORS 659A.403(3) and ORS 659.409; (g) AK aided or abetted MK as the owner of Sweetcakes in MK's violation of ORS 659A.403(3) and ORS 659.409; thereby violating ORS 659A.406; (h) Complainants are each entitled to damages for emotional, mental, and physical suffering in the amount of \"at least $75,000\" and out-of-pocket expenses \"to be proven at hearing.\" (i) Respondents published or issued a communication, notice that its accommodation, advantages would be refused, withheld from or denied to, or that discri mination would be made Pet.App.182 against, a person on account of his or her sexual orientation, in violation of ORS 659A.409. On the same day, BOLI's Contested Case Coordinator issued Notices of Hearing in both cases stating the time and place of the hearing as August 5, 2014, beginning at 9:00 a.m., at BOLI's Portland, Oregon office. (Exs. X2, X4) 5) On June 6, 2014, Respondents filed a motion to postpone the hearing because Respondent's attorney Herbert Grey had \"pre-paid non-refundable vacation plans\" during the time scheduled for hearing. The forum granted Respondents' motion. (Ex. X5) 6) On June 18, 2014, Respondents, through attorneys Grey, Tyler Smith, and Anna Adams, filed an \"Election to Remove to Circuit Court (ORS 659A.870(4)(b))\" and \"Alternative Motion to Disqualify BOLI Commissioner Brad Avakian\" from deciding issues in these cases. Respondents requested oral argument on both issues. On June 25, 2014, the Agency filed objections to Respondents' motions. On June 26, 2014, the ALJ denied Respondents' request for oral argument. (Exs. XS, X11) 7) On June 19, 2014, the ALJ held a prehearing conference and rescheduled the hearing to start on October 6, 2014. The ALJ also consolidated the cases for hearing. (Ex. X7) 8) On June 24, 2014, Respondents timely filed an answer and response to both sets of Formal Charges. Respondent admitted that AK had declined RBC's Pet.App.183 request to design and provide a cake for Complainants' same-sex ceremony but denied that any unlawful discrimination occurred. Respondents raised numerous affirmative defenses, including: xThe Formal Charges fail to state ultimate facts sufficient to constitute a claim. xBecause the Oregon Constitution did not provide for or recognize same-sex unions in January 2013 and the state of Oregon did not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples at that time, BOLI lacks \"any legitimate authority to compel Respondents to engage in creative expression or otherwise participate in same-sex ceremonies not recognized by the state of Oregon contrary to their fundamental rights, consciences and convictions.\" xBOLI is estopped from compelling Respondents to engage in free expression or otherwise participate in same-sex ceremonies not recognized by the state of Oregon contrary to their fundamental rights, consciences and convictions. xThe statutes underlying the Formal Charges are unconstitutional as applied to Respondents to the extent they do not protect the fundamental rights of Respondents and persons similarly situated arising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as applied to the state of Oregon under the Fourteenth Amendment, in one or more of the following particulars, by unlawfully: (a) infringing on Respondents' right of conscience; (b) infringing Pet.App.184 on Respondents' right to free exercise of religion; (c) infringing on Respondents' right to free speech; (d) compelling Respondents to engage in expression of a message they do not want to express; (e)_denying Respondents' right to due process; and (f) denying Respondents the equal protection of the laws. xThe statutes underlying th e Formal Charges, as applied, violate Respondents fundamental rights arising under the Oregon Constitution in one or more of the following particulars, by unlawfully: (a) violating Respondents' freedom of worship and conscience under Articl e I, \u00a72; (b) violating Respondents' freedom of religious opinion under Article I, \u00a73; (c) violating Respondents' freedom of speech under Article I, \u00a78; (d) compelling Respondents to engage in expression of a message they did not want to express; (e) violating Respondents' privileges and immunities under Article I, \u00a720; and (f) violating Article XV, \u00a73. xThe statutes underlying the Formal Charges are facially unconstitutional in that they violate Respondents' fundamental rights arising under the Oregon Constitution to the extent there is no religious exemption to protect or acknowledge the fundamental rights of Respondents and persons similarly situated. Respondents also raised four Counterclaims, including: xRespondents are entitled to costs and attorney fees if they are determined to be the prevailing Pet.App.185 party. xThe State of Oregon, acting by and through BOLI, has knowingly and selectively acted under color of state law, to deprive Respondents of their fundamental constitutional and statutory rights in the basis of religion without taking similar action against county clerks and other state of Oregon officials similarly denying same-sex couples goods and services related to same-sex unions, disparately impacting Respondents, causing economic damages to Respondents in an amount not less than $100,000. BOLI has knowingly and selectively acted under color of state law to deprive Respondents of their fundamental constitutional and statutory rights in the basis of religion without taking similar action against county clerks and other state of Oregon officials similarly denying same-sex couples goods and services related to same-sex unions, disparately impacting Respondents and causing economic damages to Respondents in an amount not less than $100,000. xDuring the period from February 5, 2013 to the present, BOLI's Commissioner published, circulated, issued, displayed, or cause to be published, circulated, issued, displayed, communications on Faceb ook and in print media to the effect that its accommodations, advantages, facilities, services or privileges would be refused, withheld from or denied to, or that discrimination would be made against Respondents and other persons similarly situated on the basis of religion in violation of ORS 659A.409. Pet.App.186 xUnder 42 USC\u00a7 1983, BOLI is liable to Respondents for depriving Respondents of their rights and protections guaranteed by the United States Constitution \"under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage of any State.\" (Ex. X10) 9) On July 2, 2014, the ALJ issued an interim order ruling on Respondents' June 18, 2014, motions. That order is reprinted below in pertinent part. 23 \"Respondents' Putative Election to Circuit Court \"Respondents assert that they have a 'unqualified right to have these matters removed to the circuit court of either Clackamas, Marion or Multnomah Counties pursuant to ORS 659A.870(4)(b).' ORS 659A.870(4)(b) provides, in pertinent part: '(b) A respondent or complainant named in a complaint filed under ORS 659A.820 or 659A.825 alleging an unlawful practice under ORS 659A.145 or 659A.421 or discrimination under federal housing law may elect to have the matter heard in circuit court under ORS 659A.885. The election must be made in writing and received by the commissioner 23 Footnotes from this inte rim order and other interim orders quoted at length in the Proposed Findings of Fact - Procedural that are not critical to an understand ing of the order have been deleted. The deletions are indicated by a \"^\" symbol. Pet.App.187 within 20 days after service of formal charges under ORS 659A.845. If the respondent or the complainant makes the election, the co mmissioner shall pursue the matter in court on behalf of the complainant at no cost to the complainant.' \"To establish jurisdiction, the Agency's Formal Charges each allege: (1) bo th cases originated as verified complaints filed by Complainants Rachel Cryer and Laurel Bowman-Cryer; (2) both Complainants were authorized to file their complaints under the provisions of ORS 659A.820; and (3) that the Agency issued a Notice of Substantial Evidence Determination in both cases. Respondents deny that they engaged in discrimination based on sexual orientation or any other grounds set forth in ORS chapter 659A but do not dispute these jurisdictional allegations. Accordingly, the forum concludes that respondents were named in a complaint filed under ORS 659A.820. Under ORS 659A.870(4)(b), if the Formal Charges allege an unlawful practice under ORS 659A.145 or 659A.421 or discrimination under federal housing law, Resp ondents are entitled to elect to have the matter heard in circuit court under ORS 659A.885, subject to the. Requirement that such election must be made in writing within 20 days of service of the Formal Charges. \"ORS 659A.145 is titled 'Discrimination against individual with disability in real property transactions prohibited; advertising discriminatory preference prohibited; a llowance for reasonable modification; assisting discriminatory practices prohibited.' As indicated by its title, the provisions of Pet.App.188 ORS 659A.145 are exclusively limited to real property transactions involving people with disabilities. ORS 659A.421 is titled 'Discrimination in selling, renting, or leasing real property prohibited' and prohibits discrimination in real property transactions based on the race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, familial status or source of income of any person. \"In contrast, these cases allege violations of ORS 659A.403(3), ORS 659A.406, and ORS 659A.409. All three of these statutes appear in a section of ORS chapter 659A titled 'ACCESS TO PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS' that includes ORS 659A.400 to ORS 659A.415. Neither of the Formal Charges contains any allegations related to discrimination under federal housing law or discrimination based on real property transact ions. Rather, the Formal Charges both identify Re spondent Melissa Klein's business as a 'place of public accommodation' and allege that Respondent Melissa Klein's business, as_a public accommodation, discriminated against Complainants based on their sexual orientation. \"Since the Formal Charges do not allege an unlawful practice under ORS 659A.145 or 659A.421 or discrimination under feder al housing law, they are not subject to the provisions of ORS 659A.870(4)(b) and Respondents have no statutory right to elect to have the matter heard in circuit court. \"MOTION TO DISQUALIFY BOLI COMMISSIONER AVAKIAN BASED ON AVAKIAN'S ACTUAL BIAS Pet.App.189 \"Respondents ask that Commissioner Avakian be disqualified from deciding the issues presented in the Formal Charges becaus e he has 'publicly demonstrated actual bias against Respondents and others similarly situated, both as a candidate for re-election and as Commissioner .' Based on that alleged actual bias, Respondents contend that the Commissioner's fulfillment of his statutory role by deciding and issuing a Final Order in these cases will deprive Respondents of due process and other constitutional rights. Re spondents concede that BOLI administrative rules OAR 839-050-000 et seq contain no provision related to the disqualification of a BOLI Commissioner deciding and issuing a Final Order. However, both Respondents and the Agency acknowledge that procedural due process requires a decision maker free of actual bias and that Respondents have the burden of showing that bias. See Teledyne Wah Chang v. Energy Facility Siting Council , 298 Or 240, 262 (1985), citing Boughan v. Board of Engineering Examiners , 46 Or App 287, 611 P.2d 670, rev den 289 Or 588 (1980). \"To show the Commission er's actual bias and demonstrate that he has already pre-judged this case, Respondents submitted exhibits containing numerous copies of statements made by Commissioner Avakian to the media, in e-mails sent to Respondents' attorney Herb Grey, or on Facebook posts during the Commissioner's candidacy for reelection and as Commissioner. Summarized, those exhibits include the following statements: Pet.App.190 \"E-Mails sent to Respondents' attorney Herb Grey by 'Avakian for Labor Commissioner' x\"February 16, 2013, in which the Commissioner identified himself as 'Ore gon's chief civil rights enforcer,' and (i) noting his effort to convince the Veterans Affairs Department to grant a waiver to retired Air Force Lt. Col. Linda Campbell and her spouse, Nancy Campbell, making 40 them the 'first same-sex couple to receive equal military burial rights' and endorsing the 'Oregonians United for Marriage*** campaign to bring full marriage equality to Oregon.' x\"April 4, 2013, again noting the Commissioner's efforts on behalf of Linda Campbell, and quoting the comments made by Campbell on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court a week earlier during the debate on marriage equality. x\"December 10, 2013, in which Commissioner Avakian urged Grey to co-sign his letter to House Speaker Jon Boehner to bring the Employment Non- Discrimination Act up for a vote. x\"December 19, 2013, in which Commissioner Avakian notes his 'progressive' priorities and states '[t]hat's why I defend public education, take on unlawful discrimination, and stand up for equal rights for every last Oregonian.' x\"January 10, 2014, in which Commissioner Avakian stated '[a]t the Bureau of Labor and Industries, it's my job to protect rights of Oregonians in the workplace* * * and protect Pet.App.191 everyone's civil rights in housing and public accommodations.' x\"March 4, 2014, in which Commissioner Avakian stated: 'I believe in an Oregon where everyone has the opportunity to ge t married, raise a family and get ahead. Gay or straight, male or female, white, black, or brown -- everyone deserves an equal shot at making it in Oregon. That's why I will continue to fight for marriage equality, a woman's right to choose, better wages, and robust non-discrimination laws that protect gays and lesbians.' x\"March 12, 2014, in which Commissioner Avakian noted that no one filed to run against him as Labor Commissioner and stated, among other things: 'We built a coalition of civil rights champions, business lead ers, educators, working families and labor leaders, and many, many more. Just think- it wasn't very long ago that right-wing activists were calling for my head because of our strong support for civil rights and equality laws in Oregon.' x\"May 19, 2014, in which Commissioner Avakian stated: 'A few minutes ago, we received word that all Oregonians, including same-sex couples, will now have the freedom to marry the person- they love. As many had hoped, our federal court ruled Oregon's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional under the United States Constitution. This is an important moment in our state's history. The ruling also reflects what so many others have felt all along -- that Oregonians Pet.App.192 always eventually open th eir hearts to equality and freedom. The victory is a testament to the strength and energy of so many who dedicated themselves to making our laws match our highest ideals. Thank you. The win comes after news earlier this month that the Oregon Family Council has abandoned its campaign for a ballot measure to allow corporations to discriminate against loving same-sex couples. As a result, Oregon's law will continue to say that no corporation can deny service, housing or employment based on sexual orientation or gender identity. And as always, I will continue to hold those responsible that violate the rights of Oregonians and enthusiastically support those that go the extra mile for fairness. Here's to two significant victories that expand freedom for Oregonians - and the incredible efforts by friends and neighbors that made today possible. It's been a remarkable journey.' \"Independent Media \"August 14, 2013, Oregonian article written by Maxine Bernstein entitled 'Lesbian couple refused wedding cake files state discrimination complaint' that contains quotes by Complainant Cryer, Respondent Melissa Klein, and Commissioner Avakian. Commissioner Avakian was quoted as follows: 'We are committed to a fair and thorough investigation to determine whether there is substantial evidence of unlawful discrimination,' said Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian Pet.App.193 'Everybody's entitled to their own beliefs, but that doesn't mean that folks have the right to discriminate,' Avakian sa id, speaking generally.

Thank you -- and congratulations!' \"Summarized, these exhibits fall into two categories: (1) the Commissioner's e-mails and Facebook posts generally opposing discrimination against gays and lesbians and advocating the legality of same-sex marriage in Oregon and not addressed to these cases; and (2) remarks specific to the present cases. The vast majority of exhibits fall into the first category. Only two exhibits fall into the second category-- the Commissioner's February 5, 2013, Facebook post and the August 14, 2013, Oregonian article. \"ORS chapter 659A contains Oregon's anti- discrimination laws relate d to employment, public accommodations, and real pr operty transactions and delegates the enforcement of those laws to BOLI's Commissioner. The Legislature 's purpose in adopting the provisions of ORS chapter 659A is set out in ORS 659A.003. In pertinent part, ORS 659A.003 provides that: 'The purpose of this chapter is * * * to ensure the human dignity of all people within this state and protect their health, safety and morals from the consequences of intergroup hostility, tensions an d practices of unlawful discrimination of any kind based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, age, disability or familial status.' Pet.App.197 \"ORS 651.030(1) provides that '[t]he Bureau of Labor and Industries shall be under the control of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries * * *.' As suc h, BOLI's Commissioner has the duty to see that the stated purpose of ORS chapter 659A is carried out. In addition to enforcing the various statutes contained in that chapter through the administrative process created by the Legislature, 24 the Commissioner's duties include, among other things, initiating programs of 'public education calculated to eliminate attitudes upon which practices of unlawful discrimination because of * * * sexual orientation * * are based.' In short, the Commissioner has been instructed by the Legislature itself to raise public awareness about practices that the Legislature has declared to be unlawful discrimination in ORS chapter 659A The forum finds that all of the Commissioner's remarks contained in the first category - remarks generally opposing discrimination against gays and lesbians and advocating the legality of samesex marriage in Oregon - fall within the scope of this particular job duty. As more articulately_ stated by the Agency in its objections, '[n]one of this material is inconsistent with the exercise of the commissioner's statutory obligations as an elected official.' \"The forum next examines the two exhibits that fall within the second category that contain remarks specific to the present cases - the Commissioner's February 5, 2013, Facebook post and the August 14, 24 See footnote 21. Pet.App.198 2013, Oregonian article. The Commissioner's February 5, 2013, Facebook post contains the following content, consisting of a link to 'Ace of Cakes offers free wedding cake for Ore. gay couple www.kqw.com' and the following remark by the Commissioner that Respondents contend shows actual bias: 'Everyone has a right to their religious beliefs, but that doesn't mean they can disobey laws already in place. Having one set of rules for everybody assures that people are treated fairly as they go about their daily lives. The Oregon Department of Justice is looking into a complaint that a Gresham bakery refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex marriage. It started when a mother and daughter showed up at Sweet Cakes by Melissa looking for a wedding cake.' \"The Oregonian article, printed six days after the two Complainants filed their complaints with BOLI's CRD, contains two remarks attributed to the Commissioner that Respondents contend demonstrate his actual bias against Respondents. Those remarks are: x\"'Everyone is-entitled to their own beliefs, but that doesn't mean that folks have the right to discriminate,\" Avakian said , speaking generally.' x\"'The goal is never to shut down a business. The goal is to rehabilitate,\" Avakian said. \"For those who do violate the law, we want them to learn from that experience and have a good, successful Pet.App.199 business in Oregon.'\" \"In Samuel v. Board of Chiropractic Examiners , 77 Or App 53, 712 P2d 132 (1985), Samuel, a chiropractor, had his chiropractor's license suspended and his right to perform minor surgery permanently revoked by the Board of Chiropractic Examiners after he performed a vasectomy on a patient. The issue before the Board was whether Samuels had exceeded the scope of his license by performing 'major' surger y, whereas chiropractors are only allowed to perform 'minor' surgery. In their decision, the Oregon Court of Appeals, after determining that a vasectomy was 'major' surgery, considered whether the Bo ard's decision should be overturned based on the alleged bias of two members of the Board, Bolin and Camerer, who participated in the disciplinary hearing and resulting decision to suspend Samuels. Prior to Samuels's hearing, Bolin opined that a vasectomy was not minor surgery. The Court, citing Trade Comm'n v. Cement Institute , 333 U.S. 683 (1948), held that Bolin's expression of opinion, which the Court characterized as 'a preconceived point of view co ncerning an issue of law' -- was 'not an independent basis for disqualification' of Bolin. Camerer, in contrast, met with four chiropractors at a restaurant, brought the Board's file on Samuels, and allowed the other chiropractors to examine it. Prior to the Board's suspension decision, Samuels sought censure against Camerer and sued Camerer for disclosing the contents of the file. The Court held: 'As a defendant in the lawsuit which arose out of the very matter pending before the Pet.App.200 Board, Camerer may have harbored some animosity towards [Samuels]. The possibility of personal animosity and the appearance of a substantial basis for bias is sufficient that, under the circumstances, he should have disqualified himself.' \"To show that the Commissioner has prejudged the cases before the Forum, Respondents quote the Commissioner's two 'second category' statements as follows: to be \"rehabilitated. '\" However, this 'quote' combines selected portions of remarks made at two different times and misquotes the latter. Respondents seek to create an inference of bias that cannot reasonably be drawn from Respondents' exhibits as a whole. The Forum finds that the accurately quoted 'second category' remarks, while made in the context of Respondents' alleged di scriminatory actions and the Complainants' complaints , are remarks reflecting the Commissioner's attitude generally aboutenforcing Oregon's anti-discrimination laws and, at most, show 'a preconceived point of view concerning an issue of law' that, under Samuels, is not a basis for disqualification due to bias. \"RESPONDENTS' ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS \"In addition to their 'actual bias' argument, Respondents contend that the Commissioner should be disqualified for two other reasons: (1) The Commissioner's participation as a decision maker in these cases would violate the policy expressed in Pet.App.201 ORS 244.010 regarding ethical standards for public officials because of his conf lict of interest; and (2) His participation as a decision maker in these cases would violate Oregon Rules of Professional Conduct (ORPC) 3.6 related to lawyers making public statements about matters in litigation 25 and Oregon's Code of Judicial Ethics. \"Ethical Standards for Public Officials - ORS chapter 244 & Conflict of Interest \"Respondents contend that the Commissioner's actual bias and conflict of Interest demonstrate a partiality towards these cases that requires the Commissioner to disqualify himself from this case. As noted earlier, Respondents have not demonstrated actual bias on the Commissioner's part. Respondents assert that, under ORS chapter 244, 'the state of Oregon and its respective agencies, including BOLI, cannot ethically sit in judgment of Respondents for conduct of which it may be legally culpable,' and cite the following 'multiple conflicts of interest on the part of the Commissioner and BOLI as grounds for disqualification: '(1) [T]he Oregon Constitution and ORS 659A.003, et seq, not to mention the U.S. Constitution, require BOLI to respect and protect Respondents' constitutionally- protected religion, conscience and speech 25 Commissioner Avakian is an attorney and a member of the Oregon State Bar. Pet.App.202 rights to an even greater degree than it does complainants' statutory rights; and '(2) [T]he State of Oregon, including BOLI itself, has potential legal liability as a place of public accommodation under ORS 659A.400(1)(b) and (c) because, at the time of the original defense and the filing of complaints by complainants, the state of Oregon itself refused to recognize same sex marriage relationships, just as Respondents have chosen not to participate in complainants' same-sex ceremony.' 'Conflict of interest\"' is defined under ORS 244 in ORS 244.020: '(1) \"Actual conflict of interest\" means any action or any decision or recommendation by a person acting in a capacity as a public official, the effect of which would be to the private pecuniary benefit or detriment of the person or the person's relative or any business with which the person or a relative of the person is associated unless the pecuniary benefit or detriment arises out of circumstances described in subsection (12) of this section. * * * * * '(12) \"Potential conflict of interest\" means any action or any decision or recommendation by a person acting in a capacity as a public official, the effect of Pet.App.203 which could be to the private pecuniary benefit or detriment of the person or the person's relative, or a business with which the person or the person's relative is associated[.]' \"Respondents identify no conflict of interest by the Commissioner based on a pecuniary benefit or detriment that fits within these definitions. As noted by the Agency in its response, the Oregon Government Ethics Commission, not the Administrative Law Judge, is responsible for determining the Commission er's ethical obligations under ORS chapter 244. ORS 244.250 et seq . \"ORPC & Canons of Judicial Ethics \"The Administrative Law Judge does not have the authority to enforce the ORPC or Code of Judicial Ethics. However, I note that Respondents have not shown that any of Commissioner Avakian's remarks contained in Respondents' exhibits- 'will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing' this contested case proceeding. ORPC 3.6. The Code of Judicial Ethics does not apply to the Commissioner because he is not 'an officer of a judicial system performing judicial functions.' 26 26 See ORS 1.210- \"Judicial o fficer defined. A judicial officer is a person authorized to act as a judge in a court of justice.\" BOLI does not operate a \"court of justice,\" but is an administrative agency whose contested case proceedings are regulated by the Administrative Procedures Act, ORS 183.411 Pet.App.204 \"Conclusion \"Respondents' motion to disqualify Commissioner Avakian from deciding the issues presented in the Formal Charges and issuing a Final Order is DENIED .\" (Ex. X12) 9) On August 13, 2014, the ALJ issued an interim order that reset the hearing to begin on October 6, 2013, noting that the Agency and Respondents had both stated in an earlier prehearing conference it might take up to a week to complete the hearing. The same day, the ALJ issued an interim order requiring case summaries and setting a filing deadline of September 22, 2014. (Ex. X14) 10) On August 25, 2014, Respondents moved to postpone the hearing based on Respondents' prescheduled plans to be out of town on October 6, 2014. The Agency did not object and the ALJ reset the hearing to begin on October 7, 2014. (Ex. X17, X18) 11) On September 4, 2014, Respondents filed motions to depose Complainants and Cheryl McPherson and for a discovery order related to the Agency's objections to Respondents' informal discovery request for admissions, interrogatory responses, and documents. The Agency filed timely objections to both motion s. (Exs. X20 through X24) to ORS 183.470. Pet.App.205 12) On September 11, 2014, the Agency moved for a discovery order for the pr oduction of four types of documents. (Ex. X25) 13) On September 15, 2014, Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment \"on each or all of the claims asserted against them.\" (Ex. X26) 14) On September 16, 2014, the Agency moved for a Protective Order regarding Complainants' medical records both in formally requested by Respondents and in Respondents' motion for a discovery order. The Agency attached five pages of medical records related to LBC and asked that the forum conduct an in camera inspection \"to determine what, if any, of the information contained within these records is relevant or calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and must be turned over to Respondents.\" After conducting an in camera review, the AU made minor redactions unrelated to LBC's medical diagnosis and released the records to Respondents, accompanied by a Protective Order. (Exs. X27, X44) 15) The ALJ held a prehearing conference on September 18, 2014. After the conference, the AU issued an interim orde r summarizing his oral rulings, including his decision to postpone the hearing to give him time to rule on Respondents' motion for summary judgment before the hearing began. (Ex. X32) 16) On September 24, 2014, the Agency filed Amended Formal Charges in both cases. (Ex. X38) Pet.App.206 17) On September 25, 2014, the ALJ issued an interim order ruling on Respondents' motion for a discovery order for documents, interrogatory responses, and admissions. In pertinent part, the ruling read: \"As an initial matter, the Agency argues that Complainants are not subj ect to discovery rules under OAR 839-050-0020 because they are not 'parties' and therefore are not 'participants' under OAR 839-050-0200(1 ). In numerous prior cases with the forum*** a respondent has been allowed to request a discovery order to obtain documents and information from a complainant through the Agency that are discoverable under OAR 839-050-0020(7). See In the Matter of To/tee , 8 BOLI at 152 (noting that although the complainant was not a party, complainant still was 'a co mpellable witness' and the Agency was ordered to prod uce evidence over which it had power or authority). See also In the Matter of Columbia Components, Inc. , 32 BOLI 257, 259-61 (2013) (requiring complainant to verify that the interrogatory responses were true, and that complainant respond to a specific interrogatory request to which the Agency had objected); In the Matter of Dr. Andrew Engel , OMO, PC, 32 BOLI 94, 100 (2012) (requiring the Agency to produce any 47 documents responsive to re spondents' requests that appeared reasonably likely to produce information generally relevant to the case, including complainant's tax returns for relevant years). A. \"Interrogatories \"Respondents requested an order requiring the Pet.App.207 Agency to fully respond to four separate interrogatories. To the extent this order requires Complainants, through the Agency. to respond to the interrogatories, Complainants must sign them under oath as required by OAR 839-050- 0200(6). \"Interrogatory No. 7 \"Respondents requested that the Agency explain in detail the nature of the physical harm Complainants allege in the Formal Charges ('Charges'). The Agency responded that both Complainants experience d 'varying physical manifestations of stress' arid that '[a]ny further medical information will be provided pursuant to a protective order.' I agree that Respondents are entitled to know more sp ecifically what physical damages have been allegedly sustained. I order the Agency to have Complainants, through the Agency, respond to this interrogatory. \"Interrogatory No. 8 \"Respondents requested an explanation 'in detail [of] the nature of the mental harm Complainants alleged resulted from the events alleged in the Complaint.' The Agency objected on the grounds that the request was redundant and vague, as ii was unclear how the interrogatory differed from the interrogatory asking for information as to emotional harm allegedly suffered by Complainants. In its response to the motion, the Agency 'stipulates' that 'emotional, mental' suffer ing is any suffering not attributed to physical suffering, and that information was provided in response to Interrogatory No. 6. Pet.App.208 Based on the Agency's stipulation that 'emotional [and] mental' suffering are the same, the response to this Interrogatory appears to be sufficient and, therefore, I DENY Respondents' request for additional information in response to this interrogatory. '1nterrogatory No. 11 \"This interrogatory also relates to damages. With this interrogatory, Respondents requested an explanation as to the actions taken by Complainants to remove their public social media profiles after a complaint was filed with the Department of Justice on January 18, 2013. The Agency objected on the basis of relevancy. Respondents assert that this request is relevant becaus e '[m]uch, if not all of the damage Complainants have alleged to this point revolve around the media attention they received as a result of Complainant Laurel Bowman-Cryer's filing a Complaint with the Department of Justice.' Respondents further assert that Complainants have told Respondents they had to travel out of town because of attention and publicity. Respondents claim that the removal of social media profiles is relevant to the assessment of damages or mitigation of damages. In its response to the motion, the Agency reiterates its objection on the basis of relevance but does not directly address the arguments made in Respondents' motion as to damages allegedly caused by publicity and media attention. On September 22, 2014, the Agency timely filed a statement addressing this issue. In pertinent part, the Agency stated: \"Respondents caused substantial harm to Pet.App.209 Complainants, in part, through their intentional posting of the Department of Justice complaint on their social media website, which included Complainants' home address. This affected Complainants by exposing them to unwanted and, sometimes, unnerving contact from the public. * * * Complainants have had little to no contact with media, except through their attorney Mr. Paul Thompson. * * * The agency's position is that Complainants' damages were a direct result of Respondents intentionally posting the DOJ complaint on the Internet.\" Based on the information and representations before me, I am unable to determine at this time if Interrogatory No. 11 is 'r easonably likely to produce information that is generally relevant to the case.' Therefore, the Agency is not required to respond to this interrogatory. If Respondents establish the relevance of this interrogatory in their depositions of Complainants, Respondents may renew their motion for a discovery order regarding this interrogatory. \"Interrogatory No. 12 \"Respondents have requested an explanation 'in detail [of] any involvement or communication Complainants had with any group involved in boycotting Respondents' business.' The Agency objected on the basis of rele vance, over breadth, and because the requested information is outside the possession or control of the agency. As to relevancy, I view this request as similar to Interrogatory No. 11. Based on the information and representations before Pet.App.210 me, I am unable to determine at this time if Interrogatory No. 12 is re asonably likely to produce information that is generally relevant to the case. Therefore, the Agency is not required to respond to this interrogatory. If Respondents establish the relevance of this interrogatory in their depositions of Complainants, Respondents may renew their motion for a discovery order regarding this interrogatory. \"B. Production of Documents \"Request No. 2 \"Respondents requested a copy of records 'in the Agency's possession' as to the state policy in January of 2013 for issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples. The Agency objected on the basis of relevance and also states that such documents are not within the possession or control of the Agency. Respondents claim such documents are relevant to show whether the \"Agency is aware\" that same sex marriage was not recognized in Oregon at the time of the acts in question in this case. I deny Respondents' motion because (1) the Agency's awareness of the status of same sex marriage in Oregon is not likely to lead to relevant evidence; (2) the same sex marriage laws in Oregon are a matter of public record; and (3) the Agency has indicated it has no such documents in its possession. \"Request No. 7 \"This request seeks medical records for any medical visits relating to Complainants' request for emotional, mental or physical damages. Respondents' Pet.App.211 motion is GRANTED . * * * \"Request No. 9 \"Each of these requests for production seeks documentation and photographs of the actual wedding cake served at Complainants' wedding ceremony. The Agency objected to these requests on the basis of relevancy. The fact that a cake was purchased from another cake baker is likely relevant and, thus, I grant this motion only as to a receipt or invoice for showing the purchase of the cake and one photograph of the cake. Any other requested information is overly 49 broad. Furthermore, for the reasons set forth below regarding Request for Production No. 10, the Ag ency need not produce photographs of Complainants, their families, and the actual wedding ceremony. \"Request No. 10 \"In this request, Respondents have asked for photos, videos, or audio re cordings of Complainants' wedding ceremony. The Agency has objected on the grounds that the requested documents are irrelevant. The Agency further explains that Complainants are wary of turning over these materials to Respondents because Respondents previously posted Complainants' home address on a social media site. Unless the Agency is intending to offer photos, videos or audi o recordings as evidence at the hearing, then I agree with the Agency's objections and DENY the motion as to these documents. If the Agency intends to offer them as evidence at hearing, then the Agency must turn Pet.App.212 them over to Respondents. \"Request No. 11 \"Request No. 11 seeks communications made by Complainants to the media or on social media sites 'relating to Respondents and the events leading to the filing of Formal Charges against Respondents.' I find that this request is reasonably likely to produce information that is generally relevant to the case. * * * Respondents' request is GRANTED . \"Request No. 12 \"Request No. 12 seeks '[a]ny social media posts, blog posts, emails, text messages, or other record or communication showing Complainant's involvement with a boycott of Respondents or their business.' Based on the information and representations currently before me, I am unable to determine at this time if this request is reasonably likely to produce information that is generally relevant to the case. Therefore, Respondents' request is DENIED. If Respondents establish the relevance of this request in their depositions of Complainants, Respondents may renew thei r motion for a discovery order regarding this request. \"Request No. 16 \"Request No. 16 seeks the \"names and addresses of any person, media outlet, or other entity with whom Complainants or Ch eryl McPherson spoke regarding the events leading to this Complaint or the Pet.App.213 Complaint filed with the Department of Justice.\" I find that Respondents' request, with respect to Complainants, is reason ably likely to produce information that is generally relevant to the case, and is GRANTED . Respondents' request with regard to Cheryl McPherson is DENIED . \"Request No. 17 \"Request No. 17 seeks the production of '[a]ny receipt, invoice, contract, or other writing memorializing the purchase of the cake by Complainants from Respondent for Cheryl McPherson's wedding.' I find that Respondents' request is not reason ably likely to produce information that is generally relevant to the case. Respondents' request is DENIED. \"Request No. 18 \"Request No. 18 seeks the production of '[a]ny photos, videos, or other record of the cake Complainants purchased from Respondent for Cheryl McPherson's wedding.' I find that Respondents' request is not reason ably likely to produce information that is generally relevant to the case. Respondents' request is DENIED. \"Request No. 22 \"Request No. 22 seeks '[a]II posting by Complainants or Cheryl McPherson to any social media website, including bu t not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln, MySpace, lnstagram, and SnapChat from January 2013 to the present.' I find Pet.App.214 that this request, with re spect to Complainants, is reasonably likely to produce information that is generally relevant to the case. * * * However, Complainants are only requ ired to provide postings that contain comments about the facts of this case, comments about Respondents, or comments that relate to their alleged damages. Respondents' request with regard to Cheryl McPherson is DENIED. \"Request No. 23 \"Request No. 23 seeks '[a]ny recording or documents showing that Complainants ever removed any public social media profiles or caused to be hidden from public view.' Based on the information and representations currently before me, I am unable to determine at this time if this request is reasonably likely to produce information that is generally relevant to the case. Therefore, Respondents' request is DENIED. If Respondents establish the relevance of this request in their de positions of Complainants, Respondents may renew thei r motion for a discovery order regarding this request. B. \"Requests for Admissions \"Request No. 4 \"Respondents ask the Agency to admit that the State of Oregon did not reco gnize same sex marriage on or about January 17 and 18, 2013. The Agency objected on the basis of relevancy. For the reasons set forth above in regards to Request for Production No. 2, Respondents' request is DENIED. Pet.App.215 \"Requests Nos. 7 & 8 \"Respondents ask the Agency to admit that Complainants Laurel Bowman-Cryer and Rachel Cryer 'did not at any time on or after January 17, 2013, delete or remove her public Facebook profile.' The Agency objects on the basis of relevance. Based on the information and representations currently before me, I am unable to determine at this time if this request is reasonably likely to produce information that is generally relevant to the case. Therefore, Respondents' request is DENIED. If Respondents establish the relevance of this request in their depositions of Complainants, Respondents may renew their motion for a discovery order regarding this request. \"Request No. 9 \"Respondents ask the Agency to admit that Complainants were not is sued a marriage license between January 17, 2013, and May 18, 2014. The Agency objects for the same reasons it objected to Request for Production No. 2, which sought similar information. This request is DENIED for the same reasons set out in my denial to Request for Production No. 2. (Ex. X41) 18) On September 25, 2014, the ALJ issued an interim order ruling on Respondents' motion for a discovery order for depositio ns. In pertinent part, the ruling read: \"Complainants Laurel Bowman-Crver and Rachel Cryer Pet.App.216 \"I agree with the Agency that, given the availability of other discovery methods, the forum typically does not allow for depositions, as well as the fact that the Agency typically produc es an investigative file with detailed notes of interviews of witnesses. However, this case poses two unique circumstances. First, based on the information I have received to date from Respondents and the Agency, I have been unable to determine whether or not information and documents sought in response to Interrogatories Nos. 11 and 12 and Requests for Production Nos. 12 and 23 are reasonably likely to produce information that is generally relevant to the case. If so, it may result in the production of evidence that bears a significant relationship to Complainants' alleged damages. Respondents should be able to ascertain this in a deposition and, as stated in my interim order related to those Interrogatories and Requests for the Production, may renew their request for a discovery order if they can show that testimony given during the depositions shows those requests are reasonably likely to produce information is generally relevant to the case. I also note that there appears to be a unique damages claim for reimbursement of expenses for out- of-town trips to Seattle, Tacoma (two trips), and Lincoln City, with expenses for lodging, gas, and food at a number of establishments. As Respondents point out in their motion, they 'would use all of their 25 interrogatories Pet.App.217 just trying to determine exactly how one or two of these alleged expenses was at all related to Respondents' alleged unlawful conduct.' I am persuaded by Respondents that they have sought informal discovery on the issue of damages through other methods and do not have adequate information as to damages. \"In this unusual set of circumstances, I find that Respondents should be permitted to briefly depose Complainants, with the scope of the depositions limited to Complainants' claim for damages. Unless unexpected circumstances arise that require an ALJ's intervention, the depositions should take no longer than 90 minutes per Complainant. After the scheduled September 29, 2014, prehearing conference in this matter, the forum will issue a subsequent order stating a deadline for when the depositions should be completed. The Agency and Complainants' counsel are instructed to cooperate with Respondents so that the deposition can be conducted by that deadline. Respondents are responsible for any court reporter costs associated with the deposition, and Respondents and the Ag ency must each pay for their own copy of transcripts if transcripts are prepared. \"Cheryl McPherson \"Respondents argue that they are entitled to depose Cheryl McPherson, a material witness in this Pet.App.218 case, because they: \"strongly dispute some of the factual claims made by the complainants, Respondents need to know whether Cheryl McPherson will validate complainant's (sic) testimony under oath before the hearing. * * * In this case, multiple parties to the same conversations recall substantially different events, and subtle differences in retelling will substantially affect a credibility determination that Administrative Law Judge must make. Without being able to compare such testimony prior to hearing, the Respondents are substant ially prejudiced.\" \"I do not find that Respondents have demonstrated the need to depose witness Cheryl McPherson. I note that Respondents are typically provided with notes from investigative interviews of witnesses. Neither the Agency nor Respondents have provided information as to whether that occurred_ in this case. However, unless Respondents did not receive the usual investigative notes of the Agency's interview with Cheryl McPherson or no such notes exist because McPherson was never interviewed,_ I deny Respondents' request to take her deposition.\" (Ex. X42) 19) On September 25, 20\"14, the ALJ issued a discovery order requiring Respondents to produce documents in three of the four categories sought by the Agency in its September 11, 2014, motion. (Ex. X43) Pet.App.219 20) On September 29, 2014, the ALJ held a prehearing conference. During the conference, mutually acceptable new hearing dates, discovery status and a possible alternative to depositions, and filing deadlines were discussed and the ALJ made several rulings, summarized in a September 30, 2014 interim order that stated: \"(1) Subject to th e availability of Respondents and Complainants, the hearing is reset to begin at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, March 10; 2015, at the Tualatin Office of Administrative hearings. If the hearing is not concluded by late afternoon on Friday, March 13, the hearing wi ll reconvene at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, March 17, 2015, at the same location. The Agency and Respondents' counsel will let me know this week of the availability of Respondents and Complainants on those dates. \"(2) Respondents have until October 2, 2014, to file answers to the Amended Formal Charges. \"(3) The Discovery ordered in my rulings on the Agency's and Respondents' motions for Discovery Orders must be mailed or hand- delivered no later than October 14, 2014. This does not include Complainants' depositions. \"(4) My order requiring Complainants to submit to depositions by Respondents is 'on hold' for the present. Pet.App.220 \"(5) As a potential means for avoiding the necessity of depositions, Respondents proposed that they be allowed to serve 30 additional interrogatories to the Agency for Complainants' responses. The Agency objected to 30 but agreed to 25. I agreed and ruled that Respondents could serve 25 additional interrogatories to the Agency for Complainants' response, with the responses due 14 days after the date of service. At the Agency's request, I also ruled that, should they elect to do so, the Agency may also serve up to 25 interrogatories to Respondents' counsel for Respondents' response, noting that 53 the Agency is also entitled to do that under the rules since they have issued no prior interrogatories. \"(6) Case Summaries must be filed no later than February 24, 2015. \"(7) We also discussed the most efficient means of procedure regarding Respondents' motion for summary judgment and the Agency's pending response, considering the fact that the Agency has filed Amended Formal Charges since Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment. Respondents' counsel stated their intention in filing the motion was to resolve both cases in their entirety, if possible. After discussion, I ruled that the Agency did not need to respond to Respondents' pending motion for summary judgment and I will not rule on that motion. Rather, Respondents will file another motion Pet.App.221 for summary judgment that will incorporate the matters raised in the Amended Formal Charges so that all outs tanding issues can be addressed in my ruli ng on Respondents' motion. It was mutually agreed that Respondents could have until October 24, 2014, to file an amended motion for summary judgment and that the Agency would have until November 21, 2014, to file its written response. Accordingly, I order that Respondents must file their amended motion for summary judgment no later than October 24, 2014, and the Agency must file its response no later than November 21, 2014. Respondents' counsel asked if oral argument would be allowed on the motion and I ruled that it would not. \"(8) The Agency stipulated that it is not seeking reimbursement for the out-of-pocket expenses listed in response to Respondents' Interrogatory #16. In response to my question, the Agency stated that it is not willing to stipulate th at those trips are not relevant to the issue of damages.\" (Ex. X50) 21) On October 2, 2014, Respondents filed Answers to the Agency's Amended Formal Charges. (Ex. X51) 22) On October 24, 2014, Respondents re-filed their motions for summary judgment. (Ex. X53) Pet.App.222 23) On November 21, 2014, the Agency filed a response to Respondents' motion for summary judgment and a cross-motion for partial summary judgment \"on the same issues moved upon by Respondents.\" (Ex. X54) 24) On December 8, 2014, the Agency filed a second motion for a discovery order. On December 15, 2014, Respondents filed a response stating that they had \"now provided the Agency with all responsive documents * * * not subject to the attorney-client privilege.\" On December 18, 2014, the Agency withdrew its motion for a discovery order, stating that Respondents had satisfied the Agency's request for production. (Ex. X57) 25) On December 19, 2014, Respondents filed a response to the Agency's crossmotion for summary judgment. (Ex. X61) 26) On January 15, 2015, the Agency moved for a Protective Order regard ing \"additional medical documentation from Complainants that is subject to discovery.\" The Agency a ttached 13 pages of medical records, dated September 30, 2014, through January 20, 2015, related to LBC and asked that the forum conduct an in camera inspection \"to determine what, if any, of the information contained within these records is relevant or calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and must be turned over to Respondents.\" Before ruling, the ALJ instructed the Agency to tell the forum whether the Agency contended \"that Bowman-Cryer continued to experience \"emotional, mental, and physical suffering\" caused by Respondents' alleged unlawful Pet.App.223 actions during the period of time covered by these records. (Ex. X64) 27) On January 15, 2014, Respondents renewed their motion to depose Complainants, based on part on Complainant's alleged inadequate responses to Respondents second set of interrogatories. On January 22, 2014, the Agency objected to Respondents' motion. On January 29, 2014, the ALJ issued an interim order instructing Respondents to provide a copy of the interrogatories and the Agency's responses before the ALJ ruled on Respondents' motion. (Exs. X62, X63, X66) 28) On January 29, 2015, the ALJ issued an interim order ruling on Re spondents' refiled motion for summary judgment and the Agency's cross-motion for summary judgment. The interim order is reprinted verbatim below, pursuant to OAR 839-050- 0150(4)(b): \"Introduction \"Respondents operate a bakery under the name of Sweetcakes by Melissa.\" 27 These cases arise from Respondents' refusal to pr ovide a wedding cake for Complainants -Rachel Crye r ('Cryer') and Laurel 27 At the time of the alleged discrimination, Sweetcakes by Melissa was an inactive assumed business name. On February 1, 2013, Sweetcakes by Melissa was re-registered as an assumed business name with the Oregon Secretary of State Business Registry, with M. Klein listed as the registrant and A. Klein listed as the authorized representative. Pet.App.224 Bowman-Cryer ('Bowman-Cryer') after Respondents Aaron Klein ('A. Klein') and Melissa Klein ('M. Klein') learned that the wedding would be a same-sex wedding. \"As an initial matter, the forum notes Respondents' request for oral argument with regard to their motion. Respondents' request for oral argument is DENIED. \"Procedural History \"On June 4, 2014, the Civil Rights Division of the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries ('Agency') issued two sets of Formal Charges alleging that M. Klein violated ORS 659A.403(3) by refusing to provide Complainants a wedding cake for their same-sex wedding based on their sexual orientation and that A. Klein aided and abetted M. Klein, thereby violating ORS 659A.406. The Charges further alleged that M. Klein and A. Klein, who was acting on behalf of M. Klein, 'published, circulated, issued or displayed or caused to be published, circulated, issued or di splayed, a communication, notice, advertisement or sign to the effect that its accommodations, advantages, facilities, services or privileges would be refused, withheld from or denied to, or that discrimination would be made against, a person on account of his or her sexual orientation,' causing M. Klein to violate ORS 659A.409 and A. Klein to violate ORS 659A.406 by aiding and abetting M. Klein in her violation of ORS 659A409. The Agency sought $75,000 in damages for 'emotional, mental, and physical suffering' for each Complainant, plus 'out of pocket expenses to be Pet.App.225 proven at hearing. 'On June 19, 2014, the ALJ consolidated the two cases for hearing. \"Respondents, through joint counsel Herbert Grey, Tyler Smith, and Anna Adams (now Anna Harmon), timely filed Answer s to both sets of Formal Charges, raising numerous affirmative defenses and four counterclaims. \"On September 15, 2014, Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to both sets of Charges, based primarily on legal argument supporting the constitutional affirmative defenses raised in their Answers. On September 16, 2014, the Agency moved for an extension of time to respond to Respondents' motion until September 26, 2014. On September 17, 2014, the ALJ granted the Agency's motion. On September 17, 2014, the ALJ held a prehearing conference in which it became apparent that he had ruled on the Agency's motion before Respondents had seen the motion. Accordingly, the ALJ gave Respondents an opportunity to file objections. On September 18, 2014, Respondents filed objections to Agency's motion for extension. On September 22, 2014, the ALJ issued an interim order that sustained his September 17, 2014, order. \"On September 24, 2014, the Agency amended both sets of Charge s to allege that M. Klein and A. Klein both violated ORS 659A.403(3) and that A. Klein, 'in the alternative,' aided and abetted M. Klein in her violation of ORS 659A.403(3), thereby violating ORS 659A.406. Additionally, the Agency Pet.App.226 alleged that, 'in the alternative,' A. Klein aided and abetted M. Klein's violation of ORS 659A.409.28 \"On September 29, 2014, the ALJ held a prehearing conference. During the conference, the participants discussed the most efficient means of proceeding regarding Respondents' motion for summary judgment and the Agency's pending response, considering the fact that the Agency had filed Amended Formal Ch arges ('Charges') since Respondents filed their motion for summary judgment. After discussion, it was agreed that, instead of the Agency filing a response to Respondents' original motion, it would be more efficient for Respondents to file an amended motion for summary judgment that would incorporate the matters raised in the Charge s so that all outstanding issues could be addressed in the ALJ's ruling on Respondents' motion. It was mutually agreed that Respondents could have until October 24, 2014, to file an amended motion for summary judgment and that the Agency would have until November 21, 2014, to file its response. \"On October 2, 2014, Respondents filed Amended Answers ('Answers' ) to the Charges. On October 24, 2014, Respondents timely filed an amended motion for summary judgment. On November 21, 2014, the Agency timely filed a response and cross motion asking that Respondents' 28 The Agency's amended Charges did not allege that A Klein violated ORS 659A.409. Pet.App.227 motion be denied in its entirety and that the Agency be granted partial summary judgment as to the issues on which Respondents sought summary judgment. On November 25, 2014, the forum granted Respondents' unopposed motion for an extension of time until December 19, 2014, to respond to the Agency's cross motion. Respondents filed a response on December 19, 2014. \"Summary Judgment Standard \"A motion for summary judgment may be granted where no genuine issue as to any material fact exists and a participant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, as to all or any part of the proceedings. OAR 839-050-0150(4)(8). The standard for determining if a genuine issue of material fact exists and the evidentiary burden on the participants is as follows: '* * * No genuine issue as to a material fact exists if, based upon the record before the court viewed in a manner most favorable to the adverse party, no objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict for the adverse party on the matter that is the subject of the motion for summary judgment. The adverse party has the burden of producing evidence on any issue raised in the motion as to which the adverse party would have the burden of persuasion at [hearing].' ORCP 47C. The 'record' consid ered by the forum of: (1) the amended Formal Charges and Respondents' Pet.App.228 amended Answers to those Charges; (2) Respondents' motion, with attached ex hibits; (3) the Agency's response and cross-motion to Respondents' motion, with an attached exhibit; and (4) Respondents' response to the Agency's motion. \"Analysis A. Facts of the Case \"The undisputed material facts of this case relevant to show whether Respondents violated ORS chapter 659A as alleged in the Charges are set out below. Findings of Fact 1) \"Complainants Cryer and Bowman-Cryer are both female persons. 29 (Formal Charges) 2) \"In January 2013, Sweetcakes by Melissa ('Sweetcakes') was a business owned and operated as an unregistered assumed business name by Respondents M. Klein and A. Klein. At all material times, Sweetcakes was a plac e or service that offered custom designed wedding cakes for sale to the public. (Respondents' Admission; Affidavits of A. Klein, M. Klein) 29 The Charges do not identify either Complainant as a female, but the forum infers from their names and the Agency's reference to each Complainant as \"her\" that Complainants are both female Pet.App.229 3) \"Before and throughout the operation of Sweetcakes, Respondents M. Klein and A. Klein have been jointly committed to live their lives and operate their business according to their Christian religious convictions. Based on specific passages from the Bible, they have a sincerely held belief that that God 'uniquely and purposefully designed the institution of marriage exclusively as the union of one man and one woman' and that 'the Bible forbids us from proclaiming messages or participating in activities contrary to Biblical principles, including celebrations or ceremonies for uniting same-sex couples.' (Affidavits of A. Klein, M. Klein) 4) \"In the operation of Sweetcakes, A. Klein bakes the cakes, cuts the layers, adds filling, and applies a base layer of frosting. M. Klein then does the design and decorating. A. Klein delivers the cake to the wedding or reception site in a vehicle that has 'Sweet Cakes by Melissa' written in large pink letters on the side and assembles the cake as necessary. A. Klein also sets up the cake and finalizes any remaining decorations after final assembly and placement. In that capacity, he often interacts with the couple or other family members an d often places cards showing that Sweetcakes created the cake. (Affidavits of A. Klein, M. Klein) 5) \"In or around November 2010, Respondents designed, created, and decorated a wedding cake for Cryer's mother, Cheryl McPherson, for which Cryer paid. (Affidavit of M. Klein) 6) \"On January 17, 2013, Cryer and McPherson visited Sweetcakes for a previously scheduled cake Pet.App.230 tasting appointment, intending to order a cake for Cryer's wedding ceremony to Bowman-Cryer. (Respondents' Admission; Affidavit of A. Klein) 7) \"A. Klein conducted the cake tasting at Sweetcakes' bakery shop located in Gresham, Oregon. M. Klein was not pr esent during the tasting. During the tasting, A. Klein asked for the names of the bride and groom, and Cryer told him there would be two brides and their names were 'Rachel and Laurel.' (Respondents' Admission; Affidavit of A. Klein) 8) \"A. Klein told Cryer that Sweetcakes did not make wedding cakes for same-sex ceremonies because of A. and M. Klein's religious convictions. In response, Cryer and McPherson walked out of Sweetcakes. (Respondents' Admission; Affidavit of A. Klein) 9) \"Before driving off, McPherson re-entered Sweetcakes by herself to talk to A. Klein. During their subsequent conversation, McPherson told A. Klein that she used to think like him, but her 'truth had changed' as a result of having 'two gay children.' A. Klein quoted Leviticus 18:22 to McPherson, saying 'You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; ii is an abomination.' McPherson then left Sweetcakes. (Affidavit of A. Klein) 10) \"On February 1, 2013, Sweetcakes by Melissa was registered as an assumed business name with the Oregon Secretary of State, with the 'Registrant/Owner' listed as Melissa Elaine Klein and the 'Authorized Representative' listed as Aaron Pet.App.231 Wayne Klein. (Exhibit A 1, p. 2, Agency Response to Motion for Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment) 11 )\"On August 8, 2013, both Complainants filed verified written complaints with BOLI's Civil Rights Division ('CRD') alleging unlawful discrimination by Respondents on the basis of sexual orientation. After investigation, the CRD issued a Notice of Substantial Evidence Determination on January 15, 2014, in both cases, and sent co pies to Respondents. (Respondents' Admission) 12) \"At some time prior to September 2, 2013, A. Klein and M. Klein took part in a video interview with Christian Broadcast Network (CBN) in which A. Klein explained the reasons for declining to provide a wedding cake for Complainants. On September 2, 2013, CBN broadcast a one minute, five seconds long presentation about Complainants' complaints. The broadcast begins and ends with a CBN announcer describing the complaints filed by Cryer and Bowman-Cryer against Respondents while pictures of the bakery are broadcast. A. and M. Klein appear midway in the broadcast, standing together outdoors, and make the following statements: 30 31 30 There is nothing in the video to show whether these statements were made in response to a question or if it was part of a longer interview. 31 23 This transcript was made by the ALJ from a DVD provided to the forum by Respondents. The DVD includes the September 2, 2013, CBN video, and an mp4 recording of a Pet.App.232 A. Klein: 'I didn't want to be a part of her marriage, which I think is wrong.' M. Klein: 'I am who I am and I want to live my life the way I want to live my life and, you know, I choose to serve God.' 32 A. Klein: 'It's one of those things where you never want to see something you've put so much work into go belly up, but on the other hand, um, I have faith in the Lord and he's taken care of us up to this point and I'm sure he will in the future.' (Exhibit 1-1, Respondents' Motion for Summary Judgment) 13) \"In September 2013, M. and A. Klein closed their bakery shop in Gresham and moved their business to their home, where they co ntinued to offer custom designed wedding cakes for sale to the public. (Affidavits of A. Klein, M. Klein) 14) \"On February 13, 2014, A. Klein was interviewed live on a radio show by Tony Perkins called 'Washington Watch.' Perkins's show lasted approximately 15 minutes. In pertinent part, the February 13, 2014, interview with Tony Perkins. 32 M. Klein's statement is only included to provide context, as the Agency did not allege that her statement was a violation of Oregon law. Pet.App.233 interview included the following exchange that occurred, starting at four minutes, 30 seconds into the interview and ending at six minutes, twenty-two seconds into the interview:33 Perkins: '***Tell us how this unfolded and your reaction to that.' Klein: 'Well, as far as how it unfolded, it was just, you know, business as usual. We had a bride come in. She wanted to try some wedding cake. Return customer. Came in, sat down. I simply asked the bride and groom's first name and date of the wedding. She kind of giggled and informed me it was two brides. At that point, I apologized. I said \"I'm very sorry, I feel like you may have wasted your time. You know we don't do same-sex marriage, same-sex wedding cakes.'' And she got upset, noticeably, and I understand that. Got up, walked out, and you know, that was, I figured the end of it.' Perkins: 'Aaron, let me stop you for a moment. Had you and your wife, had you talked about this before; is this something that you had discussed? Did you think, you know, this might occur and had you thought through how you might respond or did this kind of catch you off guard?' 33 See footnote 29. Pet.App.234 Klein: 'You know, it was something I had a feeling was going to become an issue and I discussed it with my wife when the state of Washington, which is right across the river from us, legalized same-sex marriage and we watched Masterpiece Bakery going through the same issue that we ended up going through. But, you know, it was one of those situations where we said \"well I can see it is going to become an issue but we have to stand firm. It's our belief and we have a right to it, you know.\" I could totally understand the backlash from the gay and lesbian community. I could se e that; what I don't understand is the government sponsorship of religious persecution. That is something that just kind of boggles my mind as to how a government that is under the jurisdiction of the Constitution can decide, you know, that these people's rights ov ertake these people's rights or even opinion, that this person's opinion is more valid than this person's; it kind of blows my mind.' (Exhibit 1-1, Respondents' Motion for Summary Judgment) \"B. Analysis of Complainants' Claims on the Merits \"The forum first analyzes whether Respondents' actions violated the app licable public accommodation statutes. If so, the forum moves on to a determination of whether Respondents have established one or more of their affirmative defenses Pet.App.235 that rely on the Oregon and U. S. Constitution.

Bureau of Labor and Industries, 322 Or 132, 138-39 (1995) (before considering constituti onal issues, court must first consider pertinent subconstitutional issues). \"In its Charges, the Agency alleged that Respondents operated Sweetcakes, a place of public accommodation under ORS 659A.400, and violated ORS 659A.403, 659A.406, and 659A.409 by refusing to provide Complainants a wedding cake based on their sexual orientation, by aiding and abetting that refusal, and by communicating their intent to discriminate based on sexual orientation. \"Although Respondents' affirmative defenses apply to the forum's ultima te disposition of each alleged statutory violation, the forum is able to draw several legal conclusions from the undisputed material facts relevant to the Agency's allegations that are unaffected by those affirmative defenses. \"First, at all times material, A. Klein and M. Klein owned and operated Sweetcakes as a partnership. ORS 67.055 provides, in pertinent part: '(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, the association of two or more persons to carry on as co- owners a business for profit creates a partnership, whether or not the persons Pet.App.236 intend to create a partnership. '* * * * * '(d) It is a rebuttable presumption that a person who receives a share of the profits of a business is a partner in the business***.' In affidavits dated October 23, 2014, signed by M. Klein and A. Klein and submitted in support of Respondent's motion for summary judgment, they both aver: 'Together we have operated Sweetcakes by Melissa as a business since we opened in 2007. * * * Until recent months, we both worked actively in the business, primarily derived our family income from the operation of the busine ss, and jointly shared the profits of the business.' The Agency does not dispute the factual accuracy of these statements. Accordingly, the forum concludes that M. Klein and A. Klein were joint owners of Sweetcakes and operated it as a partnership and unregistered assumed business name in January 2013, and as a registered assumed business name since February 1, 2013. As such, they are jointly and severally liable for any violations of ORS chapter 659A related to Sweetcakes. \"Second, ORS 659A.403, 659A.406, and 659A.409 all require that discrimination must be made by a 'person' acting on behalf of a 'place of public accommodation.' 'Perso n' includes '[o]ne or more individuals.' ORS 659A.001 (9)(a). The undisputed facts establish th at A. Klein and M. Klein are 'individual[s]' and 'person[s].' A 'place of public accommodation' is defined in ORS 659A.400 as '{a) Pet.App.237 Any place or service off ering to the public accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges whether in the nature of goods, services, lodgings, amusements, transportation or otherwise.' The undisputed facts show that, at all material times, Sweetcakes was a place or 4 service offering goods and services - wedding cakes and the design of those cakes - to the public. Accordingly, the forum concludes that Sweetcakes, at all material times, was a 'place of public accommodation.' \"Third, as germane to this case, ORS 659A.403 and 659A.406 prohibit any 'distinction, discrimination or restriction' based on Complainants' 'sexual orientation.' This requires the forum to determine Complainants' actu al or perceived sexual orientation. As used in ORS chapter 659A, 'sexual orientation' is defined as 'an individual's heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuaiity, or gender iden tity, regardless of whether the individual's gender identity, appearance, expression or behavior diff ers from that traditionally associated with the individual's assigned sex at birth.' OAR 839-005-0003(16). The forum infers 34 that Complainants' sexual orientation is homosexual and that (a).Klein perceived they were homosexual from four undisputed facts: (a) Complainants were planning to have a same-s ex marriage; (b) A. Klein 34 Evidence includes inferences. There may be more than one inference to be drawn from the basic fact found; it is the forum's task to decide which inference to draw. See, e.g., In the Matter of Income Property Management , 31 BOU 18, 39 (2010). Pet.App.238 told Cryer and McPherson that Respondents do not make wedding cakes for same-sex ceremonies; (c) McPherson told A. Klein that she had 'two gay children'; and (d) In re sponse to McPherson's statement, A. Klein quoted a reference from Leviticus related to male homosexual behavior. \"Fourth, A. Klein's verbal statements made in the CBN and Tony Perkins interviews that were publicly broadcast constitute a 'communication' that was 'published' under ORS 659A.409. C. Failure to State Ulti mate Facts Sufficient to Constitute a Claim \"Before determining the merits of the Agency's ORS 659A.403(3) allegations, the forum first evaluates Respondents' plea ding - 'fail[ure] to state ultimate facts sufficient to constitute a claim' -- that Respondents categorize as their first 'affirmative defense.' As a procedural matter, the forum views this defense as a straig htforward denial of the allegations in the pleadings rather than as an affirmative defense. 35 35 In general, an affirmative defense is a defense. setting up new matter that provides a defense against the Agency's case, assuming all the facts in the complaint to be true. See, e.g., Pacificorp v. Union Pacific Railroad , 118 Or App 712,717,848 P2d 1249 (1993). A few examples of affirmative defenses previously recognized by this forum include statute of limitations, claim and issue preclusion, bona fide occupational requirement, undue hardship, laches, and unclean hands. Some other affirmative defenses recognized by Oregon courts include Pet.App.239 As argued by Respondents in their motion for summary judgment, this defen se goes to two issues. First, whether Bowman-Cryer's absence when A. Klein made his alleged disc riminatory statement on January 13, 2013, deprives her of a cause of action under ORS 659A.403 and 659A.406. Second, whether Respondents' refusal to provide a wedding cake for Complainants was on account of their sexual orientation. \"Bowman-Cryer's absence on January 13, 2013 does not deprive her of standing \"It is undisputed is the fact that Complainants sought a wedding cake from Sweetcakes based on Cryer's previous experience in purchasing a wedding cake from Sweetcakes for McPherson's wedding. It is also undisputed that Bowman-Cryer was not present at Sweetcakes on January 13, 2013, when A. Klein told Cryer and McPherson that Sweetcakes would not make a wedding cake for a same-sex wedding. \"Respondents argue as follows: 'Additionally, if as it appears on the face of the pleadings, one or more of the complainants were not actually potential customers requesting a wedding cake issue, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, fraud, payment, release, statute of frauds, unconstitution ality, and waiver. ORCP 198. In contrast, a defense that admits or denies facts constituting elements of the Agency's prima facie case that are alleged in the Agency's charging document is not an affirmative defense. Pet.App.240 and they were also not the ones denied services, and their claims must fail as a matter of law. In particular, the record is Laurel Bowman-Cryer was not present for the cake tasting and was never denied services. Therefore, either Rachel Cryer or.Cheryl McPherson was the only person who was denied services according to Complainants['] own record. Claims made by anyone else must fail.' The forum rejects this argument, as it relies on the false premise that a person cannot be discriminated against unless they are physically present to witness an alleged act of discrimination perpetrated against them. In this case, the 'full and equal accommodation' sought by both Complainants was a wedding cake to celebrate their same-sex wedding, an occasion in which they would be joint celebrants. The forum takes judicial notice that a wedding cake has long been consider ed \u00b7a customary and important tradition in weddings in the United States. Respondents themselves acknowledge the special significance of wedding cakes in their affidavits, in which A. Klein and M. Klein each aver: 'The process of designing, creating and decorating a cake for a wedding goes far beyond the basics of baking a cake and putting frosting on it. Our customary practice involves meeting with customers to determine who they are, what their personalities are, how they are planning a wedding, finding out what their wishes and expectations concerning size, number of Pet.App.241 layers, colors, style and other decorative detail, which often includes looking at a variety of design alternatives before conceiving, sketching, and custom crafting a variety of decorating suggestions and ultimately finalizing the design. Our clients expect, and we intend, that each cake will be uniquely crafted to be a statement of each customer's personality, physical tastes, theme and desires, as well as their palate so it is a special part of their holy union.' Because the wedding cake was intended to equally benefit both Cryer and Bowman-Cryer, the forum finds that Bowman-Cryer has the same cause of action against Respondents under ORS 659A.403 and .406 as Cryer. Macedonia Church v. Lancaster Hotel Ltd. , 498 F. Supp 2d 494 (2007), though not binding on this forum, illustrates this point. In Macedonia , a group of individuals associated with Macedonia Church, a predominantly African- American congregation, alleged that they were denied accommodations be cause of their race. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint as to all but four plaintiffs on the grounds that the only plaintiffs who had standing to pursue the complaint were the four who actually visited defendants' facility. As stated by the court, 'the defendants' argument appears to assume that unless each plaintiff had a first-hand contact with the defendants, he or she could not [have] suffered any \"personal and individual\" injury.' The court motion, holding: 'Whether there was first-hand contact Pet.App.242 between the individual plaintiffs and the defendants is not material to the question of whether the individual plaintiffs suffered a personal and individual injury. Each of the Non-organizer Plaintiffs alleges that he or she was denied accommodations based on race or color. The fact that the defendants informed the plaintiffs that their refusal to provide them with accommodations by communicating with the Organizers instead of with each of the Non-organizer plaintiffs does not alter-the fact that those plaintiffs were denied accommodations. Nor is it material that the plaintiffs were unaware of the discrimination until sometime after it occurred.' \"Nexus between Complainants' sexual orientation and Respon dents' refusal to provide a wedding cake for their same-sex wedding \"Respondents argue that there is no evidence of any connection between Complainants' sexual orientation and Respondents' alleged discriminatory action. Respondents' argument is two-pronged. First, Respondents argue that their prior sale of a wedding cake to Cryer for her mother's wedding proves Respondents' lack of anim us towards Complainant's sexual orientation. Second, Respondents attempt to isolate Complainants' sexual orientation from their proposed 36 wedding, arguing that their decision was 36 The forum uses the term \"proposed\" because there is no Pet.App.243 not on account of Complainants' sexual orientation, but on Respondents' objection to participation in the event for which the cake would be prepared. \"Respondents' first argument fails for the reason that there is no evidence in the record that A. Klein, the person who refu sed to make a cake for Complainants while acting on Sweetcakes' behalf, had any knowledge of Complainants' sexual orientation in November 2010 when Cryer purchased a cake for her mother's wedding. Even if A. Klein was aware of Cryer's sexual orientation in November 2010, not discriminating on one occasion does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that A. Klein did not discriminate on a subsequent occasion. \"Respondents rely on Tanner v. OHSU to support their second argument In Tanner, OHSU, in accordance with State Employees' Benefits Board (SEBB) eligibility criteria, permitted employees to purchase insurance covera ge for 'family members.' Under the SEBB criteria, unmarried domestic partners of employees were not 'family members' who were entitled to insurance coverage. Plaintiffs, three lesbian nursing professionals with domestic partners, applied for insurance coverage and were denied on the ground that the domestic partners did evidence in the record to sh ow whether Complainants were actually ever married. [NOTE: At hearing, evidence was presented that Complainant's were legally married in 2014, a few days after Oregon's ban on same-sex marriage was struck down in federal court. See Prop osed Finding of Fact #47 -- The Merits, infra. Pet.App.244 not meet the SEBB eligibi lity criteria. Plaintiffs sued, alleging disparate impa ct sex discrimination in violation of then ORS 659.030 (1)(b) in that OHSU's policy had the effect of di scriminating against homosexual couples because, unlike heterosexual couples, they could not marry and become eligible for insurance benefits. Significant to this case, the court stated that plaintiffs were a member of a protected class under ORS 659.030 and that they made out a disparate impact claim because 'OHSU's practice of denying insurance benefits to unmarried domestic partners, while facially neutral as to homosexual couples, effectively screens out 100 percent of them from obtaining full coverage for both partners. That is because, under Oregon law, homosexual couples may not marry.' Id. at 516. The court then held that OHSU did not violate then ORS 659.030(1 )(b) because plaintiffs did not prove that OHSU engaged 'in a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter' under then ORS 659.028. Id. at 517-19. The language that Respondents quote to support their argument is not the holding of the case, but merely a bridge between the court's evalua tion of plaintiffs' case based on different treatment and disparate impact theories. Accordingly, Tanner does not assist Respondents. Also significant to this case, plaintiffs alleged a violation of Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution. The court found that plaintiffs, as homosexual couples, were members of a 'true class,' and also members of a 'suspect class' based on their sexual orientation. Id. at 524. \"Respondents' attempt to divorce their refusal to provide a cake for Complainants' samesex wedding from Complainants' sexual orientation is neither Pet.App.245 novel nor supported by case law. As the Agency argues in support of its cross-motion, '[!]here is- simply no reason to distinguish between services for a wedding ceremony between two persons of the same sex and the sexual orientation of that couple. The conduct, a marriage ceremony, is inextricably linked to a person's sexual orientation.' \"The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected similar attempts to distinguish between a protected status and conduct closely correla ted with that status. In Christian Legal Society Chapter of the University of California, Hastings Coll ege of the Law v. Martinez , 561 U.S. 661, 130 S. Ct. 2971 (2010), students at Hastings College of the Law formed a chapter of the Christian Legal Society (' CLS') and sought formal recognition from the school. The CLS required its members to affirm their beli ef in the divinity of Jesus Christ and to refrain from 'unrepentant homosexual conduct.' Id. at 2980. Hastings refused to recognize the organization on the ground that it violated Hastings' nondiscrimination policy, which prohibited exclusion based on religion or sexual orientation. The CLS argued that 'it does not exclude individuals because of sexual orientation, but rather \"on the basis of a conjunction of conduct and the belief that the conduct is not wrong.'\" Id. at 2990. The Court rejected this argument, stating: 'Our decisions have declined to distinguish between status and conduct in this context. See Lawrence v. Texas , 539 U.S. 558, 575, 123 S Ct 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (\"When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that Pet.App.246 declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination.'' (emphasis added)); id., at 583, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\"While it is true that the law applies only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is conduct that is closely correlated with being homosexual. Under such circumstances, [the] law is targeted at more than conduct. It is instead directed toward gay persons as a class.\"); cf. Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic , 506 U.S. 263, 270, 113 S.Ct. 753, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993) (\"A tax on wearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews.'').' In conclusion, the forum holds that when a law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, that law similar ly protects conduct that is inextricably tied to sexual orientation. See Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock , 309 P3d 53, 62 (2013), cert den 134 S. Ct. 1787 (2014). Applied to this case, the forum finds that Respon dents' refusal to provide a wedding cake for Complain ants because it was for their same-sex wedding was synonymous with refusing to provide a cake because of Complainants' sexual orientation. \"D. Respondent A. Klein violated 659A.403 With regard to its ORS 659A.403 claims, the Agency alleges the following in paragraph 111.12 in both sets of Charges: '12. Respondents discrimi nated against Complainant Pet.App.247 because of her sexual orientation. a. Melissa Elaine Klein denied full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of her business to [Complainant] based on her sexual orientation, in violation of ORS 659A.403(3). b. Respondent Aaron Wayne Klein, dba Sweetcakes by Melissa denied full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of her [sic] business to [Complainant] based on her sexual orientation, in violation of ORS 659A.403(3). c. In the alternative , Respondent Aaron Wayne Klein aided or abetted Melissa Elaine Klein in violating ORS 659A.403(3), in violation of ORS 659A.406.' (emphasis bolded by Agency in its Amended Formal Charges to show amendments to original Formal Charges) ORS 659A.403 provides, in pertinent part: '(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any place of public accommodatlon, without any distinction, discrimination or restriction on account of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age if the individual is 18 years of age or older. Pet.App.248 '(2) Subsection (1) of this section does not prohibit: \"(a) The enforcement of laws governing the consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors and the frequenting by minors of places of public accommodation where alcoholic beverages are served; or \"(b) The offering of spec ial rates or services to persons 50 years of age or older. '(3) It is an unlawful practice for any person to deny full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any place of public accommodation in violation of this section.' \"The prima facie elements of the Agency's 659A.403 case are: 1) Complainants were a homosexual couple and were perceived as such by A Klein and M. Klein; 2) Sweetcakes was a place of public accommodation; 3a) A Klein, a person acting on behalf of Sweetcakes, denied full and equal accommodations to Complainants; 3b) M. Klein, a person acting on behalf of Sweetcakes, denied full and equal accommodations to Complainants; and 4) the denials were on account of Complainants' sexual orientation. Elements 1, 2, 3a are established by undisputed facts. Element 4 is established in the preceding section's discussion of 'Nexus.' Accordingly, the forum concludes that A Klein violated ORS 659A.403 and that the Agency is entitled to summary judgment on the merits as to Cryer's and Bowman- Cryer's 659A.403 claims against A Klein. Since there Pet.App.249 is no evidence that M. Klein took any action to deny the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of Sweetcakes to Complainants, the forum concludes that M. Klein did not violate ORS 659A.403. However, M. Klein, as a joint owner of Sweetcakes with A. Klein, is jointly and severally liable for any damages awarded to Complainants stemming from A Klein's violation. \"E. ORS 659A.406 -- Aiding and Abetting a Violation of ORS 659A.403(3) \"The Agency seeks to hold A Klein liable as an aider and abettor under ORS 659A.406 for M. Klein's alleged violation of ORS 659A.403(3). Respondents assert that A Klein cannot be held liable as an aider and abettor under ORS 659A.406 because he is a co-owner of Sweetcakes and, as a matter of law, cannot aid and abet himself. The Agency argues to the contrary, based on the 'plain text' of the statute. \"ORS 659A.406 provides, in pertinent part: \"Except as otherwise authorized by ORS 659A.403, it is an unlawful practice for any person to aid or abet any place of public accommodation, as defined in ORS 659A.400, or any employee or person acting on behalf of the place of public accommodation to make any distinction, discrimi nation or restriction on account of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status or age if the individual is 18 years of age or older.\" Pet.App.250 In the previous section, the forum concluded that M. Klein did not violate ORS 659A.403(3) as alleged in paragraph 111.12.a and that A Klein, the joint owner of Sweetcakes, violated ORS 659A.403(3) as alleged in paragraph I1.12.b. Sinc e M. Klein did not violate ORS 659A.403, A Klein cannot be held liable to have aided and abetted her violation. 37 \"F. Notice that Discrimination will be made in Place of Public Accommodation - ORS 659A.409 \"In section IV of its Charges,38 the Agency alleges: (a) Respondent M. Klein 'published, issued* * * a communication, notice * * * that its accommodation, advantages* * * would be refused, withheld from or denied to, or that discrimination would be made against, a person on account of his or her sexual orientation, in violation of ORS 659A.409'; (b) Respondent A. Klein, 'dba Sweetcakes by Melissa, denied full and equal accommodations, advantages, 37 As pointed out in the prev ious section, there is a difference between committing a violation and being 25 I liable for the consequences of that violation. In this case, M. Klein's liability stems from her partnership status, not from any violation that she committed. 38 Section IV is prefaced by the caption \"UNLAWFUL PRACTICE: DISCRIMINATION BY PUBLICATION, CIRCULATION, ISSUANCE, OR DISPLAY OF A COMMUNICATION, NOTICE, ADVERTISEMENT, OR SIGN OF A DENIAL OF ACCOMMODATIONS, ADVANTAGES, FACILITIES, SERVICES OR PRIVILEGES BY A PLACE OF PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION.\" Pet.App.251 facilities and privileges of her business to [Complainant] based on her sexual orientation, in violation of ORS 659A.403(3)'; and (c) In the alternative, Respondent A. Klein 'aided or abetted M. Klein in violating ORS 659A.409, in violation of ORS 659A.406.' \"In its Charges, the Agency alleges in paragraphs 11.8 & 9 that A. Klein made statements that were broadcast on television on September 2, 2013, and on the radio on February 13, 2014, that communicate an intent to discriminate based on sexual orientation. The full text of the relevant part of those broadcasts is set out in Findings of Fact ##12 and 14, supra. The Agency's cross-motion for summary judgment singles out the statements made on those two occasions as proof that Respondents violated ORS 659A.409. 39 \"ORS 659A.409 provides, in pertinent part: :'* * * it is an unlawful practice for any person acting on behalf of any place of public accommodation as defined in ORS 659A.400 to publish, circulate, issue or display, or cause to be published, circulated, issued or displayed, any communication, notice, advertisement or sign of any kind to the 39 The Agency's cross-motion also discusses the sign on Sweetcakes' door after it closed for business, but since the Agency did not allege the existenc e or contents of the sign as a violation, the forum does not consider it. Pet.App.252 effect that any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, services or privileges of the place of public accommodation will be refused, withheld from or denied to, or that any discrimination will be made against, any person on account of*** sexual orientation * * *.' The alleged unlawful statements made by A. Klein were: 'I didn't want to be a part of her marriage, which I think is wrong.' (September 2, 2013 CBN interview) 'I said \"I'm very sorry, I feel like you may have wasted your time. You know we don't do same-sex marriage, same-sex wedding cakes.\" ***You know, it was something I had a feeling was going to become an issue and I discussed it with my wife when the state of Washington, which is right across the river from us, legalized same-sex marriage and we watched Masterpiece Bakery going through the same issue that we ended up going through. But, you know, it was one of those situations where we said \"well I can see it is going to become an issue but we have to stand firm. It's our belief and we have a right to it, you know.\"' (February 13, 2014, Tony Perkins interview) In their motion for summary judgment, Respondents argue that 'ORS 659A.409 by its terms requires a statement of future intention that is entirely absent Pet.App.253 in this instance.' Respondents further argue that: 'A review of the vid eotape record of the CBN broadcast*** clearly sh ows that Aaron Klein spoke only of the reason why he and his wife declined to participate in complainants' ceremony. The same is true of the Perkins radio broadcast. * * * A statement of future intention in either media event is conspicuously absent.' The Agency does not dispute the correctness of Respondents' argument that ORS 659A.409 is directed towards communications relating a prospective intent to discriminate, but argues that A. Klein's statements are a prospective communication: 'Reviewed in context, Respondents communicated quite clearly that same-sex couples would not be provided wedding cake services at their bakery. These are not descriptions of past events as alleged by Respondents. Respon dents stated their position in these communications and notify the public that they \"don't do same sex weddings,\" they \"stand firm,\" are \"still in business\" nue to stay strong.'\" Whatever Respondents' post-January 2013 intentions may have been or may still be with regard to providing wedding cake services for same-sex weddings, the forum finds that A. Klein's above quoted statements, evaluated both for text and context, are properly cons trued as the recounting of past events that led to the present Charges being Pet.App.254 filed. In other words, these statements described what occurred on January 17, 2013, and thoughts and discussions the Kleins had before January 2013, not what the Kleins intended to do in the future.40 To arrive at the conclusion sought by the Agency requires drawing an inference of future intent from the Kleins's statements of. religious belief that the forum is not willing to draw. Accordingly, the forum concludes that A. Klein' s communication did not violate ORS 659A.409. 41 \"In addition, the forum notes that M. Klein cannot be held to have violated ORS 659A.409 40 In contrast, had A. Klein told Perkins \"I said 'I'm very sorry*** You know we don't do same-sex marriage, same-sex wedding cakes' and we take the same stand today,\" the forum's ruling would be different, as suming the Agency had plead a violation of ORS 659A.409 by A. Klein. 41 Compare In the Matter of Blachana , LLC, 32 BOLI 220 (2013), appeal pending (Respondent found to have violated ORS 659A.409 when member of the LLC left a telephone message with the organizer of a group of transgender individuals who had visited the LLC's nightclub regularly on Friday nights during the previous 18 months asking \"not to come back on Friday nights.\"); In the Matter of The Pub , 6 BOLI 270, 282-83 (1987) (Respondent found to have violated ORS 659.037, the predecessor of ORS 659A.409, by posting a on front door of pub, immediately under another sign that said \"VIVA APARTHEID,\" a sign that said \"NO SHOES, SHIRTS, SERVICE, NIGGERS,\" and a sign inside the pub, with chain and spikes attached at each end, that read \"Discrimination. Webster - to use good judgment\" on the front and \"Authentic South African Apartheid Nigger 'Black' Handcuffs Directions Drive Through Wrists and Bend Over Tips\" on the back). Pet.App.255 because she made no communication. Therefore, the forum finds that A. Klein did not aid or abet M .. Klein to commit a violation of that statute and Respondents are entitled to summary judgment on this issue. \"G. Respondents' Counterclaims \"Before addressing Respondents' affirmative defenses, the forum addresses Respondents' counterclaims. First, Respondents allege that BOL through its actions in prosecuting this case, has 'knowingly and selectively acted under color of state law to deprive Responde nts of their fundamental constitutional and statutor y rights on the basis of religion' in violation of ORS-659A.403 and 'deprive[d] the Respondents of fundamental rights and protections guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution,' thereby generating liability under 42 USC \u00a7 1983. Second, Respondents allege that the BOLI's Commissioner violated ORS 659A.409 by publishing, circulating, issuing, or displaying communications on Facebook and in print media 'to the effect that its accommodations, advantages, facilities, services or privileges would be refused, withheld from or denied to, or the discrimination would be made against Respondents and other persons similarly situated on the basis of- religion in violation of ORS 659A.409.' Respondents seek damages in the amount of $100,000 for economic damages, $100,000 for non-economic damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney fees. \"The authority of state agencies is limited to Pet.App.256 that granted to them by the legislature. See SAIF Corp. v. Shipley, 326 Or 557, 561, 955 P2d 244 (1998) ('an agency has only those powers that the legislature grants and cannot exercise authority that it does not have'). ORS 659A.850(4) gives the Commissioner the authority to award compensatory damages to complainants as an element of a cease and desist order within a contested case proceeding. There is no corresponding statute that authorizes the Commissioner to award the damages sought by Respondents in their counter claims. With regard to attorney fees or court costs, the legislature has only granted authority to the Commissioner to award these in contested case proc eedings to interveners in a real property case brought under ORS 659A.145 or ORS 659A.421. 42 \"In conclusion, the forum lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate Respondents' counterclaims and may neither grant nor deny them. The only relief available to Respondents through this forum is dismissal of any Charges not proven by the Agency under ORS 659A.850(3).43 42 See ORS 659A.850(1)(b)(B). 43 See, e.g., Wallace v. PERB , 245 Or App 16, 30,263 P3d 1010 (2011) (when plaintiff sought compensatory damages in an APA contested case proceeding based on alleged financial loss after PERS placed a limit on how often he could transfer funds he had invested in the Oregon Savings Growth Plan, the court held that, since it had no auth ority under ORS 183.486(1 )(b) to award compensatory damages to plaintiff, plaintiff was also unable to recover those damages in the contested case Pet.App.257 \"H. Respondents' Affirmative Defenses \"Respondents' affirmative defenses include estoppel and the unconstitutionality of ORS 659A.403, .406, and .409, both facially and as applied. As an initial matter, the forum notes that the Oregon Court of Appeals has held that an Agency has the authority to decide the constitutionality of statutes. See Eppler v. Boar d of Tax Service Examiners , 189 Or App 216, 75 P3d 900 (2003), citing Cooper v. Eugene Sch. Dist. No. 4J , 301 Or. 358, 362-65, 723 P.2d 298 (1986) and Nutbrown v. Munn , 311 Or. 328, 346, 811 P.2d 131 (1991). In BOL contested cases, the Commissioner has delegated to the ALJ the authority to rule on motions for summary judgment, with the decision 'set forth in the Proposed Order' and subject to ratification by the Commissioner in the Final Order. OAR 839-050-0150(4). Accordingly, the ALJ has the initial authority to rule on the constitutional issues raised by Respondents in their motion for summary judgment. 44 \"Estoppel proceeding). 44 Eppler , Cooper , and Nutbrown impliedly overruled the forum's holding in the case of In the Matter of Doyle's Shoes , 1 BOLI 295 (1980), a Final Order issued before the Eppler , Cooper , and Nutbrown decisions in which th e forum held that it was beyond the Commissioner's discretion to determine the constitutionality of legislative enactments. The forum now explicitly overrules that holding. Pet.App.258 \"In their answers, Responde nts phrase their estoppel defense as follows: \"The state of Oregon, including the Bureau of Labor and Industries[,] is estopped from compelling Respondents to engage in creative expression or otherwise participate in same-sex ceremonies not recognized by the state of Oregon contrary to their fundamental rights, consciences and convictions.\" Estoppel is a legal doctrine whereby one party is foreclosed from proceeding against another when one party has made 'a false re presentation, (1) of which the other party was ignorant, (2) made with the knowledge of the facts, (3) made with the intention that it would induce action by the other party, and (4) that induced the other party to act upon it. ' State ex rel. State Offices for Services to Children and Families v. Dennis , 173 Or App 604, 611, 25 P3d 341 (2001 ), citing Keppinger v. Hanson Crushing, Inc. , 161 Or App 424, 428, 983 P.2d 1084 (1999). In order to establish estoppel against a state agency, a party must have relied on the agency's representations and the party's reliance must have been reasonable. Id., citing Dept. of Transportation v. Hewett Professional Group , 321 Or 118,126,895 P2d 755 (1995). 45 45 See also In the Matter of Sunnyside Inn , 11 BOLI 151, 162 (1993) (Equitable estoppel may exist when one party (1) has made a false representation; (2) the false representation is made with knowledge of the fa cts; (3) the other party is ignorant of the truth; (4) the false representation is made with Pet.App.259 \"Here, Respondents do not identify any false representation made by BOLI or any other state agency upon which Respondents relied in refusing to provide a wedding cake to Complainants. Although it is undisputed that the Oregon Constitution did not recognize same-sex marriages in January 2013, the affidavits of A. Klein and M. Klein establish that the refusal was because of Respondents' religious convictions stemming from Biblical authority, not on their reliance on Oregon's Constitutional provisim1 rejecting same-sex marri age or their attempt to enforce that provision. 46 \"In conclusion, Respondents present no facts, articulate no legal theory, and cite no case law to support their argument that BOL should be estopped from litigating this case based on the doctrine of the intention that it should be relied upon by the other party; and (5) the other party is induced to act upon it to that party's detriment); In the Matter of Portla nd Electric & Plumbing Company , 4 BOLI 82, 98-99 (1983) (estoppel only protects those who materially change their position in reliance on another's acts or representations). 46 In A. Klein's affidavit, he states that, after Cryer told him \"something to the effect 'Well, there are two brides, and their names are Rachel and Laurel,\"' he \"indicated we did not create wedding cakes for same-sex ceremonies because of our religious convictions, and they left the shop.\" In the same paragraph, he states \"I believed that I was acting within the bounds of the Oregon Constitution and the laws of the State of Oregon which, at that time, explicitly defined marriage as the union of one man and prohibited recognition of any other type of union as marriage.\" Pet.App.260 estoppel. The Agency is entitled to summary judgment on this issue. \"Respondents' Constitutional Defenses - Introduction \"Due to the number and complexity of Respondents' constitution al defenses, the forum summarizes them, as plead in Respondents' answers, before analyzing them. They include the following: x\"The statutes underly ing the Charges are unconstitutional as applied in that they violate Respondents' fundamental rights arising under the Oregon Constitution by: (a) unlawfully violating Respondents' freedom of worship and conscience under Articl e I, \u00a72; (b) unlawfully violating Respondents' freedom of religious opinion under Article I, \u00a73; (c) unlawfully violating Respondents' freedom of speech under Article I, \u00a78; (d) unlawfully compelling Respondents to engage expression of a message they did not want to express; (e) unlawfully violating Respondents' privileges and immunities under Article I, \u00a720; and (f) violating Article XV, \u00a75a. x\"The statutes underlying the Charges are facially unconstitutional under the Oregon Constitution in that they violate Respondents' fundamental rights arising under the Oregon Constitution to the extent there is no religious exemption to protect or acknowledge the fundamental rights of Respondents and persons similarly situated. Pet.App.261 x\"The statutes underly ing the Charges are unconstitutional as applied to Respondents to the extent they do not protect the fundamental rights of Respondents and persons similarly situated arising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as applied to the State of Oregon under the Fourteenth Amendment, by: (a) unlawfully infringing on Respondents' right of conscience right to free exercise of religion, and right to free speech; (b) unlawfully compelling Respondents to engage expression of a me ssage they did not want to express; and (c) unlawfully denying Respondents' right to due process and equal protection of the laws. x\"The statutes underlying the Charges are facially unconstitutional to the extent there is no religious exemption to protect or acknowledge the fundamental rights of Respondents and persons similarly situated arising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as applied to the State of Oregon under the Fourteenth Amendment. When both state and federal constitutional claims are raised, Oregon courts first evaluate the state claim. Sterling v. Cupp , 290 Or 611, 614, 625 P2d 123 (1981). The forum does likewise. For continuity's sake, the forum follows the analysis of each state claim with an analysis of the parallel federal claim. The forum only addresses the constitutionality of ORS 659A.403, since the forum has already concluded, on a subconstitutional level, that Respondents did not violate ORS 659A.406 and Pet.App.262 659A.409. \"Oregon Constitution \"Article I. Sections 2 and 3: Freedom of worship and conscience: Freedom of religious opinion \"The forum addresses these interrelated defenses together. Article I, Sections 2 and 3 of the Oregon Constitution provide: 'Section 2. Freedom of worship. All men shall be secure in the Natural right, to worship Almighty God according_ to the dictates of their own consciences.' 'Section 3. Freedom of religious opinion.No law shall in any case whatever control the free exercise, and enjoyment of religeous [sic] opinions, or interfere with the rights of conscience.' Respondents, who are Christians, have a sincerely held belief that the Bible 'f orbids us from proclaiming messages or participating\u00b7 in activities contrary to Biblical principles, including celebrations or ceremonies for uniting same-sex couples.' They argue that Article I, sections 2 and 3 gave them the unfettered right to refuse to provide a cake for Complainants' same-sex wedding ceremony because doing so would have compelled them to act contrary to their sincerely held religious beliefs. \"The forum first analyzes a series of Oregon Supreme Court cases interpreting Article I, sections Pet.App.263 2 and 3, then applies them to ORS 659A.403. Beginning with City of Portland v. Thornton , 174 Or 508, 149 P2d 972 (1944), the 15 Oregon Supreme Court applied U.S. Supreme Court precedents under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution when interpreting Article I, Sections 2 and 3 of the Oregon Constitution. In Salem College & Academy, Inc. v. Emp. Div. , 298 Or 471, 486-87, 695 P2d 25 (1985), an inter-denominational Christian school argued that the state's requirement that it pay unemployment tax violated Article I, sectio ns 2 and 3. Th e court held that 'the state had not infringed upon the school's right to religious freedom when all similarly situated employers in the state were subject to [unemployment tax].' Significant to this case, the Salem court interpreted Article I, sections 2 and 3 in light of the text and historical context in which they arose, without reference to U.S. Supreme Court decisions and without reference to its own prior decisions that had relied on federal First Amendment precedent Id. at 484. \"In 1986, in the next case involving the application of Article I, sections 2-7, the Oregon Supreme Court made explicit what was implicit in Salem College. In Cooper v. Eugene Sch. Dist. No. 4J, 301 Or. 358, 369-70, 723 P2d 298, 306-07 (1986), the court stated: 'This court sometimes has treated these guarantees and the First Amendment's ban on laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion (footnote omitted) as \"identical in meaning,\" City of Portland v. Thornton , 174 Or. 508, 512, 149 P.2d 972 (1942); but Pet.App.264 identity of 'meaning' or even of text does not imply that the state's laws will not be tested- against the state's own constitutional guarantees before reaching the federal constraints imposed by the Fourtenth [sic] Amendment, or that verbal formulas developed by the United States Supreme Court in applying the federal text also govern application of the state's comparable clauses.' (footnote omitted). Since Cooper , the Oregon Supreme Court has decided a trio of cases interp reting Article I, sections 2 and 3 that are relevant to tbe present case. \"In Smith v. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources \" 301 Or 209, 721 P2d 445 (1986), vacated on other grounds sub nom., Employment Div. v. Smith , 485 US 660 (1988), a drug counselor was fired for misconduct based on his ingestion of peyote, a sacrament in the Native American Church, during a Native American Church service and denied unemployment benefits. Smith claimed that the denial of unemployment benefi ts placed 'a burden on his freedom to worship according to the dictates of his conscience' under th e Oregon Constitution, Article I, sections 2 and 3. Citing Salem College , the court held that there was no violation of Article I, sections 2 and 3 because the statute and rule defining misconduct were 'completely neutral toward religious motivations for mi sconduct' and '[claimant] was denied benefits through the operation of a statute that is neutral both on its face and as applied.' Id. at 215-16. Pet.App.265 \"In Employment Div., Department of Human Resources v. Rogue Valley Youth for Christ, 307 Or 490, 498-99, 770 P2d 588 (1989), the court rejected a religious organization's claim that payment of unemployment tax would violate its rights under Article I, sections 2 and 3. Relying on United States v. Lee , 455 U.S. 252, 256-57, 102 S.Ct. 1051, 1054-55, 71 L.Ed.2d 127, 132 (1982), the court stated: 'When governmental action is challenged as a violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment ii must first be shown that the governmental action imposes a burden on the party's religion. Assuming that imposing unemployment payroll taxes on all religious organizations will burden at least some of those groups, (although not necessarily their freedom of belief or worship), that assumption \"is only the beginning, however, and not the end of the inquiry. Not all burdens on religious liberty are unconstitutional. * * * The state may justify a limitation on religion by showing that it is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental interest.\" In the present case the State of Oregon has two governmental interests which, when taken together, are sufficiently important to support the burden on religion represented by unemployment payroll taxes. 'There are few governmental tasks as important as providing for the economic security of its ci tizens. A strong unemployment compensation system plays a Pet.App.266 significant role in providing this security. * * * [A]ny state's unemployment tax must, as a practical matter, comply with FUTA's (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) requirements or the state's employers would face a double tax. Such a double tax would, in turn, create a very undesirable business climate in the state. This, combined with Oregon's constitutional interest in treating all religious organization s equally, creates an overriding state interest in applying the unemployment payroll ta xes to all religious organizations. Our construction of the coverage of Oregon's unemployment compensation taxation scheme does not offend the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause or Article I, section 3 of the Oregon Constitution.' (internal citations and footnotes omitted) Rogue Valley , at 498-99. \"In Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and Industries , 322 Or 132, 903 P2d 351 (1995), the court considered a constitutional challenge to BOLI's rule that 'verbal or physical conduct of a religious nature' in the workplace was unlawful if it had the purpose or effect of unreasonably inter fering with the subject's work performance or crea ting an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.' Id. at 139. As Respondents note, th e court introduced its discussion of Article I, sections 2 and 3, with this sweeping statement: ' These provisions are ob viously worded more Pet.App.267 broadly than the federal First Amendment, and are remarkable in the inclusiveness and adamancy with which rights of conscience are to be protected from governmental interference.' Id. at 146. The court then launched into a brief history of governmental intolerance towards religion enforced by criminal laws in England before summarizing its Salem College decision and concluding: 'A general scheme prohibiting religious discrimination in employment, including religious harassment, does not conflictwith any of the underpinnings of the Oregon constitutional guarantees of religious freedom identified in Salem College: It does not infringe on the right of an employer independently to develop or to practice his or her own religious opinions or exercise his or her rights of conscience, short of the employer's imposing them on employees holding other forms of belief or nonbelief; it does not discourage the multiplicity of religious sects; and it applies equally to all employers and thereby does not choose among religions or beliefs. 'The law prohibiting religious discrimination, including religious harassment, honors the constitutional commitment to religious pluralism by ensuring that employees can earn a living regardless of their religious beliefs. The statutory prohibition against religious discrimination in employment and, Pet.App.268 in particular, the BOLI rule at issue, when properly applied, will promote the '[n]atural right' of employees to 'be secure in' their 'worship [of] Almighty God according to the dictates of their own co nsciences,' Or. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 2, and will not be a law controlling religious rights of cons cience or their free exercise.' Meltebeke at 148-49. The court then moved on to a review of Smith, stating that Smith stood for the principle that '[a] law that is neutral toward religion or nonreligion as such, that is neutral among religions, and that is part of a general regulatory scheme having no purpose to control or interfere with rights of conscience or with religious opinions does not violate the guarantees of religious freedom in Article I, sections 2 and 3.' Meltebeke at 149. The court held as follows: 'We conclude that, under established principles of state constitutional law Concerning freedom of religion, discussed above, BOLI's rule is constitutional on its face. The law prohibiting employment discrimination, including the regulatory prohibition against relig ious harassment, is a law that is part of a general regulatory scheme, expressly neutral toward religion as such and neutral among religions. Indeed, its purpose is to support the values protected by Article I, sections 2 and 3, not to impede them.' Id. at 150-51. Pet.App.269 \"Next, the Meltebeke court analyzed whether the BOLI rule, as applied, violated Article i, sections 2 and 3. Following Smit h, the court stated: 'Because sections 2 and 3 of Article I are expressly designed to prevent government created homogeneity of religion, the government may not constitutionally impose sanctions on an employer for engaging in a religious practice without knowledge that the practice has a harmful effect on the employees intended to be protected. If the rule were otherwise, fear of unwarranted government punishment would stifle or make insecure the employer's enjoyment and exercise of religion, seriously eroding the very values that the constitution expressly exempts from government control.' (emphasis added) Id. at 153. Based on facts set out in BOLI's Final Order, the court found that the employer's complained-of conduct co nstituted a 'religious practice,' that the employer did not know his conduct created an intimidating, host ile, or offensive working environment, 47 and that the employer had established an affirmative defense under Article I, sections 2 and 3 because BOLI's rule did not require 47 See In the Matter of James Meltebeke , 10 BOLI 102, 105- 07 (1992) (BOLI Commissioner's Findings of Fact included detailed findings that employer believed he was commanded to preach his beliefs to others un der \"any and all circumstances\" or \"he would be lost\"). Pet.App.270 that the employer 'knew in fact that his actions in exercise of his religious practice had an effect forbidden by the rule.'48 Id. In contrast, here Respondents' affidavits estab lish that their refusal to make a wedding cake for Complainants was not a religious practice, but conduct motivated by their religious beliefs. 49 Accordingly, Meltebeke does not aid Respondents. \"The general principle that emerges from these cases is that a law that is part of a general regulatory scheme, expressly neutral and neutral among religions, is constitutional under Article I, sections 2 and 3. ORS 659A.403 is such a law. 48 In a footnote, the court distinguished \"a religious practice\" from \"conduct that may be motivated by one's religious beliefs\" in stating: \"Conduct that may be motivated by one's religious beliefs is not the same as conduct that constitutes a religious practice. The knowledge standard is considered here only in relation to the latte r category. In this case, no distinction between those categories is called into play, because a fair reading of BOLI's revised final order is that BOLI found that all of Employer's religious activity respecting Complainant is part of Employer's religious practice.\" Meltebeke at 153, fn. 19. 49 v. , 257 Or App 220,226,305 P3d 147 (2013) (\"First, we conclude that , regardless of where the line between religious practice and religiously motivated conduct is drawn, there are some behaviors that fall clearly to one side or the other. A Catholic taking comm union at mass is clearly and unambiguously engaging in a religious practice; on the other side of the line, allowing a chil d to die for lack of life-saving medical care is clearly and unambiguously-and, as a matter of law-conduct that may be motivated by one's religious beliefs.\") Pet.App.271 Additionally, there is also \"an overriding governmental interest\" present, explicitly expressed by Oregon's legislature in ORS 659A.003 in the following words: 'The purpose of this chapter is*** to ensure the human dignity of all people within this state and protect their health, safety and morals from the consequences of intergroup hostility, tensions and practices of unlawful discrimination of any kind based on*** sexual orientation***.' \"Respondents further contend that 'the statutes underlying the Charges are facially unconstitutional under the Oregon Constitution in that they violate Respondents' fundamental rights arising under the Oregon Constitution to the extent there is no religious exemption to pr otect or acknowledge the fundamental rights of Respondents and persons similarly situated.' There is no requirement under the Oregon Constitution for such an exemption. 50 he 50 The legislature did choose to enact certain exemptions to civil rights laws. Actions by bona fide churches or other religious institutions regarding ho using and use of facilities are not unlawful practices if based on a bona fide religious belief about sexual orientation. Actions by bona fide churches or other religious institutions regarding employment are not unlawful practices if based on a bona fide religioas belief about sexual orientation if the actions fall under one of three specific circumstances. Preference for employment applicants of a particular religion is not an unlawful practice by a bona fide church or other religious institut ion if it passes a three part test. The housing, use of facilities and employment exemptions do not apply to commercial or bu siness activities of the church or institution. See ORS 659A.006. The existence of this statute, Pet.App.272 exclusions and prohibitions in ORS 659A.400(2) and 659A.403(2) do not lead to the conclusion that the law is not neutral. Respondents' reliance on Hobby Lobby51 fails because Hobby Lobby was not decided on constitutional grounds, but decided under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\") of 1993 and because the RFRA does not apply to the states. City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 US 507 (1997). \"Based on the above, the forum finds ORS 659A.403 to be constitutional with respect to Article I, sections 2 and 3 of the Oregon Constitution. With respect to whether ORS 659A.403 is constitutional 'as applied,' Meltebeke does not aid Respondents for the reason that Respondents' refusal to make a wedding cake for Complainants was not a 'religious-practice,' but conduct motivated by their 'religious beliefs.' Meltebeke at 153. \"United States Constitution \"First Amendment: Unlawfully infringing on Respondents' right of conscience and right -to last amended in 2007, does not support Respondents' argument that the public accommodation statutes are unconstitutional because they do not contain such exemptions. Rather, it supports the Agency. If the legislature intended such exemptions be applied to the pu blic accommodation statutes it would have enacted them. 51 Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, 57 3 us_, 134 set2751 (June 30, 2014). Pet.App.273 free exercise of religion \"Respondents contend that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as applied to the State of Oregon under the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits BOLI from enforcing the provisions of ORS 659A.403 against Respondents because that statute, on its face and as applied, unlawfully infringes on Respondents' right of conscience and right to free exercise of religion. In pertinent part, the First Amendment provides: 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof* * *' \"Respondents argue that the forum should apply the 'strict scrutiny' test set out by the U.S. Supreme Court in Sherbert v. Verneer , 374 US 398 (1963), claiming that Sherbert and the U.S. Supreme Court's subsequent decisions in Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 US 205 (1972), Thomas v. Review Board , 450 US 707 (1981), Pacific Gas and E/ec. Co. v. Public Utilities Commissioner . 475 US 1 (1986), Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah , 508 US 520 (1993), Hosanna-Tabor Ev. Lutheran Church & School v. EEOC , 132 set 694 (2012), Gonzalez v. 0 Centro , 546 US 418 (2006), Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn., 131 SCt 2729 (2011), and Wooley v. Maynard , 430 US 705 (1977) compel the application of that test. \"The forum begins its analysis by noting that Wooley, Pacific Gas, Hosanna-Tabor, Gonzalez , and Brown are inapplicable to Resp ondents' free exercise claim for the following reasons: Pet.App.274 Wooley and Pacific Gas involved religion but were decided exclusively upon free speech grounds. \"Hosanna-Tabor was an employment discrimination suit brought by the EEOC on behalf of a minister challenging the church's decision to fire her as an ADA violation in which the court held only that 'the ministerial exception bars such a suit.' Hosanna-Tabor at 710. \"Gonzalez , like Hobby Lobby , is inapplicable to this case because it was decided under the RFRA and because the RFRA does not apply to the states. \"Brown was a free speech case that did not involve a free exercise claim. \"In Sherbert , a Seventh Day Adventist ('appellant') was denied unemployment benefits because she refused to work on Saturdays based on her religious beliefs. She appealed on the grounds that South Carolina's law violated the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. The court held that the law was constitutionally invalid because it imposed a burden on appellant's free exercise of her religion and there was no 'compelling state interest enforced in the eligibility provisions of the South Carolina statute [that] justifies the substantial infringement of appellant's First Amendment rights.' Id. at 404, 406-07. \"In Wisconsin , the Supreme Court held that the state of Wisconsin could no t compel Amish students to attend school beyond the eighth grade when that requirement conflicted with Amish religious beliefs, Pet.App.275 stating: \"[I]n order for Wisconsi n to compel school attendance beyond the eighth grade against a claim that such attendance interferes with the practice of a legitimate religious belief, it must appear either that the State does not deny the free exercise of religious belief by its requirement, or that there is a state interest of sufficient magnitude to override the interest claiming protection under the Free Exercise Clause.\" \"Relying on Sherbert and Wisconsin , the Thomas court reversed the denial of unemployment benefits to a Jehovah's Witnesses who quit his job because his job duties changed from working with sheet metal to manufacturing turrets for ta nks, a war-related task that he opposed based on his religious beliefs. In upholding appellant's claim, the court stated: 'The mere fact that the petitioner's religious practice is burdened by a governmental program does not mean that an exemption accommodating his practice must be granted. The state may justify an inroad on religious liberty by showing that it is the least restrictive means of achieving some compelling state interest.' Thomas , at 718. \"In 1990, the Smith case, upon which both the Agency and Respondents rely, came before the court on appeal from the Oregon Supreme Court. The Pet.App.276 Oregon Supreme Court held that the state's denial of unemployment benefits based on the prohibition of sacramental peyote use wa s valid under the Oregon Constitution but invalid under the free exercise clause in the First Amendment of the U. S. Constitution based on Sherbert and Thomas . The U.S. Supreme Court characterized the issue before it as follows: \"This case requires us to decide whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment permits the State of Oregon -to include religiously inspired peyote use within the reach of its general criminal prohibition on use of that drug, and thus permits the State to deny unemployment benefits to persons dismissed from their jobs because of such religious ly inspired use.\" Smith at 874. Smith argued that 'prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]' includes requiring any individual to observe a generally applicable law that requires (or forbids) the pe rformance of an act that his religious belief forbids (or requires).' Id. at 878. The court rejected Smith 's argument, holding that the State of Oregon, 'consistent with the free exercise clause,' could deny Smith unemployment benefits when Smith's dismissal resulted from the use of peyote, a use that was constitutionally prohibited under Oregon law. Id. at 890. The court specifically declined to apply Sherbert 's 'compelling interest' test, stating: 'Although, as noted earlier, we have sometimes used the Sherbert test to analyze Pet.App.277 free exercise challenges to * * * laws, we have never applied the test to invalidate one. We conclude today that the sounder approach, and the approach in accord with the vast majority of our precedents, is to hold the test inapplicable to such challenges. The government's ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct, like its ability to carry out other aspects of public policy, \"cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector's spiritual development.\" To make an individual's obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law's coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State's interest is compelling - permitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, \"to become a law unto himself,\" - contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.' (internal citations omitted) Id. at 884-85. The court concluded that the 'right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a \"valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).\"' Id. at 879, citing United States v. Lee , 455 U.S. 252, at 263, n. 3. Related to one of Respondents' arguments here, the court also discussed the concept of 'hybrid' cases and concluded that Smith was not a 'hybrid' case. 52 52 With respect to \"hybrid claims,\" the Smith court stated: Pet.App.278 \"In Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. \"The only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action have involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such as freedom of speech and of the press, see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310 U.S., at 304-307, 60 S.Ct ., at 903-905 (invalidating a licensing system for religious an d charitable solicitations under which the administrator had discretion to deny a license to any cause he deemed nonreligious); Murdock v. Pennsylvania , 319 U.S. 105, 63 S.Ct. 870, 87 L.Ed. 1292 (1943) (invalidating a flat tax on solicitation as applied to the dissemination of religious ideas); Follett v. McCormick , 321 U.S. 573, 64 S.Ct 717, 88 L.Ed. 938 (1944) (same), or the right of parents, acknowledged in Pierce v. Society of Sisters , 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), to direct the education of their children, see Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) (invalidating compulsory school-attendance laws as applied to Amish parents-who refused on religious grounds to send their children to school). Some of our cases prohibiting compelled expression, decided exclusively upon free speech grounds, have also involved freedom of religion, cf. Wooley v. Maynard , 430-U.S. 705, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977) (invalidating compelled display of a license plate slogan that offended individual religious beliefs); West Virginia Bd. of Education v. Barnette 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628-(1943) (invalidating compulsory flag salute statute challenged by religious objectors). And it is easy to envision a case in which a challenge on freedom of association grounds would likewise be reinforced by Free Exercise Clause concerns. Cf. Roberts v. United States Jaycees , 468 U.S. 609, 622, L.Ed.2d 462 (1984) (\"An individual's freedom to speak, to worship, and to petition the government for the redress of grievances co uld not be vigorously protected from interference by the State [if] a correlative freedom to engage in group effort toward those ends were not also guaranteed.\") (footnotes omitted) Pet.App.279 City of Hialeah , 508 US 520 (1993), the Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. ('church') and its congregants practiced the Santeria religion, a religion that employed anim al sacrifice as one of its principal forms of devotion. During that devotion, animals are killed by cutti ng their carotid arteries, then cooked and eaten following Santeria rituals. After the church leased land in Hialeah and announced plans to establish a house of worship and other facilities there, the city council held an emergency public session and passed a resolution which noted city residents' 'concern' over religious practices inconsistent with public morals, peace, or safety, and adopted three substantive ordinances addressing the issue of religious animal sacrifice. Using the Smith test, the Supreme Court found that the ordinances were neither neutral nor 53 of general applicability54 and held that 'a law burdening 53 The court examined the hist ory behind the ordinances before concluding: \"In sum, the neutrality inqu iry leads to one conclusion: The ordinances had as their object the suppression of religion. The pattern we have recited discloses animosity to Santeria adherents and their religious prac tices; the ordinances by their own terms target this religious exercise; the texts of the ordinances were gerrymandered wi th care to proscribe religious killings of animals but to excl ude almost all secular killings; and the ordinances suppress much more religious conduct than is necessary in order to achieve the legitimate ends asserted in their defense. These ordinances are not neutral, and the court below committed clear error in fail ing to reach this conclusion.\" Lukumi at 542. 54 In concluding that Hialeah's ordinances were not of Pet.App.280 religious practice that is not neutral or not of general application' can only survive if there is a 'compelling' governmental interest and the law is 'narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.' Id. at 546-47. \"Respondents argue that the Smith 'neutrality' test should not be applied here for two reasons. First, this is a 'hybrid' case in which the law 'substantially burden[s] multiple rights combining religion and speech' that the Smith court distinguished from cases that only involve free exercise claims. This argument fails because neither Respondents' free exercise nor free speech claims are independently viable 55 and the two claims together are not greater than the sum of their parts.56 Second, Respondents argue that ORS 659A.403 is neither 'neutral' nor of \"general applicability,\" the court found that the ordinances \"were drafted with care to forbid few killings but those occasioned by religious sacrifice, \" that they did not prohibit and approved many kinds of \"animal deat hs or kills for nonreligious reason,\" that the city's purported concern for public health resulting from improper disposal of animal carcasses only addressed religious sacrifice and not disposal by restaurants or hunters, that more rigorous standards of inspection were imposed on animals killed for religious sacrifice and eaten than animals killed by hunters or fishermen, and that small commercial slaughterhouses were not subject to similar requirements related to the city's \"professed desire to prevent cruelty to animals and preserve the public health.\" Id. at 543- 45. 55 See discussion in \"free speech\" section, infra. 56 See Elane Photography, LLC v. 53 (2013), cert. den. (2014). Pet.App.281 'general applicability.' Applying the Smith test, the forum finds that ORS 659A.403 is a 'valid and neutral law of general applicability.' As such, it is constitutional under the First Amendment's free exercise clause, both facially and as applied. \"Oregon Constitution \"Article I. Section 8: freedom of speech \"Article I, Section 8 of the Oregon Constitution provides: 'Section 8. Freedom of speech and press. No laws shall be passed restraining the free expression of opinion, or restricting the right to speak, write, or print freely on any subject whatever; but every person shall be responsible for the abuse of this right.' ORS 659A.403 provides, in pertinent part: '(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any place of public accommodation, without any distinction, discrimination or restriction on account of*** sexual orientation***. * * * * * '(3) It is an unlawful practice for any person to deny full and equal accommodations, Pet.App.282 advantages, facilities and privileges of any place of public accommod ation in violation of this section.' The issues considered by the forum are: (1) Is ORS 659A.403 facially unconstitutional? (2) If ORS 659A.403 is facially constitutional, is it unconstitutional by requiring Respondents to participate in 'compelled speech' by making and providing a wedding cake for Complainants? \"State v. Robertson , 293 Or 402,649 P.2d 569 (1982), is the seminal Oregon case in this area. Robertson involved an Article I, Section 8 challenge to ORS 163.275, a statute defining the crime of coercion, in which 'speech [was] a statutory element in the definition of the offense.' Id. at 415. In Robertson , the Oregon Supreme Court established a basic framework, comprised of three categories, for determining whether a law violates Article I, section 8. That framework was most recently described in State v. Babso n, 355 Or 383, 391, 326 P3d 559, 566 (2014). 'Under the first category , the court begins by determining whether a law is \"written in terms directed to the substance of any 'opinion' or any 'subject' of communication.'' If it is, then the law is unconstitutional, unless the scope of the restraint is \"wholly confined within some historical exception Pet.App.283 that was well established when the first American guarantees of freedom of expression were adopted and that the guarantees then or in 1859 demonstrably were not intended to reach.\" If the law survives that inquiry, then the court determines whether the law focuses on forbidden effects and \"the proscribed means [of causing those effect s] include speech or writing,\" or whether it is \"directed only against causing the forbidden effects.\" If the law focuses on forbidden effects, and the proscribed means of causing those effects include expression, then the law is analyzed under the second Robertson category. Under that category, the court determines whether the law is overbroad, and, if so, whether it is capable of being narrowed. If, on the other hand, the law focuses only on forbidden effects, then the law is in the third Robertson category, and an individual can challenge the law as applied to that individual's circumstances.' (internal citations omitted) \"Robertson Category One \"In analyzing a law under Robertson 's first category, Oregon courts have looked to the text of the law to see whether it expressly regulates expression. Babson at 395. In Babson , the issue was the constitutionality of a gu ideline adopted by the Legislation Administration Committee ('LAC') that prohibited all overnight use of the capitol steps, including protests like defen dants' vigil. Defendants arid the LAC agreed that a person could violate the Pet.App.284 guideline without engaging in expressive acfivities, if, for example, a person us ed the steps as a shortcut while crossing the capitol grounds after 11 :00 p.m. when there were no hearings or floor sessions taking place. Id. at 396-97. The co urt held that the guideline was not unconstitutional under Robertson 's first category because it was not 'written in terms directed to the substance of any \"opinion\" or any \"subject\" of communication.' Id. ORS 659A.403, like the LAC guideline in Babson , is not \"written in terms directed to the substance of any 'opinion' or any \"subject\" of communication.\" Rather, it is a law focused on proscribing the pursuit or accomplishment of a forbidden result - in this case, discrimination by places of public accommodat ions against individuals belonging to specifically enumerated protected classes. As such, it is not susceptible to a Robertson category one facial challenge. \"Respondents argue that ORS 659A.403 expressly regulates expression because the word 'deny' in section (3) shows that, when properly interpreted, 'the statute prohibits communication that services are being denied for a prohibited reason, which implicates both speech and opinion.' (emphasis in original). Under Respondents' expansive interpretation, all laws implicating any form of communication whatsoev er would be facially unconstitutional under Article I, Section 8. This is not what the court held in Robertson and Babson . 57 57 See State v. Robertson 402, 416-417, 649 P.2d 569 (1982) above, article I, section 8, prohibits Pet.App.285 \"Based on the above, the forum concludes that ORS 659A403 is not subject to a Robertson category one Article I, Section 8 facial challenge. \"Robertson Category Two lawmakers from enacting restrict ions that focus on the content of speech or writing, either be cause that content itself is deemed socially undesirable or offensive, or because it is thought to have adverse consequences. ***It means that laws must focus on proscribing the pursuit or accomplishment of forbidden results rather than on the suppression of speech or writing either as an end in itse lf or as a means to some other legislative end.\") See also State v. Garcias , 296 Or 688,697,679 P.2d 1354, 1359 (1984) (menacin g statute held constitutional under Robertson category one analysis even though it prohibited threatening words because \"[t]he fact that the harm may be brought about by use of words, even by words unaccompanied by a physical act, does not alter the focus of the statute, which remains directed against attempts to cause an identified harm, rather than pr ohibiting the use of words as such\"); State v. Moyle 299 740 (1985)(statute criminalizing tele phonic or written threats held constitutional under Robertson category one analysis because \"the effect that it proscribes, causing fear of injury to persons or property_ merely mirrors a proh ibition of words themselves\"); City of Eugene v. Miller , 318 Or 480,489,871 P2d 454 (1994)(defendant, who sold joke books on the city sidewalk, was convicted of violating an ordi nance prohibiting vendors from selling merchandise on city si dewalks; ordinance held valid under first category of Robertson because it banned the sale of all expressive material on the sidewalk and therefore was content neutral); State v. Illig-Renn , 341 Or 228,237, 142 P3d 62 (2006)(\"[t]he fact that persons seek to convey a message by their conduct, that words accompany their conduct, or that the very reason for their conduct is expressive, does not transform prohibited conduct into protected expression or assembly\"). Pet.App.286 \"A law falls under the second category of Robertson if it is 'direc ted in terms against the pursuit of a forbidden effect' and 'the proscribed means [of causing that effect] include speech or writing.' Babson at 397, quoting Robertson at 417-18. Oregon courts examine a statute in the second category for 'overbreadth' to determine if 'the terms of [the] law exceed constitutional boundaries, purporting to reach conduc t protected by guarantees such as * * * [A]rticle I, section 8. * * * If a statute is overbroad, the court then must determine whether it can be interpreted to avoid such overbreadth.' Id. at 397-98, quoting Robertson at 410, 412. \"In State v. Illig Renn , 341 Or 228 (2006), the defendant challenged as 10 overbroad a statute that made it a crime to '[r]efuse[] to obey a lawful order by [a] peace officer' if the person knew that the person giving the order was a peace officer. In addressing the state's argument that the statute was not subject to an overbreadth challenge because it did not 'expressly' restrict expression, the court stated that a statute is subject to a faci al challenge under the first or second category of Robertson if it 'expressly or obviously proscribes expression,' leaving statutes with '[m]arginal and unforeseen applications to speech and expression' to as-applied challenges under the third category. 58 Illig-Renn , at 234. The court went on to state that facial challenges 58 The court referred to this type of statute as a \"speech- neutral\" statute, one that \"doe[s] not by its terms forbid particular forms of expression.\" Illig-Renn at 233-34. Pet.App.287 generally would not be permitted 'if the statute's application to protected sp eech [was] not traceable to the statute's express terms.' id. at 236. Based on that interpretation of Article I, section 8, the court concluded that the defendant could challenge the statute that prohibited interfering with a peace officer only as applied, und er the third category of Robertson, and not on its face, under the other two categories. Id. at 237. \"Respondents' argument resembles defendants' argument in Babson, which the court characterized in the following words: 'Defendants instead argue that, even if the [law] targets some harm-rather than targeting expression-the [law] has an \"obvious and foreseeable\" application to speech, and it is overbroad. That is, defendants argue that the text of the statute does not have to refer to expression or include expression as an element to fall under category two, as long as it has an obvious application to expression.' Babson at 398. The Babson court rejected this argument, stating: 'We agree with the state that the statement in Robertson on which defendants rely does not extend Article I, section 8, overbreadth analysis to every law that the legislature enacts. When expressi on is a proscribed means of causing the harm prohibited in a statute, it is apparent that the law will Pet.App.288 restrict expression in some way because expression is -an elemen t of the law. For that type of law, the legislature must narrow the law to eliminate apparent applications to protected expression. See Robertson , 293 Or. at 417-18, 649 P2d 569 (noting that when a law focused on harmful effects includes expression as a proscribed means of causing those effects, the court must determine whether the law \"appears to reach privileged communication\" (emphasis added)). However, if expression is not a proscribed means of causing harm, and is not described in the terms of the statute, the possible or plausible application of the statute to protected expression is less apparent. That is, in the former situation, every time the statute is enforced, expression will be implicated, leading to the possibility that the law will be considered overbroad; in the latter situation, the statute may never be enforced in a way that implicates expression, even if it is possible, or even apparent, that it could be applied to reach protected expression. When a law does not expressly or obviously refer to expression, the legislature is not required to consider all apparent applications of that law to protected expression and narrow the law to eliminate them. The court's statement in Robertson, on which defendants rely, does not extend the second category overbreadth analysis to statutes that do-not, by their terms, expressly or obviously refer to protected expression.' Pet.App.289 Id. at 400. The Babson court went on to explain that 'obviously,' as used in the last sentence of the above- quoted statement, did not 'extend Article I, section 8, scrutiny [under the first two Robertson categories] to any statute that could have an apparent application to speech; rather, the [Rob ertson] court used the word 'obviously' to make it clear that creative wording that does not refer directly to expression, but which could only be a pplied to expression, would be scrutinized under the first two categories of Robertson .' Id. at 403. The Babson court concluded its Robertson category two analysis by stating: 'Similarly, here, althou gh the guideline does not directly refer to speech, the guideline does have apparent applications to speech, as defendants contend. A restriction on use of the capitol steps will prevent people like defendants from protesting or otherwise engaging in expressive activities on the capitol steps overnight. That fact alone, however, does not subject the guideline to Article I, section 8, scrutiny under the second category of Robertson . The guideline is not simply a mirror of a prohibition on words. The guideline also bars skateboarding, sitting, sleeping, walking, storing equipment, and all other possible uses of the capitol steps during certain hours. Thus, because the guideline does no t expressly refer to expression as a means of causing some harm, and it does not \"obviously\" prohibit expression within the meaning of Moyle, it is not subject to an overbreadth challenge under the second category of Robertson .' Pet.App.290 Babson at 403-04. This case, like Babson and Illig- Renn , does not involve a statute that 'obviously' prohibits expression. Rather, it is a 'speech-neutral' statute as described in Illig-Renn .59 Furthermore, the legislature's use of the challenged word 'deny' in ORS 659A.403 is contextually similar to the challenged word 'refuse' in Illig-Renn, as both terms prohibit specific actions that may involve expression without specifying a particular form of expression. !n conclusion, the forum finds that ORS 659A.403 is not subject to Article I, sectio n 8 overbreadth scrutiny as set out in Robertson , category two. \"Robertson Category Three Does Not Apply to Respondents' claim of 'compelled speech.' \"Respondents contend th at their Article I, section 8, rights were violated by the Agency's application of ORS 659A.403 because that application, in requiring_ them to provide a wedding cake to Complainants, 'unlawfully compel[s] Respondents to engage in expression of a message they did not want to express.' The Robertson framework was developed in a series of cases involving prohibited speech, and there are no Oregon cases that have come to the forum's attention in 59 Cf State v. Babson , 355 Or 383,405, 326 P3d 559,566 (2014), quoting Miller at 489-90 (Robertson category two analysis did not apply because. contested ordinance \"was directed at a harm - street and sidewalk congestion - that the city legitimately could seek to prevent, and did not, 'by [its] terms, purport to proscribe sp eech or writing as a means to avoid a forbidden effect.\"') Pet.App.291 which compelled speech was the issue. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has addressed that issue in a line of cases involving the First Amendment and compelled speech. In the absence of Oregon case law, the forum turns to those decisions for guidance. \"As a preliminary matte r, the forum addresses Respondents' argument, made in their response to the Agency's cross-motions for summary judgment, that the 'forbidden effect' involved in a Robertson category three analysis of the constitutionality of ORS 659A.403 is 'Respondents' choice not to be involved in Complainants' same-sex ceremony, which is alleged to be a denial of services based on sexual orientation.' Respondents argue that their 'choice not to be involved' cannot be a 'forbidden effect' because Article XV, section 5a of the Oregon Constitution expressly prohibited legal recognition of same-sex marriages in January 2013, 60 making it 'clear [that] opposition to same-sex marriage is not a 'forbidden effect.\"' Respondents misread Babson, Robertson, and the statute. The 'forbidden effect' under ORS 659A.403 is not its impact on Respondents, but Respondents' denial of services to Complainants based on their sexual orientation. Respondents were not asked to issue a marriage license, perform a wedding ceremony, or in any way legally recognize Complainants' planned same-sex wedding in 60 In January 2013, Article X:v, section 5a, of the Oregon Constitution provided: \"It is the policy of Oregon, and its political subdivisions, that only a marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or legally recognized as a marriage.\" Pet.App.292 contravention of Article XV, Section 5a. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record, as submitted for summary judgment, that they communicated to Respondents where they intended to be married, that they in tended to be married in the state of Oregon, or, for that matter, that Complainants were ever married. 61 \"The right to refrain from speaking was established in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943), in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the State of West Virginia could not constitutionally require students to salute the American flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. The Court held that a state could not require 'affirmation of a belief and an attitude of mind,' noting that 'the right of freedom of thought protected by the First Amendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.' Id. at 633-34. \"In Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Tomi/lo , 418 U.S. 241 (1974), the Court considered whether a Florida statute that required newspapers that 'assailed' the 'perso nal character or official 61 The forum takes judicial not ice that a law granting full marriage rights for same-sex couples in the state of Washington, which is immediately adjacent to the State of Oregon and only separated from the City of Portland by the Columbia River, took effect on December 6, 2012.

Id. at 243. The Court found the statute was unconstitutional because it deprived the newspaper and its editors of the fundamental right to decide what to print or omit. Id. at 258. \"In 1977, the Court was asked to decide whether the State of New Hampshire could constitutionally enforce criminal sanctions against persons who covered the motto 'Live Free or Die' on their passenger vehicle license plates because that motto was repugnant to their mo ral and religious beliefs. Wooley v. Maynard , 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In its discussion of the nature of compelled speech, the Court noted that New Hampshire's statute 'in effect requires that appellees used their private property as a \"mobile billboard\" for the State's ideological message or suffer a penalt y' and that driving an automobile was a 'virtual necessity for most Americans.' Id. at 715. The Court found New Hampshire's statute unconst itutional, holding as follows: 'We are thus faced with the question of whether the State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an ideological message by displaying it on his private property in a manner and for the express purpose that it be observed and read by the public. We hold Pet.App.294 that the State may not do so.' Id. at 713. \"In 1986, the Court was asked to decide whether a regulated public utility company that had traditionally distributed a company newsletter in its quarterly billing statements was required to enclose newsletters published by TURN, a group expressing views opposite to the utility, in the same billing statements. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of California (\"PUC\"), 475 U.S. 1 (1986). The Court held that the PUC's requirement unconstitutionally compelled Pacific Gas to accommodate TURN's speech by requiring it to disseminate messages hostile to Pacific's own interests. Id. at 20-21. \"Hurley v. Irish-American GLIB , 515 U.S. 557 (1995), presented the question of whether private citizens in Massachusetts who organized a St. Patrick's Day parade were required to include GLIB, a group 'celebrat[ing] its me mbers' identity as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of the Irish immigrants,' thereby imparting a message that the organizers did not wish to convey among the marchers. Id. at 570. The requirement was based on a provision of Massachuse tts' public accommodation law that included a prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Court found that a parade is a form of expression, stating that a 'parade' indicates 'marchers who are making some sort of collective point, not just to each other but to bystanders along the wa y. Indeed, a parade's dependence on watchers is so extreme that Pet.App.295 nowadays, as with Bishop Berkeley's celebrated tree, \"if a parade or demonstration receives no media coverage, it may as well not have happened.\"' Id. at 568. The Court also determined that: '[GLIB]'s participation as a unit in the parade was equally expressive. GLIB was formed for the very purpose of marching in it, as the trial court found, in order to celebrate its members' identity as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of the Irish immigrants, to show that there are such individuals in the community, and to support the like men and v11omen who sought to march in the New York parade. The organization distributed a fact sheet describing the members' intentions, and the record otherwise corroborates the expressive nature of GLIB's participation. In 1993, members of GLIB ma rched behind a shamrock-strewn banner with the simple inscription \"Irish American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston.\" GLIB understandably seeks to communicate its ideas as part of the ex isting parade, rather than staging one of its own.' (internal citations omitted) Id. at 570. The Court further determined that '[s]ince every participating unit affects the message conveyed by the private or ganizers, the state courts' application of the statute produced an order essentially requiring petitioners to .alter the Pet.App.296 expressive content of their parade'62 and held the state's application of the statute unconstitutional because 'this use of the State's power violates the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.' Id. at 573. \"In Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. ('FAIR') , 547 U.S. 47 (2006), a group of law school associations objected to the application of the Solomon Amendment, which required campuses receivin g federal fund s to provide equal access to military recruiters. The Court held that there was no First Amendment violation, distinguishing Hurley , Tomi/lo , and Pacific Gas because in those cases 'the complaining speaker's own message was affected by the speech it was forced to accommodate' or 'interfere[d] with a speaker's desired message.' Id. at 63-64. The Court noted that '[c]ompelling a law school that sends scheduling emails for other recruiters to send one for a military recruiter is simply not the same as forcing a student to pledge allegiance, or forcing a Jehovah's Witness to display the motto 'Live Free or Die,' and it trivializes the freedom protected in Barnette and Wooley to suggest that it is.' Id. at 62. Of additional significance to this case, the Court stated: 'Nothing about recruiting suggests that law schools agree with any speech by recruiters, 62 Hurley v. Irish-American GLIB, 515 U.S. 557, 572-73 (1995). Pet.App.297 and nothing in the Solomon Amendment restricts what the law schools may say about the military's policies. We have held that high school students can appreciate the difference between speech a school sponsors and speech the school permits because legally required to do so, pursuant to an equal access policy.' Id. at 65. \"Wooley and Barnette do not support Respondents because Respondents are under no compulsion to publicly 'speak the government's message' 63 in an affirmative manner that demonstrates their support for same-sex marriage. Unlike the laws at issue in Wooley and Barnette, ORS 659A.403 does not require Respondents to recite or display any message. It only mandates that if Respondents operate a busine ss as a place of public accommodation, they cannot discriminate against potential clients based on their sexual orientation. Elane Photography at 64. \"Tomi/lo and Pacific Gas are distinctly different from this case. In both cases, the government commandeered a speaker's means of reaching its audience and required the speaker to disseminate an opposing point of view. Here, the state has not compelled Respondents to publish or distribute 63 Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. , 547 U.S. 47, 62 (2006). Pet.App.298 anything expressing a view. \"Hurley is distinguishable because Respondents' provision of a wedding cake for Complainants was not for a public event, but for a private event. Whatever message the cake conveyed was expressed only to Complainants and the persons they invited to their wedding ceremony, not to the public at large. In addition, the forum notes that, whether or not making a wedding cake may be expressive, the operation of Respondents' bakery, including Respondents' decision not to offer services to a protected class of persons, is not. Elane Photography at 68. \"Finally, Rumsfeld does not aid Respondents because it rejected the law schools' arguments that they were forced to speak the government's message and that they were required to host the recruiters' speech in a way that violated compelled speech principles. Rumsfeld at 64-65. \"For the reasons stated above, the forum concludes that the application of ORS 659A.403 to Respondents so as to require them to provide a wedding cake for Complainants does not constitute compelled speech that violates Article I, section 8 of the Oregon Constitution. \"United States Constitution \"First Amendment: Unlawfully infringing on Respondents' right to free speech. \"Respondents contend that the First Pet.App.299 Amendment to the U.

Constitution, as applied to the State of Oregon under the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits BOLI from enforcing the provisions of ORS 659A.403 against Respondents because that statute unlawfully infringes on Respondents' free speech rights. In pertinent part, the First Amendment provides: 'Congress shall make no law*** abridging the freedom of speech***.' \"Based on the discussion in the previous section, the forum concludes that the requirement in ORS 659A.403 that Respondents bake a wedding cake for Complainants is not 'compelled speech' that violates the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the U.

Respondents' motion is based on part on their assertion that (1) the 25 additional interrogatories they were allowed to serve on the Agency pursuant to my September 29, 2014, interim order that allowed Respondents to serve additi onal interrogatories as a potential means of eliminating the need for a deposition, (2) coupled with the Agency's responses to Respondents' prior interroga tories and the Agency's answers to the 25 additional interrogatories, (3) are inadequate to address Complainants' damages, leaving Respondents substan tially prejudiced as a result. \"On January 22, 2015, the Agency filed Pet.App.302 objections, arguing that Respondents' have not clearly articulated how they will be substantially prejudiced in the absence of depositions, that Complainants should not be subjected to depositions 'due to Respondents' inab ility to adequately craft their interrogatories,' and that 'discovery tactics are an abuse of process.' \"Discussion \"On October 14, 2014, the Agency complied with the forum's September 25, 2014, discovery order requiring the Agency to answer Respondents' August 5, 2014, interrogatory seeking a detailed explanation of Complainants' emotional, physical and mental suffering caused by Resp ondents' actions. The Agency's interrogatory response listed a total of 88 discrete types of harm suffered by Complainant Cryer and 90 discrete types of harm suffered by Complainant Bowman-Cryer. In support of their motion, Respondents argue that: '[The listed symptoms], some of which are inconsistent with each other, raise more questions than they answer. Respondents attempted to address some of these nearly 200 symptoms in their 25 interrogatories, but were unable to even begin to address the questions raised by this exhaustive list of symptoms, much less get clear answers from Complainants.' Among its objections to Respondents' motion for depositions, the Agency asserts that 'many of the listed symptoms are interrelated to one another and Pet.App.303 would hardly require Respondents to explore them individually.' The Agency further notes that Respondents will have an adequate opportuc1ity to 'cross-examine Complainan ts on all symptoms at hearing.' \"To more clearly illustrate the points raised by Respondents and the Agency, the types of harm alleged by each Complainant are reprinted below in their entirety. As will be seen, they permeate all aspects of Complainants' lives. Complainant Rachel Cryer '[88 listed] Complainant Laurel Bowman-Cryer '[90 symptoms listed] 839-050-0200(3) governs depositions in this forum. It provides: 'Depositions are strongly disfavored and will be allowed only when the requesting participant demonstrates that other methods of discovery are so inadequate that the participant will be su bstantially prejudiced by the denial of the motion to depose a particular witness.' \"Since OAR 839-050-0200(3) was adopted, the forum has been extremely reluctant to grant depositions, and has uniformly denied respondents' requests for depositions when respondents have not Pet.App.304 first sought informal discovery through interrogatories. See, e.g., In the Matter of Oak Harbor Freight Lines, Inc. , 33 BOLI 1 (2014), In the Matter of Columbia Components, Inc., 32 BOLI 257 (2013), In the Matter of Blachana, LLC , 32 BOLI 220 (2013), In the Matter of From the Wilderness, Inc. , 30 BOLI 227 (2009). The only occasion when the forum has allowed a deposition to take place was in the Columbia Components case, under the following circumstances: 'During the hearing it became clear that Complainant possessed documents either requested by Respondent and/or set out in the [ALJ's] discovery order that Complainant did not provide until Respondent was able to ascertain existence of those documents during Complainant's testimony*** [and] that Complainant had been less than forthcoming with regard to the existence of those documents.' \"In this case, Respondents have satisfied the forum's requirement of seeking discovery by means of informal request before requesting a deposition. Before initially requesting a deposition, Respondents made informal document discovery requests, requested admissions, and served 25 interrogatories on the Agency, all before Respondents received the Agency's interrogatory answer setting out the alleged 178 types of harm suffered by Complainants as a result of Respondents' actions. \"On September 25, 2014, the forum granted Respondents' motion to depose Complainants, with Pet.App.305 the scope of the depositions limited to 'Complainants' claim for damages.' That ru ling was predicated on my conclusion that Resp ondents '[had] sought informal discovery on the issue of damages through other methods and do not have adequate information on damages.' \"At a prehearing conference held on September 29, 2014, discovery was discussed at length. As noted earlier, it was agreed that Respondents would be allowed to serve 25 additional interrogatories on the Agency as a potential means of eliminating the need for a deposition. On October 14, 2014, the Agency sent Respondents its interrogatory response listing the 178 types of alleged harm. In the absence of depositions, that left 25 interrogatories for Respondents to explore those 178 listed harms. On December 31, 2014, Respondents served the interrogatories that were allowed in my September 29, 2014, ruling. The Agency timely responded on January 13, 2015. \"Since Respondents filed their motion on January 15, 2015, the Agency was granted summary judgment as to Respondents' alleged ORS 659A.403 violation. In the interim order granting summary judgment, I ruled that the only evidentiary issue at hearing will be the amount of damages, if any, to which Complainants are entitled. The amount of damages sought on Complainants' behalf is 'at ieast $75,000' for each Complainant. In addition, it appears from the Agency's February 3, 2015, filing in response to the forum's inquiry regarding a Protective Order sought by the Agency that the Agency may intend to present evidence at hearing Pet.App.306 that Complainants are-entitled to damages for mental and emotional suffering up to the present day, more than two years after the date of discrimination. \"I have reviewed prior BOLI Final Orders in which damages were awarded for emotional and mental suffering and find that this case stands well apart from all its predecessors in the exhaustive list of harms alleged by Complainants for which the Agency seeks damages. No other case comes even remotely close. In defending themselves, Respondents have a right to inquire into each type of harm alleged by Complainants to determine the extent of the harm and whether Complainants' physical, mental, and emotional suffering was caused, at least in part, if not in whole, by events and circumstances that were unrelated to Aaron Klein's ORS 659A.403 violation. Based on the sheer number and variety of types of alleged harm, there is no practical way Respondents can accomplish an effective inquiry using inte rrogatories. I find that Respondents will be substanti ally prejudiced if they are not allowed to de pose Complainants. \"Based on the above, Respondents' motion to depose Complainants is GRANTED , with the following limitations: '1. Respondents are allowed a maximum of three hours, not counting breaks, to question each Complainant. '2. The Agency may choose where the depositions are to be conducted and is Pet.App.307 instructed to cooperate in making Complainants available for deposition as- soon as practical, given that the hearing is scheduled to begin next month. If the Agency and Respondents cannot agree on a date, they are instructed to contact me and I will choose a date. I do not intend to postpone this hearing again because of a discovery issue. '3. Respondents are responsible for any costs associated with conducting the deposition. Respondents and Agency must each pay for their own copy of the transcript if a transcript is prepared. '4. Respondents and the Agency are ordered to notify me at least seven days in advance of the date and time for the depositions so that I can be available if necessary. As of today, the only dates I will be unavailable between now and March 1 are the afternoon of February 11 and all day February 16. 5. The scope of Respondents' questioning is limited to damages. Respondents may not engage in a fishing expedition by inquiring into matters totally irrelevant to the issue of physical, emotional, and mental suffering. (Ex. X72) 31) On February 11, 2015, \"in view of the national attention and attendant publicity these cases have already received and the likelihood that Pet.App.308 Complainants will be ques tioned about the protected health information in the records produced under the protective order,\" the ALJ issued a protective order regarding Complainants' depositions. The order prohibited the deposition transcripts or notes made of the deposition testimony from being made available to \"non-qualified\" persons or from being used \"for any other purpos e than the preparation for litigation of [the] proceeding.\" (Ex. X74) 32) On February 17, 2015, Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration of the ALJ's ruling on summary judgment. The AL J denied Respondents' motion. (Exs. X73, X75, X79) 33) On February 23, 2015, the Agency issued Second Amended Formal Charges in both cases. Respondents filed answers on February 27, 2015. (Exs. X78, X82) 34) Respondents and Agency timely submitted case summaries. (Exs. X76, 77) 35) On February 26, 2015, Respondents filed a motion for discovery sanctions that was opposed by the Agency. On March 5, 2015, the ALJ ruled on Respondents' motion as follows: \"On February 26, 2015, Respondents filed a motion requesting discovery sanctions related to the Agency's failure to provide discovery subject to my Discovery Order dated September 25, 2014, until February 24, 2015. The Agency filed a response on February 27, 2015, and Respondents Pet.App.309 supplemented their motion on March 3, 2015. \"The discovery in question relates to my September 25, 2014, Order requiring that the Agency provide Respondents with: 'all posting by Complainants to any social media website, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln, MySpace, lnstagram, and SnapChat from January 2013 to the present that contain comments about the facts of this case, comments about Respondents, or comments that relate to their alleged damages.' \"Specifically, Respondents allege that on February 24, 2015, less than three hours before the Agency filed its case su mmary, the Agency turned over 109 pages of documents ('subject documents') to Respondents that were subject to my discovery order. Respondents further allege that the 109 pages were-included in the Agency's case summary. The Agency does not dispute these alle gations, acknowledges ii received the subject documents from Complainants in August 2014, and attempts to explain the reason for its late disclosure in its response. After reviewing the subject documents, I conclude that they contain Complainants' social media conversations that fall within the scope of my September 25, 2014, Discovery Order. \"Respondents allege that the Agency's untimely disclosure of these documents establishes bad faith on the part of the Agency and/or Complainants, Pet.App.310 particularly since the di sclosure occurred after Respondents completed their depositions of Complainants, and that Re spondents are irreparably prejudiced as a result. Respondents ask that the forum sanction the Agency in a number of different ways. \"In my September 25, 2014, Discovery Order, I ruled as follows: 'After the scheduled September 29, 2014, prehearing conference in this matter, the forum will issue a subsequent order stating the Agency's deadline for complying with the terms of this order. The Agency has a continuing obligation, through the close of the hearing, to provide Respondents' counsel with any newly discovered material that responds to the responses and production ordered in this interim order. The Agency's failure to comply with this order may result in the sanction described in OAR 839-050-0200(11).' In the interim order I issued on September 30, 2014, that summarized the September 29, 2014, prehearing conference, I ordered that \"[!]he Discovery ordered in my rulings on*** Respondents' motions for Discovery Orders must be mailed or hand-delivered no later th an October 14, 2014.\" That was not done. \"As a prelude to my ruling, I note that the forum has no authority to impose the vast majority of sanctions sought by Respondents. The forum's-Pet.App.311 authority in this matter is not derived from the ORCP, but from provisions in the Oregon APA, the Oregon Attorney General's Administrative Rules (OAR 137-003-0000 to -0092), and the forum's own rules, OAR 839-050-000 et seq. The ALJ's authority to impose sanctions for violations of discovery orders is set out in OAR 839-050- 0020(11):^ 'The administrative law judge may refuse to admit evidence that has not been disclosed in response to a discovery order or subpoena, unless the participant that failed to provide discovery shows good ca use for having failed to do so or unless excluding the evidence would violate the duty to conduct a full and fair inquiry under ORS 183.415(10) 64. If the administrative law judge admits evidence that was not disclosed as ordered or subpoenaed, the administrative law judge may grant a continuance to allow an opportunity for the other participant(s) to respond.\" In brief, the Agency frankly admits that it 'cannot determine why the [subject records] were not produced [earlier] in discovery, but they were in a location unlikely to be accessed' and characterizes its 'oversight' as an 'inadverte nt error.' The Agency also notes, in a supporting declaration by * * * the 64 This statutory reference in the current rule is in error. The APA was amended in 2007 and the \"full and fair inquiry\" requirement was moved to ORS 183.417(8). Pet.App.312 Agency's Chief Prosecutor, th at '[i]t appears that on or about October 3, 2014, in anticipation of discovery, the subject documents were partially redacted. I have no other recollection as to why they were not provided in discovery.' \"OAR 839-050-0020(16) provides: \"'Good cause\" means, unless otherwise specifically stated, that a participant failed to perform a required act due to an excusable mistake or a circumstance over which the participant had no contro l. \"Good cause\" does not include a lack of knowledge of the law, including these rules.' For the reasons stated below, the forum concludes that the Agency's failure to provide the subject records by October 14, 2014, as ordered by the forum, does not meet the 'good cause' standard. Participants in all cases aFe responsible for keeping track of documents that constitute potential evidence, particularly documents subject to an existing discovery order. In this ca se, the subject records were accessed by BOLI's Administ rative Prosecutions Unit on October 3, 2014, eight days after a discovery order was issued requiring the pr oduction of those records, and only 11 days before their production was due pursuant to the forum's September 30, 2014, order. The Agency's 'oversight' or storage of the documents in a place where they were 'unlikely to be accessed' does not constitute 'an excusable mistake or a circumstance over which the [Agency] had no control.' Pet.App.313 \"Ordinarily, the forum's sanction for failing_ to provide documents pursuant to a discovery order would be to prohibit the introduction of the documents as evidence.^ However, Respondents assert that some of the subject records will potentially assist Respondents' defense and explain why in their motion. Based on Respondents' assertion, it appears that a blanket prohibition on the introduction of the subj ect records may prejudice Respondents and prevent a 'full and fair inquiry' by the forum. The forum's order is crafted with this in mind. \"ORDER \"1. Sanctions : (a) The Agency may not offer or otherwise utilize any of the subject documents as evidence until such time as Respondents have offered the subject documents into evidence or otherwise utilized them during the hearing while eliciting testimony in support of their case; (b) Respondents, should they elect to do so , may offer or utilize the subject documents in support of their case. \"2. Discovery Order \"To the extent these records have not already been provided, the forum he reby issues a discovery order requiring the Agency to provide responsive documents to items ##1, 5-6, 8, 13- 15, and 21 listed on pages 9 and 10 of Respondents' Motion for Discovery Sanctions, with the caveat that the Agency is not required to produc e statements made to Ms. Gaddis or Ms. Casey, the Agency's administrative prosecutors in this case, in any response to item #5. Pet.App.314 The Agency's responsibility to produce any such records begins as soon as this order is issued and continues until the hearing is concluded. The forum will apply OAR 839-050-0020(11) if an issue arises regarding an alleged failure by the Agency to produce such records in a timely manner. \"3. Respondents' request that the forum dismiss the Agency's Second Amended Formal Charges is DENIED . \"4. Respondents may amend their Case Summary witness list and exhibit list. * * *\" \"5. Respondents' request to 'reopen discovery to allow for depositions of Complainants and other BOLI witnesses with knowledge of these matters' is DENIED . \"6. Respondents' request that the cases be dismissed or that the Agen cy's claim for damages of Complainants' behalf be dismissed is DENIED . \"7. Respondents' request for costs is DENIED . \"8. Respondents' request for any other sanctions not specifically discussed in this interim order is DENIED .\" (Exs. X81, X83, X86, X87) 36) The general public was allowed to attend the hearing. Because of this and potential security issues, the ALJ issued guidelines prior to the hearing that, among other things: prohibited the public from Pet.App.315 bringing backpacks, briefc ases, satchels, carrying cases any type, or handbags into the building in which the hearing was held ; prohibited the use of audio recorders and cameras, including cell phone cameras and recorders; and required cell phones to be turned off during the hearing. (Ex. X85; Statement of ALJ) 37) At the start of the hearing, the ALJ orally advised the Agency and Respondents of the issues to be addressed, the matters to be proved, and the procedures governing the conduct of the hearing. (Statement of ALJ) 38) During the hearing, the Agency offered Exhibits A24and A26. Respon dents objected to their admission and the ALJ reserved ruling on their admissibility for the Prop osed Order. Respondents objected on the basis of rele vancy. Exhibits A24 and A26 are received because they are relevant to show the impact that the media exposure spawned by this case had on Complainan ts. (Exs. A24, A26) 39) During the hearing, the ALJ stated he would consider LBC's testimony about the \"handfasting cord\" used in LBC's and RBC's commitment 65 ceremony as an offer of proof and rule on its admissibility in the Propos ed Order. That testimony 65 The forum uses the term \"commitment\" because the handfasting cord was used in Complainants' June 27, 2013, ceremony at the West End Ballroom, when same-sex marriage was not yet permitted in the state of Oregon Pet.App.316 is admitted because it is not evidence that was required to be disclosed by the ALJ's discovery orders and it is relevant to show the extent of Complainants' commitment to their relationship. (Testimony of LBC; Statement of ALJ) 40) On March 16, after the Agency had concluded its case-in-chi ef, Respondents filed a motion for an order to Dismiss or Reopen Discovery and Keep Record Open. Respondents argued that this was necessary in order: \"to allow Respondents a full and fair opportunity to reopen discovery concerning possible undisclosed collusion among Complainants, Basic Rights Oregon and/or the Agency in light of the testimony of Agency witness Aaron Cryer elicited at the hearing on Friday, March 13, 2015.\" The ALJ allowed Respondents and the Agency fo present oral argument on Respondents' motion when the hearing re-convened on March 17, 2015, then denied Respondents' motion. (Ex. X94; Statement of ALJ) 41) Respondents called AK, MK, and RBC as witnesses in support of their case in chief. At the conclusion of RBC's testimony on March 17, 2015, Respondents' counsel Grey made the following statement: \"That's all of the witnesses that we have to present at this time. However, for purposes of the record I'd like to make it clear that Pet.App.317 Respondents did not intend to rest their case in chief for the reasons we discussed in connection with the motion that we presented this morning, which the forum denied. So simply for purposes of the record, we are not planning on closing our case in chief.\" (Statement of Grey) 42) On May 28, 2015, Respondents filed a motion to Reopen the Contested Case Record. The Agency filed a response on June 2, then supplemented its response on June 5, 2015. On June 22, 2015, the ALJ issued an interim order that-denied Respondents' motion. The ALJ's ruling is reprinted in its entirety below: \"Pursuant to OAR 839-050-0410, Respondents filed a motion to reopen the contested case record on May 29, 2015. \"OAR 839-050-0410 provides: 'On the administrative law judge's own motion or on the motion of a participant, the administrative la w judge will reopen the record when the administrative law judge determines additional evidence is necessary to fully and fairly adjudicate the case. A participant requesting that the record be reopened to offer additional evidence must show good cause for not having provided the evidence before the record closed.' Pet.App.318 \"Good cause\" means: '[U]nless otherwise specifically stated, that a participant failed to perform a required act due to an excusable mistake or a circumstance over which the participant had no control. \"Good cause\" does not include a lack of knowledge of the law, including these rules.' OAR 839-050- 0020(16). Respondents' motion, like their earlier motion to Disqualify BOLI Commissioner Brad Avakian, is predicated on their argument that Commissioner Avakian's alleged bias 'has effectively precluded Respondents from receiving due process in this case.' \"In support of their motion, Respondents attached documentation of the following: (1) emails beginning April 11, 2014, and ending January 31, 2015, primarily containing conversations between Charlie Burr, BOLI's Communications Director and Strategy Works NW, LLC, Basic Rights of Oregon ('BRO'), and Senator Jeff Merkley's office, that were forwarded to Respondents' counsel by email by on May 20, 2015, by Kelsey Harkness, a reporter for the Daily Signal, pursuant to a public records request made by Harkness (the 'Harkness records'); (2) testimony of both Rachel and Laurel Bowman-Cryer from their February 17, 2015, depositions; and (3) selected hearing testimony of Aaron Cryer, brother of Complainant Rachel Bowman-Cryer. Respondents contend that the above shows 'hitherto undisclosed collusion between complainants, BOLI and Basic Rights Oregon*** sufficient to taint the integrity of Pet.App.319 the proceedings and deny Respondents fundamental due process or a fair hearin g\" and 'unfairly prejudice Respondents['] rights herein. \"Specifically, Respondents ask that the record be reopened so that they can: \"(1) Depose Aaron Cryer; \"(2) Request, obtain and review additional documents from BOLI, BRO, and others and to issue interrogatories through subpoena duces tecum upon non-participants including but not limited to Commissioner Brad Avakian, the Commissioner's assistant Jesse Bontecou, Charlie Burr, Jeanna Frazzini, Amy Ruiz, Diane Goodwin, Emily McLain, Joe LeBlanc and Maura Roche, all of whom are identified in the emails provided to Respondents by Harkness; \"(3) Depose Roche; and \"(4) Depending on the information obtained, renew their motion to disqualify the Commissioner \"and other BOLI personnel shown to have been involved in this political agenda from any role in deciding the case.\" On June 2, 2015, the Agency timely filed a response to Respondents' motion, then supplemented it with an amended response on June 5, 2015. Pet.App.320 \"Discussion \"Under OAR 839-050-0410, Respondents have the burden of showing 'g ood cause' within the meaning of OAR 839-050-0020(16) for reopening the contested case record. To show good cause, Respondents must demonstrate an excusable mistake or a circumstance over which Respondents had no control. The excusable mistake or circumstances over Resp ondents had no control means 'there must be a superseding or intervening event which prevents timely compliance.' In the Matter of Ashlanders Se nior Foster Care, Inc. , 14 BOLI 54,61-62 (1996), citing In the Matter of City of Umatilla , 9 BOLI 91 (1990), affirmed without opinion, City of Umatilla v. Bureau of Labor and Industries , 110 151, 821 P2d 1134 (1991). The mistaken act or failure to act is excusable if a party mistakenly acts or fails to act due to being misled by facts or circumstances that would mislead a reasonable person under similar circumstances. Ashlanders , citing In the Matter of 60 Minute Tune , 9 BOLI 191 (1991), affirmed without opinion, Nida v. Bureau of Labor and lndustries ., 119 Or App 174, 822 P2d 974 (1993). The forum examines the three different types of supporting documentation provided by Respondents against these standards. A. The Harkness Records \"The emails provided to Respondents by Harkness are dated April 11, 2014, to January 31, 2015, well before the hearing began. Respondents do not assert that BOLI did not cooperate promptly in providing these documents to Harkness when she Pet.App.321 made her public records request. Respondents' June 18, 2014, motion to disqualify Commissioner Avakian due to bias makes it apparent that Respondents considered the Commissioner's alleged bias to be a relevant issue at least nine months before the hearing began. Despite this, there is no evidence in the record that Respondents made a discovery request or public records re quest for the records that were provided to Harkness. This is a circumstance that was under Respondents' control, and Respondents provide no explanation for their own failure to make a pre-hearing request for these records that they now claim are relevant and probative of the Commissioner's bias. In addition, Respondents have failed to show a superseding or intervening event that prevented them obtaining the Harkness Records before the hearing or that they were misled by facts or circumstances that would mislead a reasonable person under similar circumstances. Accordingly, the forum concludes that Respondents have not shown good cause for their failure to pursue the_ Harkness records before the hearing and offer them as evidence at hearing. 66 66 There are no Commissioner's Final Orders interpreting \"good cause\" in the context of a motion to reopen a contested case proceeding. Besides Ashlanders , City of Umatilla , and 60 Minute Tune , there have been numerous Final Orders interpreting the definition of \"good cause\" in OAR 839-050- 0020(16) in other contexts. None of them support Respondents' claim that their supporting docu mentation shows \"good cause.\" Cf. In the Matter of From the Wilderness, Inc ., 30 BOLI 227,240 (2009) (when respondents sought a postponement so they could complete discovery and responde nts' previous motion for a postponement had been granted to give respondents' newly Pet.App.322 retained attorney time to prepare for the hearing, respondents delayed three months after the forum granted the first postponement before seeking discovery, the agency was not responsible for respondent's delay, and respondents' need for an another postponement could have been obviated if respondents had timely sought discovery, the forum denied respondents' motion, finding that respondents had not shown \"good cause\"); In the Matter of Loga n International, Ltd. , 26 BOLI 254, 257-58 (2005)(the ALJ denied respondent 's motion to reset the hearing based on the agency's alleged failure to provide complete discovery, stating that respon dent had not established \"good cause\" because it had not shown that the agency had withheld discoverable information nor that respondent was entitled to a deposition of the complainant); In the Matter of Orion Driftboat and Watercraft Company , LLC, 26 BOLI 137, 139 (2005) (when respondents moved-for a postpo nement 12 days before the hearing date based on respondents' need to be represented by an attorney and current inability to afford an at torney, because the agency had refused to accept respondents' settlement offers, and because respondents needed more time to_ file a discovery order, the agency objected on the basis that it had lined up its witnesses and was prepared to proceed, and because respondents had agreed three mont hs earlier to the date set for hearing and the forum denied respondents' motion because respondents had not shown good cause); In the Matter of Adesina Adeniji , 25 BOLI 162, 164-65 (2004) (respondent's failure to comply with discovery order because he believed the case would settle and because he had provided some of the documents subject to discovery or der exhibits with his answer was not \"good cause\" and the ALJ sustained the agency's objection to respondent's attempted reliance at hearing on exhibits subject to discovery order that were not provided before hearing); In the Matter of Barbara Coleman , 19 BOLI 230, 238- 39 (2000)(respondent's attorney's assertion that respondent's medical condition of depression made it difficult for her to gather information did not present good cause for postponement of the hearing when \"nothing fi led with this forum * * * comes close to establishing that respondent is legally incompetent, and respondent has made no such clai m. As the forum stated in [an Pet.App.323 earlier] order, respondent spoke lucidly and logically during the** * teleconference, stated that she was able to work at her business several hours each day, and was able to recall details of events that occurred many months ago'?; In the Matter of Sabas Gonzalez , 19 BOLI 1, 5- 6 (1999)(respondent's motion for postponement, based in part on a scheduling conflict of respondent's counsel, was denied based on respondent's failure to show good cause when there was no evidence that the matter on respondent's counsel's schedule that conflicted with the hearing had been set before the notice of hearing issued in this case and respondent's counsel kne w of the possible conflict for weeks before filing the motion and did not respond to the attempts the agency made at that time to resolve the conflict); In the Matter of Troy R. Johnson , 17 BOLI 285, 287-88 (1999) (respondent's motion to postpone the hearing was denied based on respondent's failure to show good cause when respondent based his motion on assertions that he had not received the notice of hearing until one week before a scheduled hearing date and did not have time to prepare for the hearing, but his delay in receiving the notice of hearing was due to his failure to notify the forum of his change of address; he was out of town on a hunting trip; and he was amazed the case had been set for hearing); In the Matter of Jewel Schmidt, 15 BOLI 236, 237 (1997) (when respondent requested a postponement of the hearing because she had an adult care home and could not find a relief person for the date of hearing or successive days, and the agency opposed the request because it was ready to proceed and had subpoenaed witnesses, the ALJ denied the request because respondent had not shown good cause for a postponement, noting that there were over 30 days between the date the notice of hearing was issued and the date of the scheduled hearing, and this shou ld have been ample time to find a relief person for the ex pected one-day hearing). Compare In the Matter of Computer Products Unlimited, Inc. , 31 BOLI 209, 212-13 (2011) (respondent's motion for postponement granted based on emergency medical treatment required by the wife of respondent's authorized representative that could not be put off ); In the Matter of Spud Cellar Deli, Inc. , 31 BOLI 106, 111 (2010) (forum granted the ag ency's motion for a hearing Pet.App.324 B. Complainants' Deposition Testimony \"Respondents allege that Aaron Cryer's testimony and the Harkness records show that Complainants' deposition testimony is not credible regarding their alleged 'collusion' with BOLI 'in using this case against Respondents for a political agenda rather than a good faith claim for recovery of damages to Complainants.' This is merely a repeat of Respondents' March 16, 2015, argument made in their Motion to Dismiss or Reopen Discovery and Keep Record Open that the ALJ denied at hearing. The deposition testimony given by Complainants postponement based on the fact that respondent's counsel had been traveling out of state due to a death in her family and was unable to adequately prepare for hearing); In the Matter of Northwestern Title Loans LLC , 30 BOLI 1, 3, (2008) (forum granted respondent's motion for postponement based on unavailability of respondent's key witness on the date set for hearing); In the Matter of Captain Hooks, LLP , 27 BOLI 211, 213 (2006) (respondent's motion for postponement granted based on respondent's documented emergency medical condition); In the Matter of SQDL Co ., 22 BOLI 223, 227-28 (2001) (when respondent retained substitute counsel after its original counsel was suspended from the practice of law and substitute counsel filed a motion for postponement five days before the hearing based on the complexity of the case and his corresponding need for more time to prepare for the hearing, the ALJ concluded that responde nt had shown good cause and granted the motion); In the Matter of Ann L. Swanger , 19 BOLI 42, 44 (1999)(respondent's moti on for postponement, based on the fact that respondent would be having major dental surgery the day before the hearing was set to commence, making it extremely difficult for her to attend or communicate at the hearing, was granted). Pet.App.325 that Respondents now argue justifies reopening the case was given on February 17, 2015, almost a month before the hearing commenced. In their depositions, Complainants were asked questions and gave answers regarding Jeanna Frazzini, Amy Ruiz, BRO, and their involvement with Frazzini, Ruiz, and BRO, as reflected in the attachments to Exhibit X94. Despite that deposition testimony, there is no evidence that Respondents attempted to follow up on the collusion that Respondents now alleges existed between these individuals, Complainants, BRO, and BOLI. Further, Respondents could have questioned Complainants about Cryer's testimony in their case-in-chief but did not do so. These opportunities were both circumstances that were under Respondents' control. Likewise, Respondents have not shown a superseding or intervening event that prevented them from pursuing furt her discovery before the hearing based on Complainants' deposition testimony or that they were misled by facts or circumstances that would mislead a reasonable person under similar circumstances. Accordingly, Respondents have not estab lished good cause to support their argument that Complainants' deposition testimony, coupled with Aaron Cryer's hearing testimony and the Harkness records, constitute grounds for reopening the contested case record to pursue the a dditional discovery that Respondents seek in this motion. C. Aaron Cryer's Testimony \"Respondents' proffered characterization of Cryer's quoted testimony as 'directly implicat[ing] BOLI and Complainants in using this case against Pet.App.326 Respondents for a political agenda rather than a good faith claim for recovery of damages to Complainants' is simply inaccurate. As noted above, Respondents were aware of communications between Complainants, BRO, BOLI, Frazzini, and Ruiz before the hearing, but elected not to pursue the defense they now assert by requesting additional discovery or by calling Complainants as witnesses in their case in chief to explore the alleged political agenda. This was a choice made by Respondents' legal team, not a circumstance beyond Respondents' control, and Respondents have not shown any superseding or intervening event that prevented them seeking additional discovery or that they were misled by facts or circumstances that wo uld mislead a reasonable person under similar circumstances. Accordingly, Cryer's testimony that Respondents rely on is not good cause within the meaning of OAR 839-050-0410 and OAR 839-050-0020(16). D. The Additional Evidence Sought by Respondents is Unnecessary to Fully and Fairly Adjudicate This Case \"Notwithstanding the lack of 'good cause,' the forum also concludes that additional evidence on the issues raised in Respondent's motion is unnecessary to fully and fairly adjudica te this case, as the forum has fully and carefully cons idered and ruled on these matters, which are incorporated herein and made a part hereof by this reference. See Ex. X12 (ALJ's July 2, 2014, Interim Order entitled Ruling on Respondents' Election to Remove Cases to Circuit Pet.App.327 Court and Alternative Motion to Disqualify BOLI Commissioner Brad Avakian).67 \"Furthermore, since these prior rulings the Oregon Court of Appeals issued an opinion in Columbia Riverkeeper v. Clatsop County , 267 Or App 578, 341 P3d 790 (2014) that supports those rulings. Respondents' earlier motion s sought to disqualify Commissioner Avakian due to 'actual bias.' In Columbia , Huhtala, a Clatsop County Commissioner, ran for election on the platform of not allowing a LNG business to be establi shed in Astoria, then voted to deny in a land use decision that denied a pipeline company's application to build an LNG pipeline originating in Astoria. Prior to his election, Huhtala had made many pu blic statements opposing construction of an LNG pipeline. In reversing the Land Use Board of Appeals' (LUBA) decision that 67 Cf. In the Matter of Mo untain Forestry, Inc ., 29 BOLI 11, 48-50 (2007), affirmed without opinion, Mountain Forestry, Inc. v. Bureau of Labor and Industries , 229 Or App 504, 213 P3d 590 (2009) (when respondent s moved to reopen the record to admit a federal audit that purportedly showed the prevalence of records discrepancies througho ut the firefighting industry and that the Oregon Department of Forestry did not have specific training requiremen ts prior to 2003, and that purportedly negated certain inferences drawn from witness testimony, the forum found that, notwithstanding respondents' failure to submit an affidavit showing they had no knowledge of the audit prior to its release in March 2006, the audit did not contain any information relevant to the issues in the case or that mitigated respondents' violations and therefore the additional evidence was not ne cessary to fully and fairly adjudicate the case). Pet.App.328 Huhtala's bias had deprived the pipeline company of an impartial tribunal, the court stated: 'All told, no single case in Oregon establishes what is necessary for a party to prove actual bias by an elected official in quasi-judicial land-use proceedings such as this one. Generally, we can glean the following. The bar for disqualification is high; no published case has concluded that disqualification was required in quasi-judicial land-use pr oceedings. An elected local official's 'intense involvement in the affairs of the community' or 'political predisposition' is not grounds for disqualification. Involvement with other governmental organizations that may have an interest in the decision does not require disqualification. An elected local official is not expected to have no appearance of having views on matters of community interest when a decision on the matter is to be made by an adjudicatory procedure. ' In addition to those general observations, there are three salient principles from the case law that define and drive our analysis in this case. First, the scope of the \"matter\" and \"question at issue\" is narrowly limited to the specific decision that is before the tribunal. Second, because of the nature of elected local officials making decisions in quasijudicial proceedings, the bias must be actual, not merely apparent. And third, the substantive standard for actual bias is that Pet.App.329 the decision maker has so prejudged the particular matter as to be incapable of determining its merits on the basis of the evidence and arguments presented.' Columbia Riverkeeper at 602-03. \"Under this standard, no ne of the \"evidence\" that Respondents have proff ered previously or in support of their Motion to Reopen the Contested Case Record is probative to show \"actual bias\" on Commissioner Avakian's part. Therefore, notwithstanding the lack of \"good cause\" shown for not providing the proffered \"evidence\" before the record closed, the Motion is denied on the merits. E. Conclusion \"Respondents' motion to Reopen the Contested Case Record is DENIED .\" 43) On April 24, 2015, the ALJ issued a proposed order that notified the participants they were entitled to file exceptions to the proposed order within ten days of its issuance. The Agency and Respondents both timely filed exceptions. 44) Respondents' exceptions are DENIED in their entirety as lackin g merit.

In addition, the FormalCharges alleged that Aaron Klein aided and abettedMelissa Klein in the commission of those violations. Inthis Final Order, the Commissioner concludes that:(1) A. Klein, acting on behalf of Sweetcakes by Melissa,refused to make a wedding cake for Complainantsbased on their sexual orientation, thereby violatingORS 659A.403; (2) M. Klein did not violate ORS659A.403; and (3) A. Klein did not aid and abet M.Klein in violation of ORS 659A.406. The Commissionerreversed the ALJ's ruling on summary judgmentmotions that neither A. nor M. Klein violated ORS659A.409 and held that both A. and M. Klein violatedORS 659A.409. The Commissioner held that, aspartners, A. Klein and M. Klein are jointly andseverally liable for all violations.

The above-entitled case came on regularly for hearing before Alan McCullough, designated asAdministrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") by Brad Avakian,Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industriesfor the State of Oregon. The hearing was held at theOffice of Administrative Hearings, located at 7995 S.W. Mohawk Street, Entrance B, Tualatin, Oregon.

FINDINGS OF FACT - THE MERITS2 1)\u0001LBC and RBC are both homosexual females. \u0001 They met in 2004 while they attended the same college \u0001 and considered themselves a \"couple\" for the 11 years \u0001 preceding the hearing. They lived together in Texas \u0001 until 2009, when they moved to Portland, Oregon, and \u0001 have lived together continuously since moving to \u0001 Portland. (Testimony of LBC, RBC, McPherson) 2)\u0001LBC first asked RBC to marry her soon after \u0001 they met and was turned down. LBC continued to \u0001 propose on a regular basis until October 2012, when \u0001 RBC finally agreed to marry her. (Testimony of RBC, \u0001 LBC) 3)\u0001Before October 2012, RBC did not want to get \u0001 married because of her personal experience of failed \u0001 marriages that \"tended to do more damage than good.\" \u0001 (Testimony of RBC, LBC, McPherson) 1 The Ultimate Findings of Fact required by OAR 839-050- 0370(1)(b)(B) are subsumed within the Findings of Fact - TheMerits. 2 Except for Finding of Fact #43 - The Merits, the findings of fact relevant to the forum's determination of whether Respondentsviolated ORS 659A.403, ORS 659A.406, and ORS 659A.409 are setout in the forum's ruling on Respondents' Renewed Motion forSummary Judgment and the Agency's Cross-Motion for SummaryJudgment. See Finding of Fact #28 - Procedural, supra . They are duplicated in these Findings of Fact - The Merits only to theextent necessary to provide context to Complainants' claim for damages.Pet.App.3394)\u0001In November 2011, Complainants became foster parents for \"E\" and \"A,\"3 two disabled children with very high special needs, after the death of their mother,LBC's best friend. At the time, Complainants were already the children's godparents. When they becamethe children's foster parents, Complainants decidedthat they wanted to adopt the children. Subsequently,Complainants became involved in a bitter andemotional custody battle for the children with thechildren's great-grandparents that continued untilsometime after December 2013, when Complainants'December 2013 adoption application was formallyapproved by the state of Oregon. 4 (Testimony of LBC, RBC, McPherson) 5) In October 2012, RBC decided that she and LBC should get married in order to give their foster children\"permanency and commitment\" by showing them howmuch she and LBC loved one another and werecommitted to one another. RBC told LBC that shewanted to get married, which made LBC \"extremelyhappy.\" After her long-standing matrimonial reticence,RBC then became excited to get married and to startplanning the wedding, wanting a wedding that was as\"big and grand\" as they could afford. (Testimony ofRBC, LBC) 3 The forum uses the children's first name initials instead of their full names to protect their privacy. 4 Although it is undisputed that Complainants eventually adopted the children, there is no evidence as to what date the adoptionswere finalized.Pet.App.3406)\u0001Sometime between October 2012 and January 17, 2013, RBC and Cheryl McPherson (\"CM\"), RBC'smother, attended a Portland bridal show. MK had abooth at the show to advertise wedding cakes made bySweetcakes by Melissa (\"Sweetcakes\"). Two yearsearlier, Sweetcakes had designed, created, anddecorated a wedding cake for CM and RBC that RBCreally liked. At the show, RBC and CM visitedSweetcakes's booth and told MK they would like toorder a cake from her. After the show, RBC made anappointment via email for a cake tasting atSweetcakes. (Testimony of RBC, CM, MK; Ex. R16) 7) Complainants were both excited about the cake tasting at Sweetcakes because the cake Respondentshad made for CM's wedding had been so good and RBCwanted to order a cake like CM's cake. (Testimony ofRBC, A. Cryer) 9) On January 17, 2013, RBC and CM visited Sweetcakes's bakery shop in Gresham, Oregon for theircake tasting appointment, intending to order a cake for RBC's wedding to LBC. (Respondents' Admission;Affidavit of AK; Testimony of RBC, CM, AK) 9) In January 2013, AK and MK were alternately caring for their infant twins at their home. At the timeof the tasting, MK was at home and AK conducted thetasting. During the tasting, AK asked for the names ofthe bride and groom, and RBC told him there would betwo brides and their names were \"Rachel and Laurel.\"At that point, AK stated that he was sorry, but thatSweetcakes did not make wedding cakes for same-sexceremonies because of AK's and MK's religiousconvictions. In response, RBC began crying. She feltthat she had humiliated her mother and was anxiousPet.App.341whether CM was ashamed of her, in that CM had \u0001 believed that being a homosexual was wrong until only \u0001 a few years earlier. CM then took RBC by the arm and \u0001 walked her out of Sweetcakes to their car. On the way \u0001 out to their car and in the car, RBC became hysterical \u0001 and kept telling CM \"I'm sorry\" because she felt that \u0001 she had humiliated CM. (Respondents' Admission; \u0001 Affidavit of AK; Testimony of RBC, CM) 10)\u0001In the car, CM hugged RBC and assured her \u0001 they would find someone to make a wedding cake. CM \u0001 drove a short distance, then returned to Sweetcakes \u0001 and reentered Sweetcakes by herself to talk to AK. \u0001 During their subsequent conversation, CM told AK \u0001 that she used to think like him, but her \"truth had \u0001 changed\" as a result of having \"two gay children.\" AK \u0001 quoted Leviticus 18:22 to CM, saying \"You shall not lie \u0001 with a male as one lies with a female; it is an \u0001 abomination.\" CM then left Sweetcakes and returned \u0001 to the car. While CM was in Sweetcakes, RBC \u0001 remained sitting in the car, \"holding [her] head in her \u0001 hands, just bawling.\" (Affidavit of AK; Testimony of \u0001 RBC, CM) 11)\u0001When CM returned to the car, she told RBC \u0001 that AK had told her that \"her children were an \u0001 abomination unto God.\" (Testimony of RBC; CM) 12)\u0001When CM told RBC that AK had called her \u0001 \"an abomination,\" this made RBC cry even more. RBC \u0001 was raised as a Southern Baptist. The denial of service \u0001 in this manner made her feel as if God made a mistake \u0001 when he made her, that she wasn't supposed to be, and \u0001 that she wasn't supposed to love or be loved, have a \u0001 family, or go to heaven. (Testimony of RBC)Pet.App.34213)\u0001CM and RBC then drove home. RBC was crying when they arrived home and immediately wentupstairs to her bedroom, followed by LBC and CM,where she lay in her bed, crying. 5 In the bedroom, LBC asked CM what had happened, and CM told her thatAK had told them that Sweetcakes did \"not do same-sex weddings\" and that AK had told CM that \"yourchildren are an abomination .\" LBC was \"flabbergasted\" at AK's statement about same-sex weddings. Thisupset her and made her very angry. (Testimony ofRBC, LBC, CM) 14) LBC, who was raised as a Catholic, recognized Klein's statement as a reference fromLeviticus. She was \"shocked\" to hear that AK hadreferred to her as an \"abomination,\" and thought CMmay have heard wrong. She took the denial of servicein this manner to mean \"...this is a creature notcreated by God, not created with a soul; they areunworthy of holy love; they are not worthy of life.\" Sheimmediately thought that this never would havehappened if she had not asked RBC to marry her andfelt shame because of it. She also worried that thismight negatively impact CM's acceptance of RBC'ssexual orientation. (Testimony of LBC) 15) LBC, who had always viewed herself as RBC's protector, got into bed with RBC and tried to 5 RBC credibly testified as follows: \"I was beyond upset. I just wanted everybody to leave me alone. I couldn't face looking at my mom, and I didn't evenknow if I still wanted to go through with getting married anymore. So I just told everybody to leave me alone asmuch as possible, and I went to my room.\"Pet.App.343soothe her. RBC became even more upset and pushed \u0001 RBC away. In response, LBC lost her temper and \u0001 started yelling that she \"could not believe this had \u0001 happened\" and that she could \"fix\" things if RBC would \u0001 just let her. After LBC left the room, RBC continued \u0001 crying and spent much of that evening in bed.(Testimony of RBC, LBC, CM) 16)\u0001Back downstairs, E, the older of \u0001 Complainants' foster daughters was extremely agitated \u0001 from events at school that day. LBC tried to calm her, \u0001 but she refused to be calmed, repeatedly calling out for \u0001 RBC, with whom she had a special bond. Eventually, E \u0001 cried herself to sleep. LBC's inability to calm E was \u0001 very frustrating to her. She felt overwhelmed because \u0001 she didn't know how to handle the situation. That \u0001 night, LBC was very upset, cried a lot, and was hurt \u0001 and angry. (Testimony LBC, A. Cryer) 17)\u0001After CM returned home on January 17, \u0001 2013, she telephoned \"Lauren\" at the West End \u0001 Ballroom (\"WEB\"), the venue where Complainants \u0001 planned to have their commitment ceremony, and told \u0001 Lauren that Sweetcakes had refused them cake service \u0001 for their wedding. CM also posted a review on \u0001 Sweetcakes Facebook wedding page and on another \u0001 wedding website with a message stating: \"If you're a \u0001 gay couple and having a commitment ceremony or \u0001 wedding, don't go to this place because they \u0001 discriminate against gay people.\" (Testimony of CM; \u0001 Ex. R22) 18)\u0001At 8:22 p.m. on January 17, 2013, Lauren \u0001 from WEB emailed RBC and LBC to say she had heard \u0001 from CM and wanted to know the details of the refusal \u0001 at Sweetcakes. (Testimony of LBC; Ex. R32)Pet.App.34419)\u0001At 9:10 p.m. on January 17, 2013, RBC sent a return email to Lauren at WEB in which she stated: \"Hi Lauren,\"I am sorry to have to bring this to your attention. I want to assure you that we would have gone withSweet Cakes reguardless (sic) of yourrecommendation, because we purchased mymother's wedding cake from them and were veryhappy with the cake. My girlfriend and I purchasedmy mother's cake as a wedding gift for her. At thattime Melissa said nothing about not wanting towork for us because we were gay. \"I even spoke with them at the Portland Wedding Show and made an appointment then for 1pmtoday. When we showed up for the appointment itwas with Melissa's husband. I did not catch hisname because the appointment did not last longenough for me to ask. He took us in the office andasked what the bride and groom names were. Whenwe told him that our names were Rachel andLaurel, he quickly said that they don't do gayweddings because they are Christians and don'tbelieve same-sex marriage is right. My motherasked why they had no problem taking my moneywhen I purchased her cake. She told them that weare a christian family as well and that she used tobelieve like he believed until God blessed her withtwo gay children. \"I was stunned and crying. This is twice in this wedding process that we have faced this kind ofbigotry. It saddens me because we moved fromPet.App.345Texas so that my brother and I could be more \u0001 accepted in the community. \"We wanted to inform you of all of this because you \u0001 have a right to know so that other same-sex couples \u0001 don't have to go through this in the future. It \u0001 surprisingly that both the West End Ballroom and \u0001 the caterers we chose, Premier Catering, \u0001 reccommend (sic) Sweet Cakes and yet neither \u0001 mentioned to us that they don't do gay weddings. I \u0001 figure that this must be because no one ever speaks \u0001 up to let you know. I didn't want to let this pass \u0001 without saying something. \"My fianc\u00e9 and I have been together for 10 years. \u0001 We are adopting our two foster children and wanted \u0001 to get married as a sign of our commitment to each \u0001 other and the family that we are creating. It \u0001 saddens me that my children will grow up in a \u0001 world where people are an abomination because \u0001 they love each other. It is my responsibility to set an \u0001 example for them that you should speak up when \u0001 you see injustice because that is how we make \u0001 progress. \"Thank you for your fast response to both my \u0001 mother and I. I realize that you are not responsible \u0001 for their poor behavior, and thank you for your \u0001 understanding. If there is anymore info that I can \u0001 provide for you please let me know. \"Sincerely, Rachel Cryer & Laurel Bowman\" (Testimony of LBC; Ex. R32)Pet.App.34620)\u0001Later that same evening, LBC filled out an \"Oregon Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") ConsumerComplaint Form,\" using her smart phone to accessDOJ's website. In hard copy, 6 the complaint was two pages long. On the first page, she provided her name,address, phone number and email address, Sweetcakes's name, address, and phone number. Onthe first page, immediately above the space where LBCwrote her name, the following text was printed: \"By submitting this complaint, I understand a) this complaint will become part of DOJ's permanentrecords and is subject to Oregon's Public RecordsLaw; b) this complaint may be released to thebusiness or person about whom I am complaining;c) this complaint may be referred to anothergovernmental agency.

On the second page,LBC described the details of her complaint as follows: \"In november of 2011 my fiance and I purchased a wedding cake from this establishment for hermother's wedding. We spent 250.

We were \u0001 then informed that our money was not equal, my \u0001 fianc\u00e9 reduced to tears. This is absolutely \u0001 unacceptable.\" (Testimony of LBC; Exhibit R3) 21) Aaron Cryer, RBC's brother, also lived with Complainants at this time. Later on the evening ofJanuary 17, 2013, he arrived home from school andwork and he and Complainants had a 30 minuteconversation about what happened at Sweetcakes thatday. (Testimony of A. Cryer) 22) On January 18, 2013, RBC felt depressed and questioned whether there was something inherentlywrong with the sexual orientation she was born withand if she and LBC deserved to be married like aheterosexual couple. She spent most of her day in herroom, trying to sleep. (Testimony of RBC) 23) In the days following January 17, 2013, RBC had difficulty controlling her emotions and cried a lot,and Complainants argued because of RBC's inability tocontrol her emotions. They had not argued previouslysince moving to Oregon. RBC also became moreintroverted and distant in her family relationships. Sheand A. Cryer, have always been very close, and theirconnection was not as close \"for a little bit\" afterJanuary 17, 2013. RBC questioned whether she hadthe ability to be a good mother because of the difficultyPet.App.348she was having in controlling her emotions. A week \u0001 later, RBC still felt \"very sad and stressed,\" felt \u0001 concerned about still having to plan her wedding, and \u0001 felt less exuberant about the wedding. Previous to that \u0001 time, she had been \"very friendly and happy\" in her \u0001 communications with Candice Ericksen, A and E's \u0001 great aunt, about her wedding. After January 17, 2013, \u0001 although RBC relied on CM to contact potential \u0001 wedding vendors, she experienced anxiety over possible \u0001 rejection because her wedding was a same-sex wedding.(Testimony of RBC, LBC, CM, A. Cryer, Ericksen) 24)\u0001In the days following January 17, 2013, LBC \u0001 experienced extreme anger, outrage, embarrassment, \u0001 exhaustion, frustration, intense sorrow, and shame as \u0001 a reaction to AK's refusal to provide a cake. She felt \u0001 sorrow because she couldn't console E, she could not \u0001 protect RBC, and because RBC was no longer sure she \u0001 wanted be married. Her excitement about getting \u0001 married was also lessened because she was not sure \u0001 she could protect RBC if any similar incidents occurred.(Testimony of RBC, LBC, Ericksen) 25)\u0001After January 17, 2013, CM assumed the \u0001 responsibility for contacting the vendors who would be \u0001 needed for Complainants' ceremony. Shortly thereafter, \u0001 she arranged for a cake tasting at Pastry Girl (\"PG\"), \u0001 another local bakery. While making the appointment, \u0001 CM asked Laura Widener, PG's owner/baker, if she \u0001 was okay with providing a cake for a same-sex wedding \u0001 ceremony. Widener assured her that this was not a \u0001 problem. (Testimony of RBC, CM, Widener; Ex. R4) 26) On January 21, 2013, CM and RBC went to PG and met with Widener. While at PG, CM and RBCwere both anxious, and CM did most of the talking,Pet.App.349while RBC tried not to cry until they started talking \u0001 about the design of the cake. At that point, RBC \u0001 became more animated and was able to explain the \u0001 design she wanted on the cake. By the end of the \u0001 meeting, the design they settled on was a cake with \u0001 three tiers that had a peacock's body on top and the \u0001 peacock's tail feathers trailing down over tiers to the \u0001 cake plate. When completed, the peacock and its \u0001 feathers were hand-created and hand-painted cake. of Widener, RBC, CM) 27)\u0001Respondents would have charged $600 for \u0001 making and delivering the same cake. (Testimony of \u0001 AK) 28)\u0001On January 28, 2013, DOJ mailed a copy of \u0001 LBC's Consumer Complaint to Respondents, along with \u0001 a cover letter. In pertinent part, DOJ's cover letter \u0001 stated: \"We have received the enclosed consumer complaint about your business. We understand that there areoften two sides to a problem, and we wouldappreciate your prompt review of this matter. \"We do not represent the complainant.

R3, A4) 29) On day that AK posted LBC's DOJ complaint, LBC received an email telling her of theposting and that she should look at it. LBC did so, thencalled Paul Thompson, Complainants' attorney in thisproceeding. Later that day, the posting was removed.(Testimony of LBC, AK) 30) On February 1, 2013, LBC went to the emergency room of a local hospital at approximately8:00 p.m. because of an injury to her shoulder that shehad suffered three weeks earlier when lifting one of herfoster children above her head when they were playing.While in the hospital, she became aware that AK'srefusal to make their wedding cake was on the news.This made her very upset and she cried when she wasexamined by a doctor, telling the doctor that she hadan \"unpleasant interaction with a business owner, andnow this information is on the news.\" (Testimony ofLBC; Exs. A6, R7) 31) On February 1, 2013, RBC became aware that the media was aware of AK's refusal to make awedding cake for Complainants when she received atelephone call from Lars Larson, an Americanconservative talk radio show host based in Portland,Oregon, who told her that he had spoken with AK andPet.App.351wanted to see what RBC \"had to say about the pending \u0001 case.\" RBC refused to talk with Larson and called LBC, \u0001 who was at the hospital having her shoulder examined.(Testimony of RBC, LBC) 32)\u0001As soon as they became aware that LBC's \u0001 DOJ complaint had become public knowledge through \u0001 the media, both Complainants greatly feared that E \u0001 and A would be taken away from them by the state of \u0001 Oregon's foster care system. 7 Earlier, they had been 7 The level of Complainants' concern over their foster parent status was vividly illustrated in RBC's and LBC's testimony on direct examination by the Agency: R. Bowman-CryerQ: \"So how did you react? How did you react to hearing about your case, I guess, or your situation in the news?\" A: \"My first concern was that nobody could know that we had these children and that whatever we did had to be to protect them. Wedid not want their names in the media. We did not want anyinformation about them or our foster parent status or the status oftheir case to be public knowledge to anyone.\" L. Bowman-CryerQ: \"Was the fear from that initial media release ever lessened for you?\" A: \"No, ma'am. That fear was paramount to everything.\"Q: \"When you say paramount, was it greater for you than the actual refusal of service?\" A: \"At that point in time, yes, ma'am.\"Q: \"Did you still feel emotional effects from the refusal of service?\"A: \"Absolutely, yes, ma'am. My children were still suffering. My wife was still suffering, and that was tearing me apart.\"Pet.App.352instructed that it was their responsibility to make sure \u0001 that the girls' information was protected and that the \u0001 state would \"have to readdress placement\" of the girls \u0001 with Complainants if any information was released \u0001 concerning the girls. (Testimony of RBC, LBC) 33)\u0001Based on the media or potential media \u0001 exposure about the case after February 1, 2013, LBC's \u0001 headaches increased. She felt intimidated and became \u0001 fearful. (Testimony of LBC; Ex. A12) 34)\u0001At some point after February 1, 2013, one of \u0001 RBC's Facebook \"friends\" saw an article about the case \u0001 in her local Florida paper and posted it on Facebook, \u0001 adding in her comments that RBC and LBC had \u0001 children. RBC immediately responded, writing: \u0001 \"Jessica - I know you were trying to defend us, but you \u0001 released information about our kids. The public doesn't \u0001 know we have kids; that is the whole point of being \u0001 silent.

The letter read as follows: \"Members of the Media: \"I would like to begin by thanking each of you for your interest in this story.

The protest was organized by a personor persons who started a Facebook page called\"BoycottSweetCakesByMelissaGRESHAM\" (\"Boycott\")on February 6, 2013, and posted a photo fromKATU.com that shows \"protesters gathered Saturdayoutside a Gresham bakery that's at the center of awedding cake controversy.\" Complainants were notinvolved in the protest or subsequent boycott. However,on February 10, 2013, both Complainants madecomments on Boycott's Facebook page in which theyindirectly identified themselves as the persons whosought the wedding cake and thanked people for theirsupport. (Exs. R9, R13) 37) On February 8, 2013, Herbert Grey, Respondents' lead counsel in this case, sent a letter toDOJ that responded to LBC's January 17, 2013,consumer complaint. In the letter, Grey identifiedhimself as representing Respondents concerning thecomplaint filed by \"Laurel Bowman\" and addressed theissues raised in the complaint. Grey also cc'd a copy ofhis letter to LBC. (Ex.

(Ex. R15) 39) After LBC's DOJ complaint was publicized in the media, Complainants both had negativeconfrontations from relatives who learned about theircomplaint against Respondents through the media. InJanuary 2013, LBC had just begun to re-establish arelationship with an aunt who had physically andemotionally abused her as a child and also owned all ofthe family property. Shortly after LBC's complaintbecame public, the aunt insisted through social mediathat LBC drop the complaint. She also called LBC andtold her she was not welcome on family property andshe would shoot LBC \"in the face\" if LBC ever set footon the family's property in Ireland or the UnitedStates. This threat \"devastated\" LBC, as it meant shecould not visit her mother or grandmother, both ofPet.App.356whom lived on family property. RBC's sister, who \u0001 believed that homosexuals should not be allowed to get \u0001 married, wrote a Facebook message to the Kleins to tell \u0001 them that she supported them. This was a \"crushing \u0001 blow\" to RBC, and it hurt her and made her very angry \u0001 at her sister. (Testimony of LBC, RBC, CM; Ex.

On the day of the ceremony, the words \u0001 \"ROMANCE BY CANDLELIGHT - STARRING \u0001 RACHEL AND LAUREL - JUNE 27, 2013\" were \u0001 posted on a large billboard on the street-facing wall of \u0001 the WEB. Only invited guests were allowed to attend \u0001 the ceremony. Just prior to the ceremony, Duff \u0001 Goldman's free cake was delivered by an incognito \u0001 motorcyclist. At the ceremony, Complainants and their \u0001 guests celebrated with their cakes from Pastry Girl and \u0001 Goldman. After the ceremony, Complainants \u0001 considered themselves to be married even though they \u0001 could not be legally married in the state of Oregon at \u0001 that time. (Testimony of RBC, LBC, Widener; Exs. R18, \u0001 R19) 41)\u0001On August 8, 2013, RBC filed a verified \u0001 complaint with BOLI alleged that Sweetcakes by \u0001 Melissa had discriminated against her by refusing to \u0001 make her a wedding cake because of her sexual \u0001 orientation. (Testimony of RBC; Ex. A27) 42)\u0001On August 14, 2013, BOLI's Communications \u0001 Director issued a press release related to RBC's \u0001 complaint. The first paragraph read: \"Portland, OR - A \u0001 same-sex couple has filed an anti-discrimination \u0001 complaint with the Oregon Bureau of Labor andPet.App.357Industries (BOLI) against a Gresham bakery, Sweet \u0001 Cakes by Melissa, for allegedly refusing service based \u0001 on sexual orientation.\" (Ex.

(Testimony of LBC; Ex. A28) 45) On January 17, 2014, BOLI's Communications Director issued a press release thatbegan and ended with the following statements: \"BOLI finds substantial evidence of unlawful discrimination in bakery civil rightscomplaint Sweet Cakes complaint will now move into conciliation to determine whether settlementcan be reachedPet.App.358\"Portland, OR - A Gresham bakery violated the \u0001 civil rights of a same-sex couple when it denied \u0001 service based on sexual orientation, a Bureau of \u0001 Labor and Industries (BOLI) investigation has \u0001 found. \"The couple filed the complaint against Sweetcakes \u0001 by Melissa under the Oregon Equality Act of 2007, \u0001 a law that protects the rights of gays, lesbians, \u0001 bisexual and transgender Oregonians in \u0001 employment, housing and public places. \"* * * * *\"Copies of the complaint are available upon request. \u0001 * * *\" (Ex.

(Testimony of RBC) 47) From February 1, 2013, until the time of the hearing, many people have made \"hate-filled\"comments through social media and in the commentssections of various websites that were supportive ofRespondents and critical of or threatening toComplainants. These comments and the mediaattention caused RBC stress, anger, pain, frustration,suffering, torture, shame, humiliation, degradation,fear that she would be harassed at home because theDOJ complaint with Complainants' home address hadbeen posted on Facebook, and the feeling that herreputation was being destroyed. (Testimony of RBC,LBC, CM; Ex. A24)Pet.App.35948)\u0001The publicity from the case and accompanying threats from third parties on socialmedia made RBC \"scared\" for the lives of A, E, LBC,and herself. (Testimony of RBC) 49) Although AK has been interviewed by the media on a number of occasions about the case, he didnot initiate any contacts with the media. Other thanposting LBC's DOJ complaint on his Facebook page,there is no evidence that AK gave Complainants'names to the media. Finally, there is no evidence in therecord of any untruthful statements that AK or MKmade to public media regarding their case. 8 (Testimony of AK; Entire Record) 50) Except for Paul Thompson's February 8, 2013, press release, Complainants have never solicitedmedia attention nor been interviewed by the mediawith regard to this case. (Testimony of RBC, LBC) 51) Candice Ericksen, Laura Widener, Melissa Klein, Jessica Ponaman, and Aaron Cryer werecredible witnesses and the forum has credited theirtestimony in its entirety. (Testimony of Ericksen,Widener, M. Klein, RBC, Ponaman) 52) For the most part, CM's testimony was credible, even though her answers frequently strayedfrom the subject of the questions. However, the forumdid not believe her earlier statements to Ponaman that 8 Complainants testified that they were upset by Respondents' repeated untruthful statements about them in the media, but didnot testify as to any specific incident in which Respondents madeuntruthful statements of which they were aware and the Agency presented no other evidence of any such statements.Pet.App.360RBC was \"throwing up\" because she was so nervous \u0001 and that \"for days [RBC] couldn't get out of bed\" \u0001 because RBC did not testify to those facts and because \u0001 RBC spent 30 minutes talking with LBC and A. Cryer \u0001 the night of January 17, 2013, and went to a cake \u0001 tasting at Pastry Girl on January 21, 2013. Due to \u0001 these exaggerations, the forum has only credited CM's \u0001 testimony when it was either (a) undisputed, or (b) disputed but corroborated by other credible testimony. (Testimony of CM) 53) AK was a credible witness except for his testimony that he did not realize that LBC's name andaddress were on the DOJ complaint that he posted onhis Facebook page. LBC's name, address, and phonenumber are conspicuously printed on the complaintimmediately above Sweetcakes's name, address, andphone number, and the forum finds it extremelyunlikely that AK would have posted the complaintwithout reading it, particularly since he posted acomment immediately above it that read: \"This is whathappens when you tell gay people you won't do their'wedding' cake.\" Apart from that testimony, the forumhas credited AK's testimony in its entirety. (Testimonyof AK) 54) RBC was an extremely emotional witness who was in tears or close to tears during most of hertestimony. Despite her emotional state, she answeredquestions directly in a forthright manner. She did nottry to minimize the effect of media exposure on heremotional state as compared to how the denial ofservice affected her. The forum has credited RBC'stestimony about her emotional suffering in its entirety.However, the forum has only credited her testimonyPet.App.361about media exposure when she testified about specific \u0001 incidents. (Testimony of RBC) 55)\u0001LBC was a very bitter and angry witness who \u0001 had a strong tendency to exaggerate and over-dramatize events. On cross examination, she argued \u0001 repeatedly with Respondents' counsel and had to be \u0001 counseled by the ALJ to answer the questions asked of \u0001 her instead of editorializing about the denial of service \u0001 and how it affected her. Her testimony was \u0001 inconsistent in several respects with more credible \u0001 evidence. First, she testified that she had a \"major \u0001 blowout\" and \"really bad fight\" with A. Cryer between \u0001 January 17 and January 21, 2013. In contrast, A. Cryer \u0001 testified, when asked if he fought with LBC, \"I wouldn't \u0001 say we fought.\" He also testified that this case did not \u0001 affect his relationship with LBC. Second, she testified \u0001 that her blood pressure spiked in the hospital to \u0001 210/165 on February 1, 2013, when she learned that \u0001 her DOJ complaint had hit the media, requiring the \u0001 immediate attention of a doctor and four nurses. Her \u0001 treating doctor's report notes that she was upset and \u0001 crying about her situation hitting the news, but there \u0001 is no mention of a blood pressure spike. Third, she \u0001 testified that the media were standing outside her and \u0001 RBC's apartment on February 1, 2013, when she talked \u0001 to RBC from the hospital. RBC, who was at the \u0001 apartment at that time, testified that the media were \u0001 not outside their apartment at that time. Fourth, LBC \u0001 testified that RBC stayed in bed the rest of the day \u0001 after she returned from the cake tasting at Sweetcakes. \u0001 In contrast, A. Cryer testified that he, LBC, and RBC \u0001 had a 30 minute conversation that evening. Like RBC, \u0001 the forum has only credited her testimony about media \u0001 exposure when she testified about specific incidents.Pet.App.362The forum has only credited LBC's testimony when it \u0001 was either (a) undisputed, or (b) disputed but \u0001 corroborated by other credible testimony.

OPINION Introduction In his ruling on Respondents' motion and the Agency's cross-motion for summary judgment, the ALJconcluded that Respondents did not violate ORS659A.409. 9 This final order reverses that decision. The following discussion explains why. ORS 659A.409 provides, in pertinent part:\"* * * [I]t is an unlawful practice for any person acting on behalf of any place of publicaccommodation as defined in ORS 659A.400 topublish, circulate, issue or display, or cause to bepublished, circulated, issued or displayed, any 9 See Finding of Fact #28 - Procedural, infra . In the ALJ's ruling on the motions for summary judgment, he noted that the Agencydid not allege that AK violated ORS 659A.409, but did not considerthis paragraph. See footnote 26.Pet.App.364communication, notice, advert isement or sign of any \u0001 kind to the effect that any of the accommodations, \u0001 advantages, facilities, services or privileges of the \u0001 place of public accommodation will be refused, \u0001 withheld from or denied to, or that any \u0001 discrimination will be made against, any person on \u0001 account of * * * sexual orientation[.]\" The first paragraph in section IV of the Agency's Charges10 alleges that \"Respondents published, issued * * * a communication, notice * * * that itsaccommodation, advantages * * * would be refused,withheld from or denied to, or that discriminationwould be made against, a person on account of his orher sexual orientation.\" In subparagraphs \"a\" and \"c,\"the Agency identifies ORS 659A.409 as the statute thatwas allegedly violated. Earlier in the Charges, theAgency identified statements made by AK that werebroadcast on CBN television on September 2, 2013, andon the radio on February 13, 2014, that allegedlycommunicated an intent to discriminate based onsexual orientation. The full text of the relevant part ofthe CBN broadcast is reprinted below: A. Klein : 'I didn't want to be a part of her marriage, which I think is wrong.' 10 Section IV is prefaced by the caption \"UNLAWFUL PRACTICE: DISCRIMINATION BY PUBLICATION, CIRCULATION,ISSUANCE, OR DISPLAY OF A COMMUNICATION, NOTICE,ADVERTISEMENT, OR SIGN OF A DENIAL OF ACCOMMODATIONS, ADVANTAGES, FACILITIES, SERVICES OR PRIVILEGES BY A PLACE OF PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONBASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION.\" Pet.App.365M.\u0001Klein : 'I am who I am and I want to live my life \u0001 the way I want to live my life and, you know, I \u0001 choose to serve God.' A.\u0001Klein : 'It's one of those things where you never \u0001 want to see something you've put so much work into \u0001 go belly up, but on the other hand, um, I have faith \u0001 in the Lord and he's taken care of us up to this point \u0001 and I'm sure he will in the future.'(September 2, 2013, CBN interview ) The Agency's cross-motion for summary judgment also singles out the text on a handwritten sign that wasshown taped to the inside of Sweetcakes' front windowduring the CBN broadcast: \"Closed but still in business. You can reach me by email or facebook. www.sweetcakesweb.com or Sweetcakes by Melissa facebook page. New phonenumber will be provided on my website andfacebook. This fight is not over. We will continue tostand strong. Your religious freedom is becomingnot free anymore. This is ridiculous that we cannotpractice our faith. The LORD is good and we willcontinue to serve HIM with all our heart. [heartsymbol]\" The full text of the relevant part of the Perkins' broadcast is reprinted below: Perkins : '* * * Tell us how this unfolded and your reaction to that.' Klein : 'Well, as far as how it unfolded, it was just, you know, business as usual. We had a bride comein. She wanted to try some wedding cake. Returncustomer. Came in, sat down. I simply asked thePet.App.366bride and groom's first name and date of the \u0001 wedding. She kind of giggled and informed me it \u0001 was two brides. At that point, I apologized. I said \u0001 \"I'm very sorry, I feel like you may have wasted \u0001 your time. You know we don't do same-sex \u0001 marriage, same-sex wedding cakes.\" And she got \u0001 upset, noticeably, and I understand that. Got up, \u0001 walked out, and you know, that was, I figured the \u0001 end of it.' Perkins : 'Aaron, let me stop you for a moment. Had \u0001 you and your wife, had you talked about this before; \u0001 is this something that you had discussed? Did you \u0001 think, you know, this might occur and had you \u0001 thought through how you might respond or did this \u0001 kind of catch you off guard?' Klein : 'You know, it was something I had a feeling \u0001 was going to become an issue and I discussed it \u0001 with my wife when the state of Washington, which \u0001 is right across the river from us, legalized same-sex \u0001 marriage and we watched Masterpiece Bakery \u0001 going through the same issue that we ended up \u0001 going through. But, you know, it was one of those \u0001 situations where we said \"well I can see it is going \u0001 to become an issue but we have to stand firm. It's \u0001 our belief and we have a right to it, you know.\" I \u0001 could totally understand the backlash from the gay \u0001 and lesbian community. I could see that; what I \u0001 don't understand is the government sponsorship of \u0001 religious persecution. That is something that just \u0001 kind of boggles my mind as to how a government \u0001 that is under the jurisdiction of the Constitution can \u0001 decide, you know, that these people's rights \u0001 overtake these people's rights or even opinion, thatPet.App.367this person's opinion is more valid than this \u0001 person's; it kind of blows my mind.' (February 13, \u0001 2014, Perkins' interview ) The Agency's cross-motion for summary judgment singles out the statements made on those two occasionsas proof that Respondents violated ORS 659A.409,along with the note posted on Sweetcakes' front door. \"ORS 659A.409 provides, in pertinent part:'* * * it is an unlawful practice for any person acting on behalf of any place of public accommodation asdefined in ORS 659A.400 to publish, circulate, issueor display, or cause to be published, circulated,issued or displayed, any communication, notice,advertisement or sign of any kind to the effect thatany of the accommodations, advantages, facilities,services or privileges of the place of publicaccommodation will be refused, withheld from ordenied to, or that any discrimination will be madeagainst, any person on account of * * * sexualorientation * * *.' In their motion for summary judgment, Respondents argue that \"ORS 659A.409 by its terms requires astatement of future intention that is entirely absent in this instance.\" Respondents further argue that: \"A review of the videotape record of the CBN broadcast * * * clearly shows that Aaron Kleinspoke only of the reason why he and his wifedeclined to participate in complainants' ceremony.The same is true of the Perkins radio broadcast.* * * A statement of future intention in either mediaevent is conspicuously absent.\"Pet.App.368In contrast, the Agency argues that the Klein's \u0001 statements are a prospective communication: \"Reviewed in context, Respondents communicated quite clearly that same-sex couples would not beprovided wedding cake services at their bakery.These are not descriptions of past events as allegedby Respondents. Respondents stated their positionin these communications and notify the public thatthey 'don't do same sex weddings,' they business' and will 'continue to staystrong.'\" As stated earlier, the Agency asserts that the three incidents described above - the two interviews and thenote -- show Respondents' prospective intent todiscriminate. Although the Agency did not include thetext or specifically allege the existence of the note in itsFormal Charges and the Perkins' interview occurredafter the Agency had completed its initial investigationof the complaint and issued its Substantial EvidenceDetermination, this does not preclude the Agency frompursuing those incidents at hearing. The Agency'sinvestigation may continue past its substantialevidence determination and charges may includeevidence not discovered by the investigator. See In the Matter of Sears, Roebuck and Company, 18 BOLI 47, 78 (1999). The only limitation is that the charges be\"reasonably related\" to the allegations of the initialcomplaint. Id. The allegations and theories of the specific charges define those to be adjudicated throughthe hearing, whether or not those allegations andtheories are consistent with or even based on those inthe administrative determination. See In the Matter of Jake's Truck Stop, 7 BOLI 199, 211 (1988). Also, thePet.App.369only limitation on charges is that the complainant must \u0001 have had standing to raise the issues and those issues \u0001 must encompass discrimination only like or reasonably \u0001 related to the allegations in the complaint. See In the \u0001 Matter of Sapp's Realty, Inc., 4 BOLI 93, 94 (1981). In the present case, both the note and Perkins \u0001 interview are not only \"reasonably related' but, directly \u0001 related to the allegations and theories of both the \u0001 original complaint and charges. Whether corroborating \u0001 evidence or included as a fact underlying a specific \u0001 charge, they may be considered as evidence to \u0001 determine whether a violation of ORS 659A.409 \u0001 occurred. Whatever Respondents' intentions may have been \u0001 or may still be with regard to providing wedding cake \u0001 services for same-sex weddings, the Commissioner \u0001 finds that AK's above-quoted statements, evaluated \u0001 both for text and context, are properly construed as the \u0001 recounting of past events that led to the present \u0001 Charges being filed. In addition, they also constitute \u0001 notice that discrimination will be made in the future by \u0001 refusing such services. In the Perkins' interview, AK \u0001 stated \"...We don't do same-sex marriage, same-sex wedding cakes....\" He continued that in discussing Washington's same-sex marriage law with MK, \"we cansee this becoming an issue and we have to stand firm.\"The note similarly said \"...This fight is not over. Wewill continue to stand strong....\" On their face, thesestatements are not constrained to a singular incidentor time. They reference past, present and futureconduct. AK did not say only that he would not docomplainants' specific marriage and cake but, thatrespondents \"don't do\" same-sex marriage and cakes.Pet.App.370Respondents' joint statement that they will \"continue\" \u0001 to stand strong relates to their denial of service and is \u0001 prospective in nature. The statements, therefore, \u0001 indicate Respondents' clear intent to discriminate in \u0001 the future just as they had done with Complainants. The Commissioner concludes that, through the \u0001 communications described above, AK and MK both \u0001 violated ORS 659A.409.11 However, the Commissioner \u0001 awards no damages to Complainants based on \u0001 Respondents' unlawful practice because there is no \u0001 evidence in the record that Complainants experienced \u0001 any mental, emotional, or physical suffering because of \u0001 it. In their Answers to the Formal Charges, \u0001 Respondents raised the affirmative defenses that ORS \u0001 659A.409 is unconstitutional on its face and as applied. \u0001 Their defense is set out with particularity in Finding of \u0001 Fact #7 - Procedural. The forum did not address these \u0001 defenses in the ALJ's Summary Judgment ruling 11 See In the Matter of Blachana, LLC, 32 BOLI 220 (2013), appeal pending (Respondent found to have violated ORS 659A.409 when member of the LLC left a telephone message with the organizer ofa group of transgender individuals who had visited the LLC's nightclub regularly on Friday nights during the previous 18months asking \"not to come back on Friday nights.\"); In the Matter of The Pub , 6 BOLI 270, 282-83 (1987)(Respondent found to have violated ORS 659.037, the predecessor of ORS 659A.409, by posting a on front door of pub, immediately under another sign that said \"VIVA APARTHEID,\" a sign that said \"NO SHOES,SHIRTS, SERVICE, NIGGERS,\" and a sign inside the pub, withchain and spikes attached at each end, that read \"Discrimination. Webster - to use good judgment\" on the front and \"AuthenticSouth African Apartheid Nigger 'Black' Handcuffs Directions DriveThrough Wrists and Bend Over Tips\" on the back).Pet.App.371because the ALJ concluded that Respondents did not \u0001 violate ORS 659A.409. The Commissioner now \u0001 addresses them without duplicating the extensive \u0001 analysis in the ALJ's Summary Judgment ruling. Oregon Constitution -- Article I, Sections 2 and 3 Article I, Sections 2 and 3 of the Oregon \u0001 Constitution provide: \"Section 2. Freedom of worship. All men shall be secure in the Natural right, to worship AlmightyGod according to the dictates of their ownconsciences. \"Section 3. Freedom of religious opinion. No law shall in any case whatever control the free exercise,and enjoyment of religeous [sic] opinions, orinterfere with the rights of conscience.\" ORS 659A.409, like ORS 659A.403, is a law that is part of a general regulatory scheme, expressly neutraltoward religion as such and neutral among religions.Accordingly, it is constitutional on its face. Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and Industries , 322 Or 132, 903 P2d 351 (1995). It is also constitutional as applied in thiscase because Respondents' statements announcingtheir clear intent to discriminate in future, just as theyhad done with Complainants, was not a religiouspractice but was conduct motivated by their religiousbeliefs. Id. at 153. Furthermore, the Oregon Supreme Court has held, in the context of Article I, section 8,that engagement in constitutionally protectedexpression while engaging in otherwise punishableconduct does not insulate the unlawful conduct fromthe usual consequences that accompany it. See, e.g., Hoffman and Wright Logging Co. v. Wade, 317 Or 445,Pet.App.372452, 857 P2d 101 (1993)(\"a person's reason for engaging \u0001 in punishable conduct does not transform conduct into \u0001 expression under Article I, section 8 [and] speech \u0001 accompanying punishable conduct does not transform \u0001 conduct into expression[.]); State v. Plowman, 314 Or\u0001 157, 838 P2d 558 (1992) (\"One may hate members \u0001 of a specified group all one wishes, but still be punished \u0001 constitutionally if one acts together with another to \u0001 cause physical injury to a person because of that \u0001 person's perceived membership in the hated group\"). \u0001 The same should hold true with regard to the \u0001 protections afforded by Article I, sections 2 and 3.12 United States Constitution - First Amendment: \u0001 Unlawfully Infringing on Respondents' right of \u0001 conscience and right to free exercise of religion The Commissioner finds ORS 659A.409 \u0001 constitutional, both facially and as applied, based on \u0001 the same reasoning set out in the Summary Judgment \u0001 ruling with respect to the constitutionality of ORS \u0001 659A.403. Oregon Constitution - Section 8: freedom of \u0001 speech Article I, Section 8 of the Oregon Constitution \u0001 provides: \"Section 8. Freedom of speech and press. No laws shall be passed restraining the free expressionof opinion, or restricting the right to speak, write, or 12 This reasoning also applies to the ALJ's analysis of the constitutionality of ORS 659A.403 in the summary judgmentruling.Pet.App.373print freely on any subject whatever; but every \u0001 person shall be responsible for the abuse of this \u0001 right.\" In State v. Robertson , 293 Or 402, 649 P2d 569 (1982), the Oregon Supreme Court established a basicframework, with three categories, for determiningwhether a law violates Article I, Section 8. ORS659A.409 falls within Robertson's second category because it is \"directed in terms against the pursuit of aforbidden effect\" and proscribed means or writing.\" Id. at 417-18. 13 Oregon courts examine a statute in the second category for \"overbreadth' to determine if 'the terms of [the] lawexceed constitutional boundaries, purporting to reachconduct protected by guarantees such as * * * [A]rticleI, section 8. * * * If a statute is overbroad, the courtthen must determine whether it can be interpreted toavoid such overbreadth.\" State v. Babson, 355 Or 383, 391, 326 P3d 559, 566 (2014). Respondents assert that ORS 659A.409 prohibits Respondents from \"express[ing] their own position\" andthat ORS 659A.409 amounts to \"a speech code.\" To thecontrary, the language of ORS 659A.409 focuses on thediscriminatory effect that accompanies certain speech\"published, circulated, issued or displayed\" on behalf of a place of public accommodation. It does not cover expressions of personal opinion, political commentary,or other privileged communications unrelated to thebusiness of a place of public accommodation, and its 13 In its cross-motion for summary judgment, the Agency concedes that ORS 659A.409 \"falls within the second Robertson category of laws.\"Pet.App.374breadth is narrowly tailored to address the effects of \u0001 the speech at issue. As such, it is facially constitutional \u0001 under Article I, Section 8.14 A statute that falls within Robertson category two \u0001 is not subject to an as-applied challenge. See Leppanen \u0001 v.\u0001Lane Transit Dist ., App 136, 142-43, 45 P3d \u0001 501, 504-05 (2002), citing City of Eugene v. Lee, 177 Or\u0001 App 492, 497, 34 P3d 690 (2001). U.S. Constitution - First Amendment: Unlawfully \u0001 infringing on Respondents' right to free speech In pertinent part, the First Amendment to the U.S. \u0001 Constitution provides \"Congress shall make no law \u0001 * * * abridging the freedom of speech * * *.\" This \u0001 applies to the State of Oregon under the Fourteenth \u0001 Amendment. In his Summary Judgment ruling, the \u0001 ALJ conducted a \"compelled speech\" analysis to \u0001 Respondents' defense that baking a wedding cake for \u0001 Complainants was \"speech\" that violated the First \u0001 Amendment. In contrast, the speech that violated ORS \u0001 659A.409 - the CBN interview, the \"note\" on \u0001 Sweetcakes's door, and the Perkins' interview - was \u0001 voluntary on Respondents' part. ORS 659A.409 is an integral part the anti- discrimination public accommodation laws in ORS \u0001 chapter 659A. The forum first interpreted this statute \u0001 nearly 30 years ago, when it was numbered as ORS 14 See also State v. Sutherland , 329 Or 359, 365, 987 P2d 501, 504 (1999)(for a statute to be facially unconstitutional, it must beunconstitutional in all circumstances, i.e., there can be no reasonably likely circumstances in which application of the statute would pass constitutional muster).Pet.App.375659.037, in a case in which the Respondent owned a \u0001 bar and posted a sign on the front door stating \"NO, \u0001 SHOES, SHIRTS, SERVICE, NIGGERS.\" In the Matter \u0001 of The Pub, 6 BOLI 270, 278 (1987). In her Final Order, \u0001 the Commissioner held that this statute, then \u0001 numbered as ORS 659.037, \"does not generally operate \u0001 to deny [a] Respondent his constitutional guarantees of \u0001 free speech.\" Subsequently, in Hurley v. Irish-Am. Gay, \u0001 & Grp. of Boston , 515 U.S. 557, 572 \u0001 (1995), the U. S. Supreme Court held that \"modern \u0001 public accommodations laws are well within the State's \u0001 usual power to enact when a legislature has reason to \u0001 believe that a given group is the target of \u0001 discrimination, and they do not, as a general matter, \u0001 violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments.\"15 In\u0001 conclusion, ORS 659A.409 is constitutional on its face. \u0001 It is also constitutional as applied because the \u0001 Commissioner only applies it to Respondents' language \u0001 that indicate Respondents' clear intent to discriminate \u0001 in future just as they had done with Complainants. Damages This case is not about a wedding cake or a marriage. \u0001 It is about a business's refusal to serve someone \u0001 because of their sexual orientation. Under Oregon law, \u0001 that is illegal. Free enterprise provides great opportunity for \u0001 entrepreneurs to take an idea, create a business and 15 Cf. Hishon v. King & Spalding , 467 U.S. 69, 78 (1984)(\"[i]nvidious private discrimination may be characterized asa form of exercising freedom of association protected by the FirstAmendment, but it has never been accorded affirmative constitutional protections\")Pet.App.376achieve whatever success they can. It is a system open \u0001 to all but, to participate fairly, businesses must follow \u0001 the laws that apply to each of them equally. A business \u0001 that disregards the law erodes the free marketplace for \u0001 both law abiding businesses and patrons alike. Respondents' claim they are not denying service \u0001 because of Complainants' sexual orientation but rather \u0001 because they do not wish to participate in their same \u0001 sex wedding ceremony. The forum has already found \u0001 there to be no distinction between the two. Further, to \u0001 allow Respondents, a for profit business, to deny any \u0001 services to people because of their protected class, \u0001 would be tantamount to allowing legal separation of \u0001 people based on their sexual orientation from at least \u0001 some portion of the public marketplace. This would \u0001 clearly be contrary to Oregon law as well as any \u0001 standard by which people in a free society should \u0001 choose to treat each other. Within Oregon's public accommodations law is the \u0001 basic principle of human decency that every person, \u0001 regardless of their sexual orientation, has the freedom \u0001 to fully participate in society. The ability to enter \u0001 public places, to shop, to dine, to move about unfettered \u0001 by bigotry. When Respondents denied RBC and LBC a wedding \u0001 cake, their act was more than the denial of the product. \u0001 It was, and is, a denial of RBC's and LBC's freedom to \u0001 participate equally. It is the epitome of being told there \u0001 are places you cannot go, things you cannot do...or be. \u0001 Respondent's conduct was a clear and direct statement \u0001 that RBC and LBC lacked an identity worthy of being \u0001 recognized.Pet.App.377The denial of these basic freedoms to which all are \u0001 entitled devalues the human condition of the \u0001 individual, and in doing so, devalues the humanity of \u0001 us all. This was clearly reflected in RBC's and LBC's \u0001 testimony. In addition to other emotional responses, \u0001 RBC described that being raised a Christian in the \u0001 Southern Baptist Church, Respondent's denial of \u0001 service made her feel as if God made a mistake when \u0001 he made her, that she wasn't supposed to be, and that \u0001 she wasn't supposed to love or be loved, have a family, \u0001 or go to heaven. LBC, who was raised Catholic, \u0001 interpreted the denial to represent that she was not a \u0001 creature created by god, not created with a soul and \u0001 unworthy of holy love and life. She felt anger, intense \u0001 sorrow and shame. These are the reasonable and very \u0001 real responses to not being allowed to participate in \u0001 society like everyone else. The personal harm in being \u0001 subjected to such separation is felt deeply and severely, \u0001 as the evidence in this case indicated. The Formal Charges seek damages for emotional, \u0001 mental and physical suffering in the amount of \"at \u0001 least $75,000\" for each Complainant. In addition to any \u0001 emotional suffering experienced by Complainants as a \u0001 direct result of Sweetcakes' refusal to bake them a cake \u0001 (\"denial of service\"), the Agency also seeks damages for \u0001 suffering caused to Complainants by media publicity \u0001 and social media responses to this case. In order, the forum considers the extent of \u0001 Complainants' emotional suffering and the cause of \u0001 that suffering; and the appropriate amount of damages. \u0001 Any damages awarded do not constitute a fine or civil \u0001 penalty, which the Commissioner has no authority toPet.App.378impose in a case such as this. Instead, any damages \u0001 fairly compensate RBC and LBC for the harm they \u0001 suffered and which was proven at hearing. This is an \u0001 important distinction as this order does not punish \u0001 respondents for their illegal conduct but, rather makes \u0001 whole those subjected to the harm their conduct \u0001 caused. 1. Extent and Cause of Complainants' Emotional Suffering A. R. Bowman-Cryera. Emotional suffering from the denial of service Prior to the cake tasting, LBC had been asking RBC to marry her for nine years. Until October 2012, RBCdid not want to be married because of her personalexperience of failed marriages. At that time, RBCdecided that they should get married to give theirfoster children a sense of \"permanency andcommitment.\" After her long-standing matrimonialreticence, RBC became excited to get married and tostart planning the wedding, 16 wanting a wedding that was as \"big and grand\" as they could afford. Obtaininga cake from Sweetcakes like the one purchased forCM's wedding two years earlier was part of that grandscheme, and both Complainants were excited about thecake tasting at Sweetcakes because of how much theyliked the cake Respondents had made for CM'swedding. 16 The forum acknowledges that Complainants' \"wedding\" on June 27, 2013, was only a commitment ceremony, not a legal \"marriage.\"See footnote 58, infra .Pet.App.379RBC's emotional suffering began at the January 17, \u0001 2013, cake tasting when AK told RBC and CM that \u0001 Sweetcakes did not make wedding cakes for same-sex \u0001 ceremonies. In response, RBC began to cry. She felt \u0001 that she had humiliated her mother and was concerned \u0001 that CM, who had believed that homosexuality was \u0001 wrong until only a few years earlier, was ashamed of \u0001 her. Walking out to the car and in the car, RBC became \u0001 hysterical and kept apologizing to CM. When CM \u0001 returned to the car after talking with AK, RBC was \u0001 still \"bawling\" in the car. When CM told her that AK \u0001 had called her \"an abomination,\" this made RBC cry \u0001 even more. RBC, who was brought up as a Southern \u0001 Baptist, interpreted AK's use of the word \u0001 \"abomination\" her mean that God made a mistake \u0001 when he made her, that she wasn't supposed to exist, \u0001 and that she had no right to love or be loved, have a \u0001 family, or go to heaven. She continued to cry all the \u0001 way home and after she arrived at home, where she \u0001 immediately went upstairs to her bedroom and lay in \u0001 her bed, crying. On January 18, 2013, RBC felt depressed and \u0001 questioned whether there was something inherently \u0001 wrong with the sexual orientation she was born with \u0001 and if she and LBC deserved to be married like a \u0001 heterosexual couple. She spent most of that day in her \u0001 room, trying to sleep. In the days following January 17, 2013, RBC had \u0001 difficulty controlling her emotions and cried a lot, and \u0001 Complainants argued with each other because of RBC's \u0001 inability to control her emotions. They had not argued \u0001 previously since moving to Oregon. In addition, RBC \u0001 also became more introverted and distant in her familyPet.App.380relationships. She and A. Cryer have always been very \u0001 close, and their connection was not as close \"for a little \u0001 bit\" after January 17, 2013. A week later, RBC still felt \u0001 \"very sad and stressed,\" felt concerned about still \u0001 having to plan her wedding, and felt less exuberant \u0001 about the wedding. On January 21, 2013, she \u0001 experienced anxiety during her cake tasting at Pastry \u0001 Girl because of AK's January 17, 2013, refusal and her \u0001 fear of subsequent refusals. After January 17, 2013, \u0001 although RBC relied on CM to contact potential \u0001 wedding vendors, RBC still experienced some anxiety \u0001 over possible rejection because her wedding was a \u0001 same-sex wedding. During this same period of time, A. \u0001 Cryer credibly analogized RBC's demeanor as similar \u0001 to that of a dog who had been abused. b. Emotional suffering from publicity about the case On February 1, 2013, RBC became aware that the media was aware of AK's refusal to make a weddingcake for Complainants when she received a telephonecall from Lars Larson, an American conservative talkradio show host based in Portland, Oregon, who toldher that he had spoken with AK and wanted to seewhat RBC \"had to say about the pending case.\" Thisupset RBC, and she became greatly concerned that Eand A would be taken away from them by the fostercare system because they had been told that the girls'information had to be protected and that the statewould \"have to readdress placement\" of the girls withComplainants if any information was releasedconcerning the girls. This concern continued until theiradoption became final sometime after December 2013.Pet.App.381From February 1, 2013, until the time of the \u0001 hearing, many people have made \"hate-filled\" \u0001 comments through social media and in the comments \u0001 sections of various websites that were supportive of \u0001 Respondents and critical of or threatening to \u0001 Complainants. These comments and the media \u0001 attention caused RBC stress, anger, pain, frustration, \u0001 suffering, torture, shame, humiliation, degradation, \u0001 fear that she would be harassed at home because the \u0001 DOJ complaint with Complainants' home address had \u0001 been posted on Facebook, and the feeling that her \u0001 reputation was being destroyed. The publicity from the \u0001 case and accompanying threats on social media from \u0001 third parties made RBC \"scared\" for the lives of A, E, \u0001 LBC, and herself. In addition, RBC was also upset by \u0001 a confrontation with her sister who learned about the \u0001 DOJ complaint through the media and posted a \u0001 comment in support of Respondents on Respondents' \u0001 Facebook. Without giving any specific examples, RBC credibly \u0001 testified that, in a general sense,17 the denial of service 17 The following is RBC's only testimony about her emotional suffering due to the denial of service after the case began to bepublicized. It occurred during the Agency's redirect examination: Q: \"You testified earlier about the media attention being sort of a secondary layer of stress, and I believe that that term you usedduring Mr. Smith's cross examination of you. During myexamination of you, you testified at length as to the emotionalharm that you suffered directly from the refusal of service alone.Do you still feel that harm from the refusal itself -- the January 17, 2013 refusal?\" \"* * * * *Pet.App.382has caused her continued emotional suffering up to the \u0001 time of hearing. B. L. Bowman-Cryer a. Emotional suffering from the denial of service LBC had been asking RBC to marry her for nine years before RBC finally accepted in October 2012.RBC's acceptance in October 2012 of LBC's marriageproposal made LBC \"extremely happy.\" BothComplainants were excited about the cake tasting atSweetcakes because of how much they liked the cakeRespondents had made for CM's earlier wedding.However, LBC, unlike RBC, did not go to the caketasting. When CM and RBC arrived home on January 17, 2013, after their cake tasting at Sweetcakes, CM toldLBC that AK had told them that Sweetcakes did \"notdo same-sex weddings\" and that AK had told CM that\"your children are an abomination.\" LBC was\"flabbergasted\" and she became very upset and veryangry. LBC, who was raised as a Roman Catholic,recognized AK's statement as a reference fromLeviticus. She was \"shocked\" to hear that AK hadreferred to her as an \"abomination.\" Based on herreligious background, she understood the term A. \"Yes, I still experience that.\" Q. \"Was the primary harm, the harm that resulted from the refusal of service itself, persistent throughout the times where youexperienced media attention?\" \"* * * * * A. \"Yes, the harm was still present during the media attention.\"Pet.App.383\"abomination\" to mean \"this is a creature not created \u0001 by God, not created with a soul. They are unworthy of \u0001 holy love. They are not worthy of life.\" Her immediate \u0001 thought was that this never would have happened, had \u0001 she had not asked RBC to marry her. Because of that, \u0001 she felt shame. Like RBC, she also worried about how \u0001 it would affect CM's relatively recent acceptance of \u0001 RBC's sexual orientation. LBC views herself as RBC's protector. After RBC \u0001 climbed into bed, crying, LBC got into bed with RBC \u0001 and tried to soothe her. RBC became even more upset \u0001 and pushed RBC away. In response, LBC lost her \u0001 temper because she could not \"fix\" things. When LBC went back downstairs, E, the older of \u0001 Complainants' foster daughters was extremely agitated \u0001 from events at school that day. LBC tried to calm her, \u0001 but she refused to be calmed, repeatedly calling out for \u0001 RBC, with whom she had a special bond. Eventually, E \u0001 cried herself to sleep. LBC's inability to calm E was \u0001 very frustrating to her. That night, LBC was very \u0001 upset, cried a lot, and was hurt and angry. Later that \u0001 same evening, she filed her DOJ complaint. In the days immediately following January 17, \u0001 2013, LBC experienced anger, outrage, embarrassment, \u0001 exhaustion, frustration, sorrow, and shame as a \u0001 reaction to AK's denial of service. She felt sorrow \u0001 because she couldn't console E, she could not protect \u0001 RBC, and because RBC was no longer sure she wanted \u0001 to be married. Her excitement about getting married \u0001 was also lessened because she was not sure she could \u0001 protect RBC if any similar incidents occurred.Pet.App.384b.\u0001Emotional suffering from publicity about the case On February 1, 2013, LBC went to the emergency room of a local hospital because of pain from a shoulderinjury that she had suffered three weeks earlier andher concern that she might have a broken shoulder.While in the hospital, she heard that AK's refusal tomake their wedding cake was on the news. This madeher very upset and she was crying when she wasexamined by a doctor. Based on the media, potentialmedia exposure, and social media attention related toher DOJ complaint after February 1, 2013, LBC'sheadaches increased. She also felt intimidated andbecame fearful. After LBC's DOJ complaint was publicized in the media, LBC also had an \"devastating\" confrontationwith her aunt who had learned about her DOJcomplaint against Respondents through the media andthreatened to shoot LBC in the face if she ever set footon LBC's family's property again. 18 After February 1, 2013, LBC, like RBC, was also greatly concerned that their foster children would betaken away from them because of media exposure. LBC testified that she still feels emotional effects from the denial of service because E, A, and RBC\"were\" still suffering and that \"was\" tearing me apart. 19 18 LBC's intense and visceral display of emotions while testifying about her aunt's behavior made it clear that her aunt's behaviorcaused her extreme upset. 19 See footnote 7, supra . LBC testified in the past tense.Pet.App.3852. Emotional suffering damages based on media and social media attention In its closing argument, the Agency asked the forum to award Complainants $75,000 each in emotionalsuffering damages stemming directly from the denial ofservice, In addition, the Agency asked the forum toaward damages to Complainants for emotionalsuffering they experienced as a result of the media andsocial media attention generated by the case fromJanuary 29, 2013, the date AK posted LBC's DOJcomplaint on his Facebook page, up to the date ofhearing. The Agency's theory of liability is that sinceRespondents brought the case to the media's attentionand kept it there by repeatedly appearing in public tomake statements deriding Complainants, it wasforeseeable that this attention would negatively impactComplainants, making Respondents liable for anyresultant emotional suffering experienced byComplainants. The Agency also argues thatRespondents are liable for negative third party socialmedia directed at Complainants because it was aforeseeable consequence of the media attention. The Commissioner concludes that complainants' emotional harm related to the denial of servicecontinued throughout the period of media attention andthat the facts related solely to emotional harmresulting from media attention do not adequatelysupport an award of damages. No further analysisregarding the media attention as a causative factor is,therefore, necessary.Pet.App.3863. Amount of Damages There is ample evidence in the record of specific, identifiable types of emotional suffering bothComplainants experienced because of the denial ofservice. In determining an award for emotional and mental suffering, the forum considers the type ofdiscriminatory conduct, and the duration, frequency,and severity of the conduct. It also considers the typeand duration of the mental distress and thevulnerability of the aggrieved persons. The actualamount depends on the facts presented by eachaggrieved person. An aggrieved person's testimony, ifbelieved, is sufficient to support a claim for mentalsuffering damages. In the Matter of C. C. Slaughters, Ltd., 26 BOLI 186, 196 (2005). In public accommodation cases, \"the duration of thediscrimination does not determine either the degree orduration of the effects of discrimination.\" In the Matter of Westwind Group of Oregon, Inc., 17 BOLI 46, 53 (1998). In this case, the ALJ proposed that $75,000 and $60,000, are appropriate awards to compensateComplainants RBC and LBC, respectively, for theemotional suffering they experienced fromRespondents' denial of service. The proposal for LBC isless because she was not present at the denial and theALJ found her testimony about the extent and severityof her emotional suffering to be exaggerated in somerespects. In this particular case, the demeanor of thewitnesses was critical in determining both the sincerityand extent of the harm that was felt by RBC and LBC.As such, the Commissioner defers to the ALJ'sPet.App.387perception of the witnesses and evidence presented at \u0001 hearing and adopts the noneconomic award as \u0001 proposed, finding also that this noneconomic award is \u0001 consistent with the forum's prior orders.20 ORDER A.\u0001NOW, THEREFORE, as authorized by ORS \u0001 659A.850(4), and to eliminate the effects of the \u0001 violation of ORS 659A.403 by Respondent Aaron \u0001 Klein, and as payment of the damages awarded, the \u0001 Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Industries \u0001 hereby orders Respondents Aaron Klein and \u0001 Melissa Klein to deliver to the Administrative \u0001 Prosecution Unit of the Bureau of Labor and \u0001 Industries, 1045 State Office Building, 800 NE Oregon \u0001 Street, Portland, Oregon 97232-2180, a certified check 20 See, In the Matter of Andrew W.

DATED this 2 day of July , 2015. /s/ Brad Avakian, Commissioner Bureau of Labor and Industries Issued ON: July 2, 2015Pet.App.390APPENDIX FINDINGS OF FACT - PROCEDURAL 1)\u0001On August 8, 2013, R. Bowman-Cryer (\"RBC\") \u0001 filed a verified complaint with the Agency's Civil Rights \u0001 Division (\"CRD\") alleging that Aaron Klein and Melissa \u0001 Klein, dba Sweetcakes by Melissa, refused to make her \u0001 a wedding cake based on her sexual orientation and \u0001 published and displayed a communication to that \u0001 effect, in violation of ORS 659A.403 and ORS 659A.409. \u0001 RBC's complaint was subsequently amended to name \u0001 Kleins as aiders and abettors under ORS 7, 2013, L. Bowman-Cryer (\"LBC\") \u0001 filed a verified complaint with the Agency's Civil Rights \u0001 Division (\"CRD\") alleging that Aaron Klein (\"AK\") and \u0001 Melissa Klein (\"MK\"), dba Sweetcakes by Melissa, \u0001 refused to make her a wedding cake based on her \u0001 sexual orientation and published and displayed a \u0001 communication to that effect, in violation of ORS \u0001 659A.403 and ORS 659A.409. LBC's complaint was \u0001 subsequently amended to name AK and MK as aiders \u0001 and abettors under ORS 659A.406. 15, 2014, after investigating RBC's \u0001 and LBC's complaints, the CRD issued a Notice of \u0001 Substantial Evidence Determination in each case in \u0001 which the CRD found substantial evidence of unlawful \u0001 discrimination in public accommodation against \u0001 Respondents in violation of ORS 659A.403, ORS \u0001 659A.406, and ORS 659A.409 (Ex. A29) 4) On June 4, 2014, the Agency issued two sets of Formal Charges, one alleging unlawful discriminationagainst RBC (case no. 44-14) and the other allegingPet.App.391unlawful discrimination against LBC (case no. 45-14) \u0001 that alleged the following: (a) At all times material, Sweetcakes by Melissa (\"Sweetcakes\") was an assumed business name ofRespondent MK doing business in Gresham,Oregon, that offered goods and services to thepublic, including wedding cakes; (b) At all times material, AK was registered with the Oregon Sec. of State Business Registry as theauthorized representative of MK, dba Sweetcakesby Melissa; (c) On January 17, 2013, RBC and her mother went to Sweetcakes for a cake tasting related toRBC's wedding ceremony to LBC; (d) AK conducted the tasting and asked for the names of a bride and groom. RBC said there wouldbe two brides for her ceremony and gave her nameand LBC's name. AK told RBC that because Complainants were injured by Respondents' refusal to provide them with a wedding cake; (f) MK discriminated against Complainants based on their sexual orientation, in violation ofORS 659A.403(3) and ORS 659.409; (g) AK aided or abetted MK as the owner of Sweetcakes in MK's violation of ORS 659A.403(3)and ORS 659.409; thereby violating ORS 659A.406; (h) Complainants are each entitled to damages for emotional, mental, and physical suffering in thePet.App.392amount of \"at least $75,000\" and out-of-pocket \u0001 expenses \"to proven at hearing.\" (i)\u0001Respondents published or issued a \u0001 communication, notice that its accommodation, \u0001 advantages would be refused, withheld from or \u0001 denied to, or that discrimination would be made \u0001 against, a person on account of his or her sexual \u0001 orientation, in violation of ORS 659A.409. On the same day, BOLI's Contested Case Coordinator issued Notices of Hearing in both cases stating the timeand place of the hearing as August 5, 2014, beginningat 9:00 a.m., at BOLI's Portland, Oregon office. (Exs.X2, X4) 4) On June 6, 2014, Respondents filed a motion to postpone the hearing because Respondent's attorneyHerbert Grey had \"pre-paid non-refundable vacationplans\" during the time scheduled for hearing. Theforum granted Respondents' motion. (Ex. X5) 5) On June 18, 2014, Respondents, through attorneys Grey, Tyler Smith, and Anna Adams, filed an\"Election to Remove to Circuit Court (ORS659A.870(4)(b))\" and \"Alternative Motion to DisqualifyBOLI Commissioner Brad Avakian\" from decidingissues in these cases. Respondents requested oralargument on both issues. On June 25, 2014, the Agencyfiled objections to Respondents' motions. On June 26,2014, Respondents' request for oralargument. (Exs. X8, X11) 6) On June 19, 2014, the ALJ held a prehearing conference and rescheduled the hearing to start onOctober 6, 2014. The ALJ also consolidated the casesfor hearing. (Ex. X7)Pet.App.3937)\u0001On June 24, 2014, Respondents timely filed an answer and response to both sets of Formal Charges.Respondent admitted that AK had declined RBC'srequest to design and provide a cake for Complainants'same-sex ceremony but denied that any unlawfuldiscrimination occurred. Respondents raised numerousaffirmative defenses, including: The Formal Charges fail to state ultimate facts sufficient to constitute a claim. Because the Oregon Constitution did not provide for or recognize same-sex unions in January2013 and the state of Oregon did not issuemarriage licenses to same-sex couples at thattime, BOLI lacks \"any legitimate authority tocompel Respondents to engage in creativeexpression or otherwise participate in same-sexceremonies not recognized by the state of Oregoncontrary to their fundamental rights,consciences and convictions.\" BOLI is estopped from compelling Respondents to engage in free expression or otherwiseparticipate in same-sex ceremonies notrecognized by the state of Oregon contrary totheir fundamental rights, consciences andconvictions. The statutes underlying the Formal Charges are unconstitutional as applied to Respondents tothe extent they do not protect the fundamentalrights of Respondents and persons similarlysituated arising under the First and FourteenthAmendments to the United States Constitution,as applied to the state of Oregon under thePet.App.394Fourteenth Amendment, in one or more of the following particulars, by unlawfully:(a) infringing on Respondents' right ofconscience; (b) infringing on Respondents' rightto free exercise of religion; (c) infringing onRespondents' right to free speech; (d) compellingRespondents to engage in expression of amessage they do not want to express; (e) denyingRespondents' right to due process; and(f) denying Respondents the equal protection ofthe laws. The statutes underlying the Formal Charges, as applied, violate Respondents fundamental rightsarising under the Oregon Constitution in one ormore of the following particulars, by unlawfully:(a) violating Respondents' freedom of worshipand conscience under Article I, \u00a72; (b) violatingRespondents' freedom of religious opinion underArticle I, \u00a73; (c) violating Respondents' freedomof speech under Article I, \u00a78; (d) compellingRespondents to engage in expression of amessage they did not want to express;(e) violating Respondents' privileges andimmunities under Article I, \u00a720; and (f) violatingArticle XV, \u00a73. The statutes underlying the Formal Charges are facially unconstitutional in that they violateRespondents' fundamental rights arising underthe Oregon Constitution to the extent there is noreligious exemption to protect or acknowledgethe fundamental rights of Respondents andpersons similarly situated. Respondents also raised fo ur Counterclaims, including:Pet.App.395 Respondents are entitled to costs and attorney fees if they are determined to be the prevailingparty. The State of Oregon, acting by and through BOLI, has knowingly and selectively actedunder color of state law to deprive Respondentsof their fundamental constitutional andstatutory rights in the basis of religion withouttaking similar action against county clerks andother state of Oregon officials similarly denyingsame-sex couples goods and services related tosame-sex unions, disparately impactingRespondents, causing economic damages toRespondents in an amount not less than$100,000. BOLI has knowingly and selectivelyacted under color of state law to depriveRespondents of their fundamental constitutionaland statutory rights in the basis of religionwithout taking similar action against countyclerks and other state of Oregon officialssimilarly denying same-sex couples goods andservices related to same-sex unions, disparatelyimpacting Respondents and causing economicdamages to Respondents in an amount not lessthan $100,000. During the period from February 5, 2013 to the present, BOLI's Commissioner published,circulated, issued, displayed, or cause to bepublished, circulated, issued, displayed,communications on Facebook and in print mediato the effect that its accommodations,advantages, facilities, services or privilegeswould be refused, withheld from or denied to, orPet.App.396that discrimination would be made against \u0001 Respondents and other persons similarly \u0001 situated on the basis of religion in violation of \u0001 ORS 659A.409. Under 42 USC \u00a7 1983, BOLI is liable to Respondents for depriving Respondents of theirrights and protections guaranteed by the UnitedStates Constitution \"under color of any statute,ordinance, regulation, custom or usage of anyState.\" (Ex. X10) 8) On July 2, 2014, the ALJ issued an interim order ruling on Respondents' June 18, 2014, motions. Thatorder is reprinted below in pertinent part. 21 \"Respondents' Putative Election to Circuit Court \"Respondents assert that they have a 'unqualified right to have these matters removed tothe circuit court of either Clackamas, Marion orMultnomah Counties pursuant to ORS659A.870(4)(b).' ORS 659A.870(4)(b) provides, inpertinent part: '(b) A respondent or complainant named in a complaint filed under ORS 659A.820 or659A.825 alleging an unlawful practice underORS 659A.145 or 659A.421 or discrimination 21 Footnotes from this interim order and other interim orders quoted at length in the Proposed Findings of Fact - Proceduralthat are not critical to an understanding of the order have beendeleted.

The election must be made in writing \u0001 and received by the commissioner within 20 \u0001 days after service of formal charges under ORS \u0001 659A.845. If the respondent or the complainant \u0001 makes the election, the commissioner shall \u0001 pursue the matter in court on behalf of the \u0001 complainant at no cost to the complainant.' \"To establish jurisdiction, the Agency's Formal Charges each allege: (1) both cases originated asverified complaints filed by Complainants RachelCryer and Laurel Bowman-Cryer; (2) bothComplainants were authorized to file theircomplaints under the provisions of ORS 659A.820;and (3) that the Agency issued a Notice ofSubstantial Evidence Determination in both cases.Respondents deny that they engaged indiscrimination based on sexual orientation or anyother grounds set forth in ORS chapter 659A but donot dispute these jurisdictional allegations.Accordingly, the forum concludes that respondentswere named in a complaint filed under ORS659A.820. Under ORS 659A.870(4)(b), if the FormalCharges allege an unlawful practice under ORS659A.145 or 659A.421 or discrimination underfederal housing law, Respondents are entitled toelect to have the matter heard in circuit court underORS 659A.885, subject to the requirement that suchelection must be made in writing within 20 days ofservice of the Formal Charges. \"ORS 659A.145 is titled ' Discrimination against individual with disability in realPet.App.398property transactions prohibited; advertising \u0001 discriminatory preference prohibited; \u0001 allowance for reasonable modification; \u0001 assisting discriminatory practices prohibited. '\u0001 As indicated by its title, the provisions of ORS \u0001 659A.145 are exclusively limited to real property \u0001 transactions involving people with disabilities. ORS \u0001 659A.421 is titled ' Discrimination in selling, \u0001 renting or leasing real property prohibited '\u0001 and prohibits discrimination in real property \u0001 transactions based on the race, color, religion, sex, \u0001 sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, \u0001 familial status or source of income of any person. \"In contrast, these cases allege violations of ORS \u0001 659A.403(3), ORS 659A.406, and ORS 659A.409. All \u0001 three of these statutes appear in a section of ORS \u0001 chapter 659A titled ' ACCESS TO PUBLIC \u0001 ACCOMMODATIONS ' that includes ORS \u0001 659A.400 to ORS 659A.415. Neither of the Formal \u0001 Charges contains any allegations related to \u0001 discrimination under federal housing law or \u0001 discrimination based on real property transactions. \u0001 Rather, the Formal Charges both identify \u0001 Respondent Melissa Klein's business as a 'place of \u0001 public accommodation' and allege that Respondent \u0001 Melissa Klein's business, as a public \u0001 accommodation, discriminated against \u0001 Complainants based on their sexual orientation. \"Since the Formal Charges do not allege an \u0001 unlawful practice under ORS 659A.145 or 659A.421 \u0001 or discrimination under federal housing law, they \u0001 are not subject to the provisions of ORS \u0001 659A.870(4)(b) and Respondents have no statutoryPet.App.399right to elect to have the matter heard in circuit \u0001 court. \"MOTION TO DISQUALIFY BOLI \u0001 COMMISSIONER AVAKIAN BASED ON \u0001 AVAKIAN'S ACTUAL BIAS \"Respondents ask that Commissioner Avakian \u0001 be disqualified from deciding the issues presented \u0001 in the Formal Charges because he has 'publicly \u0001 demonstrated actual bias against Respondents and \u0001 others similarly situated, both as a candidate for re-election and as Commissioner.' Based on that \u0001 alleged actual bias, Respondents contend that the \u0001 Commissioner's fulfillment of his statutory role by \u0001 deciding and issuing a Final Order in these cases \u0001 will deprive Respondents of due process and other \u0001 constitutional rights. Respondents concede that \u0001 BOLI administrative rules OAR 839-050-000 et seq\u0001 contain no provision related to the disqualification \u0001 of a BOLI Commissioner deciding and issuing a \u0001 Final Order. However, both Respondents and the \u0001 Agency acknowledge that procedural due process \u0001 requires a decision maker free of actual bias ^ and\u0001 that Respondents have the burden of showing that \u0001 bias.

As a result, Oregon's law will \u0001 continue to say that no corporation can deny \u0001 service, housing or employment based on sexual \u0001 orientation or gender identity.

The vast majority of exhibits fall \u0001 into the first category. Only two exhibits fall into \u0001 the second category -- the Commissioner's February \u0001 5, 2013, Facebook post and the August 14, 2013, \u0001 Oregonian article. \"ORS chapter 659A contains Oregon's anti- discrimination laws related to employment, public \u0001 accommodations, and real property transactions \u0001 and delegates the enforcement of those laws to \u0001 BOLI's Commissioner. The Legislature's purpose in \u0001 adopting the provisions of ORS chapter 659A is set \u0001 out in ORS 659A.003. In pertinent part, ORS \u0001 659A.003 provides that: 'The purpose of this chapter is * * * to ensure the human dignity of all people within this state andprotect their health, safety and morals from theconsequences of intergroup hostility, tensionsand practices of unlawful discrimination of anykind based on race, color, religion, sex, sexualorientation, national origin, marital status, age,disability or familial status.' \"ORS 651.030(1) provides that '[t]he Bureau of Labor and Industries shall be under the control ofthe Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor andIndustries * * *.' As such, BOLI's Commissioner hasthe duty to see that the stated purpose of ORSchapter 659A is carried out. In addition to enforcingthe various statutes contained in that chapterthrough the administrative process created by thePet.App.407Legislature, ^22 the Commissioner's duties include, \u0001 among other things, initiating programs of 'public \u0001 education calculated to eliminate attitudes upon \u0001 which practices of unlawful discrimination because \u0001 of * * * sexual orientation * * * are based.' ^ In\u0001 short, the Commissioner has been instructed by the \u0001 Legislature itself to raise public awareness about \u0001 practices that the Legislature has declared to be \u0001 unlawful discrimination in ORS chapter 659A. The \u0001 forum finds that all of the Commissioner's remarks \u0001 contained in the first category - remarks generally \u0001 opposing discrimination against gays and lesbians \u0001 and advocating the legality of same-sex marriage in \u0001 Oregon - fall within the scope of this particular job \u0001 duty. As more articulately stated by the Agency in \u0001 its objections, '[n]one of this material is inconsistent \u0001 with the exercise of the commissioner's statutory \u0001 obligations as an elected official.' \"The forum next examines the two exhibits that \u0001 fall within the second category that contain \u0001 remarks specific to the present cases - the \u0001 Commissioner's February 5, 2013, Facebook post \u0001 and the August 14, 2013, Oregonian article. The \u0001 Commissioner's February 5, 2013, Facebook post \u0001 contains the following content, consisting of a link \u0001 to 'Ace of Cakes offers free wedding cake for Ore. \u0001 gay couple www.kgw.com' and the following remark \u0001 by the Commissioner that Respondents contend \u0001 shows actual bias: 'Everyone has a right to their religious beliefs, but that doesn't mean they can disobey laws 22 See footnote 21.Pet.App.408already in place.

Board of Chiropractic Examiners , 77 Or App 53, 712 P2d 132 (1985), Samuel, achiropractor, had his chiropractor's licensesuspended and his right to perform minor surgerypermanently revoked by the Board of ChiropracticExaminers after he performed a vasectomy on apatient. The issue before the Board was whetherSamuels had exceeded the scope of his license byperforming 'major' surgery, whereas chiropractorsPet.App.409are only allowed to perform 'minor' surgery. In their \u0001 decision, the Oregon Court of Appeals, after \u0001 determining that a vasectomy was 'major' surgery, \u0001 considered whether the Board's decision should be \u0001 overturned based on the alleged bias of two \u0001 members of the Board, Bolin and Camerer, who \u0001 participated in the disciplinary hearing and \u0001 resulting decision to suspend Samuels. Prior to \u0001 Samuels's hearing, Bolin opined that a vasectomy \u0001 was not minor surgery. The Court, citing Trade\u0001 Comm'n v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683 (1948), \u0001 held that Bolin's expression of opinion, which the \u0001 Court characterized as 'a preconceived point of view \u0001 concerning an issue of law' -- was 'not an \u0001 independent basis for disqualification' of Bolin. \u0001 Camerer, in contrast, met with four chiropractors at \u0001 a restaurant, brought the Board's file on Samuels, \u0001 and allowed the other chiropractors to examine it. \u0001 Prior to the Board's suspension decision, Samuels \u0001 sought censure against Camerer and sued Camerer \u0001 for disclosing the contents of the file. The Court \u0001 held: 'As a defendant in the lawsuit which arose out of the very matter pending before the Board,Camerer may have harbored some animositytowards [Samuels]. The possibility of personalanimosity and the appearance of a substantialbasis for bias is sufficient that, under thecircumstances, he should have disqualifiedhimself.' \"To show that the Commissioner has prejudged the cases before the Forum, Respondents quote theCommissioner's two category' statements asPet.App.410follows: be \"rehabilitated.\"' However, this 'quote' \u0001 combines selected portions of remarks made at two \u0001 different times and misquotes the latter. \u0001 Respondents seek to create an inference of bias that \u0001 cannot reasonably be drawn from Respondents' \u0001 exhibits as a whole. The Forum finds that the \u0001 accurately quoted 'second category' remarks, while \u0001 made in the context of Respondents' alleged \u0001 discriminatory actions and the Complainants' \u0001 complaints, are remarks reflecting the \u0001 Commissioner's attitude generally about enforcing \u0001 Oregon's anti-discrimination laws and, at most, \u0001 show 'a preconceived point of view concerning an \u0001 issue of law' that, under Samuels , is not a basis for \u0001 disqualification due to bias. \"RESPONDENTS' ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS \"In addition to their 'actual bias' argument, Respondents contend that the Commissioner shouldbe disqualified for two other reasons: (1) TheCommissioner's participation as a decision maker inthese cases would violate the policy expressed inORS 244.010 regarding ethical standards for publicofficials because of his conflict of interest; and(2) His participation as a decision maker in thesecases would violate Oregon Rules of ProfessionalConduct (ORPC) 3.6 related to lawyers makingpublic statements about matters in litigation 23 and Oregon's Code of Judicial Ethics. ^ 23 Commissioner Avakian is an attorney and a member of the Oregon State Bar.Pet.App.411\"Ethical Standards for Public Officials - ORS \u0001 chapter 244 & Conflict of Interest \"Respondents contend that the Commissioner's \u0001 actual bias and conflict of interest demonstrate a \u0001 partiality towards these cases that requires the \u0001 Commissioner to disqualify himself from this case. \u0001 As noted earlier, Respondents have not \u0001 demonstrated actual bias on the Commissioner's \u0001 part. Respondents assert that, under ORS chapter \u0001 244, 'the state of Oregon and its respective agencies, \u0001 including BOLI, cannot ethically sit in judgment of \u0001 Respondents for conduct of which it may be legally \u0001 culpable,' and cite the following 'multiple conflicts \u0001 of interest on the part of the Commissioner and \u0001 BOLI as grounds for disqualification: '(1) [T]he Oregon Constitution and ORS 659A.003, et seq, not to mention the U.S. Constitution, require BOLI to respect andprotect Respondents' constitutionally-protectedreligion, conscience and speech rights to an evengreater degree than it does complainants'statutory rights; and '(2) [T]he State of Oregon, including BOLI itself, has potential legal liability as a place ofpublic accommodation under ORS659A.400(1)(b) and (c) because, at the time of theoriginal defense and the filing of complaints bycomplainants, the state of Oregon itself refusedto recognize same sex marriage relationships,just as Respondents have chosen not toparticipate in complainants' same-sex ceremony.'Pet.App.412\"'Conflict of interest'\" is defined chapter 244 in ORS 244.020: '(1) \"Actual conflict of interest\" means any action or any decision or recommendation by a personacting in a capacity as a public official, the effectof which would be to the private pecuniarybenefit or detriment of the person or the person'srelative or any business with which the personor a relative of the person is associated unlessthe pecuniary benefit or detriment arises out ofcircumstances described in subsection (12) ofthis section.

The sameday, the ALJ issued an interim order requiring casesummaries and setting a filing deadline of September22, 2014. (Ex. X14 ) 24 See ORS 1.210 - \"Judicial officer defined. A judicial officer is a person authorized to act as a judge in a court of justice.\" BOLI doesnot operate a \"court of justice,\" but is an administrative agencywhose contested case proceedings are regulated by the Administrative Procedures Act, ORS 183.411 to ORS 183.470.Pet.App.41410)\u0001On August 25, 2014, Respondents moved to postpone the hearing based on Respondents'prescheduled plans to be out of town on October 6,2014. The Agency did not object and the ALJ reset thehearing to begin on October 7, 2014. (Ex. X17, X18 ) 11) On September 4, 2014, Respondents filed motions to depose Complainants and CherylMcPherson and for a discovery order related to theAgency's objections to Respondents' informal discoveryrequest for admissions, interrogatory responses, anddocuments. The Agency filed timely objections to bothmotions. (Exs. X20 through X24) 12) On September 11, 2014, the Agency moved for a discovery order for the production of four types ofdocuments. (Ex. X25 ) 13) On September 15, 2014, Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment \"on each or all of theclaims asserted against them.\" (Ex. X26) 14) On September 16, 2014, the Agency moved for a Protective Order regarding Complainants' medicalrecords both informally requested by Respondents andin Respondents' motion for a discovery order. TheAgency attached five pages of medical records relatedto LBC and asked that the forum conduct an in camera inspection \"to determine what, if any, of theinformation contained within these records is relevantor calculated to lead to the discovery of admissibleevidence and must be turned over to Respondents.\"After conducting an in camera review, the ALJ made minor redactions unrelated to LBC's medical diagnosisand released the records to accompaniedby a Order. (Exs. X27, X44 )Pet.App.41515)\u0001The ALJ held a prehearing conference on September 18, 2014. After the conference, the ALJissued an interim order summarizing his oral rulings,including his decision to postpone the hearing to givehim time to rule on Respondents' motion for summaryjudgment before the hearing began. (Ex. X32) 16) On September 24, 2014, the Agency filed Amended Formal Charges in both cases. (Ex. X38 ) 17) On September 25, 2014, the ALJ issued an interim order ruling on Respondents' motion for adiscovery order for documents, interrogatory responses,and admissions. In pertinent part, the ruling read: \"As an initial matter, the Agency argues that Complainants are not subject to discovery rulesunder OAR 839-050-0020 because they are not'parties' and therefore are not 'participants' underOAR 839-050-0200(1). In numerous prior cases withthe forum * * * a respondent has been allowed torequest a discovery order to obtain documents andinformation from a complainant through the Agencythat are discoverable under OAR 839-050-0020(7).See In the Matter of Toltec , 8 BOLI at 152 (noting that although the complainant was not a party,complainant still was 'a compellable witness' andthe Agency was ordered to produce evidence overwhich it had power or authority). See also In the Matter of Columbia Components, Inc., 32 BOLI 257, 259-61 (2013)(requiring complainant to verify thatthe interrogatory responses were true, and thatcomplainant respond to a specific interrogatoryrequest to which the Agency had objected); In the Matter of Dr. Andrew Engel, DMD, PC, 32 BOLI 94, 100 (2012) (requiring the Agency to produce anyPet.App.416documents responsive to respondents' requests that \u0001 appeared reasonably likely to produce information \u0001 generally relevant to the case, including \u0001 complainant's tax returns for relevant years). A. \"Interrogatories \"Respondents requested an order requiring the Agency to fully respond to four separateinterrogatories. To the extent this order requires Complainants, through the Agency, to respond to the interrogatories, Complainants must sign them under oath as required by OAR 839-050-0200(6) . \"Interrogatory No. 7 \"Respondents requested that the Agency explain in detail the nature of the physical harmComplainants allege in the Formal Charges('Charges'). The Agency responded that bothComplainants experienced 'varying physicalmanifestations of stress' and that '[a]ny furthermedical information will be provided pursuant to aprotective order.' I agree that Respondents areentitled to know more specifically what physicaldamages have been allegedly sustained. I order theAgency to have Complainants, through the Agency,respond to this interrogatory. \"Interrogatory No. 8 \"Respondents requested an explanation 'in detail [of] the nature of the mental harm Complainantsalleged resulted from the events alleged in theComplaint.' The Agency objected on the groundsthat the request was redundant and vague, as itwas unclear how the interrogatory differed from thePet.App.417interrogatory asking for information as to emotional \u0001 harm allegedly suffered by Complainants. In its \u0001 response to the motion, the Agency 'stipulates' that \u0001 'emotional, mental' suffering is any suffering not \u0001 attributed to physical suffering, and that \u0001 information was provided in response to \u0001 Interrogatory No. 6. Based on the Agency's \u0001 stipulation that 'emotional [and] mental' suffering \u0001 are the same, the response to this Interrogatory \u0001 appears to be sufficient and, therefore, I DENY \u0001 Respondents' request for additional information in \u0001 response to this interrogatory. \"Interrogatory No. 11 \"This interrogatory also relates to damages. \u0001 With this interrogatory, Respondents requested an \u0001 explanation as to the actions taken by \u0001 Complainants to remove their public social media \u0001 profiles after a complaint was filed with the \u0001 Department of Justice on January 18, 2013. The \u0001 Agency objected on the basis of relevancy. \u0001 Respondents assert that this request is relevant \u0001 because '[m]uch, if not all of the damage \u0001 Complainants have alleged to this point revolve \u0001 around the media attention they received as a \u0001 result of Complainant Laurel Bowman-Cryer's filing \u0001 a Complaint with the Department of Justice.' \u0001 Respondents further assert that Complainants have \u0001 told Respondents they had to travel out of town \u0001 because of attention and publicity. Respondents \u0001 claim that the removal of social media profiles is \u0001 relevant to the assessment of damages or mitigation \u0001 of damages. In its response to the motion, the \u0001 Agency reiterates its objection on the basis ofPet.App.418relevance, but does not directly address the \u0001 arguments made in Respondents' motion as to \u0001 damages allegedly caused by publicity and media \u0001 attention. On September 22, 2014, the Agency \u0001 timely filed a statement addressing this issue. In \u0001 pertinent part, the Agency stated: \"Respondents caused substantial harm to Complainants, in part, through their intentionalposting of the Department of Justice complainton their social media website, which includedComplainants' home address. This affectedComplainants by exposing them to unwantedand, sometimes, unnerving contact from thepublic. * * * Complainants have had little to nocontact with media, except through theirattorney Mr. Paul Thompson. * * * The agency'sposition is that Complainants' damages were adirect result of Respondents intentionallyposting the DOJ complaint on the Internet.\" Based on the information and representations before me, I am unable to determine at this time ifInterrogatory No. 11 is 'reasonably likely to produceinformation that is generally relevant to the case.'Therefore, the Agency is not required to respond tothis interrogatory. If Respondents establish therelevance of this interrogatory in their depositionsof Complainants, Respondents may renew theirmotion for a discovery order regarding thisinterrogatory. \"Interrogatory No. 12 \"Respondents have requested an explanation 'in detail [of] any involvement or communicationPet.App.419Complainants had with any group involved in \u0001 boycotting Respondents' business.' The Agency \u0001 objected on the basis of relevance, over breadth, and \u0001 because the requested information is outside the \u0001 possession or control of the agency. As to relevancy, \u0001 I view this request as similar to Interrogatory No. \u0001 11.\u0001Based on the information and representations \u0001 before me, I am unable to determine at this time if \u0001 Interrogatory No. 12 is reasonably likely to produce \u0001 information that is generally relevant to the case. \u0001 Therefore, the Agency is not required to respond to \u0001 this interrogatory. If Respondents establish the \u0001 relevance of this interrogatory in their depositions \u0001 of Complainants, Respondents may renew their \u0001 motion for a discovery order regarding this \u0001 interrogatory. \"B. Production of Documents \"* * * * * \"Request No. 2 \"Respondents requested a copy of records 'in the \u0001 Agency's possession' as to the state policy in \u0001 January of 2013 for issuing marriage licenses to \u0001 same sex couples. The Agency objected on the basis \u0001 of relevance and also states that such documents \u0001 are not within the possession or control of the \u0001 Agency. Respondents claim such documents are \u0001 relevant to show whether the \"Agency is aware\" \u0001 that same sex marriage was not recognized in \u0001 Oregon at the time of the acts in question in this \u0001 case. I deny Respondents' motion because (1) the \u0001 Agency's awareness of the status of same sex \u0001 marriage in Oregon is not likely to lead to relevantPet.App.420evidence ^; (2) the same sex marriage laws in \u0001 Oregon are a matter of public record; and (3) the \u0001 Agency has indicated it has no such documents in \u0001 its possession. \"Request No. 7 \"This request seeks medical records for any \u0001 medical visits relating to Complainants' request for \u0001 emotional, mental or physical damages. \u0001 Respondents' motion is GRANTED. * * * \"Request No. 9 \"Each of these requests for production seeks \u0001 documentation and photographs of the actual \u0001 wedding cake served at Complainants' wedding \u0001 ceremony. The Agency objected to these requests on \u0001 the basis of relevancy. The fact that a cake was \u0001 purchased from another cake baker is likely \u0001 relevant and, thus, I grant this motion only as to a \u0001 receipt or invoice for showing the purchase of the \u0001 cake and one photograph of the cake. Any other \u0001 requested information is overly broad. Furthermore, \u0001 for the reasons set forth below regarding Request \u0001 for Production No. 10, the Agency need not produce \u0001 photographs of Complainants, their families, and \u0001 the actual wedding ceremony. \"Request No. 10 \"In this request, Respondents have asked for \u0001 photos, videos, or audio recordings of Complainants' \u0001 wedding ceremony. The Agency has objected on the \u0001 grounds that the requested documents are \u0001 irrelevant. The Agency further explains that \u0001 Complainants are wary of turning over thesePet.App.421materials to Respondents because Respondents \u0001 previously posted Complainants' home address on \u0001 a social media site. Unless the Agency is intending \u0001 to offer photos, videos or audio recordings as \u0001 evidence at the hearing, then I agree with the \u0001 Agency's objections and DENY the motion as to \u0001 these documents.

This request is DENIED for the same \u0001 reasons set out in my denial to Request for \u0001 Production No. 2 . (Ex. X41) 18) On September 25, 2014, the ALJ issued an interim order ruling on Respondents' motion for adiscovery order for depositions. In pertinent part, theruling read: \"Complainants Laurel Bowman-Cryer and Rachel Cryer \"I agree with the Agency that, given the availability of other discovery methods, the forumtypically does not allow for depositions, as well asthe fact that the Agency typically produces aninvestigative file with detailed notes of interviewsof witnesses. However, this case poses two uniquecircumstances. First, based on the information Ihave received to date from Respondents and theAgency, I have been unable to determine whether ornot information and documents sought in responseto Interrogatories Nos. 11 and 12 and Requests forProduction Nos. 12 and 23 are reasonably likely toproduce information that is generally relevant tothe case. If so, it may result in the production ofevidence that bears a significant relationship toComplainants' alleged damages. Respondentsshould be able to ascertain this in a deposition and,as stated in my interim order related to thoseInterrogatories and Requests for the Production,may renew their request for a discovery order ifthey can show that testimony given during thedepositions shows those requests are reasonablyPet.App.426likely to produce information is generally relevant \u0001 to the case. I also note that there appears to be a \u0001 unique damages claim for reimbursement of \u0001 expenses for out-of-town trips to Seattle, Tacoma \u0001 (two trips), and Lincoln City, with expenses for \u0001 lodging, gas, and food at a number of \u0001 establishments. As Respondents point out in their \u0001 motion, they 'would use all of their 25 \u0001 interrogatories just trying to determine exactly how \u0001 one or two of these alleged expenses was at all \u0001 related to Respondents' alleged unlawful conduct.' \u0001 I am persuaded by Respondents that they have \u0001 sought informal discovery on the issue of damages \u0001 through other methods and do not have adequate \u0001 information as to damages. \"In this unusual set of circumstances, I find that \u0001 Respondents should be permitted to briefly depose \u0001 Complainants, with the scope of the depositions \u0001 limited to Complainants' claim for damages. Unless \u0001 unexpected circumstances arise that require an \u0001 ALJ's intervention, the depositions should take no \u0001 longer than 90 minutes per Complainant. After the \u0001 scheduled September 29, 2014, prehearing \u0001 conference in this matter, the forum will issue a \u0001 subsequent order stating a deadline for when the \u0001 depositions should be completed. The Agency and \u0001 Complainants' counsel are instructed to cooperate \u0001 with Respondents so that the depositions can be \u0001 conducted by that deadline. Respondents are \u0001 responsible for any court reporter costs associated \u0001 with the deposition, and Respondents and the \u0001 Agency must each pay for their own copy of \u0001 transcripts if transcripts are prepared.Pet.App.427\"Cheryl McPherson \"Respondents argue that they are entitled to \u0001 depose Cheryl McPherson, a material witness in \u0001 this case, because they: \"strongly dispute some of the factual claims made by the complainants, Respondents need toknow whether Cheryl McPherson will validatecomplainant's (sic) testimony under oath beforethe hearing. * * * In this case, multiple partiesto the same conversations recall substantiallydifferent events, and subtle differences inretelling will substantially affect a credibilitydetermination that Administrative Law Judgemust make. Without being able to compare suchtestimony prior to hearing, the Respondents aresubstantially prejudiced.\" \"I do not find that Respondents have demonstrated the need to depose witness CherylMcPherson. I note that Respondents are typicallyprovided with notes from investigative interviews ofwitnesses. Neither the Agency nor Respondentshave provided information as to whether thatoccurred in this case. However, unless Respondentsdid not receive the usual investigative notes of theAgency's interview with Cheryl McPherson or nosuch notes exist because McPherson was neverinterviewed, I deny Respondents' request to takeher deposition.\" (Ex. X42) 19) On September 25, 2014, the ALJ issued a discovery order requiring Respondents to producePet.App.428documents in three of the four categories sought by the \u0001 Agency in its September 11, 2014, motion. (Ex. X43 ) 20)\u0001On September 29, 2014, the ALJ held a \u0001 prehearing conference. During the conference, \u0001 mutually acceptable new hearing dates, discovery \u0001 status and a possible alternative to depositions, and \u0001 filing deadlines were discussed and the ALJ made \u0001 several rulings, summarized in a September 30, 2014 \u0001 interim order that stated: \"(1) Subject to the availability of Respondents and Complainants, the hearing is reset to begin at 9:00a.m. on Tuesday, March 10, 2015, at the TualatinOffice of Administrative Hearings. If the hearing isnot concluded by late afternoon on Friday, March13, the hearing will reconvene at 9:00 a.m. onTuesday, March 17, 2015, at the same location. TheAgency and Respondents' counsel will let me knowthis week of the availability of Respondents andComplainants on those dates. \"(2) Respondents have until October 2, 2014, to file answers to the Amended Formal Charges. \"(3) The Discovery ordered in my rulings on the Agency's and Respondents' motions for DiscoveryOrders must be mailed or hand-delivered no laterthan October 14, 2014. This does not includeComplainants' depositions. \"(4) My order requiring Complainants to submit to depositions by Respondents is 'on hold' for thepresent. \"(5) As a potential means for avoiding the necessity of depositions, Respondents proposed thatPet.App.429they be allowed to serve 30 additional \u0001 interrogatories to the Agency for Complainants' \u0001 responses. The Agency objected to 30 but agreed to \u0001 25.\u0001I agreed and ruled that Respondents could serve \u0001 25 additional interrogatories to the Agency for \u0001 Complainants' response, with the responses due 14 \u0001 days after the date of service. At the Agency's \u0001 request, I also ruled that, should they elect to do so, \u0001 the Agency may also serve up to 25 interrogatories \u0001 to Respondents' counsel for Respondents' response, \u0001 noting that the Agency is also entitled to do that \u0001 under the rules since they have issued no prior \u0001 interrogatories. \"(6)\u0001Case Summaries must be filed no later than \u0001 February 24, 2015. \"(7)\u0001We also discussed the most efficient means of \u0001 procedure regarding Respondents' motion for \u0001 summary judgment and the Agency's pending \u0001 response, considering the fact that the Agency has \u0001 filed Amended Formal Charges since Respondents \u0001 filed a motion for summary judgment. Respondents' \u0001 counsel stated their intention in filing the motion \u0001 was to resolve both cases in their entirety, if \u0001 possible. After discussion, I ruled that the Agency \u0001 did not need to respond to Respondents' pending \u0001 motion for summary judgment and I will not rule on \u0001 that motion. Rather, Respondents will file another \u0001 motion for summary judgment that will incorporate \u0001 the matters raised in the Amended Formal Charges \u0001 so that all outstanding issues can be addressed in \u0001 my ruling on Respondents' motion. It was mutually \u0001 agreed that Respondents could have until October \u0001 24, 2014, to file an amended motion for summaryPet.App.430judgment and that the Agency would have until \u0001 November 21, 2014, to file its written response. \u0001 Accordingly, I order that Respondents must file \u0001 their amended motion for summary judgment no \u0001 later than October 24, 2014, and the Agency must \u0001 file its response no later than November 21, 2014. \u0001 Respondents' counsel asked if oral argument would \u0001 be allowed on the motion and I ruled that it would \u0001 not. \"(8)\u0001The Agency stipulated that it is not seeking \u0001 reimbursement for the out-of-pocket expenses listed \u0001 in response to Respondents' Interrogatory #16. In \u0001 response to my question, the Agency stated that it \u0001 is not willing to stipulate that those trips are not \u0001 relevant to the issue of damages.\" (Ex. X50 ) 21) On October 2, 2014, Respondents filed Answers to the Agency's Amended Formal Charges.(Ex. X51) 22) On October 24, 2014, Respondents re-filed their motions for summary judgment. (Ex. X53) 23) On November 21, 2014, the Agency filed a response to Respondents' motion for summaryjudgment and a cross-motion for partial summaryjudgment \"on the same issues moved upon byRespondents.\" (Ex. X54) 24) On December 8, 2014, the Agency filed a second motion for a discovery order. On December 15,2014, Respondents filed a response stating that theyhad \"now provided the Agency with all responsivedocuments * * * not subject to the attorney-clientPet.App.431privilege.\" On December 18, 2014, the Agency withdrew \u0001 its motion for a discovery order, stating that \u0001 Respondents had satisfied the Agency's request for \u0001 production. (Ex. X57) 25)\u0001On December 19, 2014, Respondents filed a \u0001 response to the Agency's cross-motion for summary \u0001 judgment. (Ex.

(Ex. X64) 27)\u0001On January 15, 2014, Respondents renewed \u0001 their motion to depose Complainants, based on part on \u0001 Complainant's alleged inadequate responses to \u0001 Respondents second set of interrogatories. On January \u0001 22, 2014, the Agency objected to Respondents' motion. \u0001 On January 29, 2014, the ALJ issued an interim order \u0001 instructing Respondents to provide a copy of the \u0001 interrogatories and the Agency's responses before January 29, 2015, ALJ an interim order ruling on Respondents' re-filed motion forsummary judgment and the Agency's cross-motion forsummary judgment. The interim order is reprintedverbatim below, pursuant to OAR 839-050-0150(4)(b): \"Introduction \"Respondents operate a bakery under the name of Sweetcakes by Melissa. 25 These cases arise from Respondents' refusal to provide a wedding cake forComplainants Rachel and LaurelBowman-Cryer Klein') and Melissa Klein ('M.Klein') learned that the wedding would be a same-sex wedding. \"As an initial matter, the forum notes Respondents' request for oral argument with regardto their motion.

Klein listed as the authorized representative.Pet.App.433orientation and that A. Klein aided and abetted M. \u0001 Klein, thereby violating ORS 659A.406. The \u0001 Charges further alleged that M. Klein and A. Klein, \u0001 who was acting on behalf of M. Klein, 'published, \u0001 circulated, issued or displayed or caused to be \u0001 published, circulated, issued or displayed, a \u0001 communication, notice, advertisement or sign to the \u0001 effect that its accommodations, advantages, \u0001 facilities, services or privileges would be refused, \u0001 withheld from or denied to, or that discrimination \u0001 would be made against, a person on account of his \u0001 or her sexual orientation,' causing M.

The Agency sought$75,000 in damages for 'emotional, mental, and \u0001 physical suffering' for each Complainant, plus 'out \u0001 of pocket expenses to be proven at hearing.' On \u0001 June 19, 2014, the ALJ consolidated the two cases \u0001 for hearing. \"Respondents, through joint counsel Herbert \u0001 Grey, Tyler Smith, and Anna Adams (now Anna \u0001 Harmon), timely filed Answers to both sets of \u0001 Formal Charges, raising numerous affirmative \u0001 defenses and four counterclaims. \"On September 15, 2014, Respondents filed a \u0001 motion for summary judgment with respect to both \u0001 sets of Charges, based primarily on legal argument \u0001 supporting the constitutional affirmative defenses \u0001 raised in their Answers. On September 16, 2014, \u0001 the Agency moved for an extension of time to \u0001 respond to Respondents' motion until September 26, \u0001 2014. On September 17, 2014, the ALJ granted thePet.App.434Agency's motion. On September 17, 2014, the ALJ \u0001 held a prehearing conference in which it became \u0001 apparent that he had ruled on the Agency's motion \u0001 before Respondents had seen the motion. \u0001 Accordingly, the ALJ gave Respondents an \u0001 opportunity to file objections. On September 18, \u0001 2014, Respondents filed objections to Agency's \u0001 motion for extension. On September 22, 2014, the \u0001 ALJ issued an interim order that sustained his \u0001 September 17, 2014, order. \"On September 24, 2014, the Agency amended \u0001 both sets of Charges to allege that M.

During the conference, the \u0001 participants discussed the most efficient means of \u0001 proceeding regarding Respondents' motion for \u0001 summary judgment and the Agency's pending \u0001 response, considering the fact that the Agency had \u0001 filed Amended Formal Charges ('Charges') since \u0001 Respondents filed their motion for summary \u0001 judgment. After discussion, it was agreed that, \u0001 instead of the Agency filing a response to \u0001 Respondents' original motion, it would be more \u0001 efficient for Respondents to file an amended motion 26 The Agency's amended Charges did not allege that A. Klein violated ORS 659A.409.Pet.App.435for summary judgment that would incorporate the \u0001 matters raised in the Charges so that all \u0001 outstanding issues could be addressed in the ALJ's \u0001 ruling on Respondents' motion. It was mutually \u0001 agreed that Respondents could have until October \u0001 24, 2014, to file an amended motion for summary \u0001 judgment and that the Agency would have until \u0001 November 21, 2014, to file its response. \"On October 2, 2014, Respondents filed Amended \u0001 Answers ('Answers') to the Charges.

Klein appear midway in the broadcast,standing together outdoors, and make thefollowing statements: 28 29 A. Klein : 'I didn't want to be a part of her marriage, which I think is wrong.' M. Klein : 'I am who I am and I want to live my life the way I want to live my lifeand, you know, I choose to serve God.' 30 28 There is nothing in the video to show whether these statements were made in response to a question or if it was part of a longerinterview. 29 This transcript was made by the ALJ from a DVD provided to the forum by Respondents. The DVD includes the September 2,2013, CBN video, and an mp4 recording of a February 13, 2014, interview with Tony Perkins. 30 M. Klein's statement is only included to provide context, as the Agency did not allege that her statement was a violation of Oregonlaw.Pet.App.441A.\u0001Klein : 'It's one of those things where \u0001 you never want to see something you've \u0001 put so much work into go belly up, but on \u0001 the other hand, um, I have faith in the \u0001 Lord and he's taken care of us up to this \u0001 point and I'm sure he will in the future.' (Exhibit 1-I, Respondents' Motion for \u0001 Summary Judgment) 13) \"In September 2013, M. and A. Klein closed their bakery shop in Gresham and movedtheir business to their home, where theycontinued to offer custom designed weddingcakes for sale to the public. (Affidavits of A.Klein, M. Klein) 14) \"On February 13, 2014, A. Klein was interviewed live on a radio show by TonyPerkins called 'Washington Watch.' Perkins'sshow lasted approximately 15 minutes. Inpertinent part, the interview included thefollowing exchange that occurred, starting atfour minutes, 30 seconds into the interviewand ending at six minutes, twenty-twoseconds into the interview: 31 Perkins : '* * * Tell us how this unfolded and your reaction to that.' Klein : 'Well, as far as how it unfolded, it was just, you know, business as usual. Wehad a bride come in. She wanted to trysome wedding cake. Return customer. 31 See footnote 29 .Pet.App.442Came in, sat down. I simply asked the \u0001 bride and groom's first name and date of \u0001 the wedding. She kind of giggled and \u0001 informed me it was two brides. At that \u0001 point, I apologized. I said \"I'm very sorry, \u0001 I feel like you may have wasted your time. \u0001 You know we don't do same-sex marriage, \u0001 same-sex wedding cakes.\" And she got \u0001 upset, noticeably, and I understand that. \u0001 Got up, walked out, and you know, that \u0001 was, I figured the end of it.' Perkins : 'Aaron, let me stop you for a \u0001 moment. Had you and your wife, had you \u0001 talked about this before; is this something \u0001 that you had discussed? Did you think, \u0001 you know, this might occur and had you \u0001 thought through how you might respond \u0001 or did this kind of catch you off guard?' Klein : 'You know, it was something I had \u0001 a feeling was going to become an issue \u0001 and I discussed it with my wife when the \u0001 state of Washington, which is right across \u0001 the river from us, legalized same-sex \u0001 marriage and we watched Masterpiece \u0001 Bakery going through the same issue that \u0001 we ended up going through. But, you \u0001 know, it was one of those situations \u0001 where we said \"well I can see it is going to \u0001 become an issue but we have to stand \u0001 firm. It's our belief and we have a right to \u0001 it, you know.\" I could totally understand \u0001 the backlash from the gay and lesbian \u0001 community. I could see that; what I don'tPet.App.443understand is the government \u0001 sponsorship of religious persecution. That \u0001 is something that just kind of boggles my \u0001 mind as to how a government that is \u0001 under the jurisdiction of the Constitution \u0001 can decide, you know, that these people's \u0001 rights overtake these people's rights or \u0001 even opinion, that this person's opinion is \u0001 more valid than this person's; it kind of \u0001 blows my mind.' (Exhibit 1-I, Respondents' Motion for \u0001 Summary Judgment) \"B. Analysis of Complainants' Claims on the Merits \"The forum first analyzes whether Respondents' actions violated the applicable publicaccommodation statutes. If so, the forum moves onto a determination of whether Respondents haveestablished one or more of their affirmativedefenses that rely on the Oregon and U. S.Constitution. See Tanner v. OHSU, 157 Or App 502, 513 (1998), rev den 329 Or 528, citing Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Resources , 297 Or 562, 564, 687 P2d 785 (1984); 123 Or 74, 77-78, 858 P2d 1339 (1993). See also Meltebeke v. Labor and Industries,322 Or 132, 138-39 (1995)(before consideringconstitutional issues, court must first considerpertinent subconstitutional issues). \"In its Charges, the Agency alleged that Respondents operated Sweetcakes, a place of publicaccommodation under ORS 659A.400, and violatedPet.App.444ORS 659A.406, and 659A.409 by refusing \u0001 to provide Complainants a wedding cake based on \u0001 their sexual orientation, by aiding and abetting that \u0001 refusal, and by communicating their intent to \u0001 discriminate based on sexual orientation. \"Although Respondents' affirmative defenses \u0001 apply to the forum's ultimate disposition of each \u0001 alleged statutory violation, the forum is able to \u0001 draw several legal conclusions from the undisputed \u0001 material facts relevant to the Agency's allegations \u0001 that are unaffected by those affirmative defenses. \"First, at all times material, A. Klein and M. \u0001 Klein owned and operated Sweetcakes as a \u0001 partnership. ORS 67.055 provides, in pertinent \u0001 part: '(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, the association of two or morepersons to carry on as co-owners a business forprofit creates a partnership, whether or not thepersons intend to create a partnership. '* * * * *'(d) It is a rebuttable presumption that a person who receives a share of the profits of a businessis a partner in the business * * *.' In affidavits dated October 23, 2014, signed by M. Klein and A. Klein and submitted in support ofRespondent's motion for summary judgment, theyboth aver: 'Together we have operated Sweetcakesby Melissa as a business since we opened in 2007.* * * Until recent months, we both worked activelyin the business, primarily derived our family incomePet.App.445from the operation of the business, and jointly \u0001 shared the profits of the business.' The Agency does \u0001 not dispute the factual accuracy of these \u0001 statements. Accordingly, the forum concludes that \u0001 M.\u0001Klein and A. Klein were joint owners of \u0001 Sweetcakes and operated it as a partnership and \u0001 unregistered assumed business name in January \u0001 2013, and as a registered assumed business name \u0001 since February 1, 2013. As such, they are jointly \u0001 and severally liable for any violations of ORS \u0001 chapter 659A to Sweetcakes. \"Second, ORS 659A.403, 659A.406, and 659A.409 \u0001 all require that discrimination must be made by a \u0001 'person' acting on behalf of a 'place of 'Person' includes individuals.' ORS 659A.001(9)(a). The undisputed \u0001 facts establish that A. Klein and M. Klein are \u0001 'individual[s]' and 'person[s].' A 'place of public defined in ORS 659A.400 as '(a) \u0001 Any place or service offering to the public \u0001 accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges \u0001 whether in the nature of goods, services, lodgings, \u0001 amusements, transportation or otherwise.' The \u0001 undisputed facts show that, at all material times, \u0001 Sweetcakes was a place or service offering goods \u0001 and services - wedding cakes and the design of \u0001 those cakes - to the public. Accordingly, the forum \u0001 concludes that Sweetcakes, at all material times, \u0001 was a 'place of public accommodation.' \"Third, as germane to this 659A.403 659A.406 prohibit requiresPet.App.446the forum to determine Complainants' actual or \u0001 perceived sexual orientation. As used in ORS \u0001 chapter 659A, 'sexual orientation' is defined heterosexuality, \u0001 homosexuality, bisexuality, or identity, \u0001 regardless of whether the individual's gender \u0001 identity, appearance, expression or behavior differs \u0001 from that traditionally associated with the \u0001 individual's assigned sex at birth.' OAR 839-005-0003(16). The forum infers 32 that Complainants' \u0001 sexual orientation is homosexual and that A. Klein \u0001 perceived they were homosexual from four \u0001 undisputed facts: (a) Complainants were planning \u0001 to have a same-sex marriage; (b) A. Klein told Cryer \u0001 and McPherson that Respondents do not make \u0001 wedding cakes for same-sex ceremonies;(c)\u0001McPherson told A. Klein that she had 'two gay \u0001 children'; and (d) In response to McPherson's \u0001 statement, A. Klein quoted a reference from \u0001 Leviticus related to male homosexual behavior. \"Fourth, A. Klein's verbal statements made in \u0001 the CBN and Tony Perkins interviews that were \u0001 publicly broadcast constitute a 'communication' that \u0001 was 'published' under ORS 659A.409. \"C. Failure to State Ultimate Facts Sufficient \u0001 to Constitute a Claim \"Before determining the merits of the Agency's \u0001 ORS 659A.403(3) allegations, the forum first 32 Evidence includes inferences. There may be more than one inference to be drawn from the basic fact found; it is the forum'stask to decide which inference to draw. See, e.g., In the Matter of Income Property Management, 31 BOLI 18, 39 (2010).Pet.App.447evaluates Respondents' pleading - 'fail[ure] to state \u0001 ultimate facts sufficient to constitute a claim' -- that \u0001 Respondents categorize as their first 'affirmative \u0001 defense.' As a procedural matter, the forum views \u0001 this defense as a straightforward denial of the \u0001 allegations in the pleadings rather than as an \u0001 affirmative defense.33 As argued by Respondents in \u0001 their motion for summary judgment, this defense \u0001 goes to two issues. First, whether Bowman-Cryer's \u0001 absence when A. Klein made his alleged \u0001 discriminatory statement on January 13, 2013, \u0001 deprives her of a cause of action under ORS \u0001 659A.403 and 659A.406. Second, whether \u0001 Respondents' refusal to provide a wedding cake for \u0001 Complainants was on account of their sexual \u0001 orientation. \"Bowman-Cryer's absence on January 13, 2013 \u0001 does not deprive her of standing \"It is undisputed is the fact that Complainants \u0001 sought a wedding cake from Sweetcakes based on 33 In general, an affirmative defense is a defense setting up new matter that provides a defense against the Agency's case,assuming all the facts in the complaint to be true. See, e.g. Pacificorp v. Union Pacific Railroad, 118 Or App 712, 717, 848 P2d 1249 (1993). A few examples of affirmative defenses previouslyrecognized by this forum include statute of limitations, claim andissue preclusion, bona fide occupational requirement, unduehardship, laches, and unclean hands. Some other affirmative defenses recognized by Oregon courts include discharge in bankruptcy, duress, fraud, payment, release, statute of frauds,unconstitutionality, and waiver. ORCP 19B. In contrast, a defense that admits or denies facts constituting elements of the Agency'sprima facie case that are alleged in the Agency's chargingdocument is not an affirmative defense.Pet.App.448Cryer's previous experience in purchasing a \u0001 wedding cake from Sweetcakes for McPherson's \u0001 wedding. It is also undisputed that Bowman-Cryer \u0001 was not present at Sweetcakes on January 13, 2013, \u0001 when A. Klein told Cryer and McPherson that \u0001 Sweetcakes would not make a wedding cake for a \u0001 same-sex wedding. \"Respondents argue as follows: 'Additionally, if as it appears on the face of the pleadings, one or more of the complainants werenot actually potential customers requesting awedding cake issue, and they were also not theones denied services, and their claims must failas a matter of law. In particular, the record isLaurel Bowman-Cryer was not present for thecake tasting and was never denied services.Therefore, either Rachel Cryer or CherylMcPherson was the only person who was deniedservices according to Complainants['] ownrecord. Claims made by anyone else must fail.' The forum rejects this argument, as it relies on the false premise that a person cannot be discriminatedagainst unless they are physically present towitness an alleged act of discrimination perpetratedagainst them. In this case, the 'full and equalaccommodation' sought by both Complainants wasa wedding cake to celebrate their same-sexwedding, an occasion in which they would be jointcelebrants. The forum takes judicial notice that awedding cake has long been considered a customaryand important tradition in weddings in the UnitedStates. Respondents themselves acknowledge thespecial significance of wedding cakes in theirPet.App.449affidavits, in which A. Klein and M. Klein each \u0001 aver: 'The process of designing, creating and decorating a cake for a wedding goes far beyondthe basics of baking a cake and putting frostingon it. Our customary practice involves meetingwith customers to determine who they are, whattheir personalities are, how they are planning awedding, finding out what their wishes andexpectations concerning size, number of layers,colors, style and other decorative detail, whichoften includes looking at a variety of designalternatives before conceiving, sketching, andcustom crafting a variety of decoratingsuggestions and ultimately finalizing the design. Our clients expect, and we intend, that eachcake will be uniquely crafted to be a statementof each customer's personality, physical tastes,theme and desires, as well as their palate so it isa special part of their holy union.' Because the wedding cake was intended to equally benefit both Cryer and Bowman-Cryer, the forumfinds that Bowman-Cryer has the same cause of action against Respondents under ORS 659A.403and .406 as Cryer. Macedonia Church v. Lancaster Hotel Ltd. , 498 F. Supp 2d 494 (2007), though not binding on this forum, illustrates this point. InMacedonia , a group of individuals associated with Macedonia Church, a predominantly African-American congregation, alleged that they weredenied accommodations because of their race.Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint as to allbut four plaintiffs on the grounds that the onlyPet.App.450plaintiffs who had standing to pursue the complaint \u0001 were the four who actually visited defendants' \u0001 facility. As stated by the court, 'the defendants' \u0001 argument appears to assume that unless each \u0001 plaintiff had a first-hand contact with the \u0001 defendants, he or she could not [have] suffered any \u0001 \"personal and holding: 'Whether there was first-hand contact between the individual plaintiffs and the defendants isnot material to the question of whether theindividual plaintiffs suffered a personal andindividual injury. Each of the Non-organizerPlaintiffs alleges that he or she was deniedaccommodations on the basis of race or color.The fact that the defendants informed theplaintiffs that their refusal to provide them withaccommodations by communicating with theOrganizers instead of with each of the Non-organizer plaintiffs does not alter the fact thatthose plaintiffs were denied accommodations.Nor is it material that the plaintiffs wereunaware of the discrimination until sometimeafter it occurred.' \"Nexus between Complainants' sexual orientation and Respondents' refusal toprovide a wedding cake for their same-sexwedding \"Respondents argue that there is no evidence of any connection between Complainants' sexualorientation and Respondents' alleged discriminatoryaction. Respondents' argument is two-pronged.First, Respondents argue that their prior sale of aPet.App.451wedding cake to Cryer for her mother's wedding \u0001 proves Respondents' lack of animus towards \u0001 Complainant's sexual orientation. Second, \u0001 Respondents attempt to isolate Complainants' \u0001 sexual orientation from their proposed34 wedding, \u0001 arguing that their decision was not on account of \u0001 Complainants' sexual orientation, but on \u0001 Respondents' objection to participation in the event \u0001 for which the cake would be prepared. \"Respondents' first argument fails for the reason \u0001 that there is no evidence in the record that A. Klein, \u0001 the person who refused to make a cake for \u0001 Complainants while acting on Sweetcakes' behalf, \u0001 had any knowledge of Complainants' sexual \u0001 orientation in November 2010 when Cryer \u0001 purchased a cake for her mother's wedding. Even if \u0001 A.\u0001Klein was aware of Cryer's sexual orientation in \u0001 November 2010, not discriminating on one occasion \u0001 does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that A. \u0001 Klein did not discriminate on a subsequent \u0001 occasion. \"Respondents rely on Tanner v. OHSU to\u0001 support their second argument. In Tanner, OHSU,\u0001 in accordance with State Employees' Benefits Board \u0001 (SEBB) eligibility criteria, permitted employees to \u0001 purchase insurance coverage for 'family members.' 34 The forum uses the term \"proposed\" because there is no evidence in the record to show whether Complainants were actually evermarried. [NOTE: At hearing, evidence was presented thatComplainant's were legally married in 2014, a few days after Oregon's ban on same-sex marriage was struck down in federal court. See Proposed Finding of Fact #47 -- The Merits, infra .Pet.App.452Under the SEBB criteria, unmarried domestic \u0001 partners of employees were not 'family members' \u0001 who were entitled to insurance coverage. Plaintiffs, \u0001 three lesbian nursing professionals with domestic \u0001 partners, applied for insurance coverage and were \u0001 denied on the ground that the domestic partners did \u0001 not meet the SEBB eligibility criteria. Plaintiffs \u0001 sued, alleging disparate impact sex discrimination \u0001 in violation of then ORS 659.030(1)(b) in that \u0001 OHSU's policy had the effect of discriminating \u0001 against homosexual couples because, unlike \u0001 heterosexual couples, they could not marry and \u0001 become eligible for insura nce benefits. Significant to \u0001 this case, the court stated that plaintiffs were a \u0001 member of a protected class under ORS 659.030 and \u0001 that they made out a disparate impact claim \u0001 because 'OHSU's practice of denying insurance \u0001 benefits to unmarried domestic partners, while \u0001 facially neutral as to homosexual couples, \u0001 effectively screens out 100 percent of them from \u0001 obtaining full coverage for both partners. That is \u0001 because, under Oregon law, homosexual couples \u0001 may not marry.' Id. at 516. The court then held that \u0001 OHSU did not violate then ORS 659.030(1)(b) \u0001 because plaintiffs did not prove that OHSU engaged \u0001 'in a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this \u0001 chapter' under then ORS 659.028. Id. at 517-19. The \u0001 language that Respondents quote to support their \u0001 argument is not the holding of the case, but merely \u0001 a bridge between the court's evaluation of plaintiffs' \u0001 case based on different treatment and disparate \u0001 impact theories. Accordingly, Tanner does not assist \u0001 Respondents. Also significant to this case, plaintiffs \u0001 alleged a violation of Article I, section 20, of the \u0001 Oregon Constitution. The court found thatPet.App.453plaintiffs, as homosexual couples, were members of \u0001 a 'true class,' and also members of a 'suspect class' \u0001 based on their sexual orientation. Id. at 524. \"Respondents' attempt to divorce their refusal to \u0001 provide a cake for Complainants' same-sex wedding \u0001 from Complainants' sexual orientation is neither \u0001 novel nor supported by case law. As the Agency \u0001 argues in support of its cross-motion, '[t]here is \u0001 simply no reason to distinguish between services for \u0001 a wedding ceremony between two persons of the \u0001 same sex and the sexual orientation of that couple. \u0001 The conduct, a marriage ceremony, is inextricably \u0001 linked to a person's sexual orientation.' \"The U. S. Supreme Court has rejected similar \u0001 attempts to distinguish between a protected status \u0001 and conduct closely correlated with that status. In \u0001 Christian Legal Society Chapter of the University of \u0001 California, Hastings College of the Law v. Martinez, \u0001 561 U.S. 661, 130 S. Ct. 2971 (2010), students at \u0001 Hastings College of the Law formed a chapter of the \u0001 Christian Legal Society ('CLS') and sought formal \u0001 recognition from the school. The CLS required its \u0001 members to affirm their belief in the divinity of \u0001 Jesus Christ and to refrain from 'unrepentant \u0001 homosexual conduct.' Id. at 2980. Hastings refused \u0001 to recognize the organization on the ground that it \u0001 violated Hastings' nondiscrimination policy, which \u0001 prohibited exclusion based on religion or sexual \u0001 orientation. The CLS argued that 'it does not \u0001 exclude individuals because of sexual orientation, \u0001 but rather \"on the basis of a conjunction of conduct \u0001 and the belief that the conduct is not wrong.\"' Id. at\u0001 2990. The Court rejected this argument, stating:Pet.App.454'Our decisions have declined to distinguish \u0001 between status and conduct in this context. See \u0001 Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 575, 123 S Ct \u0001 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (\"When \u0001 homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law \u0001 of the State, that declaration in and of itself is \u0001 an invitation to subject homosexual persons to\u0001 discrimination.\" (emphasis added)); id., at 583,\u0001 J., concurring in \u0001 judgment) (\"While it is true that the law applies \u0001 only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law \u0001 is conduct that is closely correlated with being \u0001 homosexual. Under such circumstances, [the] \u0001 law is targeted at more than conduct. It is \u0001 instead directed toward gay persons as a class.\"); \u0001 cf. Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, \u0001 506 U.S. 263, 270, 113 S.Ct. 753, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 \u0001 (1993) (\"A tax on wearing yarmulkes is a tax on \u0001 Jews.\").' In conclusion, the forum holds that when a law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexualorientation, that law similarly protects conduct thatis inextricably tied to sexual orientation. See Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock, 309 P3d 53, 62 (2013), cert den 134 S. Ct. 1787 (2014). Applied to this case, the forum finds that Respondents' refusal to providea wedding cake for Complainants because it was fortheir same-sex wedding was synonymous withrefusing to provide a cake because of Complainants'sexual orientation.Pet.App.455\"D. Respondent A. Klein violated 659A.403 With regard to its ORS 659A.403 claims, the \u0001 Agency alleges the following in paragraph III.12 in \u0001 both sets of Charges: '12. Respondents discriminated against \u0001 Complainant because of her sexual orientation. a. Melissa Elaine Klein denied full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities andprivileges of her business to [Complainant]based on her sexual orientation, in violationof ORS 659A.403(3). b. Respondent Aaron Wayne Klein, dba Sweetcakes by Melissa denied full andequal accommodations, advantages,facilities and privileges of her [sic] business to [Complainant] based on hersexual orientation, in violation of ORS659A.403(3). c.In the alternative, Respondent Aaron Wayne Klein aided or abetted Melissa ElaineKlein in violating ORS 659A.403(3), inviolation of ORS 659A.406.' (emphasis bolded by Agency in its Amended Formal Charges to show amendments to original Formal Charges) ORS 659A.403 provides, in pertinent part: '(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, all persons within thejurisdiction of this state are entitled to thefull and equal accommodations, advantages,Pet.App.456facilities and privileges of any place of public \u0001 accommodation, without any distinction, \u0001 discrimination or restriction on account of \u0001 race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, \u0001 national origin, marital status or age if the \u0001 individual is 18 years of age or older. '(2)\u0001Subsection (1) of this section does not \u0001 prohibit: \"(a) The enforcement of laws governing the consumption of alcoholic beverages byminors and the frequenting by minors ofplaces of public accommodation wherealcoholic beverages are served; or \"(b) The offering of special rates or services to persons 50 years of age orolder. '(3) It is an unlawful practice for any person to deny full and equal accommodations,advantages, facilities and privileges of anyplace of public accommodation in violation ofthis section.' \"The prima 1) Complainants were ahomosexual couple and were perceived as such byA. Klein and M. Klein; 2) Sweetcakes was a place ofpublic accommodation; 3a) A. Klein, a person actingon behalf of Sweetcakes, denied full and equalaccommodations to Complainants; 3b) M. Klein, aperson acting on behalf of Sweetcakes, denied fulland equal accommodations to Complainants; and4) the denials were on account of Complainants'sexual orientation. Elements 1, 2, 3a arePet.App.457established by undisputed facts. Element 4 is \u0001 established in the preceding section's discussion of \u0001 'Nexus.' Accordingly, the forum concludes that A. \u0001 Klein violated ORS 659A.403 and that the Agency \u0001 is entitled to summary judgment on the merits as to \u0001 Cryer's and Bowman-Cryer's 659A.403 claims \u0001 against A. Klein. Since there is no evidence that M. \u0001 Klein took any action to deny the full and equal \u0001 accommodations, advantages, facilities and \u0001 privileges of Sweetcakes to Complainants, the \u0001 forum concludes that M. Klein did not violate ORS \u0001 659A.403. However, M. Klein, as a joint owner of \u0001 Sweetcakes with A. Klein, is jointly and severally \u0001 liable for any damages awarded to Complainants \u0001 stemming from A. Klein's violation. \"E. ORS 659A.406 -- Aiding and Abetting a \u0001 Violation of ORS 659A.403(3) \"The Agency seeks to hold A. Klein liable as an \u0001 aider and abettor under ORS 659A.406 for M. \u0001 Klein's alleged violation of ORS 659A.403(3). \u0001 Respondents assert that A. Klein cannot be held \u0001 liable as an aider and abettor under ORS 659A.406 \u0001 because he is a co-owner of Sweetcakes and, as a \u0001 matter of law, cannot aid and abet himself. The \u0001 Agency argues to the contrary, based on the 'plain \u0001 text' of the statute. \"ORS 659A.406 provides, in pertinent part: \"Except as otherwise authorized by ORS 659A.403, it is an unlawful practice for anyperson to aid or abet any place of publicaccommodation, as defined in ORS 659A.400, orany employee or person acting on behalf of thePet.App.458place of public accommodation to make any \u0001 distinction, discrimination or restriction on \u0001 account of race, color, religion, sex, sexual \u0001 orientation, national origin, marital status or \u0001 age if the individual is 18 years of age or older.\" In the previous section, the forum concluded that M. Klein did not violate ORS 659A.403(3) as alleged inparagraph III.12.a and that A. Klein, the jointowner of Sweetcakes, violated ORS 659A.403(3) asalleged in paragraph II.12.b. Since M. Klein did notviolate ORS 659A.403, A. Klein cannot be heldliable to have aided and abetted her violation. 35 \"F.

In this case, M. Klein's liabilitystems from her partnership status, not from any violation that shecommitted. 36 Section IV is prefaced by the caption \"UNLAWFUL PRACTICE: DISCRIMINATION BY PUBLICATION, CIRCULATION,ISSUANCE, OR DISPLAY OF A COMMUNICATION, NOTICE,ADVERTISEMENT, OR SIGN OF A DENIAL OF ACCOMMODATIONS, ADVANTAGES, FACILITIES, SERVICES OR PRIVILEGES BY A PLACE OF PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONBASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION.\"Pet.App.459would be made against, a person on account of his \u0001 or her sexual orientation, in violation of ORS \u0001 659A.409'; (b) Respondent A.

Klein 'aided or abetted \u0001 M.\u0001Klein in violating ORS 659A.409, in violation of \u0001 ORS 659A.406.' \"In its Charges, the Agency alleges in \u0001 paragraphs II.8 & 9 that A. Klein made statements \u0001 that were broadcast on television on September 2, \u0001 2013, and on the radio on February 13, 2014, that \u0001 communicate an intent to discriminate based on \u0001 sexual orientation. The full text of the relevant part \u0001 of those broadcasts is set out in Findings of Fact \u0001 ##12 and 14, supra . The Agency's cross-motion for \u0001 summary judgment singles out the statements \u0001 made on those two occasions as proof that \u0001 Respondents violated ORS 659A.409.37 \"ORS 659A.409 provides, in pertinent part: '* * * it is an unlawful practice for any person acting on behalf of any place of publicaccommodation as defined in ORS 659A.400 topublish, circulate, issue or display, or cause to bepublished, circulated, issued or displayed, anycommunication, notice, advertisement or sign of 37 The Agency's cross-motion also discusses the sign on Sweetcakes' door after it closed for business, but since the Agency did not allegethe existence or contents of the sign as a violation, the forum doesnot consider it.Pet.App.460any kind to the effect that any of the \u0001 accommodations, advantages, facilities, services \u0001 or privileges of the place of public \u0001 accommodation will be refused, withheld from or \u0001 denied to, or that any discrimination will be \u0001 made against, any person on account of * * * \u0001 sexual orientation * * *.' The alleged unlawful statements made by A. Klein were: 'I didn't want to be a part of her marriage, which I think is wrong.' ( September 2, 2013 CBN interview ) 'I said \"I'm very sorry, I feel like you may have wasted your time. You know we don't do same-sex marriage, same-sex wedding cakes.\" * * *You know, it was something I had a feeling wasgoing to become an issue and I discussed it withmy wife when the state of Washington, which isright across the river from us, legalized same-sex marriage and we watched MasterpieceBakery going through the same issue that weended up going through. But, you know, it wasone of those situations where we said \"well I cansee it is going to become an issue but we have tostand firm. It's our belief and we have a right toit, you know.\"' ( February 13, 2014, Tony Perkins interview ) In their motion for summary judgment, Respondents argue that 'ORS 659A.409 by its termsrequires a statement of future intention that is entirely absent in this instance.' Respondentsfurther argue that:Pet.App.461'A review of the videotape record of the CBN \u0001 broadcast * * * clearly shows that Aaron Klein \u0001 spoke only of the reason why he and his wife \u0001 declined to participate in complainants' \u0001 ceremony. The same is true of the Perkins radio \u0001 broadcast. * * * A statement of future intention \u0001 in either media event is conspicuously absent.' The Agency does not dispute the correctness of Respondents' argument that ORS 659A.409 isdirected towards communications relating aprospective intent to discriminate, but argues thatA. Klein's statements are a prospectivecommunication: 'Reviewed in context, Respondents communicated quite clearly that same-sexcouples would not be provided wedding cakeservices at their bakery. These are notdescriptions of past events as alleged byRespondents. Respondents stated their positionin these communications and notify the publicthat they \"don't do same sex weddings,\" they\"stand strong.\"' Whatever Respondents' post-January 2013 intentions may have been or may still be withregard to providing wedding cake services for same-sex weddings, the forum finds that A. Klein's above-quoted statements, evaluated both for text andcontext, are properly construed as the recounting ofpast events that led to the present Charges beingfiled. In other words, these statements describedwhat occurred on January 17, 2013, and thoughtsand discussions the Kleins had before JanuaryPet.App.4622013, not what the Kleins intended to do in the \u0001 future.38 To arrive at the conclusion sought by the \u0001 Agency requires drawing an inference of future \u0001 intent from the Kleins's statements of religious \u0001 belief that the forum is not willing to draw. \u0001 Accordingly, the forum concludes that A. Klein's \u0001 communication did not violate ORS 659A.409.39 \"In addition, the forum notes that M. Klein \u0001 cannot be held to have violated ORS 659A.409 \u0001 because she made no communication. Therefore, the \u0001 forum finds that A. Klein did not aid or abet M. \u0001 Klein to commit a violation of that statute and \u0001 Respondents are entitled to summary judgment on \u0001 this issue. 38 In contrast, had A. Klein told Perkins \"I said 'I'm very sorry * * * You know we don't do same-sex marr iage, same-sex wedding cakes' and we take the same stand today ,\" the forum's ruling would be different, assuming the Agency had plead a violation of ORS659A.409 by A. Klein. 39 Compare In the Matter of Blachana, LLC, 32 BOLI 220 (2013), appeal pending (Respondent found to have violated ORS 659A.409 when member of the LLC left a telephone message with theorganizer of a group of transgender individuals who had visited the LLC's nightclub regularly on Friday nights during the previous 18months asking \"not to come back on Friday nights.\"); In the Matter of The Pub , 6 BOLI 270, 282-83 (1987)(Respondent found to have violated ORS 659.037, the predecessor of ORS 659A.409, by posting a on front door of pub, immediately under another sign that said \"VIVA APARTHEID,\" a sign that said \"NO SHOES,SHIRTS, SERVICE, NIGGERS,\" and a sign inside the pub, withchain and spikes attached at each end, that read \"Discrimination.

Respondents' Counterclaims \"Before addressing Respondents' affirmative \u0001 defenses, the forum addresses Respondents' \u0001 counterclaims. First, Respondents allege that BOLI, \u0001 through its actions in prosecuting this case, has \u0001 'knowingly and selectively acted under color of state \u0001 law to deprive Respondents of their fundamental \u0001 constitutional and statutory rights on the basis of \u0001 religion' in violation of ORS 659A.403 and \u0001 'deprive[d] the Respondents of fundamental rights \u0001 and protections guaranteed by the First and \u0001 Fourteenth amendments to the United States \u0001 Constitution,' thereby generating liability under 42 \u0001 USC \u00a7 1983. Second, Respondents allege that the \u0001 BOLI's Commissioner violated ORS 659A.409 by \u0001 publishing, circulating, issuing, or displaying \u0001 communications on Facebook and in print media 'to \u0001 the effect that its accommodations, advantages, \u0001 facilities, services or privileges would be refused, \u0001 withheld from or denied to, or the discrimination \u0001 would be made against Respondents and other \u0001 persons similarly situated on the basis of religion in \u0001 violation of ORS 659A.409.' Respondents seek \u0001 damages in the amount of $100,000 for economic \u0001 damages, $100,000 for non-economic damages, court \u0001 costs, and reasonable attorney fees. \"The authority of state agencies is limited to that \u0001 granted to them by the legislature. See SAIF Corp. \u0001 v.\u0001Shipley, 326 Or 557, 561, 955 P2d 244 (1998) ('an \u0001 agency has only those powers that the legislature \u0001 grants and cannot exercise authority that it does \u0001 not have'). ORS 659A.850(4) gives the \u0001 Commissioner the authority to award compensatoryPet.App.464damages to complainants as an element of a cease \u0001 and desist order within a contested case proceeding. \u0001 There is no corresponding statute that authorizes \u0001 the Commissioner to award the damages sought by \u0001 Respondents in their counterclaims. With regard to \u0001 attorney fees or court costs, the legislature has only \u0001 granted authority to the Commissioner to award \u0001 these in contested case proceedings to interveners \u0001 in a real property case brought under ORS \u0001 659A.145 or ORS 659A.421.40 \"In conclusion, the forum lacks jurisdiction to \u0001 adjudicate Respondents' counterclaims and may \u0001 neither grant nor deny them. The only relief \u0001 available to Respondents through this forum is \u0001 dismissal of any Charges not proven by the Agency \u0001 under ORS 659A.850(3).41 \"H. Respondents' Affirmative Defenses \"Respondents' affirmative defenses include \u0001 estoppel and the unconstitutionality of ORS \u0001 659A.403, .406, and .409, both facially and as \u0001 applied. As an initial matter, the forum notes that \u0001 the Oregon Court of Appeals has held that an 40 See ORS 659A.850(1)(b)(B). 41 See, e.g., Wallace v. PERB, 245 Or App 16, 30, 263 P3d 1010 (2011) (when plaintiff sought compensatory damages in an APAcontested case proceeding based on alleged financial loss after PERS placed a limit on how often he could transfer funds he hadinvested in the Oregon Savings Growth Plan, the court held that, since it had no authority under ORS 183.486(1)(b) to awardcompensatory damages to plaintiff, plaintiff was also unable torecover those damages in the contested case proceeding).Pet.App.465Agency has the authority to decide the \u0001 constitutionality of statutes. See Eppler v. Board of \u0001 Tax Service Examiners, 189 Or App 216, 75 P3d 900 \u0001 (2003), citing Cooper v. Eugene Sch. Dist. No. 4J, \u0001 301 Or. 358, 362-65, 723 P.2d 298 (1986) and \u0001 Nutbrown v. Munn, 311 Or. 328, 346, 811 P.2d 131 \u0001 (1991). In BOLI contested cases, the Commissioner \u0001 has delegated to the ALJ the authority to rule on \u0001 motions for summary judgment, with the decision \u0001 'set forth in the Proposed Order' and subject to \u0001 ratification by the Commissioner in the Final Order. \u0001 OAR 839-050-0150(4). Accordingly, the ALJ has the \u0001 initial authority to rule on the constitutional issues \u0001 raised by Respondents in their motion for summary \u0001 judgment.42 \"Estoppel \"In their answers, Respondents phrase their \u0001 estoppel defense as follows: \"The state of Oregon, including the Bureau of Labor and Industries[,] is estopped fromcompelling Respondents to engage in creativeexpression or otherwise participate in same-sexceremonies not recognized by the state of Oregoncontrary to their fundamental rights,consciences and convictions.\" 42 Eppler, Cooper, and Nutbrown impliedly overruled the forum's holding in the case of In the Matter of Doyle's Shoes, 1 BOLI 295 (1980), a Final Order issued before the Eppler, Cooper, and Nutbrown decisions in which the forum held that it was beyond the Commissioner's discretion to determine the constitutionality of legislative enactments. The forum now explicitly overrules thatholding.Pet.App.466Estoppel is a legal doctrine whereby one party is \u0001 foreclosed from proceeding against another when \u0001 one party has made 'a false representation, (1) of \u0001 which the other party was ignorant, (2) made with \u0001 the knowledge of the facts, (3) made with the \u0001 intention that it would induce action by the other \u0001 party, and (4) that induced the other party to act \u0001 upon it.'

Hanson \u0001 Crushing, Inc., 161 Or App 424, 428, 983 P.2d 1084 \u0001 (1999). In order to establish estoppel against a state \u0001 agency, a party must have relied on the agency's \u0001 representations and the party's reliance must have \u0001 been reasonable. Id., citing Dept. of Transportation \u0001 v.\u0001Hewett Professional Group, 321 Or 118, 126, 895 \u0001 P2d 755 (1995).43 \"Here, Respondents do not identify any false \u0001 representation made by BOLI or any other state \u0001 agency upon which Respondents relied in refusing \u0001 to provide a wedding cake to Complainants. \u0001 Although it is undisputed that the Oregon \u0001 Constitution did not recognize same-sex marriages \u0001 in January 2013, the affidavits of A. Klein and M. 43 See also In the Matter of Sunnyside Inn, 11 BOLI 151, 162 (1993) (Equitable estoppel may exist when one party (1) has made a falserepresentation; (2) the false representation is made withknowledge of the facts; (3) the other party is ignorant of the truth;(4) the false representation is made with the intention that itshould be relied upon by the other party; and (5) the other party isinduced to act upon it to that party's detriment); In the Matter of Portland Electric & Plumbing Company, 4 BOLI 82, 98-99 (1983) (estoppel only protects those who materially change their position in reliance on another's acts or representations).Pet.App.467Klein establish that the refusal was because of \u0001 Respondents' religious convictions stemming from \u0001 Biblical authority, not on their reliance on Oregon's \u0001 Constitutional provision rejecting same-sex \u0001 marriage or their attempt to enforce that \u0001 provision.44 \"In conclusion, Respondents present no facts, \u0001 articulate no legal theory, and cite no case law to \u0001 support their argument that BOLI should be \u0001 estopped from litigating this case based on the \u0001 doctrine of estoppel. The Agency is entitled to \u0001 summary judgment on this issue. \"Respondents' Constitutional Defenses - Introduction \"Due to the number and complexity of \u0001 Respondents' constitutional defenses, the forum \u0001 summarizes them, as plead in Respondents' \u0001 answers, before analyzing them. They include the \u0001 following: \"The statutes underlying the Charges are unconstitutional as applied in that they violateRespondents' fundamental rights arising underthe Oregon Constitution by: (a) unlawfully 44 In A. Klein's affidavit, he states that, after Cryer told him \"something to the effect 'Well, there are two brides, and theirnames are Rachel and Laurel,'\" he \"indicated we did not createwedding cakes for same-sex ceremonies because of our religiousconvictions, and they left the shop.\" In the same paragraph, hestates \"I believed that I was acting within the bounds of theOregon Constitution and the laws of the State of Oregon which, atthat time, explicitly defined marriage as the union of one man andprohibited recognition of any other type of union as marriage.\"Pet.App.468violating Respondents' freedom of worship and \u0001 conscience under Article I, \u00a72; (b) unlawfully \u0001 violating Respondents' freedom of religious \u0001 opinion under Article I, \u00a73; (c) unlawfully \u0001 violating Respondents' freedom of speech under \u0001 Article I, \u00a78; (d) unlawfully compelling \u0001 Respondents to engage expression of a message \u0001 they did not want to express; (e) unlawfully \u0001 violating Respondents' privileges and \u0001 immunities under Article I, \u00a720; and (f) violating \u0001 Article XV, \u00a75a. \"The statutes underlying the Charges are facially unconstitutional under the OregonConstitution in that they violate Respondents'fundamental rights arising under the OregonConstitution to the extent there is no religiousexemption to protect or acknowledge thefundamental rights of Respondents and personssimilarly situated. \"The statutes underlying the Charges are unconstitutional as applied to Respondents tothe extent they do not protect the fundamentalrights of Respondents and persons similarlysituated arising under the First and FourteenthAmendments to the United States Constitution,as applied to the State of Oregon under theFourteenth Amendment, by: (a) unlawfullyinfringing on Respondents' right of conscience,right to free exercise of religion, and right to freespeech; (b) unlawfully compelling Respondentsto engage expression of a message they did notwant to express; and (c) unlawfully denyingPet.App.469Respondents' right to due process and equal \u0001 protection of the laws. \"The statutes underlying the Charges are facially unconstitutional to the extent there is noreligious exemption to protect or acknowledgethe fundamental rights of Respondents andpersons similarly situated arising under theFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the UnitedStates Constitution, as applied to the State ofOregon under the Fourteenth Amendment. When both state and federal constitutional claims are raised, Oregon courts first evaluate the stateclaim. Sterling v. Cupp, 290 Or 611, 614, 625 P2d 123 (1981). The forum does likewise. Forcontinuity's sake, the forum follows the analysis ofeach state claim with an analysis of the parallelfederal claim. The forum only addresses theconstitutionality of ORS 659A.403, since the forumhas already concluded, on a subconstitutional level,that Respondents did not violate ORS 659A.406 and659A.409. \"Oregon Constitution \"Article I, Sections 2 and 3: Freedom of worship and conscience; Freedom of religious opinion \"The forum addresses these interrelated defenses together. Article I, Sections 2 and 3 of theOregon Constitution provide: 'Section 2. Freedom of worship . All men shall be secure in the Natural right, to worshipPet.App.470Almighty God according to the dictates of their \u0001 own consciences.' 'Section 3. Freedom of religious opinion. No\u0001 law shall in any case whatever control the free \u0001 exercise, and enjoyment of religeous [sic] \u0001 opinions, or interfere with the rights of \u0001 conscience.' Respondents, who are Christians, have a sincerely held belief that the Bible 'forbids us fromproclaiming messages or participating in activitiescontrary to Biblical principles, including celebrations or ceremonies for uniting same-sexcouples.' They argue that Article I, sections 2 and 3gave them the unfettered right to refuse to providea cake for Complainants' same-sex weddingceremony because doing so would have compelledthem to act contrary to their sincerely held religiousbeliefs. \"The forum first analyzes a series of Oregon Supreme Court cases interpreting Article I, sections2 and 3, then applies them to ORS 659A.403.Beginning with City of Portland v. Thornton, 174 Or 508, 149 P2d 972 (1944), the Oregon Supreme Courtapplied U.S. Supreme Court precedents under theFirst Amendment to the U.S. Constitution wheninterpreting Article I, Sections 2 and 3 of theOregon Constitution. In Salem College & Academy, Inc. v. Emp. Div., 298 Or 471, 486-87, 695 P2d 25 (1985), an Christian schoolargued that the state's requirement that it payunemployment tax violated Article I, sections 2 and3. The court held that 'the state had not infringedupon the school's right to religious freedom when allPet.App.471similarly situated employers in the state were \u0001 subject to [unemployment tax].' Significant to this \u0001 case, the Salem court interpreted Article I, sections \u0001 2 and 3 in light of the text and historical context in \u0001 which they arose, without reference to U.S. \u0001 Supreme Court decisions and without reference to \u0001 its own prior decisions that had relied on federal \u0001 First Amendment precedent. Id. at 484. \"In 1986, in the next case involving the \u0001 application of Article I, sections 2-7, the Oregon \u0001 Supreme Court made explicit what was implicit in \u0001 Salem College. In Cooper v. Eugene Sch. Dist. No. \u0001 4J, 301 Or. 358, 369-70, \u0001 the court stated: 'This court sometimes has treated these guarantees and the First Amendment's ban onlaws prohibiting the free exercise of religion(footnote omitted) as \"identical in meaning,\" City of Portland v. Thornton, 174 Or. 508, 512, 149 P.2d 972 (1942); but identity of 'meaning' or evenof text does not imply that the state's laws willnot be tested against the state's ownconstitutional guarantees before reaching thefederal constraints imposed by the Fourtenth[sic] Amendment, or that verbal formulasdeveloped by the United States Supreme Courtin applying the federal text also governapplication of the state's comparable clauses.'(footnote omitted). Since Cooper , the Oregon Supreme Court has decided a trio of cases interpreting Article I,sections 2 and 3 that are relevant to the presentcase.Pet.App.472\"In Smith v. Employment Div., Dept. of Human \u0001 Resources, 301 Or 209, 721 P2d 445 (1986), vacated\u0001 on other grounds sub nom., Employment Div. v. \u0001 Smith, 485 US 660 (1988), a drug counselor was \u0001 fired for misconduct based on his ingestion of \u0001 peyote, a sacrament in the Native American \u0001 Church, during a Native American Church service \u0001 and denied unemployment benefits. Smith claimed \u0001 that the denial of unemployment benefits placed 'a \u0001 burden on his freedom to worship according to the \u0001 dictates of his conscience' under the Oregon \u0001 Constitution, Article I, sections 2 and 3. Citing \u0001 Salem College , the court held that there was no \u0001 violation of Article I, sections 2 and 3 because the \u0001 statute and rule defining misconduct were \u0001 'completely neutral toward religious motivations for \u0001 misconduct' and '[claimant] was denied benefits \u0001 through the operation of a statute that is neutral \u0001 both on its face and as applied.' Id. at 215-16. \"In Employment Div., Department of Human \u0001 Resources v. Rogue Valley Youth for Christ, 307 Or\u0001 490, 498-99, 770 P2d 588 (1989), the court rejected \u0001 a religious organization's claim that payment of \u0001 unemployment tax would violate its rights under \u0001 Article I, sections 2 and 3. Relying on United States \u0001 v.\u0001Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 256-57, 102 S.Ct. 1051, the court \u0001 stated: 'When governmental action is challenged as a violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the FirstAmendment it must first be shown that thegovernmental action imposes a burden on theparty's religion. Assuming that imposingPet.App.473unemployment payroll taxes on all religious \u0001 organizations will burden at least some of those \u0001 groups, (although not necessarily their freedom \u0001 of belief or worship), that assumption \"is only \u0001 the beginning, however, and not the end of the \u0001 inquiry. Not all burdens on religious liberty are \u0001 unconstitutional. * * * The state may justify a \u0001 limitation on religion by showing that it is \u0001 essential to accomplish an overriding \u0001 governmental interest.\" In the present case the \u0001 State of Oregon has two governmental interests \u0001 which, when taken together, are sufficiently \u0001 important to support the burden on religion \u0001 represented by unemployment payroll taxes. 'There are few governmental tasks as important \u0001 as providing for the economic security of its \u0001 citizens. A strong unemployment compensation \u0001 system plays a significant role in providing this \u0001 security. * * * [A]ny state's unemployment tax \u0001 must, as a practical matter, comply with FUTA's \u0001 (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) requirements \u0001 or the state's employers would face a double tax. \u0001 Such a double tax would, in turn, create a very \u0001 undesirable business climate in the state. This, \u0001 combined with Oregon's constitutional interest \u0001 in treating all religious organizations equally, \u0001 creates an overriding state interest in applying \u0001 the unemployment payroll taxes to all religious \u0001 organizations. Our construction of the coverage \u0001 of Oregon's unemployment compensation \u0001 taxation scheme does not offend the First \u0001 Amendment's Free Exercise Clause or Article I,Pet.App.474section 3 of the Oregon Constitution.' (internal \u0001 citations and footnotes omitted) Rogue Valley , at 498-99. \"In Meltebeke v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, 322 Or 132, 903 P2d 351 (1995), the courtconsidered a constitutional challenge to BOLI's rulethat 'verbal or physical conduct of a religiousnature' in the workplace was unlawful if it had 'thepurpose or effect of unreasonably interfering withthe subject's work performance or creating anintimidating, hostile or offensive workingenvironment.' Id. at 139. As Respondents note, the court introduced its discussion of Article I, sections2 and 3, with this sweeping statement: 'These provisions are obviously worded more broadly than the federal First Amendment, andare remarkable in the inclusiveness andadamancy with which rights of conscience are tobe protected from governmental interference.' Id. at 146. The court then launched into a brief history of governmental intolerance towardsreligion enforced by criminal laws in England beforesummarizing its Salem College decision and concluding: 'A general scheme prohibiting religious discrimination in employment, includingreligious harassment, does not conflict with anyof the underpinnings of the Oregonconstitutional guarantees of religious freedomidentified in Salem College: It does not infringe on the right of an employer independently todevelop or to practice his or her own religiousPet.App.475opinions or exercise his or her rights of \u0001 conscience, short of the employer's imposing \u0001 them on employees holding other forms of belief \u0001 or nonbelief; it does not discourage the \u0001 multiplicity of religious sects; and it applies \u0001 equally to all employers and thereby does not \u0001 choose among religions or beliefs. 'The law prohibiting religious discrimination, \u0001 including religious harassment, honors the \u0001 constitutional commitment to religious \u0001 pluralism by ensuring that employees can earn \u0001 a living regardless of their religious beliefs. The \u0001 statutory prohibition against religious \u0001 discrimination in employment and, in particular, \u0001 the BOLI rule at issue, when properly applied, \u0001 will promote the '[n]atural right' of employees to \u0001 'be secure in' their 'worship [of] Almighty God \u0001 according to the dictates of their own \u0001 consciences,' Or. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 2, and will not \u0001 be a law controlling religious rights of conscience \u0001 or their free exercise.' Meltebeke at 148-49. The court then moved on to a review of Smith , stating that Smith stood for the principle that '[a] law that is neutral towardreligion or nonreligion as such, that is neutralamong religions, and that is part of a generalregulatory scheme having no purpose to control orinterfere with rights of conscience or with religiousopinions does not violate the guarantees of religiousfreedom in Article I, sections 2 and 3.' Meltebeke at 149. The court held as follows: 'We conclude that, under established principles of state constitutional law concerning freedom ofPet.App.476religion, discussed above, BOLI's rule is \u0001 constitutional on its face. The law prohibiting \u0001 employment discrimination, including the \u0001 regulatory prohibition against religious \u0001 harassment, is a law that is part of a general \u0001 regulatory scheme, expressly neutral toward \u0001 religion as such and neutral among religions. \u0001 Indeed, its purpose is to support the values \u0001 protected by Article I, sections 2 and 3, not to \u0001 impede them.' Id. at 150-51. \"Next, the Meltebeke court analyzed whether the BOLI rule, as applied , violated Article I, sections 2 and 3. Following Smith , the court stated: 'Because sections 2 and 3 of Article I are expressly designed to prevent government-created homogeneity of religion, the governmentmay not constitutionally impose sanctions on anemployer for engaging in a religious practice without knowledge that the practice has aharmful effect on the employees intended to beprotected. If the rule were otherwise, fear ofunwarranted government punishment wouldstifle or make insecure the employer's enjoymentand exercise of religion, seriously eroding thevery values that the constitution expresslyexempts from government control.' (emphasisadded) Id. at 153. Based on facts set out in BOLI's Final Order, the court found that the employer'scomplained-of conduct constituted a 'religiouspractice,' that the employer did not know hisPet.App.477conduct created an intimidating, hostile, or \u0001 offensive working environment,45 and that the \u0001 employer had established an affirmative defense \u0001 under Article I, sections 2 and 3 because BOLI's \u0001 rule did not require that the employer 'knew in fact \u0001 that his actions in exercise of his religious practice \u0001 had an effect forbidden by the rule.'46 Id. In\u0001 contrast, here Respondents' affidavits establish that \u0001 their refusal to make a wedding cake for \u0001 Complainants was not a religious practice, but 45 See In the Matter of James Meltebeke, 10 BOLI 102, 105-07 (1992) (BOLI Commissioner's Findings of Fact included detailedfindings that employer believed he was commanded to preach hisbeliefs to others under \"any and all circumstances\" or \"he would belost\"). 46 In a footnote, the court distinguished \"a religious practice\" from \"conduct that may be motivated by one's religious beliefs\" instating: \"Conduct that may be motivated by one's religious beliefsis not the same as conduct that constitutes a religious practice.The knowledge standard is considered here only in relation to thelatter category. In this case, no distinction between thosecategories is called into play, because a fair reading of BOLI'srevised final order is that BOLI found that all of Employer's religious activity respecting Complainant is part of Employer's religious practice.\" Meltebeke at 153, fn. 19.Pet.App.478conduct motivated by their religious beliefs.47\u0001 Accordingly, Meltebeke does not aid Respondents. \"The general principle that emerges from these \u0001 cases is that a law that is part of a general \u0001 regulatory scheme, expressly neutral and neutral \u0001 among religions, is constitutional under Article I, \u0001 sections 2 and 3. ORS 659A.403 is such a law. \u0001 Additionally, there is also \"an overriding \u0001 governmental interest\" present, explicitly expressed \u0001 by Oregon's legislature in ORS 659A.003 in the \u0001 following words: 'The purpose of this chapter is * * * to ensure the human dignity of all people within this state andprotect their health, safety and morals from theconsequences of intergroup hostility, tensionsand practices of unlawful discrimination of anykind based on * * * sexual orientation * * *.' \"Respondents further contend that 'the statutes underlying the Charges are faciallyunconstitutional under the Oregon Constitution inthat they violate Respondents' fundamental rightsarising under the Oregon Constitution to the extentthere is no religious exemption to protect or 47 Cf. State v. Beagley, 257 Or App 220, 226, 305 P3d 147 (2013) (\"First, we conclude that, regardless of where the line betweenreligious practice and religiously motivated conduct is drawn,there are some behaviors that fall clearly to one side or the other.A Catholic taking communion at mass is clearly andunambiguously engaging in a religious practice; on the other sideof the line, allowing a child to die for lack of life-saving medicalcare is clearly and unambiguously\u2014and, as a matter oflaw\u2014conduct that may be motivated by one's religious beliefs.\")Pet.App.479acknowledge the fundamental rights of \u0001 Respondents and persons similarly situated.' There \u0001 is no requirement under the Oregon Constitution \u0001 for such an exemption.48 The exclusions and \u0001 prohibitions in ORS 659A.400(2) and 659A.403(2) \u0001 do not lead to the conclusion that the law is not \u0001 neutral. Respondents' reliance on Hobby Lobby49\u0001 fails because Hobby Lobby was not decided on \u0001 constitutional grounds, but decided under the \u0001 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\") of \u0001 1993 and because the RFRA does not apply to the \u0001 states. City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 US 507 (1997). 48 The legislature did choose to enact certain exemptions to civil rights laws. Actions by bona fide churches or other religiousinstitutions regarding housing and use of facilities are notunlawful practices if based on a bona fide religious belief aboutsexual orientation. Actions by bona fide churches or other religiousinstitutions regarding employment are not unlawful practices ifbased on a bona fide religious belief about sexual orientation if theactions fall under one of three specific circumstances. Preferencefor employment applicants of a particular religion is not anunlawful practice by a bona fide church or other religiousinstitution if it passes a three part test. The housing, use offacilities and employment exemptions do not apply to commercial or business activities of the church or institution. See ORS 659A.006. The existence of this statute, last amended in 2007, doesnot support Respondents' argument that the public accommodationstatutes are unconstitutional because they do not contain suchexemptions. Rather, it supports the Agency. If the legislature intended such exemptions be applied to the public accommodation statutes it would have enacted them. 49 Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, 573 US ___, 134 SCt 2751 (June 30, 2014). Pet.App.480\"Based on the above, the forum finds ORS \u0001 659A.403 to be constitutional with respect to Article \u0001 I, sections 2 and 3 of the Oregon Constitution. With \u0001 respect to whether ORS 659A.403 is constitutional \u0001 'as applied,' Meltebeke does not aid Respondents for \u0001 the reason that Respondents' refusal to make a \u0001 wedding cake for Complainants was not a 'religious \u0001 but conduct their at 153. Unlawfully infringing on \u0001 Respondents' right of conscience and right to \u0001 free exercise of religion \"Respondents contend that the First Amendment \u0001 to the U.S. Constitution, as applied to the State of \u0001 Oregon under the Fourteenth Amendment, \u0001 prohibits BOLI from enforcing the provisions of \u0001 ORS 659A.403 against Respondents because that \u0001 statute, on its face and as applied, unlawfully \u0001 infringes on Respondents' right of conscience and \u0001 right to free exercise of religion. In pertinent part, \u0001 the First Amendment provides: 'Congress shall \u0001 make no law respecting an establishment of \u0001 religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof * * *.' \"Respondents argue that the forum should apply the 'strict scrutiny' test set out by the U.S. SupremeCourt in Sherbert v. Verneer, 374 US 398 (1963), claiming that Sherbert and the U.S. Supreme Court's subsequent decisions in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 US 205 (1972), Thomas v. Review Board, 450 US 707 (1981), Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. v. PublicPet.App.481Utilities Commissioner., 475 US 1 (1986), Church of \u0001 Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.

She appealed on the groundsthat South Carolina's law violated the free exercisePet.App.482clause of the First Amendment. The court held that \u0001 the law was constitutionally invalid because it \u0001 imposed a burden on appellant's free exercise of her \u0001 religion and there was no 'compelling state interest \u0001 enforced in the eligibility provisions of the South \u0001 Carolina statute [that] justifies the substantial \u0001 infringement of appellant's First Amendment \u0001 rights.' Id. at 404, 406-07. \"In Wisconsin, the Supreme Court held that the \u0001 state of Wisconsin could not compel Amish students \u0001 to attend school beyond the eighth grade when that \u0001 requirement conflicted with Amish religious beliefs, \u0001 stating: \"[I]n order for Wisconsin to compel school attendance beyond the eighth grade against aclaim that such attendance interferes with thepractice of a legitimate religious belief, it mustappear either that the State does not deny thefree exercise of religious belief by itsrequirement, or that there is a state interest ofsufficient magnitude to override the interestclaiming protection under the Free ExerciseClause.\" \"Relying on Sherbert and Wisconsin , the Thomas court reversed the denial of unemployment benefitsto a Jehovah's Witnesses who quit his job becausehis job duties changed from working with sheetmetal to manufacturing turrets for tanks, a war-related task that he opposed based on his religiousbeliefs. In upholding appellant's claim, the courtstated:Pet.App.483'The mere fact that the petitioner's religious \u0001 practice is burdened by a governmental program \u0001 does not mean that an exemption \u0001 accommodating his practice must be granted. \u0001 The state may justify an inroad on religious \u0001 liberty by showing that it is the least restrictive \u0001 means of achieving some compelling state \u0001 interest.' Thomas , at 718. \"In 1990, the Smith case, upon which both the Agency and Respondents rely, came before the courton appeal from the Oregon Supreme Court. TheOregon Supreme Court held that the state's denialof unemployment benefits based on the prohibitionof sacramental peyote use was valid under theOregon Constitution but invalid under the freeexercise clause in the First Amendment of the U. S.Constitution based on Sherbert and Thomas . The U.S. Supreme Court characterized the issue beforeit as follows: \"This case requires us to decide whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendmentpermits the State of Oregon to includereligiously inspired peyote use within the reachof its general criminal prohibition on use of thatdrug, and thus permits the State to denyunemployment benefits to persons dismissedfrom their jobs because of such religiouslyinspired use.\" Smith at 874. Smith argued that 'prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]' includes requiring anyindividual to observe a generally applicable law thatPet.App.484requires (or forbids) the performance of an act that \u0001 his religious belief forbids (or requires).' Id. at 878.\u0001 The court rejected Smith's argument, holding that \u0001 the State of Oregon, 'consistent with the free \u0001 exercise clause,' could deny Smith unemployment \u0001 benefits when Smith's dismissal resulted from the \u0001 use of peyote, a use that was constitutionally \u0001 prohibited under Oregon law. Id. at 890. The court \u0001 specifically declined to apply Sherbert's 'compelling \u0001 interest' test, stating: 'Although, as noted earlier, we have sometimes used the Sherbert test to analyze free exercise challenges to * * * laws, we have never appliedthe test to invalidate one. We conclude todaythat the sounder approach, and the approach inaccord with the vast majority of our precedents,is to hold the test inapplicable to suchchallenges. The government's ability to enforcegenerally applicable prohibitions of sociallyharmful conduct, like its ability to carry outother aspects of public policy, \"cannot depend onmeasuring the effects of a governmental actionon a religious objector's spiritual development.\"To make an individual's obligation to obey sucha law contingent upon the law's coincidence withhis religious beliefs, except where the State'sinterest is compelling - permitting him, by virtueof his beliefs, \"to become a law unto himself,\" -contradicts both constitutional tradition andcommon sense.' (internal citations omitted) Id. at 884-85. The court concluded that the 'right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of theobligation to comply with a \"valid and neutral lawPet.App.485of general applicability on the ground that the law \u0001 proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion \u0001 prescribes (or proscribes).\"' Id. at 879, citing United\u0001 States v. Lee , 455 U.S. 252, at 263, n. 3. Related to \u0001 one of Respondents' arguments here, the court also \u0001 discussed the concept of 'hybrid' cases and \u0001 concluded that Smith was not a 'hybrid' case.50 50 With respect to \"hybrid claims,\" the Smith court stated: \"The only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally applicable law toreligiously motivated action have involved not the Free ExerciseClause alone, but the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction withother constitutional protections, such as freedom of speech and of the press, see Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S., at 304-307, 60 S.Ct., at 903-905 (invalidating a licensing system for religious andcharitable solicitations under which the administrator haddiscretion to deny a license to any cause he deemed nonreligious);Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 63 S.Ct. 870, 87 L.Ed. 1292 (1943) (invalidating a flat tax on solicitation as applied to the dissemination of religious ideas); Follett v. McCormick, 321 U.S. 573, 64 S.Ct. 717, 88 L.Ed. 938 (1944) (same), or the right ofparents, acknowledged in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), to direct the education of their children, see Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) (invalidating compulsory school-attendance lawsas applied to Amish parents who refused on religious grounds tosend their children to school). Some of our cases prohibitingcompelled expression, decided exclusively upon free speech grounds, have also involved freedom of religion, cf. Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977) (invalidating compelled display of a license plate slogan thatoffended individual religious beliefs); West Virginia Bd. of Education v. 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943) (invalidating compulsory flag salute statute challenged by religious objectors). And it is easy to envision a case in which achallenge on freedom of association grounds would likewise bereinforced by Free Exercise Clause concerns. Cf. Roberts v. UnitedPet.App.486\"In Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. \u0001 City of Hialeah , 508 US 520 (1993), the Church of \u0001 the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. ('church') and its \u0001 congregants practiced the Santeria religion, a \u0001 religion that employed animal sacrifice as one of its \u0001 principal forms of devotion. During that devotion, \u0001 animals are killed by cutting their carotid arteries, \u0001 then cooked and eaten following Santeria rituals. \u0001 After the church leased land in Hialeah and \u0001 announced plans to establish a house of worship \u0001 and other facilities there, the city council held an \u0001 emergency public session and passed a resolution \u0001 which noted city residents' 'concern' over religious \u0001 practices inconsistent with public morals, peace, or \u0001 safety, and adopted three substantive ordinances \u0001 addressing the issue of religious animal sacrifice. Using the Smith test, the Supreme Court found that \u0001 the ordinances were neither neutral51 nor of general States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622, S.Ct. 3244, 3251-52, 82 462 (1984) (\"An individual's freedom to speak, to worship,and to petition the government for the redress of grievances could not be vigorously protected from interference by the State [if] acorrelative freedom to engage in group effort toward those endswere not also guaranteed.\") (footnotes omitted) 51 The court examined the history behind the ordinances before concluding: \"In sum, the neutrality inquiry leads to one conclusion: The ordinances had as their object the suppression of religion. Thepattern we have recited discloses animosity to Santeriaadherents and their religious practices; the ordinances by theirown terms target this religious exercise; the texts of theordinances were gerrymandered with care to proscribereligious killings of animals but to exclude almost all secularPet.App.487applicability52 and held that 'a law burdening \u0001 religious practice that is not neutral or not of \u0001 general application' can only survive if there is a \u0001 'compelling' governmental interest and the law is \u0001 'narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.' Id.\u0001 at 546-47. \"Respondents argue that the Smith ' neutrality' \u0001 test should not be applied here for two reasons. \u0001 First, this is a 'hybrid' case in which the law \u0001 'substantially burden[s] multiple rights combining \u0001 religion and speech' that the Smith court\u0001 distinguished from cases that only involve free \u0001 exercise claims. This argument fails because neither \u0001 Respondents' free exercise nor free speech claims killings; and the ordinances suppress much more religious conduct than is necessary in order to achieve the legitimateends asserted in their defense. These ordinances are notneutral, and the court below committed clear error in failingto reach this conclusion.\" Lukumi at 542. 52 In concluding that Hialeah's ordinances were not of \"general applicability,\" the court found that the ordinances \"were draftedwith care to forbid few killings but those occasioned by religious sacrifice,\" that they did not prohibit and approved many kinds of \"animal deaths or kills for nonreligious reason,\" that the city'spurported concern for public health resulting from improperdisposal of animal carcasses only addressed religious sacrifice andnot disposal by restaurants or hunters, that more rigorous standards of inspection were imposed on animals killed for religious sacrifice and eaten than animals killed by hunters orfishermen, and that small commercial slaughterhouses were notsubject to similar requirements related to the city's \"professeddesire to prevent cruelty to animals and preserve the publichealth.\" Id. at 543-45.Pet.App.488are independently viable53 and the two claims \u0001 together are not greater than the sum of their \u0001 parts.54 Second, Respondents argue that ORS \u0001 659A.403 is neither 'neutral' nor of 'general \u0001 applicability.' Applying the Smith test, the forum \u0001 finds that ORS 659A.403 is a 'valid and neutral law \u0001 of general applicability.' As such, it is constitutional \u0001 under the First Amendment's free exercise clause, \u0001 both facially and as applied. \"Oregon Constitution \"Article I, Section 8: freedom of speech \"Article I, Section 8 of the Oregon Constitution \u0001 provides: 'Section 8. Freedom of speech and press. No laws shall be passed restraining the freeexpression of opinion, or restricting the rightto speak, write, or print freely on any subjectwhatever; but every person shall beresponsible for the abuse of this right.' ORS 659A.403 provides, in pertinent part: '(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, all persons within the jurisdiction of thisstate are entitled to the full and equalaccommodations, advantages, facilities andprivileges of any place of public accommodation,without any distinction, discrimination or 53 See discussion in \"free speech\" section, infra . 54 See Elane Photography, LLC v.

'* * * * * '(3) It is an unlawful practice for any person to deny full and equal accommodations,advantages, facilities and privileges of any placeof public accommodation in violation of thissection.' The issues considered by the forum are: (1) Is ORS 659A.403 facially unconstitutional?(2) If ORS 659A.403 is facially constitutional, is it unconstitutional by requiring Respondents toparticipate in 'compelled speech' by making andproviding a wedding v. Robertson, 293 Or 402, 649 P.2d 569 (1982), is the seminal Oregon case in this area.Robertson involved an Article I, Section 8 challenge to ORS 163.275, a statute defining the crime ofcoercion, in which 'speech [was] a statutory elementin the definition of the offense.' Id. at 415. In Robertson , the Oregon Supreme Court established a basic framework, comprised of three categories,for determining whether a law violates Article I,section 8. That framework was most recentlydescribed in State v. Babson , 355 Or 383, 391, 326 P3d 559, 566 (2014). 'Under the first category, the court begins by determining whether a law is \"written in termsdirected to the substance of any 'opinion' or any'subject' of communication.\" If it is, then the lawPet.App.490is unconstitutional, unless the scope of the \u0001 restraint is \"wholly confined within some \u0001 historical exception that was well established \u0001 when the first American guarantees of freedom \u0001 of expression were adopted and that the \u0001 guarantees then or in 1859 demonstrably were \u0001 not intended to reach.\" If the law survives that \u0001 inquiry, then the court determines whether the \u0001 law focuses on forbidden effects and \"the \u0001 proscribed means [of causing those effects] \u0001 or writing,\" or whether it is \u0001 \"directed only against causing the forbidden \u0001 effects.\" If the law focuses on forbidden effects, \u0001 and the proscribed means of causing those \u0001 effects include expression, then the law is \u0001 analyzed under the second Robertson category. \u0001 Under that category, the court determines \u0001 whether the law is overbroad, and, if so, whether \u0001 it is capable of being narrowed. If, on the other \u0001 hand, the law focuses only on forbidden effects, \u0001 then the law is in the third Robertson category, \u0001 and an individual can challenge the law as \u0001 applied to that individual's circumstances.' \u0001 (internal citations omitted) \"Robertson Category One \"In analyzing a law under Robertson's first category , Oregon courts have looked to the text of the law to see whether it expressly regulatesexpression. Babson at 395. In Babson , the issue was the constitutionality of a guideline adopted by theLegislation Administration Committee ('LAC') thatprohibited all overnight use of the capitol steps,including protests like defendants' vigil. DefendantsPet.App.491and the LAC agreed that a person could violate the \u0001 guideline without engaging in expressive activities, \u0001 if, for example, a person used the steps as a \u0001 shortcut while crossing the capitol grounds after \u0001 11:00 p.m. when there were no hearings or floor \u0001 sessions taking place. Id. at 396-97. The court held \u0001 that the guideline was not unconstitutional under \u0001 Robertson's first category because it was not \u0001 'written in terms directed to the substance of any \u0001 \"opinion\" or any \"subject'' of communication.' Id.\u0001 LAC guideline in Babson , is\u0001 not \"written in terms directed to the substance of \u0001 any 'opinion' or any \"subject\" of communication.\" \u0001 Rather, it is a law focused on proscribing the \u0001 pursuit or accomplishment of a forbidden result - in \u0001 this case, discrimination by places of public \u0001 accommodations against individuals belonging to \u0001 specifically enumerated protected classes. As such, \u0001 it is not susceptible to a Robertson category one \u0001 facial challenge. \"Respondents argue that ORS 659A.403 \u0001 expressly regulates expression because the word \u0001 'deny' in section (3) shows that, when properly \u0001 interpreted, 'the statute prohibits communication \u0001 that services are being denied for a prohibited \u0001 reason, which implicates both speech and opinion.' \u0001 (emphasis in original). Under Respondents' \u0001 expansive interpretation, all laws implicating any \u0001 form of communication whatsoever would be faciallyPet.App.492unconstitutional under Article I, Section 8. This is not what the court held in Robertson and Babson .55 \"Based on the above, the forum concludes that ORS 659A.403 is not subject to a Robertson category one Article I, Section 8 facial challenge. 55 See State v. Robertson, 293 Or 402, 416-417, 649 P.2d 569 (1982) (\"As stated above, article I, section 8, prohibits lawmakers from enacting restrictions that focus on the content of speech or writing,either because that content itself is deemed socially undesirable oroffensive, or because it is thought to have adverse consequences. * * * It means that laws must focus on proscribing the pursuit or accomplishment of forbidden results rather than on thesuppression of speech or writing either as an end in itself or as ameans to some other legislative end.\") See also State 679 P.2d 1354, 1359 (1984) (menacing statute held constitutional under Robertson category one analysis even though it prohibited threatening words because \"[t]he fact that theharm may be brought about by use of words, even by wordsunaccompanied by a physical act, does not alter the focus of thestatute, which remains directed against attempts to cause anidentified harm, rather than prohibiting the use of words as such\");State v.

Illig Renn, 341 Or 228 (2006), the \u0001 defendant challenged as overbroad a statute that \u0001 made it a crime to '[r]efuse[ ] to obey a lawful order \u0001 by [a] peace officer' if the person knew that the \u0001 person giving the order was a peace officer. In \u0001 addressing the state's argument that the statute \u0001 was not subject to an overbreadth challenge because \u0001 it did not 'expressly' restrict expression, the court \u0001 stated that a statute is subject to a facial challenge \u0001 under the first or second category of Robertson if it\u0001 'expressly or obviously proscribes expression,' \u0001 leaving statutes with '[m]arginal and unforeseen \u0001 applications to speech and expression' to as-applied \u0001 challenges under the third category.56 Illig-Renn, at 56 The court referred to this type of statute as a \"speech-neutral\" statute, one that \"doe[s] not by its terms forbid particular forms ofexpression.\" Illig-Renn at 233-34.Pet.App.494234.\u0001The court went on to state that facial \u0001 challenges generally would not be permitted 'if the \u0001 statute's application to protected speech [was] not traceable to the statute's express terms.' Id. at 236.\u0001 Based on that interpretation of Article I, section 8, \u0001 the court concluded that the defendant could \u0001 challenge the statute that prohibited interfering \u0001 with a peace officer only as applied, under the third \u0001 category of Robertson, and not on its face, under the \u0001 other two categories. Id. at 237. \"Respondents' argument resembles defendants' \u0001 argument in Babson , which the court characterized \u0001 in the following words: 'Defendants instead argue that, even if the [law] targets some harm\u2014rather than targetingexpression\u2014the [law] has an \"obvious andforeseeable\" application to speech, and it isoverbroad. That is, defendants argue that thetext of the statute does not have to refer toexpression or include expression as an elementto fall under category two, as long as it has anobvious application to expression.' Babson at 398. The Babson court rejected this argument, stating: 'We agree with the state that the statement in Robertson on which defendants rely does not extend Article I, section 8, overbreadth analysisto every law that the legislature enacts. Whenexpression is a proscribed means of causing theharm prohibited in a statute, it is apparent thatthe law will restrict expression in some waybecause expression is an element of the law. ForPet.App.495that type of law, the legislature must narrow the \u0001 law to eliminate apparent applications to \u0001 protected expression. See Robertson, 293 Or. at \u0001 417-18, 649 P2d 569 (noting that when a law \u0001 focused on harmful effects includes expression \u0001 as a proscribed means of causing those effects, \u0001 the court must determine whether the law \u0001 \"appears to reach privileged communication\" \u0001 (emphasis added)). However, if expression is not \u0001 a proscribed means of causing harm, and is not \u0001 described in the terms of the statute, the \u0001 possible or plausible application of the statute to \u0001 protected expression is less apparent. That is, in \u0001 the former situation, every time the statute is \u0001 enforced, expression will be implicated, leading \u0001 to the possibility that the law will be considered \u0001 overbroad; in the latter situation, the statute \u0001 may never be enforced in a way that implicates \u0001 expression, even if it is possible, or even \u0001 apparent, that it could be applied to reach \u0001 protected expression. When a law does not \u0001 expressly or obviously refer to expression, the \u0001 legislature is not required to consider all \u0001 apparent applications of that law to protected \u0001 expression and narrow the law to eliminate \u0001 them. The court's statement in Robertson, on\u0001 which defendants rely, does not extend the \u0001 second category overbreadth analysis to statutes \u0001 that do not, by their terms, expressly or \u0001 obviously refer to protected expression.' Id. at 400. The Babson court went on to explain that 'obviously,' as used in the last sentence of the above-quoted statement, did not 'extend Article I, section8, scrutiny [under the first two RobertsonPet.App.496categories] to any statute that could have an \u0001 apparent application to speech; rather, the \u0001 [Robertson ] court used the word 'obviously' to make \u0001 it clear that creative wording that does not refer \u0001 directly to expression, but which could only be\u0001 applied to expression, would be scrutinized under \u0001 the first two categories of Robertson .' Id. at 403. The \u0001 Babson court concluded its Robertson category two \u0001 analysis by stating: 'Similarly, here, although the guideline does not directly refer to speech, the guideline does haveapparent applications to speech, as defendantscontend. A restriction on use of the capitol stepswill prevent people like defendants fromprotesting or otherwise engaging in expressiveactivities on the capitol steps overnight. Thatfact alone, however, does not subject theguideline to Article I, section 8, scrutiny underthe second category of Robertson. The guideline is not simply a mirror of a prohibition on words.The guideline also bars skateboarding, sitting,sleeping, walking, storing equipment, and allother possible uses of the capitol steps duringcertain hours. Thus, because the guideline doesnot expressly refer to expression as a means ofcausing some harm, and it does not \"obviously\"prohibit expression within the meaning of Moyle, it is not subject to an overbreadth challengeunder the second category of Robertson.' Babson at 403-04. This case, like Babson and Illig- Renn , does not involve a statute that 'obviously' prohibits expression. Rather, it is a 'speech-neutral'Pet.App.497statute as described in Illig-Renn .57 Furthermore, \u0001 the legislature's use of the challenged word 'deny' in \u0001 ORS 659A.403 is contextually similar to the \u0001 challenged word 'refuse' in Illig-Renn , as both terms \u0001 prohibit specific actions that may involve expression \u0001 without specifying a particular form of expression. \u0001 In conclusion, the forum finds that ORS 659A.403 is \u0001 not subject to Article I, section 8 overbreadth \u0001 scrutiny as set out in Robertson, category two. \"Robertson Category Three Does Not Apply to \u0001 Respondents' claim of 'compelled speech.' \"Respondents contend that their Article I, \u0001 section 8, rights were violated by the Agency's \u0001 application of ORS 659A.403 because that \u0001 application, in requiring them to provide a wedding \u0001 cake to Complainants, 'unlawfully compel[s] \u0001 Respondents to engage in expression of a message \u0001 they did not want to express.' The Robertson \u0001 framework was developed in a series of cases \u0001 involving prohibited speech, and there are no \u0001 Oregon cases that have come to the forum's \u0001 attention in which compelled speech was the issue. \u0001 However, the U.S. Supreme Court has addressed \u0001 that issue in a line of cases involving the First \u0001 Amendment and compelled speech. In the absence 57 Cf. State v. Babson , 355 Or 383, 405, 326 P3d 559, 566 (2014), quoting Miller at 489-90 ( Robertson category two analysis did not apply because contested ordinance \"was directed at a harm - streetand sidewalk congestion - that the city legitimately could seek toprevent, and did not, 'by [its] terms, purport to proscribe speech orwriting as a means to avoid a forbidden effect.'\")Pet.App.498of Oregon case law, the forum turns to those \u0001 decisions for guidance. \"As a preliminary matter, the forum addresses \u0001 Respondents' argument, made in their response to \u0001 the Agency's cross-motions for summary judgment, \u0001 that the 'forbidden effect' involved in a Robertson \u0001 category three analysis of the constitutionality of \u0001 ORS 659A.403 is 'Respondents' choice not to be \u0001 involved in Complainants' same-sex ceremony, \u0001 which is alleged to be a denial of services based on \u0001 sexual orientation.' Respondents argue that their \u0001 'choice not to be involved' cannot be a 'forbidden \u0001 effect' because Article XV, section 5a of the Oregon \u0001 Constitution expressly prohibited legal recognition \u0001 of same-sex marriages in January 2013,58 making it \u0001 'clear [that] to same-sex effect.\"' Respondents misread The 'forbidden effect' \u0001 under ORS 659A.403 is not its impact on \u0001 Respondents, but Respondents' denial of services to \u0001 Complainants based on their sexual orientation. \u0001 Respondents were not asked to issue a marriage \u0001 license, perform a wedding ceremony, or in any way \u0001 legally recognize Complainants' planned same-sex \u0001 wedding in contravention of Article XV, Section 5a. \u0001 Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record, as \u0001 submitted for summary judgment, that they \u0001 communicated to Respondents where they intended \u0001 to be married, that they intended to be married in 58 In January 2013, Article XV, section 5a, of the Oregon Constitution provided: \"It is the policy of Oregon, and its politicalsubdivisions, that only a marriage between one man and onewoman shall be valid or legally recognized as a marriage.\"Pet.App.499the state of Oregon, or, for that matter, that \u0001 Complainants were ever married.59 \"The right to refrain from speaking was \u0001 established in West Virginia State Board of \u0001 Education v.

Irish-American GLIB, 515 U.S. 557 \u0001 (1995), presented the question of whether private \u0001 citizens in Massachusetts who organized a St. \u0001 Patrick's Day parade were required to include \u0001 GLIB, a group 'celebrat[ing] its members' identity \u0001 as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of \u0001 the Irish immigrants,' thereby imparting a message \u0001 that the organizers did not wish to convey among \u0001 the marchers. Id. at 570. The requirement was \u0001 based on a provision of Massachusetts' public \u0001 accommodation law that included a prohibition on \u0001 discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. \u0001 The Court found that a parade is a form of \u0001 expression, stating that a 'parade' indicates \u0001 'marchers who are making some sort of collective \u0001 point, not just to each other but to bystanders along \u0001 the way. Indeed, a parade's dependence on watchers \u0001 is so extreme that nowadays, as with Bishop \u0001 Berkeley's celebrated tree, \"if a parade or \u0001 demonstration receives no media coverage, it may \u0001 as well not have happened.\"' Id. at 568. The Court \u0001 also determined that: '[GLIB]'s participation as a unit in the parade was equally expressive. GLIB was formed for thePet.App.502very purpose of marching in it, as the trial court \u0001 found, in order to celebrate its members' identity \u0001 as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants \u0001 of the Irish immigrants, to show that there are \u0001 such individuals in the community, and to \u0001 support the like men and women who sought to \u0001 march in the New York parade. The \u0001 organization distributed a fact sheet describing \u0001 the members' intentions, and the record \u0001 otherwise corroborates the expressive nature of \u0001 GLIB's participation. In 1993, members of GLIB \u0001 marched behind a shamrock-strewn banner with \u0001 the simple inscription \"Irish American Gay, \u0001 Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston.\" GLIB \u0001 understandably seeks to communicate its ideas \u0001 as part of the existing parade, rather than \u0001 staging one of its own.' (internal citations \u0001 omitted) Id. at 570. The Court further determined that '[s]ince every participating unit affects the messageconveyed by the private organizers, the state courts'application of the statute produced an orderessentially requiring petitioners to alter theexpressive content of their parade' 60 and held the state's application of the statute unconstitutionalbecause 'this use of the State's power violates thefundamental rule of protection under the FirstAmendment, that a speaker has the autonomy tochoose the content of his own message.'

Id. at 63-64. The \u0001 Court noted that '[c]ompelling a law school that \u0001 sends scheduling e-mails for other recruiters to \u0001 send one for a military recruiter is simply not the \u0001 same as forcing a student to pledge allegiance, or \u0001 forcing a Jehovah's Witness to display the motto \u0001 'Live Free or Die,' and it trivializes the freedom \u0001 protected in Barnette and Wooley to suggest that it \u0001 is.' Id. at 62. Of additional significance to this case, \u0001 the Court stated: 'Nothing about recruiting suggests that law schools agree with any speech by recruiters, andnothing in the Solomon Amendment restrictswhat the law schools may say about themilitary's policies.

X65) 30) On February 5, 2015, the ALJ granted Respondents' renewed motion to depose Complainants.The ALJ's interim order read as follows: \"Introduction \"On January 15, 2015, Respondents filed a renewed motion to depose Complainants. OnPet.App.508January 22, 2015, the Agency timely filed \u0001 objections. Respondents' motion is based on part on \u0001 their assertion that (1) the 25 additional \u0001 interrogatories they were allowed to serve on the \u0001 Agency pursuant to my September 29, 2014, interim \u0001 order that allowed Respondents to serve additional \u0001 interrogatories as a potential means of eliminating \u0001 the need for a deposition, (2) coupled with the \u0001 Agency's responses to Respondents' prior \u0001 interrogatories and the Agency's answers to the 25 \u0001 additional interrogatories, (3) are inadequate to \u0001 address Complainants' damages, leaving \u0001 Respondents substantially prejudiced as a result. \"On January 22, 2015, the Agency filed \u0001 objections, arguing that Respondents' have not \u0001 clearly articulated how they will be substantially \u0001 prejudiced in the absence of depositions, that \u0001 Complainants should not be subjected to depositions \u0001 'due to Respondents' inability to adequately craft \u0001 their interrogatories,' and that Respondents' \u0001 'discovery tactics are an abuse of process.' \"Discussion \"On October 14, 2014, the Agency complied with \u0001 the forum's September 25, 2014, discovery order \u0001 requiring the Agency to answer Respondents' \u0001 August 5, 2014, interrogatory seeking a detailed \u0001 explanation of Complainants' emotional, physical \u0001 and mental suffering caused by Respondents' \u0001 actions. The Agency's interrogatory response listed \u0001 a total of 88 discrete types of harm suffered by \u0001 Complainant Cryer and 90 discrete types of harm \u0001 suffered by Complainant Bowman-Cryer. In support \u0001 of their motion, Respondents argue that:Pet.App.509'[The listed symptoms], some of which are \u0001 inconsistent with each other, raise more \u0001 questions than they answer. Respondents \u0001 attempted to address some of these nearly 200 \u0001 symptoms in their 25 interrogatories, but were \u0001 unable to even begin to address the questions \u0001 raised by this exhaustive list of symptoms, much \u0001 less get clear answers from Complainants.' Among its objections to Respondents' motion for depositions, the Agency asserts that 'many of thelisted symptoms are interrelated to one another andwould hardly require Respondents to explore themindividually.' The Agency further notes thatRespondents will have an adequate opportunity to'cross-examine Complainants on all symptoms athearing.' \"To more clearly illustrate the points raised by Respondents and the Agency, the types of harmalleged by each Complainant are reprinted below intheir entirety. As will be seen, they permeate allaspects of Complainants' lives. Complainant Rachel Laurel Bowman-Cryer '[90 symptoms listed] 839-050-0200(3) governs depositions in this forum. It provides: 'Depositions are strongly disfavored and will be allowed only when the requesting participantdemonstrates that other methods of discoveryPet.App.510are so inadequate that the participant will be \u0001 substantially prejudiced by the denial of the \u0001 motion to depose a particular witness.' \"Since OAR 839-050-0200(3) was adopted, the forum has been extremely reluctant to grantdepositions, and has uniformly denied respondents'requests for depositions when respondents have notfirst sought informal discovery throughinterrogatories. See, e.g., In the Matter of Oak Harbor Freight Lines, Inc., 33 BOLI 1 (2014), In the Matter of Columbia Components, Inc., 32 BOLI 257 (2013), In the Matter of Blachana, LLC, 32 BOLI 220 (2013), In the Matter of From the Wilderness, Inc., 30 BOLI 227 (2009). The only occasion when the forum has allowed a deposition to take placewas in the Columbia Components case, under the following circumstances: 'During the hearing it became clear that Complainant possessed documents eitherrequested by Respondent and/or set out in the[ALJ's] discovery order that Complainant did notprovide until Respondent was able to ascertainexistence of those documents duringComplainant's testimony * * * [and] thatComplainant had been less than forthcomingwith regard to the existence of those documents.' \"In this case, Respondents have satisfied the forum's requirement of seeking discovery by meansof informal request before requesting a deposition.Before initially requesting a deposition,Respondents made informal document discoveryrequests, requested admissions, and served 25interrogatories on the Agency, all beforePet.App.511Respondents received the Agency's interrogatory \u0001 answer setting out the alleged 178 types of harm \u0001 suffered by Complainants as a result of \u0001 Respondents' actions. \"On September 25, 2014, the forum granted \u0001 Respondents' motion to depose Complainants, with \u0001 the scope of the depositions limited to \u0001 'Complainants' claim for damages.' That ruling was \u0001 predicated on my conclusion that Respondents \u0001 '[had] sought informal discovery on the issue of \u0001 damages through other methods and do not have \u0001 adequate information on damages.' \"At a prehearing conference held on September \u0001 29, 2014, discovery was discussed at length. As \u0001 noted earlier, it was agreed that Respondents would \u0001 be allowed to serve 25 additional interrogatories on \u0001 the Agency as a potential means of eliminating the \u0001 need for a deposition. On October 14, 2014, the \u0001 Agency sent Respondents its interrogatory response \u0001 listing the 178 types of alleged harm. In the absence \u0001 of depositions, that left 25 interrogatories for \u0001 Respondents to explore those 178 listed harms. On \u0001 December 31, 2014, Respondents served the \u0001 interrogatories that were allowed in my September \u0001 29, 2014, ruling. The Agency timely responded on \u0001 January 13, 2015. \"Since Respondents filed their motion on \u0001 January 15, 2015, the Agency was granted \u0001 summary judgment as to Respondents' alleged ORS \u0001 659A.403 violation. In the interim order granting \u0001 summary judgment, I ruled that the only \u0001 evidentiary issue at hearing will be the amount of \u0001 damages, if any, to which Complainants arePet.App.512entitled. The amount of damages sought on \u0001 Complainants' behalf is 'at least $75,000' for each \u0001 Complainant. In addition, it appears from the \u0001 Agency's February 3, 2015, filing in response to the \u0001 forum's inquiry regarding a Protective Order sought \u0001 by the Agency that the Agency may intend to \u0001 present evidence at hearing that Complainants are \u0001 entitled to damages for mental and emotional \u0001 suffering up to the present day, more than two \u0001 years after the date of discrimination. \"I have reviewed prior BOLI Final Orders in \u0001 which damages were awarded for emotional and \u0001 mental suffering and find that this case stands well \u0001 apart from all its predecessors in the exhaustive list \u0001 of harms alleged by Complainants for which the \u0001 Agency seeks damages. No other case comes even \u0001 remotely close. In defending themselves, \u0001 Respondents have a right to inquire into each type \u0001 of harm alleged by Complainants to determine the \u0001 extent of the harm and whether Complainants' \u0001 physical, mental, and emotional suffering was \u0001 caused, at least in part, if not in whole, by events \u0001 and circumstances that were unrelated to Aaron \u0001 Klein's ORS 659A.403 violation. Based on the sheer \u0001 number and variety of types of alleged harm, there \u0001 is no practical way Respondents can accomplish an \u0001 effective inquiry using interrogatories. I find that \u0001 Respondents will be substantially prejudiced if they \u0001 are not allowed to depose Complainants. \"Based on the above, Respondents' motion to Complainants is GRANTED, with the \u0001 following limitations:Pet.App.513'1.\u0001Respondents are allowed a maximum of three \u0001 hours, not counting breaks, to question each \u0001 Complainant. '2.\u0001The Agency may choose where the \u0001 depositions are to be conducted and is instructed \u0001 to cooperate in making Complainants available \u0001 for deposition as soon as practical, given that the \u0001 hearing is scheduled to begin next month. If the \u0001 Agency and Respondents cannot agree on a date, \u0001 they are instructed to contact me and I will \u0001 choose a date. I do not intend to postpone this \u0001 hearing again because of a discovery issue. '3.\u0001Respondents are responsible for any costs \u0001 associated with conducting the deposition. \u0001 Respondents and Agency must each pay for their \u0001 own copy of the transcript if a transcript is \u0001 prepared. '4.\u0001Respondents and the Agency are ordered to \u0001 notify me at least seven days in advance of the \u0001 date and time for the depositions so that I can be \u0001 available if necessary. As of today, the only dates \u0001 I will be unavailable between now and March 1 \u0001 are the afternoon of February 11 and all day \u0001 February 16. 5.\u0001The scope of Respondents' questioning is \u0001 limited to damages. Respondents may not \u0001 engage in a fishing expedition by inquiring into \u0001 matters totally irrelevant to the issue of \u0001 physical, emotional, and mental suffering.'\" (Ex. X72)Pet.App.51431)\u0001On February 11, 2015, \"in view of the national attention and attendant publicity these caseshave already received and the likelihood thatComplainants will be questioned about the protectedhealth information in the records produced under theprotective order,\" the ALJ issued a protective orderregarding Complainants' depositions. The orderprohibited the deposition transcripts or notes made ofthe deposition testimony from being made available to\"non-qualified\" persons or from being used \"for anyother purpose than the preparation for litigation of[the] proceeding.\" (Ex. X74) 32) On February 17, 2015, Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration of the ALJ's ruling onsummary judgment. The ALJ denied Respondents'motion. (Exs. X73, X75, X79) 33) On February 23, 2015, the Agency issued Second Amended Formal Charges in both cases.Respondents filed answers on February 27, 2015. (Exs.X78, X82) 34) Respondents and Agency timely submitted case summaries. (Exs. X76, 77) 35) On February 26, 2015, Respondents filed a motion for discovery sanctions that was opposed by theAgency. On March 5, 2015, the ALJ ruled onRespondents' motion as follows: \"On February 26, 2015, Respondents filed a motion requesting discovery sanctions related to theAgency's failure to provide discovery subject to myDiscovery Order dated September 25, 2014, untilFebruary 24, 2015. The Agency filed a response onPet.App.515February 27, 2015, and Respondents supplemented \u0001 their motion on March 3, 2015. \"The discovery in question relates to my \u0001 September 25, 2014, Order requiring that the \u0001 Agency provide Respondents with: 'all posting by Complainants to any social media website, including but not limited to Facebook,Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace, Instagram, andSnapChat from January 2013 to the present thatcontain comments about the facts of this case,comments about Respondents, or comments thatrelate to their alleged damages.' \"Specifically, Respondents allege that on February 24, 2015, less than three hours before theAgency filed its case summary, the Agency turnedover 109 pages of documents ('subject documents')to Respondents that were subject to my discoveryorder. Respondents further allege that the 109pages were included in the Agency's case summary.The Agency does not dispute these allegations,acknowledges it received the subject documentsfrom Complainants in August 2014, and attempts toexplain the reason for its late disclosure in itsresponse. After reviewing the subject documents, Iconclude that they contain Complainants' socialmedia conversations that fall within the scope of mySeptember 25, 2014, Discovery Order. \"Respondents allege that the Agency's untimely disclosure of these documents establishes bad faithon the part of the Agency and/or Complainants,particularly since the disclosure occurred afterRespondents completed their depositions ofPet.App.516Complainants, and that Respondents are \u0001 irreparably prejudiced as a result. Respondents ask \u0001 that the forum sanction the Agency in a number of \u0001 different ways. \"In my September 25, 2014, Discovery Order, I \u0001 ruled as follows: 'After the scheduled September 29, 2014, prehearing conference in this matter, the forumwill issue a subsequent order stating theAgency's deadline for complying with the termsof this order. The Agency has a continuingobligation, through the close of the hearing, toprovide Respondents' counsel with any newlydiscovered material that responds to theresponses and production ordered in this interimorder. The Agency's failure to comply with thisorder may result in the sanction described inOAR 839-050-0200(11).' In the interim order I issued on September 30, 2014, that summarized the September 29, 2014,prehearing conference, I ordered that \"[t]heDiscovery ordered in my rulings on * * *Respondents' motions for Discovery Orders must bemailed or hand-delivered no later than October 14,2014.\" That was not done. \"As a prelude to my ruling, I note that the forum has no authority to impose the vast majority ofsanctions sought by Respondents. The forum'sauthority in this matter is not derived from theORCP, but from provisions in the Oregon APA, theOregon Attorney General's Administrative Rules(OAR 137-003-0000 to seq . The ALJ's authority \u0001 to impose sanctions for violations of discovery \u0001 orders is set out in OAR 839-050-0020(11): ^ 'The administrative law judge may refuse to admit evidence that has not been disclosed inresponse to a discovery order or subpoena,unless the participant that failed to providediscovery shows good cause for having failed todo so or unless excluding the evidence wouldviolate the duty to conduct a full and fair inquiryunder ORS 183.415(10) 62. If the administrative law judge admits evidence that was notdisclosed as ordered or subpoenaed, theadministrative law judge may grant acontinuance to allow an opportunity for theother participant(s) to respond.\" In brief, the Agency frankly admits that it 'cannot determine why the [subject records] were notproduced [earlier] in discovery, but they were in alocation unlikely to be accessed' and characterizesits 'oversight' as an 'inadvertent error.' The Agencyalso notes, in a supporting declaration by * * * theAgency's Chief Prosecutor, that '[i]t appears that onor about October 3, 2014, in anticipation ofdiscovery, the subject documents were partiallyredacted. I have no other recollection as to why theywere not provided in discovery.' 62 This statutory reference in the current rule is in error. The APA was amended in 2007 and the \"full and fair inquiry\" requirementwas moved to '\"Good cause\" means, unless otherwise \u0001 specifically stated, that a participant failed to \u0001 perform a required act due to an excusable \u0001 mistake or a circumstance over which the \u0001 participant had no control. \"Good cause\" does \u0001 not include a lack of knowledge of the law, \u0001 including these rules.' For the reasons stated below, the forum concludes that the Agency's failure to provide the subjectrecords by October 14, 2014, as ordered by theforum, does not meet the 'good cause' standard.Participants in all cases are responsible for keepingtrack of documents that constitute potentialevidence, particularly documents subject to anexisting discovery order. In this case, the subjectrecords were accessed by BOLI's AdministrativeProsecutions Unit on October 3, 2014, eight daysafter a discovery order was issued requiring theproduction of those records, and only 11 days beforetheir production was due pursuant to the forum'sSeptember 30, 2014, order. The Agency's 'oversight'or storage of the documents in a place where theywere 'unlikely to be accessed' does not constitute 'anexcusable mistake or a circumstance over which the[Agency] had no control.' \"Ordinarily, the forum's sanction for failing to provide documents pursuant to a discovery orderwould be to prohibit the introduction of thedocuments as evidence. ^ However, Respondents assert that some of the subject records willpotentially assist Respondents' defense and explainwhy in their motion. Based on Respondents'Pet.App.519assertion, it appears that a blanket prohibition on \u0001 the introduction of the subject records may \u0001 prejudice Respondents and prevent a 'full and fair \u0001 inquiry' by the forum. The forum's order is crafted \u0001 with this in mind. \"ORDER \"1.\u0001Sanctions: (a) The Agency may not offer \u0001 or otherwise utilize any of the subject documents as \u0001 evidence until such time as Respondents have \u0001 offered the subject documents into evidence or \u0001 otherwise utilized them during the hearing while \u0001 eliciting testimony in support of their case;(b)\u0001Respondents, should they elect to do so, may \u0001 offer or utilize the subject documents in support of \u0001 their case. \"2. Discovery Order \"To the extent these records have not already been provided, the forum hereby issues a discoveryorder requiring the Agency to provide responsivedocuments to items ##1, 5-6, 8, 13-15, and 21 listedon pages 9 and 10 of Respondents' Motion forDiscovery Sanctions, with the caveat that theAgency is not required to produce statements madeto Ms. Gaddis or Ms. Casey, the Agency'sadministrative prosecutors in this case, in anyresponse to item #5. The Agency's responsibility toproduce any such records begins as soon as thisorder is issued and continues until the hearing isconcluded. The forum will apply OAR 839-050-0020(11) if an issue arises regarding an allegedfailure by the Agency to produce such records in atimely manner.Pet.App.520\"3.\u0001Respondents' request that the forum \u0001 dismiss the Agency's Second Amended Formal \u0001 Charges is DENIED . \"4.

Respondents' request to 'reopen discovery to allow for depositions of Complainants and otherBOLI witnesses with knowledge of these matters' isDENIED . \"6. Respondents' request that the cases be dismissed or that the Agency's claim for damages ofComplainants' behalf be dismissed is DENIED . \"7. Respondents' request for costs is DENIED . \"8. Respondents' request for any other sanctions not specifically discussed in this interimorder is DENIED .\" (Exs. X81, X83, X86, X87) 36) The general public was allowed to attend the hearing. Because of this and potential security issues,the ALJ issued guidelines prior to the hearing that,among other things: prohibited the public frombringing backpacks, briefcases, satchels, carrying casesany type, or handbags into the building in which thehearing was held; prohibited the use of audio recordersand cameras, including cell phone cameras andrecorders; and required cell phones to be turned offduring the hearing. (Ex. X85; Statement of ALJ) 37) At the start of the hearing, the ALJ orally advised the Agency and Respondents of the issues to bePet.App.521addressed, the matters to be proved, and the \u0001 procedures governing the conduct of the hearing.(Statement of ALJ) 38)\u0001During the hearing, the Agency offered \u0001 Exhibits A24 and A26. Respondents objected to their \u0001 admission and the ALJ reserved ruling on their \u0001 admissibility for the Proposed Order. Respondents \u0001 objected on the basis of relevancy. Exhibits A24 and \u0001 A26 are received because they are relevant to show the \u0001 impact that the media exposure spawned by this case \u0001 had on Complainants. (Exs. A24, A26) 39)\u0001During ALJ consider LBC's testimony about the \"handfasting cord\" \u0001 used in LBC's and RBC's commitment 63 ceremony as an \u0001 offer of proof and rule on its admissibility in the \u0001 Proposed Order. That testimony is admitted because it \u0001 is not evidence that was required to be disclosed by the \u0001 ALJ's discovery orders and it is relevant to show the \u0001 extent of Complainants' commitment to their \u0001 relationship. (Testimony of LBC; Statement of ALJ) 40)\u0001On March 16, after the Agency had concluded \u0001 its case-in-chief, Respondents filed a motion for an \u0001 order to Dismiss or Reopen Discovery and Keep Record \u0001 Open. Respondents argued that this was necessary in \u0001 order: \"to allow Respondents a full and fair opportunity to reopen discovery concerning possible undisclosed 63 The forum uses the term \"commitment\" because the handfasting cord was used in Complainants' June 27, 2013, ceremony at theWest End Ballroom, when same-sex marriage was not yetpermitted in the state of Oregon.Pet.App.522collusion among Complainants, Basic Rights Oregon \u0001 and/or the Agency in light of the testimony of \u0001 Agency witness Aaron Cryer elicited at the hearing \u0001 on Friday, March 13, 2015.\" The ALJ allowed Respondents and the Agency to present oral argument on Respondents' motion whenthe hearing re-convened on March 17, 2015, thendenied Respondents' motion. (Ex. X94; Statement ofALJ) 41) Respondents called AK, MK, and RBC as witnesses in support of their case in chief. At theconclusion of RBC's testimony on March 17, 2015,Respondents' counsel Grey made the followingstatement: \"That's all of the witnesses that we have to present at this time. However, for purposes of the record I'dlike to make it clear that Respondents did notintend to rest their case in chief for the reasons wediscussed in connection with the motion that wepresented this morning, which the forum denied. Sosimply for purposes of the record, we are notplanning on closing our case in chief.\" (Statement of Grey) 42) On May 28, 2015, Respondents filed a motion to Reopen the Contested Case Record. The Agency fileda response on June 2, then supplemented its responseon June 5, 2015. On June 22, 2015, the ALJ issued aninterim order that denied Respondents' motion. TheALJ's ruling is reprinted in its entirety below:Pet.App.523\"Pursuant to OAR 839-050-0410, Respondents \u0001 filed a motion to reopen the contested case record on \u0001 May 29, 2015. \"OAR 839-050-0410 provides: 'On the administrative law judge's own motion or on the motion of a participant, theadministrative law judge will reopen the recordwhen the administrative law judge determinesadditional evidence is necessary to fully andfairly adjudicate the case. A participantrequesting that the record be reopened to offeradditional evidence must show good cause fornot having provided the evidence before therecord closed.' \"Good cause\" means: '[U]nless otherwise specifically stated, that a participant failed to perform a required act dueto an excusable mistake or a circumstance overwhich the participant had no control. \"Goodcause\" does not include a lack of knowledge ofthe law, including these rules.' OAR 839-050-0020(16). Respondents' motion, like their earlier motion to Disqualify BOLI Commissioner Brad Avakian, ispredicated on their argument that CommissionerAvakian's alleged bias 'has effectively precludedRespondents from receiving due process in thiscase.' \"In support of their motion, Respondents attached documentation of the following: (1) emailsbeginning April 11, 2014, and ending January 31,Pet.App.5242015, primarily containing conversations between \u0001 Charlie Burr, BOLI's Communications Director and \u0001 Strategy Works NW, LLC, Basic Rights of Oregon \u0001 ('BRO'), and Senator Jeff Merkley's office, that were \u0001 forwarded to Respondents' counsel by email by on \u0001 May 20, 2015, by Kelsey Harkness, a reporter for \u0001 the Daily Signal, pursuant to a public records \u0001 request made by Harkness (the 'Harkness records');(2)\u0001testimony of both Rachel and Laurel Bowman- Cryer from their February 17, 2015, depositions; \u0001 and (3) selected hearing testimony of Aaron Cryer, \u0001 brother of Complainant Rachel Bowman-Cryer. \u0001 Respondents contend that the above shows 'hitherto \u0001 undisclosed collusion between complainants, BOLI \u0001 and Basic Rights Oregon * * * sufficient to taint the \u0001 integrity of the proceedings and deny Respondents \u0001 fundamental due process or a fair hearing\" and \u0001 'unfairly prejudice Respondents['] rights herein. \"Specifically, Respondents ask that the record be \u0001 reopened so that they can: \"(1) Depose Aaron Cryer; \"(2) Request, obtain and review additional documents from BOLI, BRO, and others and toissue interrogatories through subpoena duces tecum upon non-participants including but not limited to Commissioner Brad Avakian, theCommissioner's assistant Jesse Bontecou,Charlie Burr, Emily McLain, Joe LeBlanc andMaura Roche, all of whom are identified in theemails provided to Respondents by Harkness;Pet.App.525\"(3)\u0001Depose Avakian, and \"(4)\u0001Depending on the information obtained, \u0001 renew their motion to disqualify the \u0001 Commissioner \"and other BOLI personnel shown \u0001 to have been involved in this political agenda \u0001 from any role in deciding the case.\" On June 2, 2015, the Agency timely filed a response to Respondents' motion, then supplemented it withan amended response on June 5, 2015. \"Discussion \"Under OAR 839-050-0410, Respondents have the burden of showing 'good cause' within themeaning of OAR 839-050-0020(16) for reopening thecontested case record. To show good cause,Respondents must demonstrate an excusablemistake or a circumstance over which Respondentshad no control. The excusable mistake orcircumstances over Respondents had no controlmeans 'there must be a superseding or interveningevent which prevents timely compliance.'

Bureau of Labor andIndustries, 110 151, 821 P2d 1134 (1991). The mistaken act or failure to act is excusable if a partymistakenly acts or fails to act due to being misledby facts or circumstances that would mislead areasonable person under similar circumstances.Ashlanders, citing In the Matter of 60 Minute Tune,Pet.App.5269 BOLI 191 (1991), affirmed without opinion, Nida v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, 119 Or App 174, 822 P2d 974 (1993). The forum examines the threedifferent types of supporting documentationprovided by Respondents against these standards. A. The Harkness Records\"The emails provided to Respondents by Harkness are dated April 11, 2014, to January 31,2015, well before the hearing began. Respondentsdo not assert that BOLI did not cooperate promptlyin providing these documents to Harkness when shemade her public records request. Respondents' June18, 2014, motion to disqualify CommissionerAvakian due to bias makes it apparent thatRespondents considered the Commissioner's allegedbias to be a relevant issue at least nine monthsbefore the hearing began. Despite this, there is noevidence in the record that Respondents made adiscovery request or public records request for therecords that were provided to Harkness. This is acircumstance that was under Respondents' control,and Respondents provide no explanation for theirown failure to make a pre-hearing request for theserecords that they now claim are relevant andprobative of the Commissioner's bias. In addition,Respondents have failed to show a superseding orintervening event that prevented them obtainingthe Harkness Records before the hearing or thatthey were misled by facts or circumstances thatwould mislead a reasonable person under similarcircumstances. Accordingly, the forum concludesthat Respondents have not shown good cause forPet.App.527their failure to pursue the Harkness records before the hearing and offer them as evidence at hearing.64 64 There are no Commissioner's Final Orders interpreting \"good cause\" in the context of a motion to reopen a contested case proceeding. Besides Ashlanders, City of Umatilla, and 60 Minute Tune , there have been numerous Final Orders interpreting the definition of \"good cause\" in OAR 839-050-0020(16) in othercontexts. None of them support Respondents' claim that theirsupporting documentation shows \"good cause.\" Cf.

Compare In the Matter of Computer Products Unlimited, Inc., 31 BOLI 209, 212-13 (2011) (respondent's motion for postponement granted based on emergency medicaltreatment required by the wife of respondent's authorizedrepresentative that could not be put off); In the Matter of Spud Cellar Deli, Inc., 31 BOLI 106, 111 (2010)(forum granted the agency's motion for a hearing postponement based on the fact thatrespondent's counsel had been traveling out of state due to a deathin her family and was unable to adequately prepare for hearing);In the Matter of Northwestern Title Loans LLC, 30 BOLI 1, 3, (2008)(forum granted respondent's motion for postponement basedon unavailability of respondent's key witness on the date set forhearing); In the Matter of Captain Hooks, LLP, 27 BOLI 211, 213 (2006)(respondent's motion for postponement granted based onrespondent's documented emergency medical condition); In the Matter of SQDL Co., 22 BOLI 223, 227-28 (2001)(when respondent retained substitute counsel after its original counsel was suspended from the practice of law and substitute counsel filed amotion for postponement five days before the hearing based on thecomplexity of the case and his corresponding need for more time toprepare for the hearing, the ALJ concluded that respondent had shown good cause and granted the motion); In the Matter of Ann L.

This is merely a \u0001 repeat of Respondents' March 16, 2015, argument \u0001 made in their Motion to Dismiss or Reopen \u0001 Discovery and Keep Record Open that the ALJ \u0001 denied at hearing. The deposition testimony given \u0001 by Complainants that Respondents now argue \u0001 justifies reopening the case was given on February \u0001 17, 2015, almost a month before the hearing \u0001 commenced. In their depositions, Complainants \u0001 were asked questions and gave answers regarding \u0001 Jeanna Frazzini, Amy Ruiz, BRO, and their \u0001 involvement with Frazzini, Ruiz, and BRO, as \u0001 reflected in the attachments to Exhibit X94. Despite \u0001 that deposition testimony, there is no evidence that \u0001 Respondents attempted to follow up on the collusion \u0001 that Respondents now alleges existed between these \u0001 individuals, Complainants, BRO, and BOLI. \u0001 Further, Respondents could have questioned \u0001 Complainants about Cryer's testimony in their case-in-chief, but did not do so. These opportunities were \u0001 both circumstances that were under Respondents' \u0001 control. Likewise, Respondents have not shown a \u0001 superseding or intervening event that prevented \u0001 them from pursuing further discovery before the \u0001 hearing based on Complainants' deposition \u0001 testimony or that they were misled by facts or \u0001 circumstances that would mislead a reasonable \u0001 person under similar circumstances. Accordingly, \u0001 Respondents have not established good cause to \u0001 support their argument that Complainants' \u0001 deposition testimony, coupled with Aaron Cryer's \u0001 hearing testimony and the Harkness records, \u0001 constitute grounds for reopening the contested casePet.App.531record to pursue the additional discovery that \u0001 Respondents seek in this motion. C.\u0001Aaron Cryer's Testimony \"Respondents' proffered characterization of \u0001 Cryer's quoted testimony as ' directly implicat[ing] \u0001 BOLI and Complainants in using this case against \u0001 Respondents for a political agenda rather than a \u0001 good faith claim for recovery of damages to \u0001 Complainants' is simply inaccurate. As noted above, \u0001 Respondents were aware of communications \u0001 between Complainants, BRO, BOLI, Frazzini, and \u0001 Ruiz before the hearing, but elected not to pursue \u0001 the defense they now assert by requesting \u0001 additional discovery or by calling Complainants as \u0001 witnesses in their case in chief to explore the \u0001 alleged political agenda. This was a choice made by \u0001 Respondents' legal team, not a circumstance beyond \u0001 Respondents' control, and Respondents have not \u0001 shown any superseding or intervening event that \u0001 prevented them seeking additional discovery or that \u0001 they were misled by facts or circumstances that \u0001 would mislead a reasonable person under similar \u0001 circumstances. Accordingly, Cryer's testimony that \u0001 Respondents rely on is not good cause within the \u0001 meaning of OAR 839-050-0410 and OAR 839-050-0020(16). D. The Additional Evidence Sought by Respondents is Unnecessary to Fully andFairly Adjudicate This Case \"Notwithstanding the lack of 'good cause,' the forum also concludes that additional evidence onthe issues raised in Respondent's motion isPet.App.532unnecessary to fully and fairly adjudicate this case, \u0001 as the forum has fully and carefully considered and \u0001 ruled on these matters, which are incorporated \u0001 herein and made a part hereof by this reference. See\u0001 Ex. X12 (ALJ's July 2, 2014, Interim Order entitled \u0001 Ruling on Respondents' Election to Remove Cases to \u0001 Circuit Court and Alternative Motion to Disqualify \u0001 BOLI Commissioner Brad Avakian ).65 \"Furthermore, since these prior rulings the \u0001 Oregon Court of Appeals issued an opinion in \u0001 Columbia Riverkeeper v. Clatsop County, 267 Or \u0001 App 578, 341 P3d 790 (2014) that supports those \u0001 rulings. Respondents' earlier motions sought to \u0001 disqualify Commissioner Avakian due to 'actual \u0001 bias.' In Columbia, Huhtala, a Clatsop County \u0001 Commissioner, ran for election on the platform of \u0001 not allowing a LNG business to be established in \u0001 Astoria, then voted to deny in a land use decision \u0001 that denied a pipeline company's application to \u0001 build an LNG pipeline originating in Astoria. Prior 65 Cf. In the Matter of Mountain Forestry, Inc., 29 BOLI 11, 48-50 (2007), affirmed without opinion, Mountain Forestry, Inc. v. Bureau of Labor and Industries , 229 Or App 504, 213 P3d 590 (2009)(when respondents moved to reopen the record to admit afederal audit that purportedly showed the prevalence of recordsdiscrepancies throughout the firefighting industry and that theOregon Department of Forestry did not have specific trainingrequirements prior to 2003, and that purportedly negated certain inferences drawn from witness testimony, the forum found that, notwithstanding respondents' failure to submit an affidavitshowing they had no knowledge of the audit prior to its release inMarch 2006, the audit did not contain any information relevant to the issues in the case or that mitigated respondents' violations andtherefore the additional evidence was not necessary to fully andfairly adjudicate the case).Pet.App.533to his election, Huhtala had made many public \u0001 statements opposing construction of an LNG \u0001 pipeline. In reversing the Land Use Board of \u0001 Appeals' (LUBA) decision that Huhtala's bias had \u0001 deprived the pipeline company of an impartial \u0001 tribunal, the court stated: 'All told, no single case in Oregon establishes what is necessary for a party to prove actualbias by an elected official in quasi-judicial land-use proceedings such as this one. Generally, wecan glean the following. The bar fordisqualification is high; no published case hasconcluded that disqualification was required inquasi-judicial land-use proceedings. An electedlocal predisposition' isnot grounds for disqualification. Involvementwith other governmental organizations that mayhave an interest in the decision does not requiredisqualification. An elected local official is notexpected to have no appearance of having viewson matters of community interest when adecision on the matter is to be made by anadjudicatory procedure. 'In addition to those general observations, there are three salient principles from the case lawthat define and drive our analysis in this case.First, the scope of the \"matter\" and \"question at issue\" is narrowly limited to the specific decisionthat is before the tribunal. Second, because of the nature of elected local officials makingdecisions in quasi-judicial proceedings, the biasmust be actual, not merely apparent. And third,Pet.App.534the substantive standard for actual bias is that \u0001 the decision maker has so prejudged the \u0001 particular matter as to be incapable of \u0001 determining its merits on the basis of the \u0001 evidence and arguments presented.' Columbia Riverkeeper at 602-03. \"Under this standard, none of the \"evidence\" that Respondents have proffered previously or insupport of their Motion to Reopen the ContestedCase Record is probative to show \"actual fornot providing the proffered \"evidence\" before therecord closed, the Motion is denied on the merits.
