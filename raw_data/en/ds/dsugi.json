Are vaccinated children healthier than non-vaccinated children? 2. Do the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks? 3. What are the real numbers of children being hurt? 4. Are vaccinations \"effective\"? If you missed these, please see the previous columns in my archive at www.NeighborsNewspaper.com or at my website www.DonohoeChiropractic.com. This month we continue with lots more information you won't hear anywhere else! 5. Are vaccine doses personalized? The somewhat shocking answer is no! Although all prescription medications are dosage adjusted based on the patient's body weight, the often times multiple vaccines given to our infants and children are not. A 5 pound premature baby will get the same dosage as a 60 pound 6-year-old! Very interesting to note is that a single vaccine given to a 6 pound newborn is the equivalent of giving an adult 30 vaccinations on the same day! Also note that lighter and premature babies have a higher rate of \"crib death\" than the heavier, more developed babies. (More on crib death shortly.) 6. Can vaccines cause damage that may not surface for years? Congressman Dan Burton, who is very active investigating vaccine safety said this in the LA Times on April 24, 2000... \"Instead of hiding our heads in the sand to protect the status quo, it is time to admit that [there are] no adequate studies to determine the long-term effects of vaccines on our children and future generations.\" We don't know if a vaccine given to your child today may cause or contribute to disease in 5, 10, 20 or more months or years! How long do they observe children given new, experimental vaccines? One package insert from a Hepatitis B vaccine indicates that the subjects were monitored for 4 days after the injection to observe for any potential ill effects. After only 4 days the vaccine was reported to have no serious long-term side effects! This article appeared in the British Journal, The Lancet in 1985; Measles vaccination in childhood was related to the following diseases in adult life: autoimmune diseases... skin diseases, degenerative diseases of bone and cartilage and certain tumors. Renne T. Measles virus infection without rash leads to disease in adult life. Lancet 5 January 1985. Notice the title: \"Measles virus infection without rash leads to disease in adult life.\" Every vaccine is technically an infection. The goal is to infect a child \"just a little\" to invoke antibodies, but not cause symptoms. However the rash and other symptoms are part of the healing process, the way the body externalizes the infection. Are we keeping a child infected for life is we inject bacteria and viruses and other substances but don't stimulate a healing response? What should be done? A controlled study: You take two large groups of people, match them by age and other factors, vaccinate one group and don't vaccinate the other. Then compare incidence of disease over a period of several years. That's a long-term study. Short-term studies don't give us any information about vaccination efficacy. How many long-term controlled studies are there for all vaccines for all diseases in the world since the beginning of science? Zero! 7. Can vaccines cause crib death (SIDS)? Dr. Harris Coulter, PhD whom I introduced last month stated; \"'Crib death' was so infrequent in the pre-vaccination era that it was not even mentioned in the statistics, but it started to climb in the 1950's with the spread of mass vaccination.\" Dr. William Torch was Director of Child Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Nevada School of Medicine. in his study Dr. Torch found that out of 103 children who died of SIDS, 70% received the pertussis vaccine within three weeks. 6.5% died within 12 hours of the vaccine, 13% died within 24 hours, 26% died within three days. As he wrote; \"DPT vaccination may be a generally unrecognized major cause of sudden infant and early childhood death...the risks of immunization may outweigh its potential benefits.\" His paper was presented at a meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in 1982 and published in Neurology, a peer-reviewed medical journal. What was the medical profession's response to this paper? Dr. Torch was attacked and condemned for presenting his study. One of the most powerful vaccine-crib death correlations is what occurred in Japan. Until 1975 the Japanese followed the American schedule of giving vaccines at 2, 4, 6 months, etc. After 37 babies died in one prefecture in Japan the law was changed making it illegal to vaccinate under the age of two. In 1975 Japan raised the minimum age of vaccination from 2 months to 2 years. Crib death, infantile seizures, meningitis and other infectious diseases in infants virtually disappeared. Japan went from 17th in infant mortality to 1st! However serious infectious diseases such as meningitis sharply increased in 2 year olds! That's enough food for thought this month. But, there's more to come! So stay tuned to this column as we continue to explore Questions All Parents Should Ask About Childhood Vaccinations.
