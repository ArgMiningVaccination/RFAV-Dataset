Part of Cabarrus College's commitment to helping you stay healthy is having a comprehensive plan to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has become part of the \"new normal\" in our lives, but it still poses a threat, and we must continue to acknowledge that and operate accordingly. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic we have made decisions, set policies, and developed plans with student and teammate safety as our top priority. We have relied on public health experts, federal and state guidelines, and our parent organization, Atrium Health.

It is our collective responsibility to keep each other safe and well; please continue to take this responsibility seriously. Overall, we have done well as a college community in taking the appropriate health and safety measures; let's continue to serve as exemplars and leaders in the fight against this terrible disease. Thanks very much for your serious consideration of these expectations. Please have a great Spring semester!
