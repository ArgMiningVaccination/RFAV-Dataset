The Student Accident Report Form is available online (www.vernoncollege.edu), and is to be completed by the student within 24 hours of the accident and turned in to the VC Police Department. Alcohol The use of alcohol can lead to serious health risks, such as the loss of muscle control, poor coordination, slurred speech, fatigue, nausea, headaches, increased likelihood of accidents, impaired judgment, and possible respiratory paralysis.Heavy drinking can lead to alcoholism; damage to brain cells; increased risk of cirrhosis; ulcers; heart disease; heart attack; cancers of the liver, mouth, throat, and stomach; and hallucinations. Illegal Drugs Health risks associated with the use of illegal drugs include increased susceptibility to disease due to a less efficient immune system, increased likelihood of accidents, personality disorders, addiction, death by overdose, anemia, and poor concentration. Bacterial Meningitis Effective January 1, 2014, all first-time college students and returning students under the age of 22 must be immunized against bacterial meningitis, according to the Jamie Schanbaum and Nicolis Williams Act. All incoming freshmen, transfer students and returning students, following a break in enrollment of at least one fall or spring semester, will be required to show proof of immunization against bacterial meningitis. Documentation showing that the student has received the immunization within the last five years must be provided at least 10 days prior to the first day of the semester in order to register for classes. Students must submit one of the following in order to be cleared for registration: the signature or stamp of a physician (or his/her designee) or public health personnel on a form that shows the month, day and year the vaccination dose or booster was administered an official immunization record generated from a state or local health authority an official high school or college transcript that includes documentation of immunization provided by school officials (including records from other states) After submitting proof of immunization, there will be a waiting period to allow for the processing of immunization information before a student will be cleared for registration. The law does not apply to students: age 22 and over Enrolled only in Online Classes which does not include a face-to-face component. Enrolled in Continuing Education courses or programs less than 360 contact hours or Continuing Education corporate training. Enrolled in Dual Credit courses taught at a public or private K-12 facility. Who submit an affidavit or a certificate signed by a physician who is duly registered and licensed to practice medicine in the United States, in which it is stated that, in the physician's opinion, the vaccination required would be injurious to the health and well-being of the student. Who submit an affidavit signed by the student stating that the student declines the vaccination for bacterial meningitis for reasons of conscience, including religious belief. A conscientious exemption form (\"Affidavit Request for Exemption from Immunizations for Reasons of Conscience\") from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) must be used by students living in on-campus housing. The DSHS form may be ordered electronically. Allow several weeks to submit and have form approved by the Texas Department of State Health Services.

Students must print the form, have it notarized, and file it with the Office of Admissions and Records. VC students who are required to have the vaccination will not be allowed to register until they provide proof of immunization to the Office of Admissions and Records. Getting the Immunization - Students should get the bacterial meningitis vaccination from their primary care provider. If they do not have a health care provider then a community vaccinator Walgreens or CVS is an alternative. Communicable Disease Policy This policy defines and addresses communicable diseases, which from time to time arise in colleges among students. A communicable disease is an illness due to an infectious agent or its toxic products that arises through transmission of that agent or its products from a reservoir to a susceptible host and as further defined in the Texas Health and Safety Code, Section 81.001, et seg. Communicable diseases include, but are not limited to measles, influenza, viral hepatitis-A (infectious hepatitis), viral hepatitis-B (serum hepatitis), human immune deficiency virus (HIV infection), AIDS, AIDS-Related Complex (ARC), Avian Influenza, meningitis, meningococcal infections and tuberculosis.This policy and other procedures developed by the College shall emphasize educating students concerning communicable diseases and managing each case individually with sensitivity, flexibility, and concern for the individual as well as for the College community. The College's decisions concerning a person who has a communicable disease will be based upon current and well- informed medical judgment that includes the nature of the disease, risk of transmission to others, symptoms and special circumstances of the person, and balancing identifiable risks and available alternatives to respond to a student with a communicable disease. Vernon College maintains authority to initiate dismissal of a student who has a chronic communicable disease or is a carrier of a chronic communicable disease from a particular program or course of study whenever such chronic communicable disease has a direct effect on the student's ability to perform or is deemed as a significant health risk to the campus population as a whole. At the request of the Dean of Student Services, qualified medical personnel may establish additional rules and regulations designed to implement this policy. Discrimination/Confidentiality/Counseling The College will not discriminate against any student solely on the grounds that the student has a communicable disease. No student will be required to cease attending classes or participating in college functions solely on the basis of diagnosis of a communicable disease. The medical history or records of any student are considered confidential, and will not be released without the individual's consent except as otherwise provided by law. The College will make available to all students, information developed by the Texas Department of Health. Vernon College staff will refer students to sources of testing for HIV infection and counseling upon student's request. "}
