Risk Factors Important factors that could cause actual financial, business, research or operating results to differ materially from expectations are disclosed in this annual report, including without limitation the following risk factors. Investors should carefully consider all theinformation set forth in the following risk factors before deciding to invest in any of the Company's securities. In addition to the risks listed below, we may be subject to other material risks that as ofthe date of this report are not currently known to us or that wedeem immaterial at this time. Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters We rely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our products,and if such patents and other rights were limited,invalidated or circumvented, our financial results could bematerially and adversely affected. Through patent and other proprietary rights such as data exclusivity or supplementary protection certificates in Europe, we hold exclusivity rights for a number of our research-based products. However, the protection that we are able to obtain varies in itsduration and scope from product to product and country by country. This protection may not be sufficient to maintain effective product exclusivity because of local differences in the patents, in nationallaws, applicable legal systems or developments in law orjurisprudence, which may give rise to inconsistent judgments when we assert or defend our patents. Moreover, patent and other proprietary rights do not always provide effective protection for our products. Manufacturers of generic products or biosimilars are increasingly seeking to challenge patent validity or coverage before the patents expire, and manufacturers of biosimilars or interchangeable versions of the products are seeking to have their version of the product approved before theexclusivity period ends. Furthermore, in an infringement suit against a third-party, we may not prevail and the decision rendered may not conclude that our patent or other proprietary rights arevalid, enforceable or infringed. Our competitors may alsosuccessfully avoid patents, for example through design innovation, and we may not hold sufficient evidence of infringement to bring suit. We are involved in litigation worldwide to enforce certain of our patent rights against generics, proposed generics and biosimilars of our small molecule and biological pharmaceutical products (see \"Item 8. Financial Information - A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information - Information on Legalor Arbitration Proceedings\" for additional information). Even in cases where we ultimately prevail in an infringement claim, legal remedies available for harm caused to us by infringing products may be inadequate to make us whole. A competitor may launch a generic or a biosimilar product \"at risk\" before the initiation or completion of the court proceedings, and the court may decline to grant us a preliminary injunction to halt further \"at risk\" sales andorder removal of the infringing product from the market.Additionally, while we would be entitled to obtain damages in such a case, the amount that we may ultimately be awarded and able to collect may be insufficient to compensate all harm caused to us. A successful result against a competing product for a given patent orin a specific country is not necessarily predictive of our future success against another competing product or in another country because of local variations in the patents and patent laws. In addition, if we lose patent protection as a result of an adverse court decision or a settlement, we face the risk that government and private third-party payers and purchasers of pharmaceutical products may claim damages alleging they have over-reimbursed or overpaid for a drug. For example, in Australia, our patent on clopidogrel was ultimately held invalid. Following this decision, theAustralian Government is seeking damages for its alleged over- reimbursement of clopidogrel drugs due to the preliminary injunction we had secured against the sale of generic clopidogrelduring the course of the litigation. In certain cases to terminate or avoid patent litigation, we or our collaborators may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of third-party intellectual property rights that already cover aspects ofour existing and future products in order to manufacture, use and/or sell them. Any payments under these licenses may reduce ourprofits from such products and we may not be able to obtain these licenses on favorable terms or at all. Third parties may also request a preliminary or a permanent injunction in a country from a court of law to prevent us from marketing a product if they consider that we infringe their patentrights in that country. For example, Sanofi is currently party topatent infringement proceedings in several countries initiated against us and Regeneron by Amgen relating to Praluent \u00aein which Amgen has requested injunctive relief (see Note D.22.b) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report for more information). If third parties obtain a preliminary orpermanent injunction or if we fail to obtain a required license for acountry where a valid third-party intellectual property rights as confirmed by a court of law exist, or if we are unable to alter the design of our technology to fall outside the scope of third-partyintellectual property rights, we may be unable to market some of our products in certain countries, which may limit our profitability. Also, some countries may consider granting a compulsory license to a third-party to use patents protecting an innovator's product, which limits the value of the patent protection granted to such products. We have increased the proportion of biological therapeutics in our pipeline relative to traditional small molecule pharmaceutical products. Typically, the development, manufacture, sale anddistribution of biological therapeutics is complicated by third-partyintellectual property rights (otherwise known as freedom to operate(FTO) issues), to a greater extent than for the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of small molecule therapeutics, 4 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION because of the types of patents allowed by national patent offices. Further, our ability to successfully challenge third-party patent rights is dependent on the laws of national courts. Certain countries have laws that provide stronger bases for challenging third-partypatent rights compared to the laws that are available to challenge patents in other countries. Therefore, we may be able to invalidate a certain third-party patent in one country but not invalidatecounterpart patents in other countries. In addition, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. With the accelerated regulatory pathways provided in the US and Europe for biosimilar drug approval, biosimilars can be a threat to the exclusivity of any biological therapeutics we sell or may market in the future and can pose the same issues as the small molecule generic threat described above. Governments may adopt morepermissive approval frameworks (for example, shortening the duration of data exclusivity, or narrowing the scope of new products receiving data exclusivity) which could allow competitorsto obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars including as a substitutable product, increasing competition for our products (see also \"- Changes in the laws or regulations that apply to uscould affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\" below). If a biosimilar version of one of our products were to be approved, it could reduce our sales and/or profitability ofthat product. However, through our presence as a manufacturer of generics and biosimilars, we will also utilize patent challenge strategies against other innovators' patents similar to those of long-established generic companies, though there is no assurance that thesestrategies will be successful. If our patents and/or proprietary rights to our products were limited or circumvented, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected. Product liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Product liability is a significant risk for any pharmaceutical company and our product liability exposure could increase given that liability claims relating to our businesses may differ with regard to their nature, scope and level from the types of product liabilityclaims that we have handled in the past. Substantial damages have been awarded and/or settlements agreed - notably in the United States and other common law jurisdictions - againstpharmaceutical companies based on claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. Such claims can also be accompanied by consumer fraud claims by customers or third-party payers seeking reimbursement of the cost of the product. We are currently defending a number of product liability claims (see Note D.22.a) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report) and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in defending against theseclaims or will not face additional claims in the future.Often establishing the full side effect profile of a pharmaceutical drug goes beyond data derived from preapproval clinical studies which may only involve several hundred to several thousand patients. Routine review and analysis of the continually growing body of post-marketing safety surveillance and clinical trials provide additional information - for example, potential evidence ofrare, population-specific or long-term adverse reactions or of druginteractions that were not observed in preapproval clinical studies - and may cause product labeling to evolve over time followinginteractions with regulatory authorities, including restrictions of therapeutic indications, new contraindications, warnings or precautions and occasionally even the suspension or withdrawal of a product marketing authorization. Following any of these events,pharmaceutical companies can face significant product liability claims. Furthermore, we commercialize several devices (some of which use new technologies) which, if they malfunction, could cause unexpected damage and lead to product liability claims (see \"- Breaches of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm\"). Although we continue to insure a portion of our product liability with third-party carriers, product liability coverage is increasingly difficult and costly to obtain, particularly in the United States. In the future, it is possible that self-insurance may become the sole commercially reasonable means available for managing the product liability financial risk of our pharmaceuticals and vaccines businesses(see \"Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.9. Insurance and Risk Coverage\"). In cases where we self-insure, the legal costs that we would bear for handling such claimsand potential indemnifications to be paid to claimants could have a negative impact on our financial condition. Due to insurance conditions, even when we have insurance coverage, recoveries from insurers may not be totally successful. Moreover, insolvency of an insurer could affect our ability torecover claims on policies for which we have already paid a premium. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits or the ultimate success of the Company's defense, are costly, divert management's attention, may harm our reputation and can impactthe demand for our products. Substantial product liability claims could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our products and manufacturing facilities are subject to significant government regulations and approvals, whichare often costly and could result in adverse consequencesto our business if we fail to anticipate the regulations,comply with them and/or maintain the required approvals. Obtaining marketing authorization is a long and highly regulated process requiring us to present extensive documentation and data SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 5ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION tothe regulatory authorities. Regulatory processes differ from one jurisdiction and regulatory authority to another. Either at the time of the filing of the application for a marketing authorization or later during its review, each regulatory authority may impose its own requirementswhich can evolve over time, including requiring local clinical studies, and it may delay or refuse to grant approval even though a product has already been approved in another country. Health authorities areincreasingly focusing on product safety and on the risk/benefit profile of pharmaceutical products. In particular, the FDA and the EMA have increased their requirements, particularly in terms of the volume of data needed to demonstrate a product's efficacy and safety. Even after regulatory approval, marketed products are subject to continual review, risk evaluations or comparative effectiveness studies including post-marketing studies to which at times we have committed as acondition of approval. In addition, following the implementation of European pharmacovigilance legislation in 2012, the Company and the European Regulatory Agencies (under the supervision of thePRAC (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee)) have reinforced their systematic and intensive safety signal detection systems, which may detect safety issues even with mature productsthat have been on the market for a considerable time. This system may result in negative risk/benefit assessments and additional market authorization suspensions or withdrawals. All of these requirementshave increased the costs associated with maintaining regulatoryapprovals and achieving reimbursement for our products. Post- regulatory approval reviews and data analyses can lead to the issuance of recommendations by government agencies, healthprofessional and patient or other specialized organizations regarding the use of products; for example, a recommendation to limit the patient population of a drug's indication, the imposition of marketingrestrictions, or the suspension or withdrawal of the product can result in a reduction in sales volume as well as an increased risk of litigation. Moreover, to monitor our compliance with applicable regulations, the FDA, the EMA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions routinely conduct inspections of our facilities and may identify potential deficiencies. We have received notices of deficiencies and FDA Warning Letters in the past following the inspection of some ofour facilities and may receive such letters in the future. In 2016,manufacturing deficiencies were observed by the FDA at our \"fill and finish\" facility specialized in biologics in Le Trait, France, during a routine cGMP inspection, and the FDA issued a form 483(\"Inspectional Observations\") listing manufacturing deficiencies. These cGMP deficiencies led the FDA to issue a Complete Response Letter in October 2016, delaying the approval ofsarilumab (Kevzara \u00ae) until May 2017. More generally, if we fail to adequately respond to Warning Letters identifying a deficiency following an inspection, or fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at all or within the targeted timeline, we could besubject to enforcement, remedial and/or punitive actions by theFDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities. In addition, in order to comply with our duty to report adverse events and safety signals to regulatory authorities, we must regularly train our employees and third parties (such as externalsales forces and distributor employees) on regulatory matters. If wefail to train these people, or fail to train them appropriately, or they do not comply with contractual requirements, we may be exposed to the risk that safety events are not reported or not reported in a timely manner in breach of our reporting obligations. To the extent that new regulations raise the costs of obtaining and maintaining product authorizations, or limit the economic value of a new product to its originator, the growth prospects of our industryand of Sanofi would be diminished. Approximately 50% of ourcurrent development portfolio consists of biological products that may in the future bring new therapeutic responses to current unmet medical needs, but that may also lead to more regulatory andtechnical constraints. Regulations applicable to biologics are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable toother pharmaceutical products. Biologics are also costly investments from an industrial standpoint as biological products arecomplex to produce. These constraints and costs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Claims and investigations relating to compliance, competition law, marketing practices, pricing, data privacyand other legal matters could adversely affect ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Our industry is heavily regulated. Our business covers an extremely wide range of activities worldwide and involves numerous partners. We have adopted a Code of Ethics (the \"Code\") that requires employees to comply with applicable lawsand regulations, as well as the specific principles and rules of conduct set forth in the Code. We also have policies and procedures designed to help ensure that we, our employees,officers, agents, intermediaries and other third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations (including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, the French Anti-Corruption measures law (Sapin II) and other anti-bribery laws and regulations). Notwithstanding these efforts, deviations may occur and there can be no assurance that we, our officers and/or our directors will not face liability under laws and regulations for actions taken with respect to our business. Any failure to comply directly or indirectly (including as a result of a business partner's breach) with the laws and regulations applicable to us, including new regulations, could lead to substantial liabilities and harm the Company's reputation. Governments and regulatory authorities around the world have been strengtheningimplementation and enforcement activities in recent years, including in relation to anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and data privacy legislation. Sanofi and certain of its subsidiaries are underinvestigation or could become the subject of additional investigations by various government entities and the Company is defending a number of lawsuits relating to pricing and marketingpractices (including, for example, \"whistleblower\" litigation in the United States). The Company also faces litigation and government 6 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION investigations or audits, including allegations of corruption, claims related to employment matters, patent and intellectual property disputes, consumer law claims and tax audits. See \"Item 8. Financial Information - A. Consolidated Financial Statements andOther Financial Information - Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings\" and Note D.22. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Responding tosuch investigations is costly and distracts management's attention from our business. Unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters, or in similar matters to be faced in the future, could preclude the commercialization of products, harm our reputation, negatively affect the profitability ofexisting products and subject us to substantial fines (including treble damages and fines based on our sales), punitive damages, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, potentiallyleading to the imposition of additional regulatory controls, monitoring or self-reporting obligations, or exclusion from government reimbursement programs or markets. All of this couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. These risks may encourage us to enter into settlement agreements and those settlements may involve significant monetary payments and/or criminal penalties and may include admissions ofwrongdoing. Settlement of healthcare fraud cases in the United States may require companies to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement, which is intended to regulate companybehavior for a specified period of years. Changes in the laws or regulations that apply to us could affect our business, results of operations and financialcondition. All aspects of our business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, pricing and sales, are subject to extensive legislation and governmental regulation. Changes in applicable laws, or in their application, could have a materialadverse effect on our business. For example, governmental authorities are increasingly looking to facilitate generic and biosimilar competition to existing products through new regulatory proposals intended to achieve, or resultingin, changes to the scope of patent or data exclusivity rights and use of accelerated regulatory pathways for generic and biosimilar drug approvals. Such regulatory proposals could make patent prosecution for new products more difficult and time consuming orcould adversely affect the exclusivity period for our products (see \"- We rely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our products, and ifsuch patents and other rights were limited or circumvented, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected\" above). This new competitive environment and the potential regulatory changes may further limit the exclusivity enjoyed by innovativeproducts on the market and directly impact pricing, access andreimbursement levels, which may adversely affect our business and future results. See \"Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.6. Markets - B.6.2. Competition\" and \"-B.6.3. Regulatory framework\". In addition to international tax law and regulatory changes such as the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiatives and EU directives to be adopted, changes in tax frameworks, tax reformsand other changes to the way existing tax laws are applied injurisdictions and major countries where Sanofi and its subsidiariesand affiliates operate could affect our income, our effective tax rate, and consequently our future net income. This particularly applies to the recently enacted US tax reform for which IRS comments,guidelines and regulations are still to come. These changes may cover matters such as taxation of our operations, intercompany transactions, internal restructuring and more generally taxableincome, tax rates, indirect taxation, transfer pricing, R&D tax credits, taxation of intellectual property, dividend taxation, controlled companies or a restriction in certain forms of tax relief.Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and future results. Additionally, due to the complexity ofthe fiscal environment, the ultimate resolution of any tax mattersmay result in payments greater or lesser than amounts accrued. For information regarding risks related to changes in environmental rules and regulations, see \"- Environmental liabilities and costs related to compliance with applicable regulations may have asignificant adverse effect on our results of operations\" below. Risks Relating to Our Business Our research and development efforts may not succeed in adequately renewing our product portfolio. Discovering and developing a new product is a costly, lengthy and uncertain process. To be successful in the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry, we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development in order to develop newproducts to compensate for decreasing sales of products facing patent expiry and regulatory data exclusivity, or competition from new products of competitors that are perceived as being superioror equivalent. We must pursue both early stage research and early and late development stages in order to propose a sustainable andwell-balanced portfolio of products. In 2017, we spent \u20ac5,472 million on research and development, amounting to 15.6%of our net sales. Our industry is driven by the need for constant innovation, but we may spread ourselves across too many areas of inquiry to be successful and may not be able to improve internal research productivity sufficiently to sustain our pipeline. We may also fail to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas, and product classes, or fail to build a robust pipeline and fulfill unmetmedical needs in a timely manner. Fields of discovery, particularly SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 7ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION biotechnology, are highly competitive and characterized by significant and rapid technological changes. Numerous companies are working on the same targets and a product considered as promising at the very beginning of its development may becomeless attractive if a competitor addressing the same unmet need reaches the market earlier. The research and development process can take generally up to 15 years from discovery to commercial product launch. This process is conducted in various stages in order to test, along with other features, the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of a product.There can be no assurance that any of these product candidates will be proven safe or effective. See \"Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.5. Global Research & Development\". Accordingly, there is a substantial risk at each stageof development - including clinical studies - that we will not achieve our goals of safety and/or efficacy and that we will have to abandon a product in which we have invested substantial amountsof money and human resources, even in late stage development (Phase III). More and more trials are designed with clinical endpoints of superiority; failure to achieve those endpoints coulddamage the product's reputation and our overall program.Decisions concerning the studies to be carried out can have a significant impact on the marketing strategy for a given product. Multiple in-depth studies can demonstrate that a product hasadditional benefits, facilitating the product's marketing, but such studies are expensive and time consuming and may delay the product's submission to health authorities for approval. Ourongoing investments in new product launches and research and development for future products could therefore result in increased costs without a proportionate increase in revenues, which would negatively affect our operating results and profitability. In 2015 we announced that we had up to 18 new medicines and vaccines on track to arrive on the market between 2014-2020, including six key launches. As of the end of 2017, all of those six products have already been approved However, there can be no assurance that all of the products approved will achieve commercial success. Following (or in some cases contemporaneously with) review of a product for a marketing authorization, the medical need served by the product and the corresponding reimbursement are evaluated by governmental agencies and/or third-party payers, requiring in some cases additional studies, including comparative studies, which may effectively delay marketing, change the population which the new product treats, and add to its development costs. After marketing approval of our products, other companies or investigators, whether independently or with our authorization, may conduct studies or analysis beyond our control that may ultimately report results negatively affecting our sales either permanently or temporarily, it may take time for us to address the reportedfindings, leading among other things to a material adverse impact on sales.The pricing and reimbursement of our products is increasingly affected by decisions of governments andother third parties and cost reduction initiatives. The commercial success of our existing products and our product candidates depends in part on their pricing and the conditions under which our products are reimbursed. Our products continue to be subject to increasing price and reimbursement pressure due,inter alia, to: price controls imposed by governments in many countries; increased public attention to the price of drugs and particularlyprice increases, limiting our ability to set the price, or to manage or increase the price of our products based upon their value; removal of a number of drugs from government reimbursementschemes (for example products determined to be less cost- effective than alternatives); partial reimbursement of patient populations within a labelledindication; increased difficulty in obtaining and maintaining satisfactory drugreimbursement rates; increase in cost containment policies (including budgetlimitations) related to health expenses; governmental and private health care provider policies that favorprescription of generic medicines or substitution of branded products with generic medicines; more demanding evaluation criteria applied by HealthTechnology Assessment (HTA) agencies when considering whether to cover new drugs at a certain price level; more governments using international reference pricing to set or manage the price of drugs based on an external benchmark of a product's price in other countries; aggressive pricing strategies by some of our competitors; and entry of new consumer healthcare competitors offering online sales. In addition to the pricing pressures they exert, governmental andprivate third-party payers and purchasers of pharmaceutical products may reduce volumes of sales by restricting access toformularies (including exclusive formularies), managing prescribingvia various conditions (including prior authorisations and step edits) or otherwise discouraging physicians from prescribing our products (see also \"- The concentration of the US payer market exposes usto greater pricing pressure\" below). In the United States, the federal Affordable Care Act has increased the government's role with respect to price, reimbursement, and coverage levels for healthcare services and products within the large government healthcare sector. This law also imposed rebates and fees on pharmaceutical companies. Some US states are also 8 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION considering legislation that could affect transparency practices, the marketing and prices of drugs, and access to drugs. US federal and state officials, including the new administration, are continuing to focus on the cost of health coverage and health care althoughfuture policy, including the nature and timing of any changes (including to the Affordable Care Act), remains unclear, creating multiple risks for the sector. Legislation was introduced in over 26states in 2017 which will require price transparency and reporting of certain manufacturer information. This trend will continue into 2018 where we anticipate legislation to be filed in at least 20 states and more laws to be enacted around the United States. Government price reporting obligations are complex, and we face risks related to the reporting of pricing data that could affect the reimbursement of and discount provided for our products to US government healthcare programs. We encounter similar cost containment issues in countries outside the United States. In certain countries, including countries in the European Union, China and Canada, the coverage of prescriptiondrugs, and pricing and levels of reimbursement, are subject to governmental control. For example, in Europe various authorities are developing the use of tenders for expensive products and areconsidering joint procurement mechanisms to negotiate lower prices. See also below \"- Global economic conditions and an unfavorable financial environment could have negativeconsequences for our business\". We are also unable to predict the availability or level of reimbursement and related restrictions for our product candidates. Price negotiations in a country may result in a price that is incompatible with the global price positioning of our products, which may lead us not to launch the product in that country, damaging our image and resulting in a decrease in initiallyanticipated sales. Finally, our operating results may also be affected by parallel imports, particularly within the European Union, whereby distributors engage in arbitrage based on national price differencesto buy products in low cost markets for resale in higher cost markets. The concentration of the US market exposes us to greater pricing pressure. In the United States, price is increasingly important to managed care organizations (MCOs) and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and as the MCOs/PBMs grow in size following market consolidation, pharmaceutical companies have faced increasedpressure in pricing and usage negotiations, and competition among pharmaceutical companies to have their products included in the care providers' formularies is robust. This can lead to pricediscounts or rebates in connection with the placement of products.Exclusion of one of our drugs from a formulary can significantly reduce sales in the MCO/PBM patient population. For example, since 2014, we have increased the level of rebates negotiated forLantus \u00aein order to maintain favorable formulary positions with key payers in the US. Despite these efforts, in 2016, CVS and UnitedHealthcare (a PBM and MCO, respectively) decided that effective January 1, 2017 and April 1, 2017, respectively, Lantus\u00ae/ Toujeo\u00aewould be excluded from commercial and MMC (Medicaid Managed Care) template formularies covering millions of people, thereby increasing the costs of Lantus\u00ae/Toujeo\u00aeto patients covered by the affected PBM/MCO (absent a co-pay assistance orother applicable program), and thus in turn reducing the patient population likely to purchase Lantus \u00ae/Toujeo\u00ae. Also, some payers in the United States have put in place significantrestrictions on the usage of Praluent\u00ae, which has resulted in significant out-of-pocket expenditures for Medicare patients. In addition, distributors have increased their capacity to negotiate price and other terms as a consequence of the growing number of mergers of retail chains and distributors, resulting in consolidationof the distribution channel. Due to these pressures on our prices, our revenues and margins are, and could continue to be, negatively affected. We may lose market share to competing therapeutic options, biosimilar or generic products. We are faced with intense competition from generic products, biosimilars and brand-name drugs including from retail chains and distributors. Doctors or patients may choose competitors' products over ours or alternative therapeutic options such as surgery if they perceive them to be safer, more reliable, more effective, easier to administer or less expensive, which could cause our revenues to decline and adversely affect our results of operations. The success of any product also depends on our ability to educate patients when permissible and promote our products to healthcare providers by providing them with innovative data about the product and its uses including through the use of digital tools. If theseeducation efforts are not effective, we may not be able to increase the sales of our products or realize the full value of our investment in their development. We may not be able to anticipate precisely the date of market entry of generics or biosimilars or the potential impact on our sales, both of which depend on numerous parameters. The introduction of a generic version of a branded medicine typically results in a significant and rapid reduction in net sales for the branded productbecause generic manufacturers typically offer their unbrandedversions at significantly lower prices, resulting in adverse price and volume effects for our genericized products. Also mandatory price regulations apply in certain countries to off-patent products andclasses of products, and generics prices are taken into account for international reference pricing and tenders. Substitution is often permitted for generic products that are considered to be interchangeable or clinically identical. With respect to biosimilars, in SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 9ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION the United States only biosimilars that refer to an innovator drug that was approved under a Biologics License Application may be designated as interchangeable with the original biologic, and only in circumstances where specific criteria are met. In many Europeancountries, automatic substitution of biologics is officially prohibited or not recommended. Nevertheless competition, including from non-substitutable biosimilars, would likely result in a decrease inprices, additional rebates, increased promotion efforts and lower margins. Approval of a generic or biosimilar that is substitutable for one of our products would increase the risk of accelerated market penetration by that generic or biosimilar to a greater extent thanwould be the case for a non-substitutable product. These trends are exacerbated by applicable legislation which encourages the use of generic products to reduce spending on prescription drugs in many countries such as the United States, France and Germany. Therefore, the market for our products could also be affected if a competitor's innovative drug in the same market were to become available as a generic because a certainnumber of patients can be expected to switch to a lower-cost alternative therapy. We expect this generic competition to continue and to affect more of our products, including those with relativelymodest sales. The manufacture of our products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or inventorylosses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, delay the launch of new products and negativelyimpact our image. Many of our products are manufactured using technically complex processes requiring specialized facilities, highly specific raw materials and other production constraints. Third parties supply us with a portion of our raw materials, active ingredients and medicaldevices, which exposes us to the risk of a supply shortage or interruption in the event that these suppliers are unable to manufacture our products to Sanofi quality standards or if theyexperience financial difficulties. Further, some raw materials essential to the manufacture of our products are not widely available from sources we consider reliable; for example, we haveapproved only a limited number of suppliers of heparins for use inthe manufacture of Lovenox \u00ae. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. See \"Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.8. Production and Raw Materials\" for a description of theseoutsourcing arrangements. Our products are also increasingly reliant on the use of product- specific devices for administration which may result in technical issues. For example, Praluent\u00aeis administered with an auto- injector manufactured by a third-party. The success of this product will depend partially on the performance of this device.We must also be able to produce sufficient quantities of ourproducts to satisfy demand. We may have difficulties transforming and adapting our existing plants to manufacture new products, including biologics, and scaling up production of our products currently under development once they are approved. Our biological products, in particular, are subject to the risk ofmanufacturing stoppages or the risk of loss of inventory because of the difficulties inherent in the processing of biological materials and the potential difficulties in accessing adequate amounts of rawmaterials meeting required standards. These difficulties may alsobe encountered during testing, which is a mandatory requirement for the products to be released. Effective insurance coverage for biological products may also be difficult to obtain in the event ofcontaminated batches as the cause of the contamination can be difficult to ascertain (for the impact on our financial statements see \"- Impairment charges or write downs in our books and changes inaccounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial results.\" below) Additionally, specific conditions must be respected both by Sanofi and our customers for the storage and distribution of many of our biological products. For example, cold storage for certain vaccines and insulin-based products is required. Failure to adhere to these requirements may result in lost product inventory or products becoming out of specification, which in turn may result in efficacy orsafety issues for patients. The complexity of these processes, as well as strict internal and health authority standards for the manufacture of our products, subject us to risks because the investigation and remediation ofany identified or suspected problems can cause production delays,substantial expense, product recalls or lost sales and inventories,and delay the launch of new products; this could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, and cause reputational damage and the risk of product liability (see \"- Productliability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition above\"). When manufacturing disruptions occur, we may not have alternate manufacturing capacity, particularly for certain biologics. In the event of manufacturing disruptions, our ability to use backupfacilities or set up new facilities is more limited because biologicsare more complex to manufacture. Even though we aim to havebackup sources of supply whenever possible, including by manufacturing backup supplies of our principal active ingredients atadditional facilities when practicable, we cannot be certain they will be sufficient if our principal sources become unavailable. Switching sources and manufacturing facilities requires significant time. Supply shortages generate even greater negative reactions when they occur with respect to life saving medicines with limited or no viable therapeutic alternatives. Shortages of products can have anegative impact on the confidence of patients, customers andprofessional healthcare providers and the image of Sanofi and maylead to lower product revenues. Government authorities and regulators in the United States, in the European Union and other 10 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION agencies worldwide are also considering measures to reduce these risks, such as through Supply Risk Management Plans for some products with high medical need, e.g. the French decree of July 2016 concerning the preparation of shortage management plans(\"plans de gestion des p\u00e9nuries\"). It cannot be ruled out that these ongoing initiatives may generate additional costs for Sanofi if they result in a requirement to establish backup supply channels or toincrease inventory levels to avoid shortages. We are sometimes required to use animals to test our products in the development phase and to test our vaccines before distributing them. Animal testing activities have been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Testing on animals can be vital for the development or commercialization of a product. If applicableregulations were to ban this practice or if, due to pressure from animal welfare groups, we were no longer able to source animals to perform such tests, it would be difficult and in some casesimpossible to develop or distribute our products in certain jurisdictions under the applicable marketing authorizations. We rely on third parties for the discovery, manufacture and marketing of some of our products. Our industry is both highly collaborative and competitive, whether in the discovery and development of new products, in-licensing, the marketing and distribution of approved products, or manufacturing activities. We expect that we will continue to rely on third parties forkey aspects of our business and we need to ensure our attractiveness as a potential partner. We conduct a number of significant research and development programs and market some of our products in collaboration with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. For example, we currently have a global strategic collaboration with Regeneron on monoclonal antibodies. With Alnylam, we have an agreement todevelop and commercialize treatments for rare genetic diseases (See \"Item 4. Information on the Company - B. BusinessOverview\"). In addition we may also rely on partners to design and manufacture medical devices, notably for the administration of our products. If disruptions or quality concerns were to arise in the third-party supply of raw materials, active ingredients or medical devices or if our partners were unable to manufacture a product, this could also adversely affect our ability to sell our products in the quantities demanded by the market and could damage our reputation andrelationships with our customers. See also \"- The manufacture ofour products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or inventory losses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversely affect our operating results andfinancial condition, delay the launch of new products and negatively impact our image\" above. When we research and market our products through collaboration arrangements, we are also subject to the risk that we may notadequately manage our alliance. For instance, we may not properly manage the decision making process with our partners. Decisions may also be under the control of or subject to the approval of ourcollaboration partners, who may have views that differ from ours.We are also subject to the risk that our partners may not perform effectively, which could have a detrimental effect when the performance of certain key tasks or functions is the responsibility ofour collaboration partners. Failures in the development process or differing priorities may adversely affect the activities conducted through the collaboration arrangements. Any conflicts or difficulties that we may have with our partners during the course of these agreements or at the time of their renewal or renegotiation, or any disruption in the relationships withour partners, may affect the development, the launch and/or themarketing of certain of our products or product candidates and may cause a decline in our revenues or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations. A substantial share of the revenue and income of Sanofi continues to depend on the performance of certainflagship products. We generate a substantial share of our revenues from the sale of certain key products (see \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - Results of Operations - Year ended December 31, 2017 compared with year ended December 31,2016 - Net Sales - Pharmaceuticals segment\"). Lantus \u00aeis particularly important; it was Sanofi's leading product revenues of\u20ac4,622 million in 2017, representing 13.2% of Sanofi's net sales for the year. Lantus\u00ae is a flagship product of the Diabetes franchise. Accounting for market trends, we announced in November 2017 that we now project a cumulative annual negative growth rate of 6% to 8% for our global Diabetes franchise for theperiod from 2015 to 2018. Nevertheless our actual sales may differ from these expectations given the numerous underlying assumptions (for example the outlook for insulin glargine sales, theintroduction of one or several generic glargines and their penetration of the market, or the market uptake of our newproducts). The launch of new medicines and vaccines in other therapeutic areas and the performance of our other businesses may not be sufficient to reduce the relative contribution of our Diabetesfranchise to our overall performance. As regards products recentlylaunched or under development in our R&D portfolio for which we have an alliance arrangement with a partner, the terms of thealliance agreements may require us to share profits and lossesarising from commercialization of such products with our partners. This differs from the treatment of revenue and costs generated by other products for which we have no alliance agreement, and suchprofit sharing may deliver a lower contribution to our financialresults. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 11ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION Our flagship products benefit from certain intellectual property protections such as patents and exclusivity periods but patent and proprietary rights, even if they are not challenged, are subject to expiration dates. Expiration of effective intellectual propertyprotections for our products typically results in the entry of one or more lower-priced generic competitors, often leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues on those products (for information onthe expected impact of biosimilar entry on the market see \"- We may lose market share to competing therapeutic options, biosimilar or generic products\" above). Furthermore, in general, if one or more of our flagship productswere to encounter problems such as material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, recall, regulatory proceedings, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure fromexisting competitive products, or changes in labeling, or if a new, more effective treatment were introduced, or if there were a reduction in sales or a decline in sales growth of one or more of ourflagship products, the adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be significant. We are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers(1). We run the risk of delayed payments or even non-payment by our customers, which consist principally of wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. This risk is accentuated by recent concentrations among distributors, as wellas by uncertainties around global credit and economic conditions, in particular in emerging markets. The United States poses particular customer credit risk issues because of theconcentrated distribution system: our three main customers represented respectively 9%, 5% and 4% of our consolidated net sales in 2017. We are also exposed to large wholesalers in othermarkets, particularly in Europe. An inability of one or more of thesewholesalers to honor their debts to us would adversely affect our financial condition (see Note D.34. to our consolidated financialstatements included at Item 18 of this annual report). In some countries, some customers are public or subsidized health systems. The economic and credit conditions in these countries may lead to an increase in the average length of time needed to collect on accounts receivable or the ability to collect 100% of receivables outstanding. Because of this context, we may need to reassess the recoverable amount of our debts in these countriesduring future financial years (see also \"Item 5. Operating andFinancial Review and Prospects - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity.\").Global economic conditions and an unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for ourbusiness (2). Over the past several years, growth of the global pharmaceutical market has become increasingly tied to global economic growth. In this context, a substantial and lasting slowdown of the global economy, major national economies or emerging markets couldnegatively affect growth in the global pharmaceutical market and, as a result, adversely affect our business. Unfavorable economic conditions have reduced the sources of funding for national social security systems, leading to austerity measures including heightened pressure on drug prices, increasedsubstitution of generic drugs, and the exclusion of certain productsfrom formularies. Further, our net sales may be negatively impacted by the continuing challenging global economic environment, as high unemployment, increases in cost-sharing, and lack of developed third-party payer systems in certain regions may lead some patients to switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use othertreatments to reduce their costs. In the United States there is aconsistent increase in the number of patients in the Medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many US states, to formulary restrictionslimiting access to brand-name drugs, including ours. Also, as a result of the insurance coverage mandate that came into effect in the United States in 2015, some employers may seek to reducecosts by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Our Consumer Healthcare business could also be adversely impacted by difficult economic conditions that limit the financial resources of our customers. If economic conditions worsen, or in the event of default or failure of major players including wholesalers or public sector buyers financed by insolvent states, the financial situation of the Company,its results of operations and the distribution channels of its productsmay be adversely affected. See also \"We are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers\" above. Economic and financial difficulties may have an adverse impact on third parties who are important to our business, including collaboration partners and suppliers, which could cause such third parties to delay or disrupt performance of their obligations to us and could materially adversely affect our business or results ofoperations. See \"- We rely on third parties for the discovery,manufacture and marketing of some of our products\" above. For more information see \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity.\" (1) Information in this section is supplementary to Notes B.8.8.

KEY INFORMATION Counterfeit versions of our products harm our business. Counterfeiting activities and the presence of counterfeit products in a number of markets and over the Internet continue to be a challenge for maintaining a safe drug supply. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can be life-threatening. Todistributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs along with increased levels ofcounterfeiting could be mistakenly attributed to the authentic product, affect patient confidence in the authentic product, and harm the business of companies such as Sanofi. If one of ourproducts were to be the subject of counterfeits, we could incursubstantial reputational and financial harm. See \"Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview -B.6. Markets - B.6.2. Competition.\" Breaches of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could result infinancial, legal, business or reputational harm. Our business depends heavily on the use of information technologies. Certain key areas such as research and development, production and sales are to a large extent dependent on our information systems (including cloud-based computing) orthose of third-party providers (including for the storage and transfer of critical, confidential, sensitive or personal information regarding our patients, clinical trials, vendors, customers, employees,collaborators and others). We and our third-party service providers use secure information technology systems for the protection of data and threat detection. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts or those of our third-party service providers to implement adequate security and control measures would be sufficient to protect against breakdowns, service disruption, data deterioration or loss in the event of a system malfunction, orprevent data from being stolen or corrupted in the event of a cyber- attack, security breach, industrial espionage attacks or insider threat attacks which could result in financial, legal, business orreputational harm. We commercialize a number of devices using new information technologies which, if they malfunction or are compromised, could lead to a risk of harm to patients (see \"- Product liability claimscould adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\" above), including the unavailability of our products. The expansion of social media platforms and new technologies present risks and challenges for ourbusiness and reputation. We increasingly rely on social media and new technologies to communicate about our products and diseases or to provide health services. The use of these media requires specific attention, monitoring programs and moderation of comments. For example,patients may use these channels to comment on the effectivenessof a product and to report an alleged adverse event. When suchquestions arise, the nature of evidence-based health care and restrictions on what pharmaceutical manufacturers may say about their products are not always well suited to rapidly defending Sanofi or the public's legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media and rapid news cycles, and this may result in commercial harm, overly restrictiveregulatory actions and erratic share price performance. In addition, unauthorized communications, such as press releases or posts on social media, purported to be issued by Sanofi, may containinformation that is false or otherwise damaging and could have an adverse impact on our stock price. Negative or inaccurate posts or comments about Sanofi, our business, directors or officers on anysocial networking website could seriously damage our reputation.In addition, our employees and partners may use social media and mobile technologies inappropriately, which may give rise to liability for Sanofi, or which could lead to breaches of data security, loss oftrade secrets or other intellectual property or public disclosure of sensitive information, including information about our employees, clinical trials or customers or other information. Such uses of social media and mobile technologies could have a material adverseeffect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Impairment charges or write-downs in our books and changes in accounting standards could have a significantadverse effect on Sanofi's results of operations andfinancial results. Substantial value is allocated to intangible assets and goodwill resulting from business combinations, as disclosed at Note D.4. to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report at Item 18, which could be substantially written down invalue upon indications of impairment (primarily relating to pharmacovigilance, discontinued research and development projects, patent litigation and the launch of competing products),with adverse effects on our financial condition and the value ofour assets. If any of our strategic equity investments decline in value and remain below cost for an extended period, we may be required to write down our investment. We own a significant stake in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (22.2% of its share capital as of December 31, 2017), which is listed on NASDAQ and has been accounted for using the equity method since 2014. Any materialdeterioration in Regeneron's share price or financial performance would be an indicator that the value of our investment might have become impaired. This would require us to perform an impairmenttest, which could have a negative impact on our financial statements. In addition, the inherent variability of biologics manufacturing increases the risk of write-offs of these products. Due to the value of the materials used, the carrying amount of biological products is much higher than that of small-molecule products. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 13ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION The financial environment and in particular the economic difficulties affecting Russia, Venezuela and the Middle East could also negatively affect the value of our assets (see \"- Global economic conditions and an unfavorable financial environment could havenegative consequences for our business\" above and \"- Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\" below). Any new or revised accounting standards, rules and interpretationsissued by the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board)could also result in changes to the recognition of income and expense that may materially and adversely affect Sanofi's financial results. Our pension liabilities are affected by factors such as the performance of plan assets, interest rates, actuarial data and experience and changes in laws and regulations. Our future funding obligations for our main defined-benefit pension plans depend on changes in the future performance of assets held in trust for these plans, the interest rates used to determine funding levels (or company liabilities), actuarial data and experience, inflationtrends, the level of benefits provided for by the plans, as well as changes in laws and regulations. Adverse changes in those factors could increase our unfunded obligations under such plans, whichwould require more funds to be contributed and hence negativelyaffect our cash flow and results (see Note D.19.1. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). Risks Relating to Sanofi's Structure and Strategy Our strategic objectives for long-term growth may not be fully realized. In November 2015, we outlined our strategic roadmap for the period 2015-2020. Our long term strategy rests on four pillars: reshape our portfolio, deliver outstanding launches, sustain innovation in R&D and simplify our organization. We may not be able to fully realize our strategic objectives and,even if we are able to do so, these strategic objectives may not deliver the expected benefits or within the expected timeline. We are looking to reshape our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures and may not reach this objective if we are unable to identify opportunities, or enter into agreements in a timely manner or on sufficiently attractive terms. In addition, we may fail to (i) adopt the best strategy for our acquisitions/ divestitures or (ii) compete successfully in an intensively competitive, increasingly focused market environment (see \"- We may fail to successfullyidentify external business opportunities or realize the anticipated benefits from our strategic investments\" below and \"Our research and development efforts may not succeed in adequately renewingour product portfolio\" above). We may also not have the necessaryflexibility to appropriately reallocate resources toward our priority businesses.The successful launch of a new pharmaceutical product involves substantial investment in sales and marketing activities. In 2015 we announced that we have up to 18 new medicines and vaccines on track to arrive on the market between 2014-2020 including six key launches. As of the end of 2017, all of those six products havealready there can be no assurance that all of our new products will achieve commercial success. We may also encounter failures or delays in our launch strategy. For example, Dengvaxia\u00ae sales suffer from political changes and economic volatility in Latin America and also from the recommendation to update the label at the end of 2017 following new clinical studies. In the Philippines, this resulted in the suspension of the dengue vaccination campaign inDecember 2017, and the temporary suspension of the Dengvaxia \u00ae license in early 2018, following a decision of the regulatory authority.In addition, the level of Praluent \u00aesales reflects the implementation of utilization management restrictions by payers in the United States and limited market access in Europe which have hampered our launch strategy. The launch strategy we develop (in terms of timing,pricing, market access, marketing efforts and dedicated sales forces) may not deliver the benefits that we expect. The competitive environment for a given product may also have changed by the timeof the actual launch, modifying our initial expectations. The need toprioritize the allocation of resources may also cause delays in the expected launch of some of our products. Sustaining innovation in R&D is inherently risky due to the high rate of failure and we may not be able to allocate our resources to obtain optimal results (see also \"- Our research and development efforts may not succeed in adequately renewing our productportfolio\" above). Our ongoing simplification of our global organization through the implementation, starting from January 2016, of five global business units (GBUs) to meet significant growth objectives requires substantial attention from our management. There is no guarantee that this new organization will enable Sanofi to concentrate itsefforts around the businesses most likely to deliver growth, or that these GBUs will grow in line with anticipated growth rates or deliver the expected benefits. Failure to support and grow our marketed products, successfully execute the launches of newly approved products, advance our late-stage pipeline or manage the change of our organization would have an adverse impact on our business, prospects and results of operations. We may fail to successfully identify external business opportunities or realize the anticipated benefits from ourstrategic investments. We pursue a strategy of selective acquisitions, in-licensing and collaborations in order to reinforce our pipeline and portfolio. The implementation of this strategy depends on our ability to identify 14 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION business development opportunities and execute them at reasonable cost and on acceptable financing terms. Moreover, entering into in-licensing or collaboration agreements generally requires the payment of significant \"milestones\" well before therelevant products reach the market, without any assurance that such investments will ultimately become profitable in the long term (see Note D.21.1. to the consolidated financial statements includedat Item 18 of this annual report and also \"- We rely on third parties for the discovery, manufacture and marketing of some of our products\" above). For newly acquired activities or businesses our growth objectives could be delayed or ultimately not realized, and expected synergies could be adversely impacted if: we are unable to quickly or efficiently integrate those activities or businesses; integration takes longer than expected; key employees leave; or we have higher than anticipated integration costs. In January 2017, we completed the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim's consumer healthcare (CHC) business in exchange for our Animal Health business (Merial), but the expected benefits of the transaction may never be fully realized or may take longer torealize than expected. In January 2018, we announced our intent to acquire Bioverativ and Ablynx. Completion of the transactions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These include (but not limitatively): (i) our ability to complete the transactions on the terms proposed or within the expected time-frame; (ii) our ability to obtain the required regulatory clearances; and (iii) the possibility that competing offersmay be made. We may miscalculate the risks associated with business development transactions at the time they are made or not have the resources or ability to access all the relevant information to evaluate them properly, including with regard to the potential of research and development pipelines, manufacturing issues,compliance issues, or the outcome of ongoing legal and other proceedings. It may also take a considerable amount of time and be difficult to implement a risk analysis and risk mitigation planafter the acquisition of an activity or business is completed due to lack of historical data. As a result, risk management and coverage of such risks, particularly through insurance policies, may prove tobe insufficient or ill-adapted. Because of the active competition among pharmaceutical groups for such business development opportunities, there can be no assurance of our success in completing these transactions when such opportunities are identified.The globalization of our business exposes us to increased risks in specific areas. We continue to focus on emerging markets. However, difficulties in operating in emerging markets, a significant decline in the anticipated growth rate in these regions or an unfavorable movement of the exchange rates of these countries' currenciesagainst the euro could impair our ability to take advantage of these growth opportunities and could affect our business, results of operations or financial condition (see also \"- Global economicconditions and an unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for our business\" above). The expansion of our activities in emerging markets also exposes us to more volatile economic conditions, political instability, competition from multinational or locally based companies that are already well established in these markets, the inability to adequately respond to the unique characteristics of emergingmarkets (particularly with respect to their underdeveloped judicial systems and regulatory frameworks), difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel or maintaining the necessary internal controlsystems, potential exchange controls, weaker intellectual property protection, higher crime levels (particularly with respect to counterfeit products (see \"- Counterfeit versions of our productsharm our business\" above)), and compliance issues includingcorruption and fraud (see \"- Claims and investigations relating to compliance, competition law, marketing practices, pricing and other legal matters could adversely affect our business, results ofoperations and financial condition\" above). We may also face compliance and internal control systems issues in mature markets due to increased competition and more complex and stringentregulations. As a global healthcare leader, we are exposed to a number of risks inherent in sectors in which we were previously less active such as consumer healthcare. The business models and trade channels inconsumer healthcare, in particular regarding promotional effortsand trade terms for example, are different from those in our traditional pharmaceuticals business. Our success depends in part on our senior management team and other key employees and our ability to attract,integrate and retain key personnel and qualifiedindividuals in the face of intense competition. We depend on the expertise of our senior management team and other key employees. In addition, we rely heavily on recruiting and retaining talented people to help us meet our strategic objectives. We face intense competition for qualified individuals for seniormanagement positions, or in specific geographic regions or inspecialized fields such as clinical development, biosciences and devices. In addition, our ability to hire qualified personnel also depends in part on our ability to reward performance, incentivizeour employees and to pay competitive compensation. Laws and regulations on executive compensation may restrict our ability toattract, motivate and retain the required level of talented people. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 15ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION The inability to attract, integrate and/or retain highly skilled personnel, in particular those in leadership positions, may weaken our succession plans, may materially adversely affect the implementation of our strategy and our ability to meet our strategicobjectives and could ultimately adversely impact our business or results of operations. Environmental Risks of Our Industrial Activities Risks from the handling of hazardous materials could adversely affect our results of operations. Manufacturing activities, such as the chemical manufacturing of the active ingredients in our products and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and waste, expose us to various risks, including: fires and/or explosions; storage tank leaks and ruptures; or discharges or releases of toxic or pathogen substances. These operating risks can cause personal injury, property damage and environmental contamination, and may result in the shutdown of affected facilities and/or the imposition of civil, administrative,criminal penalties and/or civil damages. The occurrence of any of these events may significantly reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and adversely affect our operating results and reputation. Although we maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance that we believe is in accordance with customary industry practices, this insurance may not be adequate to fully cover all potential hazards incidental to our business. Environmental liabilities and costs related to compliance with applicable regulations may have a significant adverseeffect on our results of operations. The environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual and potential obligations on our Company to remediate contaminated sites. These obligations may relate to sites: that we currently own or operate; that we formerly owned or operated; or where waste from our operations was disposed. These environmental remediation obligations could significantly reduce our operating results. Sanofi accrues provisions for remediation when our management believes the need is probableand that it is reasonably possible to estimate the cost. See \"Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview -B.10. Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)\" for additional information regarding our environmental policies. In particular, our provisions for these obligations may be insufficient if theassumptions underlying these provisions prove incorrect or if weare held responsible for additional, currently undiscovered contamination. These judgments and estimates may later prove inaccurate, and any shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are or may become involved in claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. Some current and former Sanofi subsidiaries have been named as \"potentially responsible parties\" or the equivalent under the US Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation andLiability Act of 1980, as amended (also known as \"Superfund\"), and similar statutes in France, Germany, Italy, Brazil and elsewhere. Asa matter of statutory or contractual obligation, we and/or our subsidiaries may retain responsibility for environmental liabilities at some of the sites of our predecessor companies, or of subsidiariesthat we demerged, divested or may divest. We have disputes outstanding regarding certain sites no longer owned by the Company. An adverse outcome in such disputes might have asignificant adverse effect on our operating results. See Note D.22.d) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report and \"Item 8. Financial Information - A.Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information- Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings\". Environmental regulations are evolving .For example, in Europe, new or evolving regulatory regimes include REACH, CLP/GHS, SEVESO, IPPC/IED, the Waste Framework Directive, the Emission Trading Scheme Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Directive on Taxation of Energy Products and Electricity and several other regulations aimed at preventing global warming. Stricter environmental, safety and health laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to our Company and could subject our handling, manufacture, use, reuseor disposal of substances or pollutants, site restoration and compliance to more rigorous scrutiny than is currently the case. Consequently, compliance with these laws could result insignificant capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities, thereby adversely affecting our business, results of operations or financial condition. For more detailed information on environmentalissues, see \"Item 4. Information on the Company - B. Business Overview - B.10. Health, Safety and Environment (HSE).\" Natural disasters prevalent in certain regions in which we do business could affect our operations. Some of our production sites are located in areas exposed to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. In the event of a major disaster we could experience severe destruction or interruption of our operations and productioncapacity. As a result, our operations and our employees could suffer serious harm which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 16 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION Risks Related to Financial Markets(1) Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Because we sell our products in numerous countries, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are particularly sensitive to movements in exchange rates between the euro andthe US dollar, the Japanese yen, and to currencies in emergingmarkets. In 2017, 33.8% of our net sales were realized in the United States; 29.3% in Emerging Markets (see the definition in \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects -A/ Operating results\"), including countries that are, or may in future become, subject to exchange controls or hyper-inflation; and 5.1%in Japan. While we incur expenses in those currencies, the impact of currency exchange rates on these expenses does not fully offset the impact of currency exchange rates on our revenues. As a result, currency exchange rate movements can have aconsiderable impact on our earnings. When deemed appropriate and when technically feasible, we enter into transactions to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange risks. These efforts, whenundertaken, may fail to offset the effect of adverse currencyexchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations or financial condition. For more information concerning our exchange rate exposure, see \"Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosuresabout Market Risk.\" Risks Relating to an Investment in Our Shares or ADSs Foreign exchange fluctuations may adversely affect the US dollar value of our ADSs and dividends (if any). Holders of ADSs face exchange rate risk. Our ADSs trade in US dollars and our shares trade in euros. The value of the ADSs and our shares could fluctuate as the exchange rates between these currencies fluctuate. If and when we pay dividends, theywould be denominated in euros. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar will affect the US dollar amounts received by owners of ADSs upon conversion by thedepositary of cash dividends, if any. Moreover, these fluctuations may affect the US dollar price of the ADSs on the New York StockExchange (NYSE) whether or not we pay dividends, in addition to any amounts that a holder would receive upon our liquidation or inthe event of a sale of assets, merger, tender offer or similar transaction denominated in euros or any foreign currency other than US dollars. Persons holding ADSs rather than shares may have difficulty exercising certain rights as a shareholder. Holders of ADSs may have more difficulty exercising their rights as a shareholder than if they directly held shares. For example, if weissue new shares and existing shareholders have the right to subscribe for a portion of them, the depositary is allowed, at its own discretion, to sell for their benefit that right to subscribe for new shares instead of making that right available to ADS holders. Also,holders of ADSs must instruct the depositary how to vote their shares. Because of this extra procedural step involving the depositary, the process for exercising voting rights will take longerfor holders of ADSs than for holders of shares. ADSs for which the depositary does not receive timely voting instructions will not be voted at any meeting. Our largest shareholder owns a significant percentage of the share capital and voting rights of Sanofi. As of December 31, 2017, L'Or\u00e9al held approximately 9.43% of our issued share capital, accounting for approximately 16.88% of the voting rights (excluding treasury shares) of Sanofi. See \"Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions - A. MajorShareholders.\" Affiliates of L'Or\u00e9al currently serve on our Board of Directors. To the extent L'Or\u00e9al continues to hold a large percentage of our share capital and voting rights, it will remain in aposition to exert greater influence in the appointment of thedirectors and officers of Sanofi and in other corporate actions that require shareholders' approval. Sales of our shares may cause the market price of our shares or ADSs to decline. Sales of large numbers of our shares, or a perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price for our shares and ADSs. To our knowledge, L'Or\u00e9al, our largest shareholder, is not subject to any contractual restrictions on thesale of the shares it holds in our Company. L'Or\u00e9al does not consider its stake in our Company as strategic. Risks Relating to Our Contingent Value Rights (CVRs) In addition to the risks relating to our shares, CVR holders are subject to additional risks. In connection with our acquisition of Genzyme, we issued CVRs under a CVR agreement entered into by and between us and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee (see also Note D.18. to the consolidated financial statements included atItem 18 of this annual report). A copy of the form of the CVR agreement is on file with the SEC as Annex B to Amendment No. 2 to the Registration Statement on Form F-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 24, 2011. Pursuant to the CVR agreement, each holder of a CVR is entitled to receive cash payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, if any,based on the achievement of certain cumulative net sales (1) Information in this section is supplementary to Note B.8.8. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report with respect to information required by IFRS 7. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 17ITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION thresholds by Lemtrada\u00ae(alemtuzumab for treatment of multiple sclerosis). See \"Item 10. Additional Information - C. Material Contracts - The Contingent Value Rights Agreement.\" CVR holders are subject to additional risks, including:the public market for the CVRs may not be active or the CVRs may trade at low volumes, both of which could have an adverseeffect on the resale price, if any, of the CVRs; the market price and trading volume of the CVRs may be volatile; no payment will be made on the CVRs without the achievement of certain agreed upon milestones. As such, it may be difficult to value the CVRs and accordingly it may be difficult or impossibleto resell the CVRs; if net sales do not exceed the thresholds set forth in the CVR agreement for any reason within the time periods specified therein, no payment will be made under the CVRs and the CVRswill expire without value; since the US federal income tax treatment of the CVRs is unclear, any part of any CVR payment could be treated as ordinary income and required to be included in income prior tothe receipt of the CVR payment; any payments in respect of the CVRs rank at parity with our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness;we are not prohibited from acquiring the CVRs, whether in open market transactions, private transactions or otherwise and we have already purchased CVRs on several occasions (for more information see \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review andProspects - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity.\"); we may, under certain circumstances, purchase and cancel alloutstanding CVRs; and while we have agreed to use diligent efforts (as defined in theCVR agreement), until the CVR agreement is terminated, to achieve each of the remaining Lemtrada \u00aerelated CVR milestones set forth in the CVR agreement, we are not requiredto take all possible actions to achieve these goals. On July 5, 2016 Sanofi disclosed that, based upon actual sales ofLemtrada \u00aein Qualifying Major Markets and in other markets during the respective applicable periods since the Product Launch, Product Sales Milestone #1 has not been met. On February 7, 2018, Sanofi disclosed that, based upon actual salestrends to date, it does not expect that product sales milestones #2, #3 and #4 will be met. Failure to achieve the remaining sales milestones could have an adverse effect on the value of theCVRs (see also Note D.22.c to the consolidated financialstatements included at Item 18 of the annual report regarding the ongoing CVR Trustee Claim). 18 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY Item 4. Information on the Company Introduction Sanofi is a leading global healthcare company, focused on patient needs and engaged in the research, development, manufacture and marketing of therapeutic solutions. In the remainder of this section:A product is referred to either by its international non-proprietary name (INN) or its brand name, which is generally exclusive to the company that markets it. In most cases, the brand names of ourproducts, which may vary from country to country, are protectedby specific registrations. In this document, products are identified by their brand names used in France and/or in the US. For our Pharmaceuticals activity, unless otherwise stated, all market share percentages and rankings are calculated based on consolidated national pharmaceutical sales data, excluding vaccines and in constant euros, on a November 2017 MAT (Moving Annual Total) basis. The data are mainly from IQVIAlocal sales audit supplemented by various other country-specific sources - e.g. Knobloch (Mexico), GERS (France hospital channel), HMR (Portugal), Reveal (Sweden). Market share datafor the Consumer Healthcare business are from Nicholas Hall, Q3 2017 MAT. For our Vaccines activity, market share percentages andrankings are based on our own estimates. These estimates have been made from information in the public domain collated from various sources, including statistical data collected by industry associations and information published by our competitors. Sanofi has three principal activities: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare (CHC) and Vaccines via Sanofi Pasteur. These activities are operating segments within the meaning of the IFRS 8 accounting standard (see Note D.35. to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 of this annual report). We exited the Animal Health business on January 1, 2017 when we closed atransaction with Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) in most markets to swapour Animal Health business for BI's Consumer Healthcare business. We invest in the following activities (see \"B. Business Overview - B.1. Strategy\" below): Rare Diseases, Multiple Sclerosis, Oncology, Immunology, Diabetes, Cardiovascular, EstablishedPrescription Products (1), Consumer Healthcare, Generics, and Vaccines. Unlike our Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare activities, which are operating segments within the meaning of IFRS 8, our Rare Diseases, Multiple Sclerosis, Oncology, Immunology,Diabetes, Cardiovascular, Established Prescription Products andGenerics activities are franchises whose performance is monitoredprimarily on the basis of net sales; the products sold by each of those franchises are included in our Pharmaceuticals operating segment. We are also active in emerging markets selling products from our three activities; the performance of our EmergingMarkets (2) operations is monitored primarily on the basis of net sales. For a presentation of the net sales of our activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, refer to \"Item 5 - Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year EndedDecember 31, 2016\". The most important pharmaceutical products marketed by us are described below. Rare Diseases: a portfolio Gaucher Aldurazyme\u00aefor mucopolysaccharidosis Type 1 (MPS 1). Multiple Aubagio\u00ae, a once-daily oral immunomodulator; and Lemtrada\u00ae, a monoclonal antibody. Both products were developed to treat patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Oncology: Jevtana\u00ae, a taxane derivative, indicated for patients with prostate cancer; Taxotere\u00ae, a taxoid representing a cornerstone therapy for several cancer types; Eloxatin\u00ae,a platinum agent, which is a key treatment broad hematologic malignancies; andZaltrap \u00ae, a recombinant fusion protein, indicated for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressedfollowing an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Immunology: Dupixent \u00ae(dupilumab), a monoclonal antibody against the Interleukin-4 alpha indicated for adults withmoderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; and Kevzara \u00ae(sarilumab), a monoclonal antibody against Interleukin-6 receptor,indicated for moderate severe rheumatoid arthritis. Diabetes: Lantus \u00ae(insulin glargine), a long-acting human insulin analog which the world-leading brand in the insulin market;Toujeo Insuman\u00ae, a range of rapid-acting or intermediate-acting human (1) Established Prescription Products comprises mature products including Plavix\u00ae, Lovenox\u00ae, Aprovel\u00ae, Renagel\u00aeand Renvela\u00ae.

INFORMATION inhibits PCSK9; and Multaq\u00ae, anti-arrhythmic drug atrial fibrillation. Established Products: a Lovenox\u00ae, a low molecular weight heparin for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous Aprovel\u00aeand CoAprovel\u00ae, anti-hypertensives; Renagel\u00aeand Renvela\u00ae, oral patients undergoing dialysis; Synvisc\u00aeand Synvisc-One\u00ae, viscosupplements used to reduce pain in patients suffering from osteoarthritis of certain joints; Stilnox\u00ae, for the short-term treatment of insomnia; long-lasting (12- and 24-hour) non-sedating prescription anti-histamine for the treatment of seasonal allergicrhinitis (hay fever) and uncomplicated hives. Generics: our pharmaceuticals portfolio also includes a wide range of generics. In October 2016, we announced our intention to initiate a carve-out process in order to divest our European Generics business. Our Consumer Healthcare (CHC) activity is supported by four strategic categories: Allergy Cough & Cold, Pain, Digestive and Nutritionals. On January 1, 2017, we acquired BI's CHC business in most markets. Our Vaccines activity is operated through Sanofi Pasteur. We sell leading vaccines in five areas: pediatric vaccines, influenza vaccines, adult and adolescent booster vaccines, meningitis vaccines, and travel and endemic vaccines. At the end ofDecember 2016, Sanofi Pasteur and MSD ended their vaccines joint venture in Europe and integrated their respective Europeanvaccines business into their own operations. We obtained regulatory approval for two new products (Dupixent \u00ae and Kevzara\u00ae) in the US and in the EU in 2017. We also obtained regulatory approval in the US for Admelog\u00ae, a follow-on insulin lispro, which was also approved in the EU as a biosimilar under the proprietary name Insulin lispro Sanofi\u00ae. Collaborations are essential to our business and a certain number of our products, whether on the market or under development, are in-licensed products relying on third-party rights or technologies. A/ History and Development of the Company The current Sanofi corporation was incorporated under the laws ofFrance in 1994 as a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ,a form of limited liability company, for a term of 99 years. Since May 2011, we haveoperated under the commercial name \"Sanofi\" (formerly known asSanofi-Aventis). Our registered office is located at 54, rue LaBo\u00e9tie, 75008 Paris, France, and our main telephone number is+33 1 53 77 40 00. Our principal US subsidiary's office is located at 55 Corporate Drive, Bridgewater, NJ 08807; telephone: +1 (908) 981 5000. Main changes since 2011 On April 4, 2011, following a tender offer, we acquired control of Genzyme, a US biotechnology company headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At the end of December 2016, Sanofi Pasteur and MSD ended their vaccines joint venture in Europe and integrated their respective European vaccines business into their own operations. On January 1, 2017, Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) successfully closed in most markets a transaction to swap Sanofi's Animal Health business for BI's CHC business. B/ Business overview B.1. Strategy The market context for Sanofi A number of fundamental trends point to a positive outlook for the pharmaceutical industry. The global population is growing and aging. Unmet medical needs remain high. The industry has increased R&D productivity, and has returned to consistently launching a high number of innovative medicines. Patients around the world, and a rising middle class in emerging markets, are demanding better care, empowered by access to new information.It is a particularly exciting time scientifically and technologically, with the promise of genomics being realized, immuno-oncology transforming cancer treatments, big data generating new insights into disease, and digital technologies helping to transform care delivery. At the same time, funding challenges, budget tightening and affordability will continue to put the entire Healthcare value chain under significant pressure. Even though we believe that the pharmaceutical portion will remain a fundamentally attractive business, the bar for innovation will most likely continue to rise.Innovation must have demonstrable benefit to the system. Payerswill continue to put scrutiny on prices and reimbursement and will demand demonstration of real life outcomes, coupled with more innovative pricing and contracting practices. Biosimilars are now firmly part of the competitive landscape in both the US and Europe. More focused competitors are building leadership positions in their priority therapy areas. Implementing the strategic roadmap To compete and win in this market, we are implementing our 2020strategic roadmap, announced in November 2015. We have made significant progress against each of the four pillars of that strategy in 2017: reshape the portfolio, deliver outstanding launches,sustain innovation in R&D , and simplify the organization. 20 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY Reshape the portfolio To reshape the portfolio, we segmented our businesses focusing on three targets: to sustain leadership, build competitive positions, and explore strategic options. Sustain leadership Diabetes and Cardiovascular Diseases. We remain committed to fighting the global epidemic of diabetes and to treating cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death globally. Our three priorities over the next few years are todevelop the insulin franchise with Lantus \u00ae, Toujeo\u00ae, and Soliqua / Suliqua and other selected insulins; strengthen our pipeline; and lead the market shift to managingdiabetes outcomes. In 2017, notable product achievementsincluded continued global momentum behind Toujeo \u00ae; the launch of Soliqua 100/33/SuliquaTMin the US and Europe; approval in the US and Europe of our insulin lispro biosimilar; and ongoing development of our future assets (including sotaglifozin in Phase III, efpeglenatide in Phase III, and our co- agonist drug candidates in Phase I and II). We are also committed to lead the market shift to managing diabetesoutcomes. In 2016, we established Onduo, our diabetessolutions joint venture with world-class partner Verily. We have also made investments in several Integrated Care solutions across various geographies. In cardiovascular, we have the opportunity to transform the management of hypercholesterolemia through Praluent\u00ae, developed jointly with Regeneron. In a challenging payer environment, we continue to work on securing access for patients to this important medication. We look forward to the results of theODYSSEY cardiovascular outcomes study of 18,000 patients, which will be released in the first quarter of 2018. Vaccines. Our growth will be driven by leading products in flu and by pediatric combinations. Demand typically exceeds supply, so a key priority for us is to produce more. We are investing tosecure and expand flu and pediatric capacity. In 2017, to expandour vaccine product portfolio we (i) completed the acquisition of Protein Sciences, adding Flublok \u00ae(the only recombinant protein- based influenza vaccine approved by the US) to our influenza vaccine portfolio and (ii) agreed a collaboration with Medimmune to develop and commercialize a monoclonal antibody for theprevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In addition, our European business has been consolidated and simplified with dissolution of the joint venture with MSD. Rare Diseases. We continue to sustain our market share leadership in rare genetic diseases through the patient-centered approach unique to Sanofi Genzyme, alongside product differentiation and market access. We continue to grow the market through screening expansion. We also expect to advanceour strong pipeline, where four of our assets have received breakthrough or fast-track designation from the FDA. In January 2018, we and Alnylam restructured our RNAi therapeuticsalliance: we now have broader rights to fitusiran (in developmentfor the treatment of people with hemophilia A and B), while Alnylam has broader rights to its investigational RNAitherapeutics programs for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis,including patisiran and ALN-TTRsc02. Consumer Healthcare. On January 1, 2017, Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) successfully closed in most markets a transaction to swap Sanofi's Animal Health and BI's CHCbusinesses. With this transaction, we acquired BI's CHC business in most markets and enhanced our position in fourstrategic categories: Allergy Cough & Cold, Pain, Digestive and Nutritionals. Since then, we have successfully integrated BI'sCHC business; rejuvenated management of the Consumer Healthcare business; and defined a growth model and target operating model. We have also launched portfolio complexityreduction programs and identified key areas for internal andexternal growth. Emerging Markets. We are the pharmaceutical industry leader in emerging markets and a major multinational player in the BRIC-M countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and Mexico). Build competitive positions Multiple Sclerosis. We already have a competitive position in multiple sclerosis. We will continue to maximize our support to these products through life cycle management in a competitivemarket and we intend to strengthen our portfolio. Investing forthe future, we have signed a licensing agreement with Principia to develop their experimental oral treatment (Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor) that shows promise in multiple sclerosis and,potentially, other central nervous system diseases. Oncology. We are rebuilding our oncology portfolio. We intend to maximize our clinical assets, particularly isatuximab (an anti- CD38 monoclonal antibody in late stage development for multiple myeloma) and cemiplimab (a PD-1 inhibitor derived from our alliance with Regeneron, in development for first line treatment of non small cell lung cancer, second line treatment of cervical cancer, the treatment of basal cell carcinoma and the treatmentof advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma). In January 2018, we announced that we and Regeneron will accelerate and expand investment in the clinical development of cemiplimab inoncology, and dupilumab in Type 2 allergic diseases. Immunology. We have the cornerstones of an important new franchise in immunology through Kevzara\u00ae(for rheumatoid arthritis) and Dupixent\u00ae(developed in several indications including atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyposis). Both drugs were developed in collaboration with Regeneron and both were launched in 2017. We aim to lead in atopic dermatitis withDupixent \u00ae, which was the first in class biologic to reach the market. An important milestone was achieved with the dupilumab Phase III study in uncontrolled persistent asthma which met its two primary endpoints; we filed for this indication and we expectto receive a decision from the FDA by October 20, 2018. Also in SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 21ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY 2017 we entered into a research collaboration and global exclusive licensing agreement with Ablynx, focused on Nanobody\u00ae-based therapeutics for the treatment of various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Explore strategic options Animal Health. We have fully exited the Animal Health business through the swap with BI. Generics in Europe. As announced, we carefully reviewed all options for our European Generics business. We announced the divestment earlier this year and signing of definitive transaction agreements(1) on the divestiture of European Generics is expected in the third quarter of 2018. Deliver outstanding launches Our second strategic priority is to deliver outstanding launches ofnew medicines and vaccines. We have focused the organization on six major Dupixent\u00ae, the first and only biologic medicine for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopicdermatitis. Dupixent \u00aeuptake to date is being driven by high patient need, healthcare professional engagement and initial marketaccess. Also in 2017, we launched Kevzara \u00aefor the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoidarthritis. We continued the global launch and lixisenatide and insulin glargine treatment for diabetes, whose market access in the US is progressing. Dengvaxia\u00aeuptake will most likely be impacted by product label updates to reflect new analysis of long-term data, which found differences in Dengvaxia\u00aeperformance based on prior dengue infection. Sustain innovation in R&D Our strategy depends on continued innovation in R&D . We continue to strengthen our R&D pipeline, increasing the number of high-quality projects in the early stage pipeline and replenishing the late development pipeline as products launch. Having deliveredreal improvements in development productivity, we are nowparticularly focused on improving research productivity. We have aligned the R&D organization with the new Global Business Unit structure, reorganized research into thematic clusters, continued to build capability in translational science, and recruited important new talent. We have moved and rebalanced our portfolio towards biologics especially through our collaboration with Regeneron for monoclonalantibodies. At the same time, we have worked internally to developour own proprietary platforms such as multi-specific antibodies to go from a mono-targeting to a multi-targeting world. Our R&D investments will follow our business priorities, focusing on those businesses where we aim to sustain leadership and build competitive positions. Simplify the organization We are creating a more agile organization through a strategic cost savings program, which has delivered\u20ac1.5 billion from 2015 to 2017: Simplification via the implementation in 2016 of a new Global Business Unit structure, integrating global franchises and country-level commercial and medical organizations for each ofour major businesses (Sanofi Genzyme; Diabetes andCardiovascular; General Medicines and Emerging Markets; Sanofi Pasteur and Consumer Healthcare), and via the creation of Global Functions (Finance, Human Resources, InformationTechnology and Solutions, etc); Operational improvement and productivity efforts in Industrial Affairs; Product portfolio streamlining in our Established Products franchise; and Resizing of sales forces to reflect evolving market dynamics. In parallel, we have made reinvestment decisions scaled to the needs of the business and have continued to strengthen our Medical Affairs and External Affairs functions. We have also united the different parts of the Company behind a single vision, a common set of values and a shared culture. B.2.

INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY Cerezyme\u00ae Cerezyme\u00ae(imiglucerase for injection) is an enzyme replacement therapy used to treat Gaucher disease, an inherited, potentially life- threatening LSD. It is estimated that Gaucher disease occurs in approximately one in 120,000 newborns in the general populationand one in 850 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population worldwide, butthe incidence and patient severity vary among regions. Cerezyme \u00aeis the only therapy with a 25-year history of reducing, relieving and reversing many of the symptoms and risks of Type 1 and Type 3 (in certain markets) Gaucher disease. Cerezyme\u00aeis administered by intravenous infusion over one or two hours. The principal markets for Cerezyme\u00aeare the US, Germany, Italy, France and Turkey. Cerdelga\u00ae Cerdelga\u00ae(eliglustat) is the first and only first-line oral therapy for Gaucher disease Type 1. A potent, highly specific ceramide analogue inhibitor of GL-1 synthesis with broad tissue distribution, Cerdelga\u00aehas demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of naive Gaucher disease patients and in patients who switch from enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Cerdelga\u00aewas approved by the FDA in August 2014 and by the European Commission in January 2015; the product is now available in several European countries. It was approved in Japan in March 2015 and launched in the same year. Regulatorysubmissions are ongoing in other countries. The largest market for Cerdelga \u00aeand for Gaucher disease overall is the US. Myozyme\u00aeand Lumizyme\u00ae Myozyme\u00aeand Lumizyme\u00ae(alglucosidase alfa) are enzyme replacement therapies used to treat Pompe disease, an inherited, progressive and often fatal LSD. Pompe disease occurs in approximately one in 40,000 newborns worldwide, but theincidence and patient severity vary among regions. Myozyme \u00aehas been marketed since 2006 in the US and the EU and is approved in more than 70 countries. Outside the US, Myozyme\u00aeis marketed for patients with both infantile- and late- onset disease. Lumizyme\u00aehas been marketed in the US since June 2010. Initially designed specifically to treat patients with late-onset Pompe disease and patients over eight years of age without evidence of cardiac hypertrophy, on August 1, 2014 it wasapproved for infantile-onset Pompe disease. Myozyme \u00aeand Lumizyme\u00aeare administered by intravenous infusion once every two weeks. Both products are recombinant forms of the same human enzyme. The principal markets for Myozyme\u00aeare the US, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK.Fabrazyme\u00ae Fabrazyme\u00ae(agalsidase beta) is an enzyme replacement therapy used to treat Fabry disease, an inherited, progressive and potentially life threatening LSD. Fabry disease occurs in approximately one in 35,000 newborns worldwide, but theincidence and patient severity vary among regions.

MPS 1 occurs in approximately one per 100,000 live births worldwide, but the incidence and patient severity vary among regions. Aldurazyme\u00aeis administered once weekly as an intravenous infusion The principal markets for Aldurazyme\u00aeare the US, France, the UK, Japan and Germany. b) Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which a person's immune system attacks the central nervous system, damaging myelin, the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers. This causes a break in communication between the brain and the rest of the body,ultimately destroying the nerves themselves, and causing irreversible damage. More than 2.5 million people suffer from MS worldwide. Our MS franchise consists of Aubagio \u00ae(teriflunomide), a once- daily, oral immunomodulator, and Lemtrada\u00ae(alemtuzumab), a monoclonal antibody. Both products have been developed to treat patients with relapsing forms of MS. Aubagio\u00ae Aubagio\u00ae(teriflunomide), a in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis required for activatedlymphocytes to multiply. The exact mechanism by whichteriflunomide exerts its therapeutic effect in MS is unknown but may involve a reduction in the number of activated lymphocytes in the central nervous system. Aubagio \u00aeis a once-daily oral therapy. Aubagio\u00aehas shown significant efficacy across key measures of MS disease activity, including slowing the progression of physical disability, reducing relapses, and reducing the number of brain lesions as detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 23ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY Aubagio\u00aeis the first and only oral MS therapy to significantly slow the progression of disability in two Phase III trials (TEMSO and TOWER). Consistent with its effect on slowing disability progression, Aubagio\u00aeis the only oral therapy shown to prevent or delay a second clinical attack in patients who have experienced initial neurological symptoms suggestive of MS (TOPIC trial). Ongoing development efforts include the TeriKIDS study to assess the safety and efficacy of teriflunomide in children (10-17 years old) and global post-marketing registries for pregnancy. Aubagio\u00aewas granted marketing authorization by the FDA in September 2012 for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS, and by the European Commission in August 2013 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting MS. Aubagio\u00aeis now approved in more than 70 countries around the world. In 2017, Sanofi reached settlement with all 20 generic Aubagio\u00ae ANDA first filers granting each a royalty-free license to enter the United States market on March 12, 2023. See \"Item 8. Financial Information - A. Consolidated financial statements and other financial information\". The principal markets for Aubagio\u00aein terms of sales are the US, Germany, France, the UK, Canada, Spain and Italy. Lemtrada\u00ae Lemtrada\u00ae(alemtuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CD52 antigen. The exact mechanism by which alemtuzumab exerts its therapeutic effect in MS is unknown. Research suggests immunomodulatory effects through theselective depletion and repopulation of T and B lymphocytes, resulting in a resetting of the immune system. Lemtrada \u00aeis administered as two short courses 12 months apart; for the majorityof patients no further treatment is necessary, making Lemtrada \u00ae the only disease-modifying therapy (DMT) that can provide long term durable efficacy in the absence of continuous dosing. Lemtrada\u00aewas able to show statistically significant improvement across many key measurements of MS disease activity including improvement in physical disability, reducing relapses, and reducing the number of brain lesions as detected by MRI. Lemtrada\u00aeis the first and only approved DMT to show an improvement in six-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI) against an active comparator (CARE MS II study). Lemtrada\u00aewas also able to reduce brain volume loss over six years to levels seen in healthy controls, despite the majority of Lemtrada\u00aepatients receiving no treatment after the initial two treatment courses (extension ofCARE MS I and II studies). In September 2013, Lemtrada \u00ae was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission for treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of MS with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. In November 2014, the FDA approvedLemtrada \u00aefor the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Because of its safety profile, the FDA approvallimited use of Lemtrada\u00aeto patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more drugs indicated for the treatment of MS and included a black-box warning on potential side effects. Lemtrada\u00aeis only available in the US through a restricted program called the Lemtrada\u00aeRisk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Lemtrada\u00aeis currently approved in more than 60 countries with additional marketing applications under review by regulatory authorities globally. Alemtuzumab is being evaluated in a Phase III study to assess the safety and efficacy in pediatric patients with relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis. The principal markets for Lemtrada\u00aein terms of sales are the US, the UK, Germany, Spain, Canada and Italy.Bayer Healthcare receives contingent payments based on alemtuzumab global sales revenue. For additional information, see Note D.18. to the consolidated financial statements included atItem 18 of this annual report. c) Immunology Our Immunology franchise consists of Dupixent\u00ae(dupilumab), the first and only biologic medicine for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), and Kevzara\u00ae (sarilumab) for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Dupixent\u00ae Dupixent\u00ae(dupilumab), a human monoclonal antibody, binds to the interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) and has been shown to specifically inhibit overactive signaling of two key proteins, IL-4 and IL-13, which are believed to be major drivers of the persistent underlyinginflammation in atopic dermatitis, and certain other allergic or atopic diseases. Atopic dermatitis, a form of eczema, is a chronic inflammatory disease with symptoms often appearing as a rash on the skin. Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is characterized by rashes sometimes covering much of the body, and can include intense, persistent itching and skin dryness, cracking, redness, crusting and oozing. Itch is one of the most burdensome symptoms for patients and can be debilitating. The global LIBERTY AD clinical trial program, which included nearly 3,000 patients, examined the use of Dupixent\u00aeeither alone or with topical corticosteroids in patients with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe AD. In all these studies, Dupixent\u00aealone or with topical corticosteroids met the primary and key secondary endpoints. Dupixent\u00aecomes in a pre-filled syringe and can be self- administered as a subcutaneous injection every other week after an initial loading dose. Dupixent\u00aecan be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Dupixent\u00aewas granted marketing authorization by the FDA in March 2017 for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic 24 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. Dupixent\u00aewas evaluated by the FDA with Priority Review. This followed the FDA's 2014 Breakthrough Therapy designation forDupixent \u00aefor inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe AD. In September 2017, the European Commission approved Dupixent\u00aefor use in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who are candidates forsystemic therapy. Applications for regulatory approval have also been submitted in several other countries and are being reviewed. Dupixent \u00aeis available in the US (since April 2017) and in Germany (since December 2017).Dupixent \u00aeis developed and commercialized in collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. For additional information on the commercialization of this product, see \"Item 5. Financial Presentation of Alliances - Alliance Arrangements with Regeneron\". Dupilumab is currently being evaluated in a broad range of clinical development programs for diseases that are driven by Type 2 inflammation, including uncontrolled persistent asthma (we filed for this indication and we expect to receive a decision from the FDA by October 20, 2018), adolescent and pediatric atopic dermatitis,pediatric asthma, nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. See \"- B.5. Global Research & Development\" There are ongoing patent infringement proceedings in several countries initiated by Sanofi and Regeneron against Amgen and Immunex relating to Dupixent\u00ae. See Note D.22.b) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annualreport and \"Item 8. Financial Information - B. Significant changes\" of this annual report for more information. Kevzara\u00ae Kevzara\u00ae(sarilumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and has been shown to inhibit IL-6R mediated signaling. IL-6 is a cytokine in the body that, in excess and over time, can contribute to the inflammationassociated with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease which carries substantial burden. In RA, the immune system attacks the tissues of the joints, causing inflammation, pain, and eventually joint damage and disability. RA most often strikes people between 30 and 60 years old; however, it can occur in adults at any age. The global SARIL-RA clinical development program, which evaluated Kevzara\u00ae, incorporated data from more than 3,300 adults with moderately to severely active RA who had an inadequate response to previous treatment regimens. In two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (MOBILITY study in methotrexate inadequateresponders and TARGET study in inadequate responders to Kevzara \u00aeplus demonstrated improvements. In May 2017, the FDA approved Kevzara \u00aefor the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have hadan inadequate response or intolerance to one or more DMARDs, such as methotrexate. In June 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Kevzara\u00aein combination with methotrexate for the treatment of moderately to severely active RAin adult patients who have responded inadequately to - or who are intolerant to - one or more DMARDs, such as methotrexate. Kevzara \u00aewas launched in Canada in February 2017, in the US in June 2017, and in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK during the second half of 2017. Kevzara\u00aeis developed and commercialized in collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. For additional information on the commercialization of this product, see \"Item 5. Financial Presentation of Alliances - Alliance Arrangements with Regeneron\". Sarilumab is being evaluated in Phase II studies in children and adolescents with polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and with systemic JIA. d) Jevtana\u00ae a cytotoxic agent, assembly and stabilizing microtubules, approved in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancerpreviously treated with a docetaxel-containing treatment regimen. Jevtana \u00aewas granted marketing authorization by the FDA in June 2010, by the European Commission in March 2011, and in Japan in July 2014. The product is now approved in over 85 countries. The main countries contributing to sales of Jevtana\u00aein 2017 were the US, France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Spain. Taxotere\u00ae Taxotere\u00ae(docetaxel), a taxoid class derivative, inhibits cancer cell division by essentially \"freezing\" the cell's internal skeleton, which is comprised of microtubules. Microtubules assemble and disassemble during a cell-division cycle. Taxotere\u00aepromotes their assembly and blocks their disassembly, thereby preventing many cancer cells from dividing, which ultimately results in destroying many cancer cells. Taxotere\u00aeis available in more than 90 countries as an injectable solution. It has been approved for use in 11 indications in five different tumor types (breast, prostate, gastric, lung, and head and neck). Generics of docetaxel have been launched globally.Sanofi is involved in Taxotere \u00aeproduct litigation in the US. See Note D.22.a) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 25ITEM 4. INFORMATION platinum-based cytotoxic agent. Eloxatin\u00ae, in combination with infusional administration of two other chemotherapy drugs, 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (the FOLFOX regimen), is approved by the FDA for adjuvant treatment of people with stage III colon cancer who have had their primary tumorssurgically removed. This approval was based on evidence of an improvement in disease-free survival after four years. Eloxatin \u00aeis in-licensed from Debiopharm and is marketed in more than 70 countries worldwide.Generics of oxaliplatin have been launched globally. Thymoglobulin\u00ae Thymoglobulin\u00ae(anti-thymocyte Globulin) is a polyclonal anti- human thymocyte antibody preparation that acts as a broad immunosuppressive and immunomodulating agent. The product's primary mechanism of action is T-cell depletion, which iscomplemented by a host of other immunomodulating effects. Thymoglobulin \u00aeis currently marketed in over 65 countries. Depending on the country, Thymoglobulin\u00aeis indicated for the treatment and/or prevention of acute rejection in organtransplantation; immunosuppressive therapy in aplastic anemia; and the treatment and/or prevention of Graft-versus-Host Disease(GvHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The main countries contributing to Thymoglobulin \u00aesales in 2017 were the US, China, France, Japan and South Korea. Mozobil\u00ae Mozobil\u00ae(plerixafor injection) is a hematopoietic stem cell mobilizer indicated in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patientswith non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM). The largest market for Mozobil \u00aeis the US. Zaltrap\u00ae Zaltrap\u00ae(aflibercept/ziv-aflibercept) is a recombinant fusion protein which acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds to (PIGF),preventing the bound VEGF from binding to their native receptors. VEGF-A is one of the mediators contributing to angiogenesis. VEGF-B and PlGF, related growth factors in the VEGF family, maycontribute to tumor angiogenesis as well. The FDA approved Zaltrap \u00aein August 2012 for use in combination with FOLFIRI (chemotherapy regimen made of 5-fluorouracil/ leucovorin/irinotecan), in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that is resistant to or has progressed following anoxaliplatin-containing regimen. To avoid confusion with Eylea \u00ae, theFDA assigned a new name, ziv-aflibercept, to the active ingredient.The European Commission approved Zaltrap\u00ae(aflibercept) in February 2013 to treat mCRC that is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Zaltrap\u00aeis now approved in more than 70 countries worldwide.

Vaccine products Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi, is a world leader in the vaccine industry providing more than one billion doses ofvaccines each year and making it possible to immunize more than 500 million people worldwide per year against diseases such aspolio or influenza. In Europe, Sanofi Pasteur's vaccine products were historically developed and marketed by Sanofi Pasteur MSD (SPMSD), a joint venture that served 19 countries, created in 1994 and held equally by Sanofi Pasteur and Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck). The vaccines market having undergone significant changes since the creation of SPMSD, Sanofi Pasteur and Merck decided to adjust their strategic priorities and terminated the SPMSD joint venture at the end of December 2016, reintegrating their European vaccine activities into their own operations. We successfully reintegrated our European vaccine portfolios into our company's operations which allowed usto drive significant growth. Sanofi Pasteur is a key supplier to publicly funded international markets such as UNICEF, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization(GAVI). The Sanofi Pasteur portfolio includes the following vaccines: a) Polio, Pertussis and Hib pediatric vaccines Sanofi Pasteur is one of the key players in pediatric vaccines in both developed and emerging markets, with a broad portfolio of standalone and combination vaccines protecting against up to sixdiseases in a single injection. Due to the diversity of immunization schedules throughout the world, vaccines vary in composition according to regional specificities. Pentaxim \u00ae, a pediatric combination vaccine protecting against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio andHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), was first marketed in 1997. To date, almost300 million doses of Pentaxim \u00aehave been distributed in over SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 31ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY 100 countries, and the vaccine has been included in the national immunization programs of 24 countries. Hexaxim\u00aeis the only fully liquid, ready-to-use 6-in-1 (hexavalent) pediatric vaccine that provides protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Hib and hepatitis B. In 2013, the EMAapproved this hexavalent pediatric vaccine in the EU, where it issold under the brand name Hexyon \u00aein Western Europe and under the brand name Hexacima\u00aein Eastern Europe. The rollout of this new hexavalent vaccine began in July 2013 in Germany and hassince ramped up significantly, with 30 countries having launchedHexaxim \u00aein their public or private immunization programs. In December 2014, the WHO granted prequalification status toHexaxim \u00aein a one-dose vial presentation. Hexaxim\u00aeis the only combination vaccine including acellular pertussis (acP) andinactivated polio vaccines (IPV) currently prequalified by the WHO. In 2017, Sanofi Pasteur in partnership with Merck made its PR5i hexavalent combination vaccine available on the market under the trademark Vaxelis\u00ae. The PR5i hexavalent combination vaccine is under regulatory review in the US. PR5i antigens are manufacturedby Sanofi Pasteur (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (5acP) and polio (IPV)), and by Merck (Hib and hepatitis B). Pentacel\u00ae, a pediatric combination vaccine protecting against five diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Hib), was launched in the US in 2008. Supply limitations have been lifted. Quadracel\u00ae, launched in the US in January 2017, is a combination vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio. It is used as a booster to be administered as the fifth dose in the primaryseries of vaccines, allowing children to complete the entirechildhood schedule with as few injections as possible. Shan5 \u00ae, developed by Shantha, is a fully-liquid 5-in-1 vaccine protecting against five diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and hepatitis B). Following improvements made to keymanufacturing steps in the production of the antigen components ofthe vaccine, Shan5 \u00aeregained its prequalification from the WHO (which provides access to the product in low-income countries) inMay 2014, and was launched in the Indian market in the lastquarter of 2014. Shan5 \u00aehas been retained for the GAVI/UNICEF tender for the 2017-2019 period. Sanofi Pasteur is the world's leading developer and manufacturer of polio vaccines, with both oral polio vaccines (OPVs) and injectable inactivated polio vaccines (IPVs) in its portfolio. Sanofi Pasteur's polio production capacity and historic commitment have enabled us toserve as an important industrial partner in helping to achieve the goal of worldwide polio eradication. The combined use of OPVs and IPVs is expected to improve the level of protection in countries threatenedby the possible resurgence of polio. In November 2013, GAVI announced its support for the introduction of IPV in the national immunization programs of the world's 71 poorest countries. The WHOexpert group on immunization recommended that all countriesintroduce at least one dose of IPV in their routine immunizationschedule by the first half of 2016. In September 2014, Nepal becamethe first GAVI supported country to introduce IPV. By the end of 2016,all 71 eligible countries had been approved for IPV support and 53had completed their introductions, with the remaining countries tocomplete their introductions in the next several years. Sanofi Pasteur continues to partner with public health authorities, supplying much- needed vaccines and making substantial efforts to register Imovax\u00ae Polio, Shan IPV Polio and bivalent OPV in an impressive number of countries in record time. As of today, polio remains endemic in threecountries: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. b) Influenza Vaccines Sanofi Pasteur is a world leader in the production and marketing of influenza vaccines, with over 200 million doses delivered in 2017.In recent years, demand for influenza vaccine has experiencedstrong growth in many countries, particularly in the US, Brazil and Mexico. Sanofi Pasteur expects the global demand for influenza vaccines to continue to grow within the next decade due to increased disease awareness, growth in emerging markets, andexpanded recommendations by governmental and advisory bodiesto be vaccinated against seasonal influenza. Sanofi Pasteur has two distinct influenza vaccines that are sold globally: Fluzone\u00aeand Vaxigrip\u00ae. Fluzone\u00aeHigh-Dose vaccine, launched in the US in 2010, was specifically designed to generate a more robust immune response against influenza in people aged 65 and older and provide greaterprotection against influenza. In November 2014, the FDA changedthe prescribing information for Fluzone \u00aeHigh-Dose to document its superior clinical benefit compared to the standard Fluzone\u00aedose (the high-dose vaccine was 24% more effective than standardFluzone a large-scale efficacy study). Fluzone\u00aeQuadrivalent is a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine containing two type A antigens and two type B antigens.Compared to the trivalent influenza vaccine, the addition of asecond B strain to the vaccine provides increased protectionagainst the most prevalent circulating strains. Fluzone \u00ae Quadrivalent/FluQuadri\u00aeis available in 24 countries for children aged over six months, adolescents and adults. Vaxigrip\u00aeis a trivalent vaccine licensed in over 150 countries globally for people aged six months and over.

Through the acquisition, Sanofi Pasteur added to its US portfolio Flublok\u00ae(a quadrivalent influenza vaccine for adults age 18 and over), the only recombinant protein-based influenza vaccine approved by the FDA. c) Adult Booster Vaccines Many countries now recommend pertussis immunization foradolescents and adults. These recommendations, combined withimmunization awareness initiatives, have led to increased pertussisvaccination rates in these populations in recent years. 32 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY Adacel\u00aeis the first trivalent adolescent and adult booster offering protection against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. It also reduces exposure from infants who are not immunized or only partiallyimmunized. Repevax \u00ae(also marketed under the trademark Adacel-Polio\u00ae)i sa combination vaccine that provides protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio. d) Meningitis and Pneumonia Vaccines Menactra\u00aeis the first quadrivalent conjugate vaccine against meningococcal meningitis, which is considered the deadliest formof meningitis in the world. Menactra \u00aeis now indicated for people aged nine months through 55 years in the US, Canada, severalMiddle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, and numerousother countries in all regions of the world. In most markets, aconjugated quadrivalent vaccine like Menactra \u00aeoffers the best value proposition by protecting against four of the most commonserogroups: A, C, Y, and W-135. e) Travel and Endemic Vaccines Sanofi Pasteur provides a wide range of travel and endemic vaccines including hepatitis A, typhoid, cholera, yellow fever, andJapanese encephalitis, as well as rabies vaccines andimmunoglobulins. These vaccines and immunoglobulins are usedin endemic settings in the developing world and are the foundationfor important partnerships with governments and organizationssuch as UNICEF. They are also used by travelers and militarypersonnel in industrialized countries and in endemic areas. In 2009, Shantha launched Shanchol \u00ae, the first oral cholera vaccine produced in India for use in children and adults. Shanchol\u00aereceived WHO prequalification in 2011. In 2013, the first oral cholera vaccine stockpile (which Shanchol\u00aeis part of) was created by the WHO, to respond to outbreaks and vaccine needs in areas of heightened risk. IMOJEV\u00ae, a Japanese encephalitis vaccine, was launched in Australia and Thailand in 2012. In 2014, IMOJEV\u00aeobtained an extension of indication for use in children aged nine months and over, and obtained WHO prequalification. IMOJEV\u00aehas been rolled out in endemic countries throughout Asia. As regards yellow fever, we shipped a significant part of the outbreak prevention stockpile in record time in 2016 to support our WHO/UNICEF/GAVI partners in their fight against expansion of theongoing outbreak, confirming our key role in combatting thisimportant public health threat. f) Dengue Dengue fever constitutes a major public health and economicburden in the endemic areas of the Asia-Pacific region and in LatinAmerica. More than 100 countries, representing nearly half of theworld's population, are at risk. Over the last 50 years, the incidenceof the disease has increased 30-fold, an alarming rate given therewas no specific treatment available. In response to this globalthreat, which can impact children, adolescents and adults, the WHO has set ambitious objectives to reduce the burden of thedisease on society. One of these objectives is to reduce morbidityby 25% and mortality by 50% by 2020. Surveillance data fromsome endemic countries indicate that between 70 and 90 percentof people will have been exposed to dengue at least once by thetime they reach adolescence. Following 20 years of innovativeresearch and collaboration with local at-risk communities anddengue scientists around the world, Sanofi Pasteur has developed a dengue vaccine candidate and embarked on a global,multinational clinical development program. Dengvaxia \u00aehas been approved in 19 countries to date: Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico,Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines (temporarily suspended for one yearin December 2017: see below), Singapore, Thailand and Venezuela.Dengvaxia \u00aeis currently indicated in most of the countries for individuals aged 9 or older living in a dengue-endemic area. In thisindicated population, Dengvaxia \u00aehas been shown to prevent 93% of severe disease and 80% of hospitalizations due to dengue over the25-month phase of the large-scale clinical studies conducted in 10countries in Latin America and Asia where dengue is widespread. On November 29, 2017 Sanofi announced results of a new analysis of long-term Dengvaxia\u00aedata which found differences in vaccine performance based on prior dengue infection. Sanofiproposed that health authorities update information provided tophysicians and patients on its dengue vaccine requesting thathealthcare professionals assess the likelihood of prior dengueinfection in an individual before vaccinating with Dengvaxia \u00ae. For individuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus,vaccination with Dengvaxia \u00aeshould not be recommended. This update is being implemented in any relevant countries (excludingthe Philippines). Based on up to six years of clinical data, the new analysis evaluated long-term safety and efficacy of Dengvaxia\u00aein people who had been infected with dengue prior to vaccination and thosewho had not. The analysis confirmed that Dengvaxia \u00aeprovides persistent protective benefit against dengue fever in those who hadprior infection. For those not previously infected by dengue virus,however, the analysis found that in the longer term, more cases ofsevere disease could occur following vaccination upon asubsequent dengue infection. Dengvaxia \u00aehad already been launched in two public vaccination programs: one in Parana State (Brazil), and one public program targeting students in public schools in the Philippines. In December2017, the Philippines put the Dengvaxia \u00aevaccine campaign on hold and temporarily suspended the Dengvaxia license for oneyear. Brazil's Parana state has continued with the program. In the Philippines Sanofi has bought back unused doses of Dengvaxia \u00aefollowing the announcement of label update in November. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 33ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY B.5. Global research & development The mission of Sanofi's R&D organization is to discover and develop therapies that prevent, treat or cure diseases. Our day-to- day commitment is to respond to patients' needs and to providethem with adapted therapeutic solutions in order to improve theirwell-being and extend their lives. Sanofi R&D is a global organization integrating all R&D activities across three major segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare. To carry out our mission and maximize its impact, we strive to bring innovation to patients and to build a pipeline of high value projects. Our approach is neutral to the source of innovation, whether itcomes from internal research or external partners. Medical value, scientific quality and operational effectiveness are the three drivers that underpin our strategy. The focus is on projects that have the potential to provide the best added medical value to patients and payers and to reduce healthcare costs for society. By using a translational medicine approach, ensuring that research hypotheses are validated in humans as early as possible, R&D can translate basic research findings into medical practice more quicklyand efficiently and improve the scientific quality of our projects. B.5.1. Pharmaceuticals B.5.1.1. Organization Our Global R&D organization is committed to responding to the real needs of patients by providing them with safe, cost-effective and appropriate therapeutic solutions, improving their access totreatment and delivering better health outcomes. In offering newsolutions to patients, it is vital to understand the complexity ofhuman diseases, to sustain innovation and to foster scientific excellence without losing sight of the need for operational efficiency. To meet these challenges, Sanofi R&D has evolved towards an integrated organization encompassing a wide range of therapeutic areas aligned with the Global Business Units (GBUs), which arededicated to supporting our commercial operations and reflect our strengths and expertise as well as the most pressing health issues. For Pharmaceuticals, six therapeutic areas (TAs) have been rolled out: Diabetes, Cardiovascular and Metabolism Oncology Immunology & Inflammation Multiple Sclerosis, Neurology & Gene Therapy Infectious Diseases Rare Diseases These TAs drive a portfolio of R&D projects, ensuring a strategically coherent approach and flawless implementation.Each TA has its own experts who are responsible for analyzing medical needs, defining project strategy and development plans, and leading the Global Project Teams. Our R&D Operations department handles all operational activities and delivers effective development through integrated, collaborative project teams. Those teams harness high caliberfunctional expertise and the most appropriate technologies acrosschemical, biological and pharmaceuticals operations, translationalmedicine and early development and clinical sciences. In Research, a dedicated, integrated platform has been introduced thatworks across multiple disease areas and methods. This platform drivescollaboration with internal and external partners to translate humanbiology research and state-of-the art technologies and processes intonovel drug targets and world-class safe and effective drugs. Sanofi's R&D operations are concentrated in three major hubs: North America, Germany and France. These hubs help build our scientificintelligence network and facilitate connections and knowledge-sharingbetween in-house scientists, and with external partners and scientificcommunities, in order to accelerate our research activities. B.5.1.2. Governance Global Project Teams (GPTs) are responsible for developingproject strategy and driving the execution of projects throughfunctional sub-teams. GPTs are led by a Global Project Head(GPH) who works in collaboration with a Project Manager (PM),and are built around core functional team members representingeach department collaborating in the development project. Various committees assess product and project development across the R&D value chain, carry out in-depth scientific review, make go and no-go decisions and determine portfolio priorities. Projects are assessed using two key criteria which allow management to rapidly understand how the portfolio is performing in terms of innovation, unmet medical needs, risk and value: relative medical value, which encompasses the extent of the unmet need, the market dynamics and the likelihood of getting satisfactory market conditions; and science translation, which includes the level of innovation andtranslatability of the science including likelihood of development success. The clinical portfolio is the result of decisions taken during these reviews, plus compounds entering the portfolio from the discovery phase or from third parties via acquisition, collaboration or alliances.

INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY Phase I studies are the first studies performed in humans, who are mainly healthy volunteers, except for studies in oncology, where Phase I studies are performed in patients. Their main objective is to assess the tolerability, the pharmacokinetic profile (the way theproduct is distributed and metabolized in the body and the manner by which it is eliminated) and where possible the pharmacodynamic profiles of the new drug (i.e. how the product may react on somereceptors). Phase II studies are early controlled studies in a limited number of patients under closely monitored conditions to show efficacy andshort-term safety and to determine the dose and regimen for Phase III studies. Phase III studies have the primary objective of demonstrating or confirming the therapeutic benefit and the safety of the new drug in the intended indication and population. They are designed to provide an adequate basis for registration. a) Diabetes Sotagliflozin (SAR439954 ), an oral dual inhibitor of SGLT1/2, is in-licensed from Lexicon.

Product discontinued in 2017 SAR428926 , an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) binding to Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP1), was discontinued in November 2017. The product was in Phase I.Collaborations Sanofi Oncology has a large number of collaborations and alliances to support its R&D portfolio. In 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration and licenseagreement with Regeneron focusing on cancer immunotherapy. The objective of the collaboration is to generate high valuedevelopment candidates in the emerging field of immuno-oncology,providing us with an opportunity to expand and accelerate ourdevelopment pipeline and build a strong position in one of the most attractive segments of the oncology market. To date cemiplimab(SAR439684), a PD-1 inhibitor monoclonal antibody derived from this collaboration, has entered Phase III clinical development. Also in 2015, we entered into an exclusive strategic collaboration with the German biotech company BioNTech (Mainz) in the field of active immunization. The goal of the alliance is to discover and develop messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics for cancer immunotherapy by leveraging the scientific expertise of the twoorganizations. The first clinical candidate is expected to enter clinical trials in 2018. These two ambitious alliances have the potential to address some of the unmet medical needs that remain in cancer treatment. Sanofi Oncology has also established various alliances withleading academic cancer centers such as Institut Gustave Roussy, Institut Curie and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and with biotechnology companies like Immunogen and Evotec. We will also be partnering with the Foundation of the US National Institutes ofHealth (FNIH) in the Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies(PACT). In 2016, we entered into a collaboration with Innate Pharma to develop innovative bispecific antibody formats engaging natural killer (NK) cells to kill tumor cells, and a collaboration with WarpDrive Bio to develop drugs targeting human oncogenes including RAS. Both these collaborations are in line with our ongoingcommitment to the discovery and development of new cancer drugs and therapeutic strategies that will make a difference in the lives of cancer patients. d) Immunology & Inflammation Main products in Phase III and in the registration phase Dupilumab (SAR231893) , an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist, is a human monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 subclass that binds to the IL-4R subunit and inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling.

PR5i (hexavalent vaccine ): Sanofi Pasteur is co-developing with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) a hexavalent combination vaccine (PR5i 6-in-1 vaccine) to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis,polio, Hib and hepatitis B. A license application for this vaccine was submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by Sanofi Pasteur MSD (SPMSD) in January 2015. On December 17, 2015 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for the product, to be commercialized as Vaxelis\u00aein the European Union. On February 19, 2016, SPMSD was granted marketingauthorization for Vaxelis \u00ae, and commercialization began in 2017 through a partnership between Merck and Sanofi Pasteur. A Biologics License Application was submitted to the US FDA in August 2014, and on November 2, 2015 the FDA issued aComplete Response Letter (CRL) for PR5i which is to becommercialized through a partnership of Merck and Sanofi 40 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY Pasteur. Sanofi Pasteur and Merck are currently reviewing the CRL and plan to further communicate with the FDA. PR5i is expected to be the first hexavalent vaccine in the US market. Shan 6 is a cost-effective, all-in-one liquid hexavalent combination vaccine being developed for the Indian market and WHO pre- qualification. It comprises a detoxified whole-cell pertussis component as well as diphtheria toxoid, Haemophilus influenza type b PRP-T, inactivated poliovirus types1, 2, and 3 and hepatitis B virus components. A Phase I/II trial was initiated in India in October 2016, and Phase III preparations areunderway. Adacel+ (Pertussis vaccine): To sustain our global leadership in the development of pertussis vaccines, our R&D efforts are focused on developing an improved Tdap (tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, and 5-component Acellular pertussis containingformulation), for use in individuals aged 10 and over in the USmarket. The new formulation is being tested in Phase II trials. New Vaccine Targets Tuberculosis: Statens Serum Institute (SSI) of Denmark has granted Sanofi Pasteur a license to its technology for the use of certain fusion proteins in the development of a tuberculosisvaccine. The candidate vaccine is made up of recombinant proteinunits. Results from a 2008 Phase I trial found that the candidate vaccine was safe when administered to healthy adults living in a region of high endemic tuberculosis. A Phase I/II study in infantswas initiated in South Africa in July 2013. A Phase II proof ofconcept study was initiated in young adolescents in South Africa in March 2014. Results are expected in 2018. Herpes Simplex Virus: Herpes simplex virus type 2 is a member of the herpes virus family and as such establishes life-long infections, with latent virus established in neural ganglia. Although antivirals currently exist to treat infections, no vaccine exists, greatly limiting options in disease management. Our vaccinecandidate is a live attenuated virus and is being assessed as a therapeutic and possibly prophylactic vaccine to reduce recurrence and transmission. In 2014, Sanofi Pasteur signed a contract with Immune Design Corp. to collaborate on the development of atherapeutic herpes simplex virus vaccine by exploring the potential of various combinations of agents. HIV: Due to the enormity of the disease burden in developing countries and the potential for initial licensing of an efficacious vaccine in the developing world, Sanofi Pasteur is working in a \"pox-protein public-private partnership\" (P5) to document efficacy of a pox-protein based HIV prophylactic vaccine in South Africa.Specifically, following the modest success of RV144 (the first trial to show supporting evidence that vaccines could lower the risk of contracting HIV), the P5 partnership adopted a pox-protein based vaccine candidate as potentially providing greater protection forSouth Africa and conducted a Phase I/II study (HVTN 100). Thisstudy met all pre-specified safety and immunogenicity criteria and supported moving the vaccine regimen to a pivotal efficacy study (HVTN702), which started on October 26, 2016 in South Africa andwill continue until 2021. HVTN702 will not only assess the vaccine's safety and efficacy, it will also help in discovering immune correlates of protection. RSVi: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis in young children. Globally, RSV accounts for 22%-40% of lower tract respiratory illnesses, 50%-90% of bronchiolitis cases and 19%-40% of pneumonia cases, and causes up to 199,000 deaths each year. It is estimated that in the US alone, about 172,000 RSV hospitalizations occur each year inchildren under 5 years of age, resulting in significant healthcare costs. Sanofi Pasteur has signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop a live attenuated RSV vaccine forroutine immunization in infants aged 4 months and older. The lead candidate(s) are currently under Phase 1 evaluation in healthy infants without previous RSV exposure. In addition, in March 2017Sanofi Pasteur announced an agreement with MedImmune to develop and commercialize a monoclonal antibody (SP0232, alsoknown as MEDI8897) which has been engineered to have a longhalf-life so that only one dose would be needed for the entire RSV season. It is currently being investigated in a Phase IIb study in preterm infants. MEDI8897 received fast-track designation from theFDA in 2015. Zika: Sanofi Pasteur entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) on a Zika vaccine project in 2016. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the US Department of Health and Human Services had agreed to provide $43.2 million in funding for the manufactureof the inactivated Zika vaccine and the Phase I-II clinical trials. In August 2017, BARDA informed Sanofi Pasteur that it had decided to limit its funding to a case definition and surveillance study as well as any activities required to advance our vaccine development to a point where development would be indefinitely paused but could be restarted if the epidemic re-emerges. Consequently,Sanofi does not intend to continue development of, or seek alicense from WRAIR for, the Zika vaccine candidate at this time. One of the ways Sanofi Pasteur will continue to contribute to the field of knowledge on Zika is by completing, with partial BARDA support, the ongoing case definition and surveillance study; this will provide guidance on Zika epidemiology and diagnosis that can be applicable to any vaccine subsequently developed to prevent thedisease. Clostridium difficile (C.diff) Toxoid vaccine: We announced in December 2017 that we had decided to discontinue clinical development of our experimental C.diff vaccine. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 41ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY B.5.3. R&D expenditures for late stage development Expenditures on research and development amounted to \u20ac5,472 million in 2017. Based on our new segment reporting model(1), that comprised \u20ac4,056 million in the Pharmaceuticals segment; \u20ac123 million in the Consumer Healthcare segment; \u20ac557 million in the Vaccines segment; and \u20ac736 million allocated to \"Other\", representing R&D support function costs that have been verticalized as part of the reorganization of Sanofi. Research anddevelopment expenditures were the equivalent of about 15.6% of net sales in 2017, compared to 15.3% in 2016 and about 14.9% in2015. The stability in R&D expenditure as a percentage of salesover the past three years is attributable to active management ofthe portfolio and close cost control, and has been achieved despite a greater proportion of products being in late stage development. Based on our previous segment reporting model(2), under which we present our comparative analysis, preclinical research in thePharmaceuticals segment (3)amounted to \u20ac1,218 million in 2017 compared to \u20ac1,094 million in 2016 and \u20ac1,072 million in 2015. Of the remaining \u20ac3,617 million relating to clinical development in the Pharmaceuticals segment(3)(\u20ac3,523 million in 2016 and \u20ac3,458 million in 2015), the largest portion was generated by Phase III orpost-marketing studies, reflecting the cost of monitoring large scale clinical trials.

INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY With respect to the compound patent information set out above, investors should bear in mind the following additional factors: The listed compound patent expiration dates do not reflect possible extensions of up to five years available in the US, the EU, and Japan for pharmaceutical products. See \"- B.7. Patents, Intellectual Property and Other Rights - Patent Protection\" for a description of supplementary protection certificates and patent term extensions. Depending on the circumstances surrounding any final regulatory approval of the compound, there may be other listed patents or patent applications pending that could have relevance to the product as finally approved; the relevance of any suchapplication would depend upon the claims that ultimately may begranted and the nature of the final regulatory approval of the product. Regulatory exclusivity tied to the protection of clinical data is complementary to patent protection, and may provide more efficacious or longer lasting marketing exclusivity than a compound's patent estate. See \"- B.7. Patents, Intellectual Property and Other Rights - Regulatory Exclusivity\" for additionalinformation. In the United States the data protection generally runs five years from first marketing approval of a new chemical entity extended to seven years for an orphan drug indication andtwelve years from first marketing approval of a biological product.In the EU and Japan the corresponding data protection periods are generally ten years and eight years, respectively. B.6.

For more information on market shares and rankings see\"Presentation of Financial and Other Information\" at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 20-F. B.6.1. Marketing and Distribution We have a commercial presence in approximately 100 countries, and our products are available in more than 170 countries. Our main markets in terms of net sales are respectively: Emerging Markets (see definition in \"- Information on the Company - Introduction\" above): Sanofi is the leading healthcarecompany in emerging markets. Sanofi is the fifth largest pharmaceutical company in China. The US: we rank twelfth with a market share of 3.7%. Europe: we are the second largest pharmaceutical company inFrance where our market share is 7.2% and we rank fourth in Germany with a 4.4% market share. Other countries: our market share in Japan is 1.6%. A breakdown of our aggregate net sales by geographical region ispresented in \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016.\" Although specific distribution patterns vary by country, we sell prescription drugs primarily to wholesale drug distributors, independent and chain retail drug outlets, hospitals, clinics,managed-care organizations and government institutions. Rare disease products are also sold directly to physicians. With theexception of Consumer Healthcare products, our drugs are ordinarily dispensed to patients by pharmacies upon presentation of a doctor's prescription. We use a range of channels from in-person to digital to disseminate information about and promote our products among healthcare professionals and patients, ensuring that the channels not only cover our latest therapeutic advances but also our established prescription products, which satisfy patient needs insome therapy areas. We regularly advertise in medical journals and exhibit at major medical congresses. In some countries, products are also marketed directly to patients by way of television,radio, newspapers and magazines, and digital channels (such as the internet). National education and prevention campaigns can be used to improve patients' knowledge of their conditions. Our sales representatives, who work closely with healthcare professionals, use their expertise to promote and provide information on our drugs. They represent our values on a day-to-day basis and are required to adhere to a code of ethics and to internal policies in which they receive training. Although we market most of our products through our own sales forces, we have entered into and continue to form partnerships to co-promote/co-market certain products in specific geographical areas. Our major alliances are detailed at \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - Financial Presentation ofAlliances.\" See also \"Item 3. Key Information - D. Risk Factors -We rely on third parties for the discovery, manufacture and marketing of some of our products.\" Our vaccines are sold and distributed through multiple channels including physicians, pharmacies, hospitals, private companies and distributors in the private sector, and governmental entities andnon-governmental organizations in the public and internationaldonor markets. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 43ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY B.6.2. Competition The pharmaceutical industry continues to experience significant changes in its competitive environment. There are four types of competition in the prescription pharmaceutical market: competition between pharmaceutical companies to research and develop new patented products or address unmet medical needs; competition between different patented pharmaceutical productsmarketed for the same therapeutic indication; competition between original and generic products or between original biological products and biosimilars, at the end of regulatory exclusivity or patent protection; and competition between generic or biosimilar products. We compete with other pharmaceutical companies in all majormarkets to develop innovative new products. We may develop new technologies and new patented products wholly in-house, but wealso enter into collaborative R&D agreements in order to access new technologies. See Note D.21. to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 of this annual report. Sanofi is the fifth largest pharmaceutical company globally by sales. Our prescription drugs compete in all major markets against patented drugs from major pharmaceutical companies. Our competitors in key businesses include: Novo Nordisk, Boehringer Ingelheim and Merck in diabetes; Lilly in diabetes, immunology andoncology; Bristol-Myers Squibb in immunology oncology; Novartis multiple sclerosis, and oncology; Shire in rare diseases; Pfizer in rare diseases and oncology; Biogen, Teva and Merck Serono in multiple sclerosis; Bayer in multiple sclerosis andoncology; Roche in multiple sclerosis, immunology and oncology;AstraZeneca in diabetes, cardiovascular disease and oncology; and Amgen in cardiovascular disease. Following our acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim's consumer healthcare business, our share of the global consumer healthcare market in 2017 was 4.2%. Other key competitors includeJohnson & Johnson, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Bayer and Reckitt Benckiser as well as local players, especially in emerging markets. Our generics business competes with multinational corporations such as Teva, Sandoz (a division of Novartis), Mylan and local players, especially in emerging markets. In our Vaccines business we are one of the top four players, competing primarily with large multinational players including Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, and Pfizer. We also face competition from generic drugs that enter the market when our patent protection or regulatory exclusivity expires, or when we lose a patent infringement lawsuit (see \"- B.7. Patents, Intellectual Property and Other Rights\" below). Similarly, when acompeting patented drug from another pharmaceutical companyfaces generic competition, those generic products can also affect the competitive environment of our own patented product. See \"Item 3. Key Information - D. Risk factors - Risks relating to our business\". Competition from producers of generics has increased sharply in response to healthcare cost containment measures and to the increased number of products for which patents or regulatory exclusivity have expired. Generics manufacturers who have received all necessary regulatory approvals for a product may decide to launch a generic version before the patent expiry date, even in cases where the owner of the original product has already commenced patent infringement litigation against the generics manufacturer. Suchlaunches are said to be \"at risk\" for the promoter of the generic product because it may be required to pay damages to the owner of the original product in the context of patent infringementlitigation; however, these launches may also significantly impair theprofitability of the pharmaceutical company whose product is challenged. Drug manufacturers also face competition through parallel trading, also known as reimportation. This takes place when drugs sold abroad under the same brand name as in a domestic market are imported into that domestic market by parallel traders, who may repackage or resize the original product or sell it through alternativechannels such as mail order or the internet. This situation is of particular relevance to the EU, where these practices have been encouraged by the current regulatory framework. Parallel traderstake advantage of the price differentials between markets arising from factors including sales costs, market conditions (such asintermediate trading stages), tax rates, or national regulation of prices. Finally, pharmaceutical companies face illegal competition from falsified drugs. The WHO estimates that falsified products account for 10% of the market worldwide, rising to 30% in some countries.All therapeutic areas are affected, also including vaccines.However, in markets where powerful regulatory controls are inplace, falsified drugs are estimated to represent less than 1% of market value. B.6.3. Regulatory Framework B.6.3.1. Overview The pharmaceutical and health-related biotechnology sectors are highly regulated. National and supranational health authorities administer a vast array of legal and regulatory requirements that dictate pre-approval testing and quality standards to maximize thesafety and efficacy of a new medical product. These authoritiesalso regulate product labeling, manufacturing, importation/ exportation and marketing, as well as mandatory post-approval commitments that may include pediatric development. 44 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that a license to market will be granted. Furthermore, each regulatory authority may impose its own requirements during the course of the product development and application review. Itmay refuse to grant approval and require additional data before granting approval, even though the same product has already been approved in other countries. Regulatory authorities also have theauthority to request product recalls, product withdrawals and penalties for violations of regulations based on data that are made available to them. Product review and approval can vary from six months or less to several years from the date of application depending upon the country. Factors such as the quality of data, the degree of control exercised by the regulatory authority, the review procedures, thenature of the product and the condition to be treated, play a major role in the length of time a product is under review. The International Council for Harmonization (ICH) continues to implement its reform mandate. The aims are to reinforce the foundations of the ICH; expand harmonization globally beyond the traditional ICH members, i.e. the three founding members (EU, Japan, US) plus Canada andSwitzerland as observers; and facilitate the involvement of additional regulators and industry associations around the world. There are now nine regulatory agencies (including China, Braziland South Korea) and six industry associations as full ICH members and 24 organizations (including nine regulatory authorities from around the world) with observer status. International collaboration between regulatory authorities continues to develop with the implementation of confidentiality arrangementsand memoranda of understanding between both ICH and non-ICH regulatory authorities. Examples include work-sharing on GoodManufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Clinical Practices (GCP) inspections, as well as regular interactions between the US and the EU in the form of \"clusters\" (i.e. pediatrics, oncology, advancedtherapy medicinal products, vaccines, pharmacogenomics, orphan drugs, biosimilars, and blood products). In 2017 the United States and the EU completed an exchange of letters to amend thePharmaceutical Annex to the 1998 US-EU Mutual RecognitionAgreement. Under this agreement, US and EU regulators will be able to utilize each other's good manufacturing practice for inspections of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. In addition to the joint efforts listed above, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) have proven to be one of the best ways to open up foreign markets to exporters and to allow for discussions on harmonizationtopics for regulatory authorities. Some agreements, such as the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), are international in nature, while others are between specific countries. The requirements of many countries (including Japan and several EU Member States) to negotiate selling prices or reimbursement rates for pharmaceutical products with government regulators significantly extend the time to marketentry beyond the initial marketing approval. While marketingauthorizations for new pharmaceutical products in the EU have been largely centralized within the European Commission in collaboration with the EMA, pricing and reimbursement remain amatter of national competence. In the EU , there are three main procedures for applying for marketing authorization:The centralized procedure is mandatory for drugs derived from biotechnologies; new active substances designed for human useto treat HIV, viral diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and auto-immune diseases; orphan drugs; andinnovative products for veterinary use. When an application is submitted to the EMA, the scientific evaluation of the application is carried out by the Committee for Medicinal Products forHuman Use (CHMP) and a scientific opinion is prepared. This opinion is sent to the European Commission which adopts the final decision and grants an EU marketing authorization. Such amarketing authorization is valid throughout the EU and the drugmay be marketed within all EU Member States. If a company is seeking a national marketing authorization in more than one Member State, two procedures are available to facilitate the granting of harmonized national authorizationsacross member states: the mutual recognition procedure or thedecentralized procedure. Both procedures are based on the recognition by national competent authorities of a first assessment performed by the regulatory authority of oneMember State. National authorizations are still possible, but are only for products intended for commercialization in a single EU MemberState or for line extensions to existing national product licenses. Generic products are subject to the same marketing authorizationprocedures. A generic product must contain the same active medicinal substance as a reference product approved in the EU.Generic applications are abridged: generic manufacturers only need to submit quality data and demonstrate that the generic drug is \"bioequivalent\" to the originator product (i.e. performs in thesame manner in the patient's body), but do not need to submit safety or efficacy data since regulatory authorities can refer to the reference product's dossier. Generic product applications can befiled and approved in the EU only after the originator product eight- year data exclusivity period has expired. Further, generic manufacturers can only market their generic products after a 10- or11-year period has elapsed from the date of approval of theoriginator product. In the case of orphan drugs, generic product applications may not be filed before the expiry of a 10- or 12-year period from the date of approval of the originator product. Another relevant aspect in the EU regulatory framework is the \"sunset clause\" under which any marketing authorization ceases to be valid if it is not followed by marketing within three years or ifmarketing is interrupted for a period of three consecutive years. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 45ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY In 2017, the EMA recommended 92 medicines for marketing authorization (versus 81 in 2016), including 35 new active substances. Among the 92 medicines recommended, 19 (21%) had an orphan designation (versus 17 in 2016 and 18 in 2015), providing medicines for patients with rare diseases. Seven medicines wereevaluated under accelerated assessment in 2017 (also seven in 2016 and five in 2015); this mechanism is reserved for medicines that have the potential to address unmet medical needs. Threemedicines were recommended for a conditional marketing authorization; this is one of the EMA's early access routes topatients, and is intended for medicines that address an unmet medical need and that target seriously debilitating, life-threateningor rare diseases, or are intended for use in emergency situations in response to a public health threat. Post-authorization safety monitoring of pharmaceutical products is carefully regulated in Europe. EU pharmaceutical legislation for medicinal products describes the respective obligations of themarketing authorization holder (MAH) and of the regulatory authorities to set up a system for pharmacovigilance in order to collect, collate and evaluate information about suspected adversereactions. It is possible for the regulatory authorities to withdraw products from the market for safety reasons. Responsibilities forpharmacovigilance rest with the regulatory authorities of all the EU Member States in which the marketing authorizations are held. In accordance with applicable legislation, each EU Member State hasa pharmacovigilance system for the collection and evaluation of information relevant to the risk-benefit balance of medicinalproducts. The regulatory authority regularly monitors the safety profile of the products available in its territory, takes appropriate action where necessary, and monitors the compliance of MAHs with their pharmacovigilance obligations. All relevant information isshared between the regulatory authorities and the MAH, in order toallow all parties involved in pharmacovigilance activities to fulfill their obligations and responsibilities. The pharmacovigilance legislation was amended in 2012. The amendments aimed to further strengthen the protection of patient health by promoting prompt and appropriate regulatory action onEuropean medicines. In particular, the amendments included major changes to notification requirements: MAHs of human medicines now have to notify EU regulators of any action to withdraw aproduct from a market, together with the reason for this action. Changes also included the creation of a Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), a scientific advisory committee atEMA level, with a key role in the assessment of all aspects of riskmanagement relating to the use of medicinal products for human use approved in the European Economic Area (EEA). This includesmeasures relating to the detection, assessment, minimization and communication of the risk of adverse reactions, having due regard to the therapeutic effect of the medicinal product. This committee is also responsible for the design and evaluation of post-authorizationsafety studies (PASS) and pharmacovigilance audits.In Europe, the PRAC has performed reviews of marketed products (by class or on ad hoc basis) through various procedures. For Sanofi, 182 products underwent PRAC review through signal andreferral procedures from July 2012 to December 2017, generating 112 labeling variations (14 new variations in 2017) and five additional risk minimization measures. In only two cases for Sanofi(Myolastan \u00ae, and methadone oral solutions containing povidone) did the review lead to the product being withdrawn from the EU market. The EU pharmacovigilance legislation also strengthens the legal basis for regulators to require post-authorization safety and efficacy studies throughout the life cycle of a medicinal product, withregulatory supervision of protocols and results. Such studies are aimed at collecting data to enable the safety or efficacy of medicinal products to be assessed in everyday medical practice.The granting of marketing authorization is conditional on such studies being performed. Consequently, the pharmaceutical industry now has to build the need for PASS and post-authorization efficacy studies (PAES) into development and life cyclemanagement plans. Sanofi has put in place robust processes to ensure that PASS and PAES can be properly implemented asrequired, either as part of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) orfollowing a health authority request. A further requirement introduced by the EU pharmacovigilance legislation is for pharmaceutical companies to prepare Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs). These are not limited to safetydata, but instead present a critical analysis of the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product, taking into account new or emerging information in the context of cumulative information onrisks and benefits. There is in addition a legal requirement for an enhanced adverse reaction collection and management system (EudraVigilance) that delivers better health protection through simplified reporting, higher quality data, and improved search, analysis and tracking functionalities. Associated with this is a legal requirement for MAHsto monitor EudraVigilance data, to the extent to which they have access to such data. On November 22, 2017, the EMA launched anew and improved version of EudraVigilance with enhanced functionalities to support the fulfilment of these pharmacovigilance obligations. Alongside the launch, simplified electronic reporting ofsuspected adverse reactions related to medicines by nationalCompetent Authorities and MAHs to EudraVigilance became mandatory. On February 22, 2018, the legal requirement for MAHs to monitor EudraVigilance data and inform the EMA and nationalcompetent authorities of validated signals became applicable for active substances included in the \"List of medicinal products under additional monitoring\", for a one-year pilot period. The database of medicinal products aims to deliver structured and quality assured information on medicinal products authorized in theEU that incorporates the terminology adopted in the EU for products, substances, and organizations underpinning pharmacovigilance and regulatory systems. Since January 1, 2015, 46 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY MAHs have been required to notify the EMA of any new marketing authorizations within 15 calendar days from the date of authorization, and to notify the EMA of any change in the terms of a marketing authorization as soon as possible within 30 calendardays following the date on which the changes were authorized. The EMA's medical literature monitoring (MLM) service was launched on September 1, 2015 to monitor selected medicalliterature for reports of suspected adverse drug reactionscontaining certain active substances, and to enter reports in the EudraVigilance database. There is a legal requirement for the EMA to set up a repository for Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) and for EMA assessment reports on PSURs in order to facilitate centralized PSUR reporting and to enhance access to data and information, thereby supportingrisk/benefit assessments of medicines. The PSUR Repository achieved full functionality in June 2015 and its use in the EU became mandatory on June 13, 2016. In the US , applications for approval are submitted for review to the FDA, which has broad regulatory powers over all pharmaceutical and biological products that are intended for sale and marketing in the US. To commercialize a product in the US, a new drugapplication (NDA) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, or a Biological License Application (BLA) under the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, must be submitted to the FDA for filing and pre-market review. Specifically, the FDA must decide whether the product is safe and effective for its proposed use; if the benefits of the drug's use outweigh its risks; whether the drug's labeling isadequate; and if the manufacturing of the drug and the controls used for maintaining quality are adequate to preserve the drug'sidentity, strength, quality and purity. Based upon this review, the FDA can require post-approval commitments and requirements.Approval for a new indication of a previously approved product requires submission of a supplemental NDA (sNDA) for a drug or a supplemental BLA (sBLA) for a biological product. Sponsors wishing to market a generic drug can file an Abbreviated NDA (ANDA) under 505(j) of the FD&C Act. These applications are \"abbreviated\" because they are generally not required to includedata to establish safety and effectiveness, but need onlydemonstrate that their product is bioequivalent (i.e. performs in humans in the same manner as the originator's product). Consequently, the length of time and cost required for developmentof generics can be considerably less than for the innovator's drug. The ANDA pathway in the US can only be used for generics of drugs approved under the FD&C Act. The FD&C Act provides another abbreviated option for NDA approved products, which is a hybrid between an NDA and ANDA called the 505(b)(2) pathway. This 505(b)(2) pathway enables a sponsor to rely on the FDA's findings that the reference product is safe and effective, based on the innovator's preclinical and clinical data.The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 46 novel drugs in 2017 (versus 22 in 2016, 45 in 2015, 41 in 2014, and 27 in 2013). Designations and pathways to expedite drug development and review include Fast Track (18/46 =39%), Breakthrough Therapy (17/46 = 37%), Accelerated approval (6/46 = 13%) and Priority Review (28/46 = 61%). Of the 46 novel drugs approved in 2017, 61% were designated in one or moreexpedited categories. CDER identified 15 of the 46 novel drugs approved in 2017 (33%) as First-in-Class, one indicator of the innovative nature of a drug. Approximately 39% of the novel drugs approved in 2017 were approved to treat rare or \"orphan\" diseases that affect200,000 or fewer Americans. In Japan , the regulatory authorities can require local clinical studies, though they also accept multi-national studies. In some cases, bridging studies have been conducted to verify that foreign clinical data are applicable to Japanese patients and obtain data todetermine the appropriateness of the dosages for Japanesepatients. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (J- MHLW) has introduced a new National Health Insurance (NHI) pricing system. Reductions in NHI prices of new drugs every twoyears are compensated by a \"Premium\" for a maximum of 15 years. A \"Premium\" is granted in exchange for the development of unapproved drugs or off-label indications with high medicalneeds. Once an official request for development of an unapproved drug or off-label indication has been made, the pharmaceutical companies must file literature-based reports within six months orsubmit a clinical trial notification for registration within one year after the official development request. For unapproved drugs with high medical needs, clinical trials in Japanese patients are generally required. Otherwise, a fine equivalent to 105% (with 5% representing interest) of sales based on the premium would have to be paid back to the government. To promote the development of innovative drugs and bring them into early practical use in Japan ahead of the world, the Sakigake (a Japanese term meaning \"forerunner\") review designation program was introduced in April 2015. The Pharmaceuticals andMedical Devices Agency (PMDA) will review designated products on a priority basis with the aim of reducing their review time from the normal 12 months to six months. Based on the NHI price system, the \"Premium\" classification will be restricted to new products from companies which conduct R&D on \"pharmaceuticals truly conducive to the improvement of healthcarequality,\" i.e. (i) pediatric/orphan drugs and (ii) drugs to treatdiseases that cannot be adequately controlled with existing drugs. From 2019, all prescription product prices will be reviewed annually instead of once every two years, but price cuts will actually beconducted only for a limited number of products with big gapsbetween their official reimbursement prices and market prices SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 47ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY (e.g. generic drugs and long-listed original products). On the other hand, prices of products that are rapidly adopted after approvals for new indications may from 2017 be reviewed four times a year. The PMDA has set a target for 80% (as opposed to the current 50%) of all applications to be reviewed in 12 months for products with standard review status and in nine months for products with priority review status by the end of 2018. The PMDA also plans to eliminate the \"review lag\" between the filing and approval of drugs and medical devices relative to the FDA by the end of 2020. The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act was implemented on November 25, 2014. There are three major objectives. The first objective is to strengthen safety measures for drugs and medical devices. In particular, MAHs must prepare a package insert based on the latest knowledge and notify the J-MHLW before placing products on the market or when revisions are made. The secondobjective is to accelerate the development of medical devices. The third-party accreditation system will be expanded to specially controlled generic medical devices (i.e. Class III devices).Consequently, the PMDA can accelerate the review of innovativemedical devices. The third objective is accelerated commercialization of regenerative medicinal products. The term \"Regenerative Medicinal Products\" used in the law includes cellular and tissue-based products and gene therapies. This concept is similar to \"Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products\" (ATMPs) in the EU. The law allows for conditional regulatory approval based on confirmation of probable efficacy and safety in small-scale clinical trials, followed up by comprehensive studies to confirm safety and efficacy in a wider population that would thenlead to a regular (full) approval. For new drugs and biosimilar products with approval applications submitted on or after April 2013, Japan has implemented an RMP (Risk Management Plan), similar to the EU Pharmacogivilance system. For generic products, the data necessary for filing are similar to EU and US requirements. Companies only need to submit quality data, and data demonstrating bioequivalence to the originator product,unless the drug is administered intravenously. Clinical Trial Data(CTD) submission for generics has been mandatory since March2017. B.6.3.2. Biosimilars Products can be referred to as \"biologics\" when they are derivedfrom natural sources, including blood products or products manufactured within living cells (such as antibodies). Most biologics are complex molecules or mixtures of molecules whichare difficult to characterize and require physico-chemical-biological testing, and an understanding of and control over the manufacturing process. The concept of \"generics\" is not scientifically appropriate for biologics due to their high level of complexity. Consequently theconcept of \"biosimilar\" products is more appropriate. A fullcomparison of the purity, safety and efficacy of the biosimilar product against the reference biological product should be undertaken, including assessment of physical-chemical-biological, non-clinical and clinical similarity. In the EU , the regulatory framework for developing and evaluating biosimilar products has been in place since 2005. The CHMP has issued several product/disease specific guidelines for biosimilar products including guidance on preclinical and clinical development of biosimilars of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) and ofinsulins. Starting in 2011 and continuing through 2017, the CHMP has been engaged in revising most of the existing biosimilar guidelines (general overarching guidelines, quality, and non-clinicaland clinical product-specific guidelines). While the CHMP has adopted a balanced approach for all biosimilars, allowing evaluation on a case-by-case basis in accordance with relevant biosimilar guidelines, it has also indicatedthat in specific circumstances, a confirmatory clinical trial may notbe necessary. This applies if similar efficacy and safety can clearly be deduced from the similarity of physicochemical characteristics, biological activity/potency, and pharmacokinetic and/orpharmacodynamic profiles of the biosimilar and the reference product. With respect to vaccines, the CHMP currently takes the view that it is at present unlikely that these products can becharacterized at the molecular level, and that each vaccine productmust be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In February 2017, the EMA launched a tailored scientific advice pilot project to support step-by-step development of new biosimilars, based on a review of the quality, analytical and functional data already available. This pilot will encompass sixscientific advice requests. The EMA will analyze the outcome after completing the pilot. In 2017, the EMA and the European Commission published an information guide for healthcare professionals to provide them with reference information on the science and regulation underpinning the use of biosimilar medicines. In the US , the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), signed into law in March 2010, amended the Public Health Service Act to create an abbreviated licensure pathway (351k) for biological products that are demonstrated to be \"biosimilar\" to or \"interchangeable\" with an FDA-licensed biological product. In 2017 the FDA published for consultation two biosimilar draft guidance documents: Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability with a Reference Product and Statistical Approaches to Evaluate Analytical Similarity. As of the date of this annual report nine biosimilar products have been approved by the FDA. Five of those nine products were approved in 2017. To date no biosimilar products have beendeemed interchangeable. 48 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY In Japan , guidelines defining the regulatory approval pathway for follow-on biologics were finalized in March 2009. These guidelines set out the requirements on preclinical, clinical and Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC) data to be considered for thedevelopment of the new application category of biosimilars. Unlike the CHMP guidelines, the main scope of the Japanese guidelines includes recombinant proteins and polypeptides, but notpolysaccharides such as LMWH. Many regulatory authorities worldwide have in place, or are in the process of developing, a regulatory framework for biosimilardevelopment and approval. It should be noted that although many emerging markets are basing their regulations and guidance on WHO or EMA documentation, some markets have approved biosimilars under an existing regulatory framework that is notspecific to biosimilars. B.6.3.3 Regenerative Medicine The US Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) hasestablished the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation program, as authorized in section 3033 of the 21st Century Cures Act. This program aims to facilitate an efficientdevelopment program, expedite review of innovative regenerative medicine therapies, and provide more timely access to potentially life-saving products. Products granted the RMAT designation areeligible for increased early interactions with FDA, including all thebenefits available to breakthrough therapies. As of October 31, 2017, FDA had granted 11 RMAT designations. In 2017, the FDA published two final guidance documents that are part of a comprehensive policy framework to address how the agency plans to support and expedite the development ofregenerative medicine products, including human cells, tissues,and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps). These guidance documents build upon the FDA's risk-based, flexible regulatory framework, and underscore the agency's commitment to help bringnew and innovative treatment options to patients. The firstguidance (Regulatory Considerations for Human Cell, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use) is intended to provide clarity in the determinationof whether HCT/Ps are subject to the FDA's premarket review requirements. The second guidance (Same Surgical Procedure Exception: Questions and Answers Regarding the Scope of theException) is intended to provide clarity as to whether an establishment may qualify for an exception from the requirements under Part 1271 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21by meeting the exception in 21 CFR 1271.15(b). Novel regenerative medicine therapies approved by the CBER in 2017 include the first three gene loss.B.6.3.4. Generics In the EU 20 positive opinions were issued under the centralized procedure for generics in 2017 (versus 16 in 2016 and 21 in 2015). Most of the generics applications for chemical entities use the mutual recognition and decentralized procedures. Pricing systemsfor generics remain at national level in the EU. In the US , to help the FDA ensure that participants in the US generic drug system comply with US quality standards and to increase the likelihood that American consumers get timely access to low cost, high quality generic drugs, the FDA and the industry have jointly agreed to a comprehensive program (Generic DrugUser Fee Amendments) to supplement traditional appropriated funding, focused on safety, access, and transparency. For the period October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017 the FDA planned to review and act on 90% of original ANDA submissionswithin 10 months from the date of submission. For this period, 763 ANDAs were approved, 174 received tentative approval and 1603 complete responses were issued. In Japan , the 2014 reforms to the NHI price system included a new special price reduction rule for long-listed drugs. The rule was introduced in April 2014. It reduced the NHI prices of long-listed drugs whose generic replacement rates are less than 20% fiveyears after their first generics join the NHI price list. Reductions are 2.0% in the first NHI price revision, 1.75% if the substitution rate is 20% or higher but less than 40%, and 1.5% if the rate is 40% orhigher but less than 60%. Under the new price system, NHI prices of first generics (previously set at 60%) were set at 50% of the price of the originator product. A 40% rule is applied to oral first generics once more than ten products with the same ingredients have obtained listing. In addition, a maximum Sakigake premium of 20% was introduced in April 2016 for Sakigake-designated products, which have new mechanisms of action and obtain approval in Japan ahead of the rest of the world. B.6.3.5. Medical Devices In the EU , there is no pre-market authorization by a regulatory authority. Instead there is a Conformity Assessment Procedure(for medium and high risk devices), possibly involving an independent third party \"Notified Body\" (NB) depending on theclassification of the device. Once certified, medical devices have to bear the CE-mark, allowing them to circulate freely in the EU/EFTA (European Free Trade Association) countries and Turkey. To align legal requirements across the EU Member States and to strengthen the protection of public health, two new Regulations came into force in 2017 replacing older EU Directives. Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices came into force on May 26, 2017 with a transition period of three years. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 49ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices came into force on May 26, 2017 with a transition period of five years. In the US , the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for regulating firms that manufacture, repackage, relabel and/or import medical devices sold in theUS. The CDRH also regulates radiation-emitting electronicproducts (medical and non-medical) such as lasers, x-ray systems, ultrasound equipment, microwave ovens and color televisions. Medical devices are classified into Class I, II, and III based on their risks and the regulatory controls necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Regulatory controlincreases from Class I to Class III. The device classificationregulation defines the regulatory requirements for a general device type. Most Class I devices are exempt from Premarket Notification 510(k); most Class II devices require Premarket Notification 510(k);and most Class III devices require Premarket Approval. Low andmoderate risk devices (Class I and II) can also be classified through the de novo pathway if certain conditions are met. The basic regulatory requirements that manufacturers of medical devices distributed in the US must comply with are: Establishment Registration; Medical Device Listing; Premarket Notification Premarket Approval; Investigational DeviceExemption; Quality System Regulation; Labeling Requirements and Medical Device Reporting. B.6.3.6. OTC drugs In the EU , four European centralized prescription to OTC (Rx-to- OTC) switches have occurred since 2009. For nationally authorizedproducts, switches follow national rules for OTC classification. In 2017, a European platform for non-prescription medicines waslaunched to harmonize non-prescription status and to facilitate the switching environment. In the US , the FDA approved one prescription to OTC switch in Sanofi J-MHLW drug safety committee set new rules in 2013 on the details of safety evaluations for drugs newly switched from prescription to OTC, following the passage of a bill to revise the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (PAL). The J-MHLW gives the green light for online sales of such OTC drugs if no safety concerns arise during an initial three-year safety evaluation period. Duringthis three-year evaluation period, drugs that moved from prescription to OTC are categorized as products that requirepharmacist consultations when purchased. Under the new rules, the J-MHLW requires marketing authorization holders to submit interim reports upon completion of their post marketing surveillance (PMS).The PMS needs to cover 3,000 patients for oral drugs and 1,000patients for topical drugs. Based on these interim reports and other reports on adverse events, the J-MHLW performs the first evaluation on whether there are any safety concerns three years after the launch. If no safety concerns are identified during thisthree-year safety evaluation period, the classification of these Rx-to-OTC switches will be downgraded to Category 1 OTC drugs, i.e. drugs which do not require pharmacist consultation and can be sold online. The J-MHLW performs the second safety evaluation one year after the transfer to Category 1 OTC drugs. If no safetyconcerns are identified, the classification of the Category 1 OTC drugs will be downgraded to Category 2 OTC drugs, i.e. drugs thatcan be handled by pharmacists but also by registered salespersons. Generic OTC drugs can be filed after completion of the three-year PMS period and will be approved in seven months . The J-MHLW launched a new panel in April 2016 to pick up Rx-to- OTC switch candidates. Under the new scheme, the MHLW accepts requests for Rx-to-OTC switch candidates from various stakeholders such as medical societies, consumers, and pharmaceutical companies, and then these requests are publicly reviewed by the new panel in order to minimize pressures frommedical societies. Based on its deliberations, the panel refers shortlisted requests to the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council (PAFSC) committee on nonprescription drugs,which effectively makes decisions on marketing approval for OTCs. B.6.3.7. Transparency and public access to documents Transparency regarding regulatory information, clinical trials and associated regulatory decision-making Over the last several years the pharmaceutical industry has been subject to growing pressure for greater transparency about clinical trials (conduct and results). Regulatory authorities are also being pressed for more openness and transparency, for example bymaking more comprehensive disclosures about the rationale and basis of regulatory decisions on medicinal products, so as to enhance the credibility of the regulatory process. This is asignificant driver of the transparency initiatives undertaken inseveral countries. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have committed to publishing protocols, study information and results of clinical studies conducted with their products in publicly accessible registries. Inaddition, both ICH and non-ICH countries often impose mandatory disclosure of clinical trials information. From a regulatory perspective, ambitious initiatives have been undertaken by the major regulatory authorities and Sanofi has processes in place to address these initiatives. EU pharmaceutical legislation for medicinal products requires national regulatory authorities and the EMA to actively publish information concerning authorization and supervision of medicinal 50 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY products. The EMA has introduced a series of initiatives aimed at improving the transparency of its activities, such as improving the format of the European Public Assessment Report and web- published product approvals, withdrawals and rejections. Inaddition, there is an increased focus on comparative efficacy and effectiveness. The new EU pharmacovigilance legislation aims at giving greater transparency, especially with regard tocommunication of safety issues (e.g. public hearings, specific European web portals with information on medicinal products). Finally, patients and consumers are increasingly involved in the work of the EMA's scientific committees. The EMA has committed to continuously extend its approach to transparency. A key goal in this process is the proactive publication of clinical trial data for medicines once the decision-making process on an application for an EU-wide marketing authorization is complete. In 2014, the EMA adopted Policy 70 for publication of clinical trial reports. The policy came into force on January 1, 2015. It applies to clinical reports contained in any new marketing authorization applications for centralized marketing authorizations; to post- authorization procedures for existing centrally authorized medicinalproducts; and to article 58 applications (medicines that are intended exclusively for markets outside the EU). For post-authorization procedures for existing centrally authorized medicinal products, the effective date was July 1, 2015 for extension of indication and line extension applications submitted asof that date. The policy is being implemented in two phases:The first phase concerns the publication of clinical reports only, the data from which will be accessible on the EMA website. In the second phase, the EMA will endeavor to find the most appropriate way to make Individual Patient Data (IPD) available, in compliance with privacy and data protection laws. In order to operationalize EMA Policy 70, Sanofi launched aninternal project to define, develop, implement and control a sustainable process, supported by associated tools and documents, as well as resourcing, training and communication plans to manage clinical documents and data redaction incompliance with Policy 70. In 2016, the EMA Policy 70 process was fully transitioned to the business operational teams. Awareness communication is ongoing not only for currentsubmissions, but also to streamline the process for ongoing andfuture studies. In the US , the FDA launched a Transparency Initiative in June 2009. The objective of the initiative was to render the FDA much more transparent and open to the American public by providing the public with useful, user-friendly information aboutagency activities and decision making.The FDA Transparency Initiative has three phases: Phase I -Improving the understanding of the FDA basics (completed with ongoing updates); Phase II - Improving the FDA's disclosure of information to the public (ongoing); and Phase III - Improving theFDA's transparency to regulated industry (ongoing). Proposals to improve transparency and access to information have been released for consultation for both Phase II and Phase III. Some ofthe less controversial proposals have been implemented; others, such as proactive release of information that the Agency has in its possession, may require revisions to US federal regulations. In September 2016, the US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Health (NIH) published Final Rule under Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) on the Dissemination of ClinicalTrial Information. The Final Rule requires registration and results submission for applicable clinical trials (ACTs); clarifies and expands registration data elements; expands scope of resultsreporting requirements to include trials of unapproved products; clarifies and expands results data elements; and revises Quality Control (QC) and posting process. Additionally, in January 2018, the FDA launched a new pilot program to evaluate whether disclosing certain information included within clinical study reports (\"CSRs\") of approved drugs is beneficial to the public. CSRs are scientific reports prepared by thesponsor to summarily address a drug's efficacy and safety, and include information related to the methods and results of clinical trials supporting the drug. Traditionally, this information has onlybeen released following submission of a Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") request. Under the pilot program, the Agency will continue to protect from disclosure trade secrets and confidential commercial information, as required by law. In Japan , the J-MHLW/PMDA actively publishes information concerning approvals of medicinal products (ethical drugs, nonprescription drugs, and quasi-drugs) and medical devices. For ethical drugs discussed at the J-MHLW's Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council, the redacted clinical trials data modules 1 and 2 (except for commercial confidential informationand personal data) have been made publicly available on the PMDA website. Transparency regarding Health Care Professionals In the EU , there is no harmonized approach regarding transparency for Health Care Professionals (HCPs). Fortransparency purposes, there is increased external scrutiny of interactions between pharmaceutical companies and HCPs atnational level, with legal provisions or healthcare industry voluntary undertakings in some countries (such as the UK, Denmark, France and Portugal). The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Association (EFPIA) released in mid-2013 a Code on Disclosure of Transfers of Value from Pharmaceutical Companies to HCPs and Healthcare SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 51ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON Organizations (HCOs), the \"EFPIA HCP/HCO Disclosure Code\". EFPIA members are required to comply with this Code and transpose it into their national codes. The Code includes stricter rules on hospitality and gifts, with the requirement for member associations to include a threshold on hospitality and the prohibition of gifts in their national codes. In the US , the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or \"Sunshine Act\", was passed as part of the Affordable Care Act. The law is designed to bring transparency to financial relationships between physicians, teaching hospitals, and the pharmaceutical industry.Manufacturers and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) must report certain payments or transfers of value - including payments for research, publication support, travel, honoraria and speaking fees, meals, educational items like textbooks and journal reprints -whether made directly to a physician or teaching hospital or indirectly through a third party. The law also requires manufacturers and GPOs to report physicians or members of theirimmediate family who have an ownership interest in the company.Reports are made to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a government agency. In Japan , the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA) member companies started releasing information on their funding of healthcare professionals in 2013 and patient groups in 2014 under the trade group's voluntary guidelines to boost financialtransparency. Under the JPMA's transparency guidelines for the relations between companies and medical institutions, its members currently report their payments in five categories: R&D , academic research support, manuscript/writing fees, provision of information,and other expenses. B.6.3.8. Other new legislation proposed or pending implementation In the US, in August 2017 the Food and Drug Reauthorization Act (FDARA) was signed into law. The law reauthorized user fee collection for the next five years for drugs (PDUFA VI), devices (MDUFA IV), generics (GDUFA II) and biosimilars (BsUFA II) andreflects a move to a more stable funded program. In addition to user fees, FDARA focuses on modifications and improvements of the regulation of drugs, devices and generics. In China , since the initial programmatic regulatory reform initiative started in 2015, most of the country's regulatory processes have been adapted to bring them into line with other major regulatory agencies. These include establishing predictable pathways and timelines (including conditional approvals); a Marketing Application Holder system; risk-based inspections; and clinical trial processes that allow companies developing innovative drugs to conductclinical trials simultaneously with other countries (InternationalMulticenter Clinical Trials). The China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has also established a system for intellectual property protection.Clinical trial regulation in the EU The Clinical Trial Regulation ((EU) 536/2014) of the EuropeanParliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC, was published in the Official Journal of the EU onMay 28, 2014. Pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers will be required to post the results of all their European clinical trials in a publicly-accessible database. The legislation streamlines the rules on clinical trials across Europe, facilitating cross-border cooperation to enable larger, more reliable trials, as well as trials of products for rare diseases. Itsimplifies reporting procedures, and gives the European Commission the authority to perform audits. Once a clinical trial sponsor has submitted an application dossier to a Member State, the Member State will have to respond to it within fixed deadlines. One of the main objectives of the European Commission in introducing the clinical trial regulation was to simplify the clinical trial approval process. The new legislation was drafted in the morestringent form of a regulation rather than as a directive, so as toachieve better harmonization between countries without interfering with Member States' competencies in terms of ethical issues. The major points are:The timeline for approving a clinical trial proposal is set at 60 days without questions (and a maximum of 99 with questions and clock stops). This can be seen as a setback for the industry,as the Commission's proposal was based on 41 days withoutquestions and a maximum of 74 days including all possible delays. In the case of advanced therapy medicinal products, the timeline can be extended by another 50 days, making 110 days in total. To make both the reference state and the relevant MemberStates comply with the timelines, the legislation includes the concept of tacit approval. The fact that this feature was accepted by all parties can be seen as a positive outcome for the industry. Selection of reference Member State by the sponsor was maintained. As regards transparency requirements for clinical trial data submitted through a single EU submission portal and stored in a Union-level database, the new clinical trial regulation allows for protection of personal data of patients and commercially confidential information, which is in line with the industry datasharing laid out in Policy 70 (see previous section). The new regulation cannot be implemented until the single EU submission portal and database is fully operational. Work on the EUdatabase and portal progressed during 2017, but due to technicaldifficulties with the development of the IT systems the portal's go- live date was postponed. An audit will be carried out in 2018, andthe EMA will provide further information on timelines after the audit. According to an EMA assessment report in 2017, 52 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY development remains in line with a schedule that would allow the EU Clinical Trial Regulation to enter into force in the second half of 2019. Falsified medicines The EU has reformed the rules for importing active substances for medicinal products for human use into the EU (Directive 2011/62/EU). Since January 2013, all imported active substances must have been manufactured in compliance with GMP standardsor standards at least equivalent to GMP. The manufacturing standards in the EU for active substances are those specified in Q7 as issued by the International Council for Harmonization (ICH).With effect from July 2, 2013, such compliance must be confirmedin writing by the competent authority of the exporting country, except for countries with waivers. Written confirmation must alsoconfirm that the plant where the active substance was manufactured is subject to control and enforcement of GMP at least equivalent to that in the EU. Several implementing measures for the Falsified Medicines Directive have been adopted. A common EU logo for online pharmacies was adopted in June 2014, giving Member States untilJuly 2015 to prepare for its application. Detailed rules for the safetyfeatures appearing on the outer packaging of medicinal productsfor human use have been adopted, meaning that all prescription drugs or reimbursed drugs commercialized on the European market will have to be serialized by February 2019. Nagoya Protocol The Nagoya Protocol came into force in October 2014 and isintended to create greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources by: establishing more predictable conditions for access to genetic resources; and helping to ensure benefit-sharing when genetic resources leave the contracting party providing the genetic resources. In the EU, the European Commission published the implementation Act in 2015 (Regulation 2015/1866). It states that the pharmaceutical industry has to implement compliance procedures for non-human biological materials used in the discovery, development, manufacturing and packaging of medicinal products. The Sanofi Nagoya Ready Project was launched in 2015 to ensure compliance with international treaties on the sustainable use of biodiversity. The Nagoya Ready Project Team has ensured that Sanofi is prepared for compliance with the Nagoya Protocol and ready for full implementation. A Nagoya Expert Group reporting tothe Bioethics Committee will continue to monitor the internationalimplementation of the protocol and provide appropriate support and advice to the relevant Sanofi teams.In Japan , the relevant ministries are currently considering local measures for the ratification of the Nagoya Protocol. The schedule for ratification has yet to be determined. The details of local measures for the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol cannot be disclosed due to ongoing discussion, but the relevant ministries are considering a framework where terms and conditions can be set formutual agreement and a consent can be obtained in advance from providers in accordance with laws and regulations in a source country when genetic resources from the source country are usedin Japan. NDA electronic clinical trial data submission (eCTD) In the EU , electronic submission for marketing authorization and variation applications has already been in place for many years. To allow secure submission over the Internet for all types of eCTD applications for human medicines, the EMA launched theeSubmission Gateway, which is now mandatory for all eCTD submissions through the centralized procedure, in order to improve efficiency and decrease costs for applicants. As of July 1, 2015, companies are obliged to use electronic application forms provided by the EMA for all centralized marketing authorization applications for human and veterinary medicines. From January 2016, the use of electronic application forms became mandatory for all other EU marketing authorization procedures (i.e. mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, and national submissions). In Japan , electronic submission of CDISC-based clinical data will become mandatory after the transition period that runs from October 2016 to March 2020, allowing the authority to efficiently store and analyze the data to improve its efficacy and safetypredictions. Such mandatory electronic submissions are expected to be limited to clinical trial data for new drugs newly filed for regulatory approval. The necessity for electronic submission for Phase I trial data will likely be decided on a case-by-case basis, while pharmaceutical companies will be required to file nonclinical toxicitystudy data in one of the Standard for the Exchange on Non clinicalData (SEND) formats in due course. Brexit The United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the EuropeanUnion (\"Brexit\") has triggered a need to adapt regulatory activities in the region. Early in 2017, the EMA established a working group to explore options to (re)distribute across the remaining networkthe workload related to human (and veterinary) medicines and inspections currently managed by the UK. The risk-based methodology leverages the diverse expertise in the network and takes into account the workload associated with the regulation of medicines. The EMA will communicate details of the methodology and next steps in early 2018. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 53ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY The EMA has conducted Industry Stakeholder meetings to discuss the various issues related to Brexit and is continuing to release regulatory and procedural guidance for pharmaceutical companies in order to facilitate preparation for Brexit. To safeguard continuity of operations and secure timely execution of its core tasks, the EMA has launched a Business Continuity Plan (BCP). The BCP defines priority levels for EMA activities accordingto their impact on public health and the ability of the EMA tomanage the tasks in light of the human resources available. Some regulatory activities are already temporarily suspended, or output istemporarily reduced, such as for instance work on the Transparency Policy 70 project. In November 2017, following a predetermined procedure, it wasdecided that the EMA will relocate to Amsterdam in theNetherlands. The EMA's collaboration with the Netherlands commenced promptly and agreement has been reached on a joint governance structure, with plans to progress activities within fivework streams relating to temporary and permanent premises, staffrelocation, financial and legal aspects, and external communication. Sanofi has set up an internal Brexit Task Force to proactively address issues triggered by Brexit. B.6.4. Pricing & Reimbursement Rising overall healthcare costs are leading to efforts to curb drugexpenditures in most markets in which we operate. Increasingly, these efforts result in pricing and market-access controls for pharmaceuticals. The nature and impact of these controls varyfrom country to country, but some common themes are reference pricing, systematic price reductions, formularies, volume limitations, patient co-pay requirements, and generic substitution. In addition,governments and third-party payers are increasingly demandingcomparative/relative effectiveness data to support their decision- making process. They are also increasing their use of emerginghealthcare information technologies such as electronic prescribing and health records to enforce transparency and tight compliance with these regulations and controls. As a result, the environment in which pharmaceutical companies must operate in order to maketheir products available to patients and providers who need them continues to grow more complex each year. While a drive to expand healthcare coverage has become a noticeable feature in many regions, providing opportunities for industry, it has also brought pressure on these new budgets, bringing with it a wave of price and volume control measures. Many countries and regions have increased pressure on pricing throughjoint procurement and negotiation. National production, whether through a policy of industrialization, through technology transfer agreements or through preferential conditions for local production,is equally a growing issue.Significant trends: In the United States there is increased scrutiny on the price of branded pharmaceutical products, and therefore heightened sensitivity to patient exposure to high out-of-pocket expense. Private health insurance is offered widely as part of employee benefit packages, and is the main source of access to subsidized healthcare provision. Some individuals purchase private healthplans directly, while publicly-subsidized programs provide cover forretirees, the poor, the disabled, uninsured children, and serving or retired military personnel. Double-coverage can occur. Public health insurances include: Medicare, which provides health insurance for retirees and for people with permanent disabilities. The basic Medicare scheme (Part A) provides hospital insurance only and the vast majority of retirees purchase additional cover through some or all of three other plans named Part B, Part C and Part D. Part D enables Medicare beneficiaries to obtain outpatient drug subsidies. Almost two-thirds of all Medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in Part D plans. Medicaid, which provides health insurance for those on low incomes. Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) combine the functions of health insurance, delivery of care, and administration. MCOs use specific provider networks and specific services and products.There are three types of managed care plans: Health MaintenanceOrganizations (HMOs), Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), and Point of Service (POS) plans. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) serve as intermediaries between insurance companies, pharmacies and manufacturers to secure lower drug costs for commercial health plans, self-insured employer plans, Medicare Part D plans, and federal and state government employee plans. In the United States, the federal Affordable Care Act has increased the government's role with respect to price, reimbursement, and coverage levels for healthcare services and products within thelarge government healthcare sector. This law also imposed rebates and fees on pharmaceutical companies. Legislation was introduced in over 26 states in 2017 which would require price transparency and reporting of certain manufacturer information. Legislation hasbeen passed in Nevada (requiring detailed reporting to the state on information for all drugs essential for treating diabetes) and in California (requiring advance price notification and detailedinformation for any drugs with a WAC increase of 16% or more over a two year period). This trend will continue into 2018 where we anticipate legislation to be filed in at least 20 states and morelaws to be enacted around the country. US federal and stateofficials, including the Trump administration, are continuing to focus on the cost of health coverage and health care although the future policy, including the nature and timing of any changes to theAffordable Care Act, remains unclear. 54 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY In October 2017, the President signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies to modify how the ACA is implemented and announced the Administration would no longer fund cost sharing subsidies paid to health insurance exchange plans. However,health insurance exchanges remain a minor percentage of the payor mix using branded pharmaceuticals, and so the impact of these changes appears limited. Currently, while there is thepotential for additional disruptions to the ACA exchange markets via administrative or congressional action, full repeal or other wholesale changes to the law appear unlikely in the near term. Drug pricing-related policies continue to be a focus for the government, however, so there is no assurance that additional adverse policy changes could arise. Affordable access for patients is critical to our industry's success; however, the cost of access via third party intermediaries - Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers (PBMs), Health Plans and Government Markets - is calling into question the integrity of thehealthcare system and the sustainability of our business. As the US approached the so-called \"Patent Cliff\" major market insurers realized the traditional business revenue model was threatened and there was an immediate shift to a model that wouldincrease enrollment and cut costs. In recent years mergers and acquisitions have been the largest source of payer revenue growth, as acquired patients translate to increased demand. With a decline in generic conversion and no further scope for consolidation, payers are seeking alternative methods to cut costs. As payers consolidate they can leverage their size and marketshare to demand higher rebates in return for increased access. If a manufacturer is reluctant to offer a higher rebate, the insurer willresort to interventions to enforce formulary controls. As a soft measure to control access, payers use step therapy (to ensure use of low-cost therapies) and prior authorization (to require proof of medical necessity). For example, some US payers have placed significant restrictions on usage of Praluent \u00ae, which has resulted in significant out-of-pocket expenditures for Medicare patients. A more extreme tactic, initially provoked by pharma coupons, is adding a product to an exclusion list; this means that (i) a patient has to pay out of pocket and (ii) manufacturer coupons are rejected at the pharmacy. For example, since 2014, we haveincreased the level of rebates granted for Lantus \u00aein order to maintain favorable formulary positions with key payers in the US. Despite these efforts, in 2016 CVS and UnitedHealthcare (a PBM and MCO, respectively) decided that effective January 1,2017 and April 1, 2017, respectively, Lantus \u00aeand Toujeo\u00aewill be excluded from the formulary across the commercial and MMC (Medicaid Managed Care) template formularies covering approximately 34.7 million people, thus reducing the potentialpatient populations to whom Lantus \u00aemay be prescribed. US insurers have prioritized the need to control costs in specialty categories, and will maximize exclusions and protocols to achievesavings. There is a particular focus on all chronic disease states,which will limit the ability of new entrants to achieve coverage without demonstration of comparative effectiveness. Finally, US insurers are quick to adopt Follow-On-Biologic (copycat) versions of branded drugs as a \"good enough\" alternative to leverage higherrebates as compared with incumbent products. A new approach to copayments was adopted recently by some plans: the copay accumulator programs do not apply manufacturercopay coupons for specialty drugs to the patient's deductible andout-of-pocket maximum, which may lead to an increase in patients' overall costs. In addition, distributors have increased their capacity to negotiate price and other terms as a consequence of the growing number of mergers of retail chains and distributors, resulting consolidation of the distribution channel. In May 2017, Sanofi adopted pricing principles for the US (for more information, please see https://www.sanofi.com/en/our- responsibility/documents-center/ ) The industry in China is going through a transformative period withmany proposals on reform from the government. The first update of the NRDL (National Reimbursement Drug List) since 2009 occurred in 2017 and it has been announced that this will be doneon a more regular basis going forward, to bring innovative medicines to the Chinese market earlier. The CFDA (China Food and Drugs Administration) has also made clear its intent to clearthe backlog of regulatory reviews. Generics manufacturers are incentivized to submit originator bioequivalence data in order toaccess priority tendering, in a drive to modernize the generics industry and change their image as an affordable alternative tobrands. The market itself is also due to transform through a series of smaller measures. For example, a two-invoice policy will simplify the supply chain, and tax reform has reallocated funds to poorerprovinces for healthcare. While these can be viewed as positive, there are many uncertainties. Whatever the outcome, we can expect many other measures in the Chinese market following a callto step up the pace of reforms. Recent trends in European policy have been towards joint procurement and joint negotiations, ignited by the controversy on funding Hepatitis C drugs. At the same time, political uncertainty,especially Brexit negotiations in the UK and tightening evaluation processes (e.g. the dissolution of the pricing committee in favor of an HTA committee in Greece, ultra-orphan drug quality adjustedlife-year (QALY) thresholds and budget thresholds in the UK) are ever-present. However, with an increasing number of innovative products on the horizon, some countries have begun to address this, such as a dedicated budget for innovative medicines in Italyand the Accelerated Access Pathway in the UK. While reforms in Japan were announced, several proposals were delayed until future reviews. However, some significant modificationswere made to the Price Maintenance Premium and to the Foreign Price Adjustment. The final details are currently under preparation. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 55ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY In South America, inflation continues to have a major effect on the sustainability of the industry in the region. Transparent tendering platforms have begun to appear in Colombia and Brazil while joint procurement actions are widening (brought about for HCV andoncology). The Eurasian Economic Union (Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,Kyrgyzstan and Russia) has moved forward with its plans for asingle pharmaceutical market with a centralized system for product registration under a mutual recognition agreement. This shouldfurther streamline processes and also increase the region's negotiating power. We believe that third-party payers will continue to act to curb the cost of pharmaceutical products. While the impact of those measures cannot be predicted with certainty, we are taking thenecessary steps to defend the accessibility and price of our products in order to reflect the value of our innovative product offerings: In compliance with local law we actively engage with our key stakeholders to define criteria for assessing the value of our products to them. These stakeholders, including physicians, patient groups, pharmacists, government authorities and third- party payers, can have a significant impact on market access for our products. We continue to add flexibility and adaptability to our operationsso as to better prepare, diagnose, and address issues in individual markets. Conscious of the importance of recognizing the value of our products and the high cost of research and development, we continue to analyze innovative pricing and access strategies that balance patient access with appropriate rewards for innovation.Specifically, we are involved in risk-sharing agreements with payers, whereby part of the financial risk related to a treatment's success is carried by the marketing company. Those agreementsprovide that clinical efficacy be monitored after launch, for aspecified period of time and patient population. The price and reimbursement level of the drug is then either confirmed or revised based on the post-marketing results. We are also actively testing pilot models for affordability and access to healthcare, allowing wider access to therapies for populations that would otherwise be denied this. B.7. Patents, intellectual property and other rights Patent Protection We own a broad portfolio of patents, patent applications and patent licenses worldwide. These patents are of various types and may cover: active ingredients; pharmaceutical formulations;product manufacturing processes; intermediate chemical compounds; therapeutic indications/methods of use; delivery systems; and enabling technologies, such as assays. Patent protection for individual products typically extends for 20 years from the patent filing date in countries where we seek patent protection. A substantial part of the 20-year life span of a patent on a new molecule (small molecule or biologic) has generally already passed by the time the related product obtains marketing authorization. As a result, the effective period of patentprotection for an approved product's active ingredient issignificantly shorter than 20 years. In some cases, the period of effective protection may be extended by procedures established tocompensate regulatory delay in Europe (via Supplementary Protection Certificate or SPC), in the US (via Patent Term Extension or PTE) and in Japan (also via PTE). Additionally, the product may benefit from the protection of patents obtained during development or after the product's initial marketing authorization. The protection a patent provides to the related product depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage, and may also vary from country to country. In Europe forinstance, applications for new patents may be submitted to the European Patent Office (EPO), an intergovernmental organization which centralizes filing and prosecution. As of December 2017, anEPO patent application may cover the 38 European PatentConvention Member States, including all 28 Member States of the EU. The granted \"European Patent\" establishes corresponding national patents with uniform patent claims among the MemberStates. However, some older patents were not approved through this centralized process, resulting in patents having claim terms for the same invention that differ between the countries. Additionally, anumber of patents prosecuted through the EPO may pre-date the European Patent Convention accession of some current European Patent Convention Member States, resulting in different treatment in those countries. In 2013, EU legislation was adopted to create a European Unitary Patent and a Unified Patent Court. However, it will only enter into force once the agreement on the Unified Patent Court is ratified byat least 13 Member States including France, Germany, and theUnited Kingdom. As of the date of this document, 14 countries including France have ratified the agreement, but ratification by the United Kingdom and Germany is still outstanding, and the processis impacted by Brexit. The Unitary Patent will provide unitary protection within the participating states of the EU (when ratified by the Member States with the exception of Croatia, Spain, and Poland, not currently signatories of the agreement). The Unified Patent Court will be aspecialized patent court with exclusive jurisdiction for litigation relating to European patents and Unitary Patents. The Court will be 56 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY composed of a central division (headquartered in Paris) and several local and regional divisions in the contracting Member States to the agreement. The Court of Appeal will be located in Luxembourg. We monitor our competitors and vigorously seek to challenge patent infringements when such infringements would negatively impact our business objectives. See \"Item 8 - A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information - A.3. Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings - Patents\" of thisannual report. The expiration or loss of a patent covering a new molecule, typically referred to as a compound patent, may result in significant competition from generic products and can result in a dramatic reduction in sales of the original branded product (see \"Item 3. KeyInformation - D. Risk Factors\"). In some cases, it is possible to continue to benefit from a commercial advantage through product manufacturing trade secrets or other types of patents, such aspatents on processes, intermediates, compound structure, formulations, methods of treatment, indications or delivery systems. Certain categories of products, such as traditional vaccines andinsulin, were historically relatively less reliant on patent protection and may in many cases have no patent coverage. It is nowadays increasingly frequent for novel vaccines and insulins also to be patent protected. Finally, patent protection is of comparatively lesser importance to our Consumer Healthcare and generics businesses,which rely principally on trademark protection. Regulatory Exclusivity In some markets, including the EU and the US, many of ourpharmaceutical products may also benefit from multi-year regulatory exclusivity periods, during which a generic competitor may not rely on our clinical trial and safety data in its drugapplication. Exclusivity is meant to encourage investment in research and development by providing innovators with exclusive use, for a limited time, of the innovation represented by a newlyapproved drug product. This exclusivity operates independently of patent protection and may protect the product from generic competition even if there is no patent covering the product. In the US, the FDA will not grant final marketing authorization to a generic competitor for a New Chemical Entity (NCE) until the expiration of the regulatory exclusivity period (five years) that commences upon the first marketing authorization of the reference product. The FDA will accept the filing of an Abbreviated New DrugApplication (ANDA) containing a patent challenge one year before the end of this regulatory exclusivity period (see the descriptions of ANDAs in \"- Product Overview - Challenges to Patented Products\"below). In addition to the regulatory exclusivity granted to NCEs,significant line extensions of existing NCEs may qualify for an additional three years of regulatory exclusivity. Also, under certain limited conditions, it is possible to extend unexpired US regulatoryand patent-related exclusivities by a pediatric extension. See \"- Pediatric Extension\", below.In the US, a different regulatory exclusivity period applies to biological drugs. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (\"BPCIA\"), was enacted on March 23, 2010 as part ofthe Affordable Care Act. The BPCIA introduced an approvalpathway for biosimilar products. A biosimilar product is a biologic product that is highly similar to the reference (or innovator) product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components,and which has no clinically meaningful differences from thereference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. The BPCIA provides that an application for a biosimilar product that relies on a reference product may not be submitted tothe FDA until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed, and that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after the date on which thereference product was first licensed. US Federal and state officials, including the new Administration, are continuing to focus on the cost of health coverage and health care although the future policy,including the nature and timing of any changes to the AffordableCare Act, remains unclear. In the EU, regulatory exclusivity is available in two forms: data exclusivity and marketing exclusivity. Generic drug applications will not be accepted for review until eight years after the first marketing authorization (data exclusivity). This eight-year period is followed by a two-year period during which generics cannot be marketed(marketing exclusivity). The marketing exclusivity period can be extended to three years if, during the first eight-year period, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one ormore new therapeutic indications which are deemed to provide asignificant clinical benefit over existing therapies. This is known as the \"8+2+1\" rule. In Japan, the regulatory exclusivity period varies from four years for medicinal products with new indications, formulations, dosages, or compositions with related prescriptions, to six years for new drugscontaining a medicinal composition, or requiring a new route ofadministration, to eight years for drugs containing a new chemical entity, to ten years for orphan drugs or new drugs requiring pharmaco-epidemiological study. Emerging Markets One of the main limitations on our operations in emerging marketcountries is the lack of effective intellectual property protection or enforcement for our products. The World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of IntellectualProperty Rights (TRIP) required developing countries to amendtheir intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products since January 1, 2005. However, it also provided a limited number of developing countries with anextended period in which to achieve compliance with TRIP. Additionally, these same countries frequently do not provide non-patent exclusivity for innovative products. While the situation has gradually improved, the lack of protection for intellectual property rights or the lack of robust enforcement of intellectual property SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 57ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY rights poses difficulties in certain countries. Additionally, in recent years a number of countries facing health crises have waived or threatened to waive intellectual property protection for specific products, for example through compulsory licensing of generics.See \"Item 3. Key Information - D. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Sanofi's Structure and Strategy - The globalization of our business exposes us to increased risks in specific areas\". Pediatric Extension In the US and the EU, under certain conditions, it is possible toextend a product's regulatory exclusivity for an additional period of time by providing data on pediatric studies. In the US, the FDA may ask a company for pediatric studies if it has determined that information related to the use of the drugs in the pediatric population may produce health benefits. The FDA has invited us by written request to provide additional pediatric data on several of our main products. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, timelyprovision of data meeting the FDA's requirements (regardless of whether the data supports a pediatric indication) may result in theFDA extending regulatory exclusivity and patent life by six months, to the extent these protections have not already expired (the so- called \"pediatric exclusivity\"). In Europe, a regulation on pediatric medicines provides for pediatric research obligations with potential associated rewards including extension of patent protection (for patented medicinal products) and six month regulatory exclusivity for pediatric marketing authorization (for off-patent medicinal products). In Japan, there is no pediatric research extension of patent protection (for patented medicinal products). However, regulatory exclusivity may be extended from eight to ten years. Orphan Drug Exclusivity Orphan drug exclusivity may be granted in the US to drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions (affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the US, or in some cases more than 200,000 with no expectation of recovering costs). Obtaining orphan drug exclusivity is a two step process. An applicant must first seek and obtain orphan drug designation from the FDA for its drug for one or more indications. If the FDA approves a drug for the designated indication, the drug will generally receive orphan drug exclusivity for such designated indication.Orphan drug exclusivity runs from the time of approval and barsapproval of another application (ANDA, 505(b)(2), New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologic License Application (BLA)) from a different sponsor for the same drug in the same indication for a seven year period. Whether a subsequent application is for the\"same\" drug depends upon the chemical and clinical characteristics. The FDA may approve applications for the \"same\" drug for indications not protected by orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivities also exist in the EU and Japan. Product Overview We summarize below the intellectual property coverage (in some cases through licences) in our major markets of the marketed products described above at \"- B.2. Main Pharmaceutical Products\". In the discussion of patents below, we focus on activeingredient patents (compound patents) and for NCEs on any laterfiled patents listed, as applicable, in the FDA's list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the \"Orange Book\") or in their foreign equivalents. For Biologicsthe Orange Book listing does not apply. These patents or their foreign equivalents tend to be the most relevant in the event of anapplication by a competitor to produce a generic or a biosimilar version of one of our products (see \"- Challenges to Patented Products\" below). In some cases, products may also benefit from pending patent applications or from patents not eligible for OrangeBook listing (for NCEs) (e.g. patents claiming industrial processes). In each case below, we specify whether the active ingredient is claimed by an unexpired patent. Where patent terms have beenextended to compensate for US Patent and Trademark Office(USPTO) delays in patent prosecution (Patent Term Adjustment - PTA) or for other regulatory delays, the extended dates are indicated below. The US patent expirations presented below reflectUSPTO dates, and also reflect six month pediatric extensions when applicable. Where patent terms have expired we indicate such information and mention whether generics are on the market. We do not provide later filed patent information relating to formulations already available as an unlicensed generic. References below to patent protection in Europe indicate the existence of relevant patents in most major markets in the EU.Specific situations may vary by country, most notably with respect to older patents and to countries that have only recently joined the EU. 58 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY We additionally set out any regulatory exclusivity from which these products continue to benefit in the US, EU or Japan.

Patents held or licensed by Sanofi do not in all cases provide effective protection against a competitor's generic version of our products. For example, notwithstanding the presence of unexpired patents, competitors launched generic versions of Allegra\u00aein the US (prior to the product being switched to over-the-counter status) and Plavix\u00aein the EU. We caution the reader that there can be no assurance that we willprevail when we assert a patent in litigation and that there may be instances in which Sanofi determines that it does not have a sufficient basis to assert one or more of the patents mentioned inthis report, for example in cases where a competitor proposes a formulation not appearing to fall within the claims of our formulation patent, a salt or crystalline form not claimed by our composition ofmatter patent, or an indication not covered by our method of use patent. See \"Item 3. Key Information - D. Risk Factors - RisksRelating to Legal and Regulatory Matters - We rely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our products, and if such patents and other rights were limited or circumvented, our financial results could be materiallyand adversely affected\". As disclosed in Item 8 of this annual report, we are involved in significant litigation concerning the patent protection of a number of our products. Challenges to Patented Products Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) In the US, companies have filed Abbreviated New DrugApplications (ANDAs), containing challenges to patents related to a number of our products. An ANDA is an application by a drug manufacturer to receive authority to market a generic version ofanother company's approved product, by demonstrating that the purportedly generic version has the same properties as the originalapproved product. ANDAs may not be filed with respect to drugs licensed as a biological. See \"- B.6.3. Regulatory Framework - B.6.3.2. Biosimilars\" above. An ANDA relies on the safety and other technical data of the original approved product, and does not generally require the generic manufacturer to conduct clinical trials(thus the name \"abbreviated\" new drug application), presenting a significant benefit in terms of time and cost. As a result of regulatory protection of our safety and other technical data, theANDA may generally be filed only five years after the initialUS original product marketing authorization. See \"- Regulatory Exclusivity\" above. This period can be reduced to four years if the ANDA includes a challenge to a patent listed in the FDA's OrangeBook. However, in such a case if the patent holder or licensee brings suit in response to the patent challenge within the statutory window, then the FDA is barred from granting final approval to anANDA during the 30 months following the patent challenge (this bar is referred to in our industry as a \"30-month stay\"), unless, beforethe end of the 30 months, a court decision or settlement has determined either that the ANDA does not infringe the listed patentor that the listed patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. FDA approval of an ANDA after this 30-month period does not resolve outstanding patent disputes, but it does remove the regulatory impediments to a product launch by a generic manufacturer willing to take the risk of later being ordered to pay damages to the patent holder. The accelerated ANDA-type procedures are potentially applicable to many, but not all, of the products we manufacture. See \"- B.6.3. Regulatory Framework - 6.3.2. Biosimilars\" and \"- Regulation\" above. We seek to defend our patent rights vigorously in thesecases. Success or failure in the assertion of a given patent against a competing product is not necessarily predictive of the future success or failure in the assertion of the same patent - ora fortiorithe corresponding foreign patent - against another competing product due to factors such as possible differences in the 62 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY formulations of the competing products, intervening developments in law or jurisprudence, local variations in the patents and differences in national patent law and legal systems. See \"Item 3. Key Information - D. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Legal andRegulatory Matters - We rely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our products, and if such patents and other rights were limited or circumvented,our financial results could be materially and adversely affected\". Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications in the US Our products and patents are also subject to challenge by competitors via another abbreviated approval pathway, under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.This provision expressly permits an applicant to rely, at least in part, on the FDA's prior findings of safety and effectiveness of adrug that has obtained FDA approval. The FDA may still require applicants to provide additional preclinical or clinical data to ensure that differences from the reference drug do not compromise safetyand effectiveness. This pathway allows for approval for a widerange of products, especially for those products that represent only a limited change from an existing approved drug. The 505(b)(2) pathway is distinct from the ANDA pathway, which allows forapproval of a generic product based on a showing that it is equivalent to a previously approved product. A 505(b)(2) applicant is required to identify the reference drug on which it relies, as well as to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the referenced product in the Orange Book.Specifically, the applicant must certify in the application that, foreach patent that claims the drug or a use of the drug for which the applicant is seeking approval: there is no patent information listed for the reference drug (paragraph I certification); the listed patent has expired for the reference drug (paragraph II certification); the listed patent for the reference drug has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration (paragraph III certification); or the listed patent for the reference drug is invalid, unenforceable,or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the product for which the 505(b)(2) NDA is submitted (paragraph IV certification). A paragraph III certification may delay the approval of an application until the expiration of the patent. A paragraph IV certification generally requires notification of the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the referenced product. If the patent owner or NDA holder brings patent litigation against the applicantwithin the statutory window, a 30-month stay is entered on the FDA's ability to grant final approval to the 505(b)(2) applicantunless, before the end of the stay, a court decision or settlement determines the listed patent is invalid, not enforceable, and/or not infringed. A 505(b)(2) application may also be subject to non-patentexclusivity, and the FDA may be prohibited from giving finalapproval to a 505(b)(2) application until the expiration of all applicable non-patent exclusivity periods. In the EU, a generic drug manufacturer may only reference the data of the regulatory file for the original approved product after data exclusivity has expired. However, there is no patent listingsystem in Europe comparable to the Orange Book, which wouldallow the patent holder to prevent the competent authorities from granting marketing authorization by bringing patent infringement litigation prior to approval. As a result, generic products may be approved for marketing following the expiration of marketingexclusivity without regard to the patent holder's rights. Nevertheless, in most of these jurisdictions once the competingproduct is launched, and in some jurisdictions even prior to launch(once launch is imminent), the patent holder may seek an injunction against such marketing if it believes its patents are infringed. See Item 8 of this annual report. Trademarks Our products are sold around the world under trademarks that weconsider to be of material importance in the aggregate. Our trademarks help to identify our products and to protect the sustainability of our growth. Trademarks are particularly importantto the commercial success of CHC and generics. It is our policy to protect and register our trademarks with a strategy adapted to each product or service depending on the countries where they are commercialized: on a worldwide basis for worldwide products or services, or on a regional or local basis for regional or local products or services. The process and degree of trademark protection vary country by country, as each country applies its own trademark laws and regulations. In most countries, trademark rights may only beobtained through formal trademark application and registration. Insome countries, trademark protection can be based primarily onuse. Registrations are granted for a fixed term (in most cases ten years) and are renewable indefinitely, except in some countries where maintenance of the trademarks is subject to theireffective use. When trademark protection is based on use, it covers the products and services for which the trademark is used. When trademark protection is based on registration, it covers only the products and services designated in the registration certificate. Additionally, in certain cases, we may enter into a coexistence agreement with athird party that owns potentially conflicting rights in order to avoidany risk of confusion and better protect and defend our trademarks. Our trademarks are monitored and defended based on this policy and in order to prevent counterfeit, infringement and/or unfair competition. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 63ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY B.8. Production and Raw Materials Our policy is to manufacture the majority of our products in-house. There are three principal stages in our production process: the manufacture of pharmaceutical active ingredients, the transformation of those ingredients into drug products, andpackaging those products. Our general policy is to produce the majority of our active ingredients and principal drug products at our own plants in order to reduce our dependence on external suppliers. In some cases, however, we rely on third parties for the manufacture and supply of certain active ingredients, drug products and medical devices.Active ingredients are manufactured using raw materials sourced from suppliers who have been subject to rigorous selection and approval procedures, in accordance with international standards and our own internal directives. We have outsourced some of ourproduction under supply contracts associated with acquisitions ofproducts or businesses or with plant divestitures, or to establish a local presence to capitalize on growth in emerging markets. Our pharmaceutical subcontractors follow our general quality andlogistics policies, as well as meeting other criteria. See ''Item 3. Key Information - D. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business''. At the start of 2017 we launched our \"Global External Manufacturing\" team, to enhance the way we manage relations with our third-party suppliers. We also obtain active ingredients from third parties under collaboration agreements. This applies to the monoclonal antibodies developed with Regeneron. Our pharmaceutical production sites are divided into three categories: global sites, which serve all markets: located mainly in Europe, these facilities are dedicated to the manufacture of our active ingredients, injectable drug products, and a number of our mainsolid-form drug products; regional sites, which serve markets at regional level, in Europeand particularly the BRIC-M countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and Mexico), giving us a strong industrial presence in emerging markets; and local sites, which serve their domestic market only. Sanofi Pasteur produces vaccines at sites located in the United States, Canada, France, Mexico, China, Thailand, Argentina andIndia. The pharmaceutical site at Le Trait (France) also contributes to Sanofi Pasteur's industrial operations by making available its aseptic filling facilities. All of our production facilities are good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliant, in line with international regulations.Our principal sites are approved by the FDA: the Biologics facilities in the United States (Allston, Framingham and Northborough), France (Lyon Gerland) and Belgium (Geel); the Injectables facilities in France (Le Trait, Maisons-Alfort), Italy (Anagni), Ireland (Waterford), Germany (Frankfurt) and the United States (Ridgefield); the Pharmaceuticals facilities in France (Ambar\u00e8s and Tours), the United Kingdom (Haverhill and Holmes Chapel), and the United States (Saint Louis); the Consumer Healthcare facilities in France (Compi\u00e8gne), and the United States (Chattanooga); and the Vaccines facilities in France (Marcy l'\u00c9toile and Le Trait which handle filling and packaging of Fluzone\u00aeID for the US market), the United States (Swiftwater), and Canada (Toronto). Wherever possible, we seek to have multiple plants approved forthe production of key active ingredients and our strategic finished products (this is the case with Lovenox\u00ae, for example). In May 2010, Genzyme's Allston facility in the United States entered into a consent decree with the FDA following FDA inspections at the facility that resulted in observations and a warning letter raising Current Good Manufacturing Practices(CGMP) deficiencies. A consent decree is a court order entered into by agreement between a company and the government (in this case the FDA) that requires the company to take certain actions asset out in the decree. Under the terms of the consent decree, the Sanofi Genzyme facility at Allston was permitted to continuemanufacturing during the remediation process subject to compliance with the terms of the consent decree. The consent decree required Sanofi Genzyme to implement a plan to bring operations at the Allston facility into compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The plan had to address alldeficiencies reported to Genzyme or identified as part of an inspection completed by a third-party expert in February 2011. This workplan was submitted to the FDA in April 2011 and accepted bythe FDA in January 2012. Modifications to the remediation workplan were accepted by the FDA in March 2012 and April 2015. The workplan was completed on March 31, 2016. The next step was a third-party certification process, which was finalized on June 30, 2017. In August 2017, the FDA conducted an inspectionof the facility and delivered a favorable conclusion, following whichcertification was received on October 4, 2017. The Allston facility is required to engage a third-party expert to audit its manufacturing operations for an additional period of at least five years. More details about our manufacturing sites are given below at section ''D. Property, Plant and Equipment''. 64 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY B.9. Insurance and Risk Coverage We are protected by four key insurance programs, relying not only on the traditional corporate insurance and reinsurance market but also on our captive insurance company, Carraig Insurance DAC (Carraig). These four key programs cover Property & Business Interruption, General & Product Liability, Stock and Transit, and Directors & Officers Liability. Carraig participates in our coverage for various lines of insurance including Property & Business Interruption, Stock and Transit, and General & Product Liability. Carraig is run under the supervision of the Irish regulatory authorities, is wholly-owned by Sanofi, and has sufficient resources to meet those portions of our risks that it has agreed to cover. It sets premiums for our entities at market rates. Claims are assessed using the traditional models applied by insurance and reinsurance companies, and the company's reserves are regularly verified and confirmed by independent actuaries. Our Property & Business Interruption program covers all our entities worldwide, wherever it is possible to use a centralized program operated by our captive insurance company. Thisapproach shares risk between our entities, enabling us to setdeductibles and guarantees that are appropriate to the needs oflocal entities. It also incorporates a prevention program, including a comprehensive site visit program covering our production, storage, research and distribution facilities and standardized repair andmaintenance procedures across all sites. Specialist site visits are conducted every year to address specific needs, such as testing of sprinkler systems or emergency plans to deal with flooding risks. The Stock and Transit program protects all goods owned by Sanofi while they are in transit nationally or internationally whatever the means of transport, and all our inventories wherever they are located. Sharing risk between our entities means that we can setdeductibles at appropriate levels, for instance differentiating between goods that require temperature controlled distribution and those that do not. We have developed a prevention program withassistance from experts, implementing best practices in this area at our distribution sites. This program, which is led by our captive insurance company, has substantial capacity, largely to deal withthe growth in sea freight which can lead to a concentration of value in a single ship. Our General & Product Liability program was renewed in 2017 for all our subsidiaries worldwide wherever it was possible to do so, despite the increasing reluctance in the insurance and reinsurance market to cover product liability risks for large pharmaceutical groups. For several years, insurers have been reducing productliability cover because of the difficulty of insuring some products that have been subject to numerous claims. These products areexcluded from the cover provided by insurers, and hence from the cover obtained by us on the insurance market. This applies to afew of our products, principally those described in Note D.22.a)to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 in this annual report. Because of these market conditions we haveincreased, year by year, the extent to which we self-insure. The principal risk exposure for our pharmaceutical products is covered with low deductibles at country level, the greatest level of risk being retained by our captive insurance company. The level of risk self-insured by Sanofi - including via our captive reinsurance company - enables us to retain control over the management and prevention of risk. Our negotiations with third-party insurers andreinsurers are tailored to our specific risks. In particular, they allowfor differential treatment of products in the development phase, for the discrepancies in risk exposure between European countriesand the United States, and for specific issues arising in certain jurisdictions such as generics coverage in the United States. Coverage is adjusted every year in order to take into account the relative weight of new product liability risks, such asthose relating to rare diseases with very low exposure or to healthcare products which do not require marketing approval. Our cover for risks that are not specific to the pharmaceutical industry (general liability) is designed to address the potential impacts of our operations. For all lines of business of Carraig, outstanding claims are covered by provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but not paid at the balance sheet date, whether reported or not, together with all related claims handling expenses. Where there is sufficient data history from Sanofi or from the market for claimsmade and settled, management - with assistance from independent actuaries - prepares an actuarial estimate of the company's exposure to unreported claims for the risks covered.The actuaries perform an actuarial valuation of the company's IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) and ALAE (Allocated LossAdjustment Expense) liabilities at year end. Two ultimate loss projections (based upon reported losses and paid lossesrespectively) are computed each year using the Bornhuetter- Ferguson method; these projections form the basis for the provisions set. The Directors & Officers Liability program protects all legal entities under our control, and their directors and officers. Our captive insurance company is not involved in this program. We also operate other insurance programs, but these are of much lesser importance than those described above. All our insurance programs are backed by best in class insurersand reinsurers and are designed in such a way that we can integrate most newly acquired businesses on a continuous basis. Our cover has been designed to reflect our risk profile and the capacity available in the insurance market. By centralizing ourmajor programs, we are able to provide world-class protectionwhile reducing costs. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 65ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY B.10. Health, Safety and Environment Our manufacturing and research operations are subject to increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental (HSE) laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and rapidly changing, and Sanofi invests the necessary sums in orderto comply with them. This investment, which aims to respect health,safety and the environment, varies from year to year. Applicable environmental laws and regulations may require us to eliminate or reduce the effects of chemical substance discharge at our various sites. The sites in question may belong to Sanofi, and may be currently operational, or may have been owned oroperational in the past. In this regard, Sanofi may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on, under or in the sites concerned, or on sites where waste from activities has been stored, without regard to whether the owner oroperator knew of or under certain circumstances caused thepresence of the contaminants, or at the time site operations occurred the discharge of those substances was authorized. As is the case for a number of companies in the pharmaceutical, chemical and intense agrochemical industries, soil and groundwater contamination has occurred at some of our sites in thepast, and may still occur or be discovered at others. In Sanofi'scase, such sites are mainly located in the United States, Germany, France, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Italy and the United Kingdom. As part of a program of environmental surveysconducted over the last few years, detailed assessments of the riskof soil and groundwater contamination have been carried out at current and former Sanofi sites. In cooperation with national and local authorities, Sanofi regularly assesses the rehabilitation workrequired and carries out such work when appropriate. Long-term rehabilitation work is in progress or planned in Mount Pleasant, East Palo Alto and Portland in the United States; Barceloneta in Puerto Rico; a number of sites divested to third parties and covered by contractual environmental guarantees granted by Sanofi. We may also have potential liability for investigation and cleanup at several other sites. We have established provisions for the sites already identified and to cover contractual guarantees forenvironmental liabilities for sites that have been divested. In Francespecifically, we have provided the financial guarantees for environmental protection required under French regulations. Potential environmental contingencies arising from certain business divestitures are described in Note D.22.d to the consolidated financial statements. In 2017, Sanofi spent\u20ac67 million on rehabilitating sites previously contaminated by soil or groundwater pollution. Due to changes in environmental regulations governing site remediation, our provisions for remediation obligations may not beadequate due to the multiple factors involved, such as the complexity of operational or previously operational sites, the nature of claims received, the rehabilitation techniques involved, theplanned timetable for rehabilitation, and the outcome of discussionswith national regulatory authorities or other potentially responsible parties, as in the case of multiparty sites. Given the long industrial history of some of our sites and the legacy obligations arising fromthe past involvement of Aventis in the chemical and agrochemicalindustries, it is impossible to quantify the future impact of these laws and regulations with precision. See \"Item 3.D. Risk Factors - Environmental Risks of Our Industrial Activities\". We have established, in accordance with our current knowledge and projections, provisions for cases already identified and to cover contractual guarantees for environmental liabilities relating to sites that have been divested. In accordance with Sanofi standards, a comprehensive review is carried out once a year on the legacy of environmental pollution. In light of data collected during this review,we adjusted our provisions to approximately \u20ac685 million as of December 31, 2017 versus\u20ac732 million as of December 31, 2016. The terms of certain business divestitures, and the environmental obligations and retained environmental liabilities relating thereto aredescribed in Note D.22. to our consolidated financial statements. To our knowledge, Sanofi did not incur any liability in 2017 for non- compliance with current HSE laws and regulations that could be expected to significantly jeopardize its activities, financial situation or operating income. We also believe that we are in substantial compliance with current HSE laws and regulations and that all theenvironmental permits required to operate our facilities have beenobtained. Regular HSE audits are carried out by Sanofi in order to assess compliance with standards (which implies compliance with regulations) and to initiate corrective measures (47 internal auditsperformed by 85 auditors in 2017). Moreover, around 200 specific visits were performed jointly with experts representing our insurers. Sanofi has implemented a worldwide master policy on health, safety and environment to promote the health and well-being of the employees and contractors working on its sites and respect for theenvironment. We consider this master policy to be an integral partof our commitment to social responsibility. In order to implement this master policy, Sanofi key requirements have been drawn up in the key fields of HSE management, HSE leadership, safety in theworkplace, process safety, occupational hygiene, health in the workplace and protection of the environment. Health From the development of compounds to the commercial launch of new drugs, Sanofi research scientists continuously assess the effect of products on human health. This expertise is made available to employees through two committees responsible forchemical and biological risk assessment. Sanofi's COVALISCommittee is responsible for the hazard determination and 66 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY classification of all active pharmaceutical ingredients and synthesis intermediates handled at Sanofi facilities. This covers all active ingredients handled in production at company sites or in processes sub-contracted for manufacture. Any important issues involving rawmaterials or other substances that lack established occupational exposure limits may also be reviewed. The COVALIS Committee determines the occupational exposure limits required within Sanofi.Our TRIBIO Committee is responsible for classifying all biological agents according to their degree of pathogenicity, and applies rules for their containment and the preventive measures to be respected throughout Sanofi. See \"Item 3. Key Information - D. Risk Factors - Environmental Risks of Our Industrial Activities - Risks from the handling of hazardous materials could adversely affect our results of operations\". Appropriate occupational hygiene practices and programs are defined and implemented in each site. These practices consist essentially of containment measures for collective and individual protection against exposure in all workplaces where chemical substances or biological agents are handled. All personnel are monitored with an appropriate medical surveillance program, basedon the results of professional risk evaluations linked to their duties. In addition, dedicated resources have been created to implement the EU Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). To fully comply with the new European Regulation on Classification, Labeling and Packaging of chemicals, Sanofi has registered the relevant hazardous chemical substances with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). Safety Sanofi has rigorous policies to identify and evaluate safety risksand to develop preventive safety measures, and methods for checking their efficacy. Additionally, Sanofi invests in training that is designed to instill in all employees a sense of concern for safety,regardless of their duties. These policies are implemented on a worldwide scale to ensure the safety of all employees and to protect their health. Each project, whether in research,development or manufacturing, is subject to evaluation procedures, incorporating the chemical substance and process data communicated by the COVALIS and TRIBIO Committees described above. The preventive measures are designed primarily to reduce the number and seriousness of work accidents and to minimize exposures involving permanent and temporary Sanofi employees as well as our sub-contractors. The French chemical manufacturing sites in Aramon, Sisteron and Vertolaye, as well as the plants located in the Hoechst Industry Park in Frankfurt, Germany, and the chemical production site in Budapest, Hungary, are listed Seveso III (from the name of theEuropean directive that deals with potentially dangerous sites through a list of activities and substances associated with classification thresholds). In accordance with French law ontechnological risk prevention, the French sites are also subject toheightened security inspections due to the toxic or flammable materials stored on the sites and used in the operating processes. Risk assessments of processes and installations are drawn upaccording to standards and internal guidelines incorporating the best state of the art benchmarks for the industry. Theseassessments are used to fulfill regulatory requirements and are regularly updated. Particular attention is paid to any risk-generatingchanges such as process or installation changes, as well as changes in production scale and transfers between industrial or research units. We have specialized process safety-testing laboratories that are fully integrated into our chemical development activities, apply methods to obtain the physico-chemical parameters of manufactured chemical substances (intermediate chemicalcompounds and active ingredients) and apply models to measure the effect of potentially leachable substances in the event of a major accident. In these laboratories the parameters for qualifyinghazardous reactions are also determined, in order to define scale- up process conditions while transferring from development stage to industrial scale. All these data ensure that our risk assessmentsare relevant. We believe that the safety management systems implemented at each site, the hazard studies carried out and the risk management methods implemented, as well as our third-party property insurance policies covering any third-party physical damage, are consistent with legal requirements and the best practices in the industry. Environment We have committed to an ambitious policy aimed at limiting thedirect and indirect impacts of our activities on the environment, throughout the life cycle of our products. We have identified five major environmental challenges relating to our businesses:greenhouse gas emissions and climate disruption; water; pharmaceuticals in the environment; waste; and biodiversity. The initiatives already implemented since 2010 are continuing, and we have been keen to give them fresh impetus through the Planet Mobilization program. Reflecting our environment strategy out to 2025, the program sets more ambitious targets for reducingenvironmental impacts across the entire value chain. Planet Mobilization is a global project that involves all of the Company's resources in defining objectives and engaging with external partners. Compared with 2015 figures, we are undertaking to halve our carbon emissions by the end of 2025 and reach carbon-neutral status by 2050 on our scope 1 & 2 (industrial, R&D and tertiary sites, including the medical rep fleet). We have also set ourselves the target of achieving sustainable water resource management, especially at sites which are under hydric stress. On this new scope, by the end of 2017, we had reduced CO2emissions by 7% and water consumption by 6%. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 67ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY Overall waste recycling at sites is already above 72% and is expected to be more than 90% by the end of 2025. The discharge rate had dropped to 8% at the end of 2017 and we have committed to move towards a maximum of 1% by 2025. Biodiversitymanagement at sites is also a priority, with the aim of making all employees aware of this challenge and implementing risk assessment and management plans at priority sites. Finally, we are pursuing the policy we began in 2010 of managingpharmaceutical products in the environment throughout their life cycles. At the end of 2017, all priority chemical sites had beenevaluated and were shown to present no risk to the environment.The assessment program was extended to other sites, starting with the pharmaceutical production sites. In 2017, eight sites implemented the program.In line with this approach, we have committed to the \"Roadmap AMR 2020\" initiative, which aims to combat microbial resistance to antibiotics. The initiative brings together thirteen of the major players in the pharmaceutical industry, and will involve co-producing reference guides and methodologies for sustainable management of antibiotics in the pharmaceutical sector. The initiative includes a specific commitment with respect to antibioticproduction sites that are operated by signatories or their suppliers, involving firstly the definition and deployment of a shared framework for managing potential waste, and secondly theestablishment of environmental thresholds. (See \"Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements\") C/ Organizational Structure C.1. Significant Subsidiaries Sanofi is the holding company of a consolidated group consisting of over 300 companies. The table below sets forth our significant subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017.

The financial effects of this transaction are presented in Note D.1. to our consolidated financial statements,included at Item 18 of this annual report on Form 20 F. At the end of December 2016, Sanofi Pasteur and MSD (known as Merck in the United States and Canada) ended their Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture. The financial effects of the resulting divestment/ acquisition are presented in Note D.1.2. to our consolidated 68 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, included in our annual report on Form 20-F for that year. In certain countries, we carry on some of our business operations through joint ventures with local partners. In addition, we have entered into worldwide collaboration agreements (i) with Regeneron, relating to Zaltrap\u00ae, human therapeutic antibodies such as Praluent\u00aeand antibodies in immunology such as Dupixent\u00aeand Kevzara\u00ae; and (ii) with BMS, relating to Plavix\u00ae. For further information, refer to Note C. to our consolidated financialstatements, \"Principal Alliances\". C.2. Internal Organization of Activities Sanofi and its subsidiaries collectively form a group organized around three activities: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Human Vaccines (Vaccines). During 2017, Sanofi gradually integrated the Consumer Healthcare operations of Boehringer Ingelheim (BI), acquired on January 1, 2017. Following the completion of the integration process andeffective December 31, 2017, Consumer Healthcare businessforms a distinct operating segment. Within Sanofi, responsibility for research and development ( R&D ) in their respective fields rests with Sanofi SA and Genzyme Corporation in Pharmaceuticals, and with Sanofi Pasteur and Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. in Vaccines. However, within our integrated R&D organization, strategic priorities are set and R&D efforts coordinated on a worldwide scale. In fulfilling their role in R&D , the aforementioned companies subcontract R&D to those of their subsidiaries that have the necessary resources. They also licensepatents, manufacturing know-how and trademarks to certain oftheir French and foreign subsidiaries. Those licensee subsidiaries manufacture and distribute the majority of our products, either directly or via local distribution entities. Our industrial property rights, patents and trademarks are mainly held by the following companies: Pharmaceuticals: and Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. (US). For a description of our principal items of property, plant andequipment, see \"- D. Property, Plant and Equipment\" below. Our property, plant and equipment is held mainly by the followingcompanies: in Genzyme Ireland Limited. C.3. Financing and Financial Relationships between Group Companies The Sanofi parent company raises the bulk of the Company's external financing and uses the funds raised to meet, directly or indirectly, the financing needs of its subsidiaries. The parent company operates a cash pooling arrangement under which anysurplus cash held by subsidiaries is managed centrally. There is also a centralized foreign exchange risk management system in place, whereby the parent company contracts hedges to meet theneeds of its principal subsidiaries. Consequently, at December 31, 2017, the Sanofi parent company held 94% of our external financing and 89% of our surplus cash. Sanofi European Treasury Center SA (SETC), a 100%-ownedSanofi subsidiary incorporated in 2012 under the laws of Belgium, is dedicated to providing financing and various financial services toour subsidiaries. D/ Property, Plant and Equipment D.1. Overview Our headquarters are located in Paris, France. See \"- D.4 OfficeSpace\" below. We operate our business through office premises and research, production and logistics facilities in approximately 100 countries around the world.

INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY We own most of our research &development and production facilities, either freehold or under finance leases with a purchase option exercisable on expiration of the lease. D.2. Description of Our Sites Sanofi industrial sites As part of the process of transforming Sanofi and creating Global Business Units, we are continuing to adapt the organization of the Industrial Affairs department in support of our new business model. Since June 2013, the Industrial Affairs department has beenresponsible for all production and quality operations within Sanofi. The department focuses on customer needs and service quality, the sharing of \"Sanofi Manufacturing System\" manufacturingpractices, the development of a common culture committed to quality and the pooling of expertise within technology platforms, particularly in biological, injectable and pharmaceutical products.Since January 2016, the Industrial Affairs department has alsobeen responsible for Sanofi Global HSE and Global Supply Chain. At the end of 2017, we were carrying out industrial production at 79 sites in 36 countries: 8 sites for our Biologics operations; 9 sites for our Injectables operations; 37 sites for our Pharmaceuticals operations; 14 sites for our Consumer Healthcare operations; 11 sites for the industrial operations of Sanofi Pasteur in vaccines. In 2017, we produced the following 4,738 million packaged only: 320 bulk equivalents: 379 million; outsourced units: 976 million; and Vaccines: 470 million containers (syringes and ampoules) filled, including outsourced production. We believe that our production facilities are in compliance with all regulatory requirements, are properly maintained and are generally suitable for future needs. Nonetheless, we regularly inspect and evaluate those facilities with regard to environmental, health, safety and security matters, quality compliance and capacity utilization.For more information about our property, plant and equipment, see Note D.3 to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of this annual report, and section \"B.8 Production and RawMaterials\" above.Production of biological, chemical and pharmaceutical products is the responsibility of our Industrial Affairs department, which is also in charge of most of our logistics facilities (distribution and storage centers). Major drugs, active ingredients, specialties and medical devices are manufactured at the following sites: and Production sites: Consumer Healthcare Major drugs for our Consumer Healthcare portfolio are manufactured at the following River.Sanofi Pasteur also has its own R&D and production sites, either freehold or under finance leases with a purchase option exercisable on expiration of the lease. Research & Development sites In Pharmaceuticals, research and development activities areconducted at the following sites: six operational sites Marcy l'Etoile, Montpellier, Strasbourg, and Vitry/ Alfortville; two sites in the rest of Europe (Germany and the Netherlands), the larger of which is in Frankfurt (Germany); four sites in the United States, the Bridgewater, Cambridge,Framingham/Waltham and Great Valley sites; and in Asia, three sites in China ( Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu) and a clinical research unit in Japan. Vaccines research and development sites are: United States: Toronto. D.3. Acquisitions, capital expenditures and divestitures The carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2017 was\u20ac9 579 million. During 2017, we invested \u20ac1,394 million (see Note D.3. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of this annual report), mainly inincreasing capacity and improving productivity at our various production and R&D sites. Our principal acquisitions, capital expenditures and divestitures in 2015, 2016 and 2017 are described in Notes D.2. (\"Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation\"), D.3. (\"Property, plant and equipment\") and D.4. (\"Goodwill and other intangible assets\") to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of thisannual report. As of December 31, 2017, our firm commitments in respect of future capital expenditures amounted to \u20ac508 million. The principal locations involved were: for the Pharmaceuticals segment, the industrial facilities at Frankfurt (Germany), Framingham and Allston (United States), Geel (Belgium), Cambridge (United States), Le Trait (France) and Vitry (France); and for the Vaccines segment, the facilities at Swiftwater (United States), Toronto (Canada) andMarcy L'\u00c9toile (France). In the medium term and assuming no changes in the scope of consolidation, we expect to invest on average some \u20ac1.7 billion a year in property, plant and equipment. We believe that our own cash resources and the undrawn portion of our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund these expenditures. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 71ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY Our principal ongoing investments are described below. Biologics In 2014, a dedicated Biologics platform was launched to develop synergies between Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi Pasteur, Sanofi Genzyme and our Biotherapeutics operations. This platform is helping us extend our footprint in biotechnologies by adopting amulti-disciplinary approach and improving capacity utilization. Italso enables us to leverage our expertise in the production of biologics, from active ingredient to integrated manufacturing, including both the medicine itself and associated medical devices. Three dedicated biotechnology hubs have been developed: Paris/ Lyon (France), Frankfurt (Germany) and Boston (United States). Piloting this technology, which relies on cell or microbiologicalculture or the development of viral vectors, calls for highly specific knowledge and expertise backed by dedicated production platforms to support global product launches. Injectables The Frankfurt facility, our principal site for the manufacture of diabetestreatments, is now equipped with an additional aseptic filling unit that uses isolator technology. Toujeo\u00ae, launched in 2015, is among the diabetes products handled in this new filling unit. TheDiabetes industrial network has a solid base in emerging markets, both in Russia with the Orel site (now our second largest insulinpen production site after Frankfurt) and at the Beijing site in China. As part of the integration of Shantha (India) into our Injectables platform, the Indian site uses our proprietary manufacturingtechnology to handle filling and packaging for insulin products. Our prefilled syringes network mainly delivers Lovenox \u00ae/Clexane\u00ae from Le Trait (France) and Maisons Alfort (France) to global markets and from Csanyikv\u00f6lgy (Hungary) to non-FDA/EMA regulated markets. Pharmaceuticals The development of our General Medicines & Emerging Markets platform is built on a network of over 30 regional and local industrial sites in 25 countries, supporting growth in those markets. At Sidi Abdellah in Algeria we are building a new facility that will become our largest industrial complex in Africa, mainly producing dry and liquid formulations. Our Industrial Affairs Department has an ongoing policy of adapting industrial facilities to market needs. As part of this process, during 2017 we sold our facilities at Tangshan (China), Dakar (Senegal)and Zenata (Morocco). Consumer Healthcare The pharmaceutical industrial operations of our Consumer Healthcare(CHC) business are spread across a dedicatednetwork. Global markets are supplied from our facilities at Compi\u00e8gne (France), Origgio (Italy), Cologne (Germany) and Veresegyh\u00e1z (Hungary). Regional markets are supplied from our Suzano facility in Brazil, our Rzeszow facility in Poland and our ACE facility in Vietnam. Our facilities at Lisieux (France, productionof Doliprane \u00aefor the French market), Hangzhou (China), Virginia (Australia), and the Chattem facility in Tennessee (United States),mainly supply their local markets. We have recently invested heavily in major projects intended to build a specialist CHCindustrial network. This has included switching some CHC products from non-CHC facilities to the dedicated CHC network, transferring some liquid and effervescent formulations of CHC products to theCologne site, and transforming the Origgio site into a facilitydedicated to a single product family (Enterogermina \u00ae). Our Industrial Affairs Department has an ongoing policy of adaptingindustrial facilities to market needs. As part of this process we have completed construction of our new facility in Ho Chi Minh City(Vietnam), which manufactures specialty pharmaceuticals andCHC products, and in 2017 sold our CHC facility at Hangzhou (China). Vaccines (Sanofi Pasteur ) Sanofi Pasteur's industrial operations are in a major investment phase, preparing for the upcoming growth of our influenza andPolio/Pertussis/Hib franchises. Major investments were launched during 2017 in France (including a new influenza building at Val-de-Reuil), Canada (a new pertussis building), the US and Mexico. Our Industrial Affairs Department has an ongoing policy of adapting industrial facilities to market needs. As part of this process, we divested the facilities at Canton and Rockville (United States) during 2017. Innovation and culture of industrial excellence In 2017, we highlighted industrial innovation in our various facilitiesby organizing our ninth annual round of Industrial Trophies, in five categories: Patient Needs, Technological Innovation, Operational Performance, Energy & Environment, and Young IndustrialInnovation Talent. The ambition of our Industrial Affairs department is to continue to raise quality standards in Sanofi's production activities, and to remain a world leader and a benchmark in the global pharmaceutical industry. To achieve this goal, all our activities share a common culture of industrial excellence, enshrined in theSanofi Manufacturing System. This sets out a series of priorities (such as customer service, constant improvement, site networkoptimization and transverse optimization) that constitute our industrial vision and will be crucial to our mutual success. D.4. Office space As part of the transformation of Sanofi and the implementation of the ONE SANOFI program, we are undertaking major real estate 72 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY programs with two core objectives: to bring our teams together on single sites in new workspaces that favor agility, cross-fertilization and communication; and to rationalize office space while achieving a responsible environmental footprint. The many projects delivered in 2017 included completion of the master plan for the Lyon area (France) with the Carteret campus (1,500 people), plus new campuses in Sao Paulo (Brazil) and Tokyo Opera City (Japan) housing 1,100 and 1,500 peoplerespectively.This transformative approach to working practices provides strongsupport for our various operations to attain their objectives. The rollout plan extends to all regions via projects such as the master plan for the Boston area, Massachusetts (United States), under which Genzyme and Sanofi office space will be combined under asingle roof in an environmentally-certified building to be delivered in2018. A similar master plan is being rolled out in the Netherlands, to bring the teams from Gouda and Naarden together on a single site. Item 4A.

Operating and Financial Review and Prospects You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report at Item 18. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and with IFRS adopted by the European Union as of December 31, 2017. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. See \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward- Looking Statements\" at the beginning of this document. Unless otherwise stated, all financial variations in this item are given on a reported basis. A/ Operating results A.1. Significant operating information A.1.1. 2017 Overview During 2017, we continued to progress towards our key strategicobjectives: reorganizing our operations, successfully launching new products, enhancing innovation in R&D and streamlining our organization. On January 1, 2017, Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) finalized the strategic transaction agreed in June 2016, involving the exchange of Sanofi's Animal Health business (Merial) for BI's Consumer Healthcare business. After final enterprise valueadjustments, the exchange values of the two businesses effectively transferred during 2017 were determined to be \u20ac10,557 million for Sanofi's Animal Health business and \u20ac6,239 million for BI's Consumer Healthcare business. The divestment of the AnimalHealth business generated an after-tax gain of \u20ac4,643 million in 2017 (see Note D.1. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report on Form 20-F). During 2017, we gradually integrated BI's Consumer Healthcare business into our Consumer Healthcare Global Business Unit (GBU). Following completion of the integration process and witheffect from December 31, 2017, we have identified our Consumer Healthcare activity as an operating segment, the financial information for which is reported separately to, and reviewedseparately by, our Chief Executive Officer. Consequently, as of December 31, 2017 Sanofi has three operating segments: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Human Vaccines(Vaccines) (see \"- A.1.5. - Segment Information\" below).At the end of December 2016, Sanofi Pasteur and MSD (known as Merck in the United States and Canada) ended their European joint venture Sanofi Pasteur MSD (SPMSD). Under the terms of this transaction, we divested our share of the joint venture and acquired the vaccines portfolio that reverted to Sanofi. The additional net sales generated from January 1, 2017 onwards as a result of this transaction are reflected in our consolidated net sales for the yearended December 31, 2017. During 2017, we continued our policy of securing research and development alliances and making targeted acquisitions. We entered into a license agreement with Principia Biopharma, Inc. todevelop an oral drug candidate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. In influenza vaccines, we completed the acquisition of Protein Sciences. We also entered into an agreement with MedImmune to develop and commercialize a vaccine for theprevention of respiratory diseases. Our research and development efforts led to a number of compounds entering Phase III in 2017: dupilumab in the treatment of uncontrolled persistent asthma in children aged 6-11 and of atopic dermatitis in adolescents aged 12-17; isatuximab in the treatment of multiple myeloma; efpeglenatide in the treatment ofdiabetes; and cemiplimab in the treatment of non small cell lung cancer and as a second line treatment for cervical cancer. A number of products were launched during 2017 following thegranting of regulatory approvals, including Dupixent \u00ae(moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults) in the United States and some European Union countries; Kevzara\u00ae(rheumatoid arthritis) in the United States and some European Union countries; and SoliquaTM 100/33 in the United States and SuliquaTM in Europe (insulin glargine 100 units/ml and lixisenatide 33 mcg/ml injectable solution) in diabetes. In 2017, we also invested in our industrial facilities to deliver the production capacity needed for those products, including an extension to our vaccine facility at Val-de-Reuil (France) and astrategic alliance with Lonza to create a large-scale biologicsproduction facility at Visp (Switzerland). On November 29, 2017, following a new analysis of long-term clinical trial data which found differences in Dengvaxia\u00ae performance based on prior dengue infection, we proposed that national regulatory agencies in countries where the vaccine has been approved update the prescribing information, known as the \"label\" in many countries, and request that healthcare professionalsassess the likelihood of prior dengue infection in an individual before vaccinating. Vaccination should only be recommended when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks (incountries with a high burden of dengue disease). For individualswho have not been previously infected by dengue virus, vaccination is not recommended. The national regulatory agency in 74 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS the Philippines decided to suspend the dengue vaccination campaign in December 2017, and early in 2018 took the decision to suspend the marketing authorization of Dengvaxia\u00aefor a one-year period. In other countries, label updates are in progress(see A.2.1. Net Sales). Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were \u20ac 35,055 million, 3.6% higher than in 2016. At constant exchange rates (CER)(1), net sales were up 5.6%, reflecting the acquisition of BI's Consumer Healthcare business and the first-time consolidation of Sanofi's European vaccines business. At constant exchange rates and on a constant structure basis, net sales grew 0.5%,driven by Vaccines, the Multiple Sclerosis franchise, Dupixent \u00ae, and more generally by Emerging Markets.Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi amounted to \u20ac8,434 million, 79.1% higher than in 2016 after taking account of the gain on divestment of the Animal Health business and thedirect and indirect effects of US tax reform. Earnings per share was\u20ac6.71, up 83.3% on 2016. Business net income (2) was \u20ac6,964 million, 4.7% lower than in 2016, while business earnings per share(2)was 2.5% lower than in 2016 at \u20ac5.54. As of December 31, 2017 we had reduced our debt, net of cashand cash equivalents(3) to\u20ac5,229 million, compared with \u20ac8,206 million as of December 31, 2016. The reduction in net debtwas due largely to the receipt of a balancing cash payment as part of the transaction with BI. At the Annual General Meeting, to beheld on May 2, 2018, the shareholders will be asked to approve a dividend of \u20ac3.03 per share for the 2017 financial year, representing a payout of 54.7% of our business net income. A.1.2. Impacts of competition from generics and biosimilars Some of our flagship products continued to suffer sales erosion in 2017 due to competition from generics and biosimilars. We do not believe it is possible to state with certainty what level of net sales would have been achieved in the absence of generic competition. A comparison of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (see \"- Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\" below) for products affected by generic and biosimilar competition shows a loss of\u20ac1,570 million of net sales on a reported basis. Other parameters may have contributed to the loss of sales, such as a fall in the average price of certain products (e.g. Lantus\u00ae). The table below sets forth the impact by product. (\u20acmillion) 2017 2016Change on a reported basisChange on a reported basis (%) Aprovel\u00aeEurope 115 127 (12) -9.4% Lantus\u00aeEurope 760 878 (118) -13.4% Lovenox\u00aeEurope 951 1,027 (76) -7.4% Plavix\u00aeEurope 150 162 (12) -7.4% Renagel\u00ae/Renvela\u00aeEurope 71 82 (11) States Lantus\u00aeUnited States -27.9% States 645 (119) -15.6% Taxotere\u00aeUnited States (4) -100.0% Allegra\u00aeJapan 174 (28) -16.1% Amaryl\u00aeJapan 27 36 (9) -25.0% Aprovel\u00aeJapan 89 82 7 +8.5% Lantus\u00aeJapan 43 74 (31) -41.9% Myslee\u00aeJapan 95 110 (15) -13.6% Plavix\u00aeJapan 235 355 (120) -33.8% Taxotere\u00aeJapan 15 26 excluding 7,567 (1,570) -20.7% (1) Non-GAAP financial measure: see Presentation of Net Sales\" below (2) Non-GAAP financial measure: see definition under \"A.1.5. Segment information - 3/ Business Net Income\" below(3) Non-GAAP financial measure: see definition under \"B. Resources\" below SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 75ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS We expect the erosion caused by generic competition to continue in 2018, with a negative impact on our net income. The products likely to be impacted include those that already faced generic competition in 2017, but whose sales can reasonably be expectedto be subject to further sales 2017, the aggregate consolidated net sales of these products in countries where generic competition currently exists or is expected in 2018 amounted to \u20ac5,997 million; this comprises \u20ac3,300 million in the United States (including\u20ac2,542 million in net sales of Lantus\u00aeand\u20ac645 million in net sales of Renagel\u00ae/Renvela\u00ae), \u20ac2,047 million in Europe, and \u20ac650 million in Japan. The negative impact on our 2018 net sales is likely to represent a substantialportion of this amount, but the actual impact will depend on anumber of factors such as the actual launch dates of generic products in 2018, the prices at which they are sold, and potential litigation outcomes. A.1.3. Purchase Accounting Effects Our results of operations and financial condition for the yearsended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 have been significantly affected by our August 2004 acquisition of Aventis, our April 2011 acquisition of Genzyme and certain subsequent transactions. See\"- Critical accounting and reporting policies - Business combinations\" below for an explanation of the impact of business combinations on our results of operations. The Genzyme business combination has generated significant amortization of intangible assets ( \u20ac857 million in 2017, \u20ac866 million in 2016 and\u20ac890 million in 2015) and impairment of intangible assets (expenses of\u20ac16 million in 2017, net reversal of \u20ac6 million in 2016 and expenses of\u20ac214 million in 2015). The Aventis business combination has also generated significant amortization expenses (\u20ac365 million in 2017,\u20ac482 million in 2016and\u20ac638 million in 2015). In order to isolate the purchase accounting effects of all acquisitions and certain other items, we use a non-GAAP financial measure that we refer to as \"business net income\"(1). A.1.4. Sources of Revenues and Expenses Revenues. Revenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement withinNet sales. Net sales compriserevenue from sales of pharmaceutical products, human vaccines and active ingredients, net of sales returns, of customer incentivesand discounts, and of certain sales-based payments paid or payable to the healthcare authorities. Returns, discounts, incentives and rebates are recognized in the period in which theunderlying sales are recognized, as a reduction of sales revenue.See Note B.13.1. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. We sell pharmaceutical products and vaccines directly, through alliances, and by licensing arrangements throughout the world. When we sell productsdirectly, we record sales revenues as part of our consolidated net sales. When we sell products through alliances, the revenues reflected in our consolidated financial statements are based on thecontractual arrangements governing those alliances. For more information about our alliances, see \"- Financial Presentation of Alliances\" below. When our products are sold by licensingarrangements, we receive royalty income that we record inOther revenues. The sales of non-Sanofi products of our US based entity VaxServe are also presented inOther revenues; see Note B.13.2. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of purchasing raw materials and active ingredients, labor and other costs relating to our manufacturing activities, packaging materials, payments made under licensing agreements and distribution costs. We have license agreements under which we manufacture, selland distribute products that are patented by other companies and license agreements under which other companies distribute products that we have patented. When we pay royalties, we recordthem inCost of sales. Operating Income. Our operating income reflects our revenues, our cost of sales and the remainder of our operating expenses, the most significant of which are research and development expenses and selling and general expenses. For our operating segments, we also measure our results of operations through an indicator referred to as \"Business Operating Income,\" which we describebelow under \"- Segment Information - Business Operating Income of Segments.\" A.1.5. Segment information 1/ Operating segments In accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the segment information reported by Sanofi is prepared on the basis of internal management data provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker. The performance of thosesegments is monitored individually using internal reports and common indicators. The operating segment disclosures required under IFRS 8 are provided in Notes D.35. and B.26. (\"SegmentInformation\") to our consolidated financial statements, included atItem 18 of this annual report. Sanofi acquired the Consumer Healthcare operations of BI on January 1, 2017, and during 2017 we gradually integrated those operations into our Consumer Healthcare Global Business Unit(GBU). Following completion of the integration process and with effect from December 31, 2017, we have identified our ConsumerHealthcare business as an operating segment, the financial (1) Non-GAAP financial measure: see definition under \"A.1.5. Segment information - 3/ Business Net Income\" below 76 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS information for which is reported separately to, and reviewed separately by, our Chief Executive Officer. Up to December 31, 2017, the results of the Consumer Healthcare business were included in the Pharmaceuticals segment, as described below. Consequently, as of December 31, 2017 Sanofi has three operating segments: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Human Vaccines (Vaccines). The Pharmaceuticals segment comprises the commercial operations of the following global franchises: Specialty Care (Rare Diseases, Multiple Sclerosis, Oncology, Immunology), Diabetes & Cardiovascular, Established Prescription Products and Generics, together with research, development and production activities dedicated to our Pharmaceuticals segment. This segment also includes all associates whose activities are related topharmaceuticals, in particular our share of Regeneron. The Consumer Healthcare segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations for our Consumer Healthcare products, together with research, development and productionactivities dedicated to those products. The Vaccines segment comprises, for all geographical territories (including from January 1, 2017 certain European territories previously included in the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture), the commercial operations of Sanofi Pasteur, together with research, development and production activities dedicated to vaccines. Inter-segment transactions are not material.In addition, during 2017 we finalized a complete realignment of our internal management reporting to match our managerial structure. As a result, the costs of our global functions (Medical Affairs,External Affairs, Finance, Human Resources, Legal Affairs,Information Solutions & Technologies, Sanofi Business Services, etc.) are now managed centrally at group-wide level and are nolonger allocated to operating segments for internal management reporting purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and subsequent years, the costs of those functions will be presentedwithin the \"Other\" category. That category also includes otherreconciling items such as retained commitments related to of divested activities.Consequently, the analysis of our net sales performance provided below is presented using our new segment reporting model. Segmental results for the year ended December 31, 2017 are alsopresented using the new model. However, due to lack of availabledata and the complex and significant adjustments that would berequired (in particular to our reporting tools), the comparative information has not been restated to reflect the changes arising from our new segment reporting model. We have therefore alsopresented segment results for 2017 and comparative periods using our previous segment reporting model. 2/ Business Operating Income We report segment results on the basis of \"Business operating income\". This indicator is used internally by our chief operating decision maker to measure the performance of each operating segment and to allocate resources. For a definition of \"businessoperating income\", and a reconciliation between that indicator and Income before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method, refer to Note D.35. to our consolidated financialstatements. 3/ Business net income We believe that understanding of our operational performance byour management and our investors is enhanced by reporting \"business net income\". This non-GAAP financial measure represents business operating income, less net financial expensesand the relevant income tax effects. For prior year periods (2016 and 2015), \"Business net income\" consists of (i) \"Business net income excluding Animal Health\", determined as described aboveand (ii) \"Animal Health business net income\", determined on asimilar and comparable basis. We also report \"business earnings per share\", a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as business net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 77ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS The table below reconciles our business operating income to our business net income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: (\u20acmillion)December 31, 2017December 31, 2016December 31, 2015 Business operating income 9,343 9,285 9,313 Financial income and expenses (273) (399)(a) (381) Income tax expense (2,106) (2,054) (1,929) Business net income excluding Animal Health 6,964 6,832 7,003 Animal Health business net income - 476 368 Business net income 6,964 7,308 7,371 (a) This amount does not include the \u20ac457 million impairment loss charged against Sanofi's equity investment in Alnylam. Business net income is defined as Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi determined under IFRS, excluding the following items: amortization and impairment losses charged against intangible assets (other than software and other rights of an industrial or operational nature); fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration relating to business combinations or divestments; other impacts associated with acquisitions (including impacts of acquisitions on investments accounted for using the equity method); restructuring costs and similar expenses(1); other gains and losses (including gains and losses on major disposals of non-current assets)(2); other costs and provisions related to litigation(2); the tax effects of the items listed above; the effects of major tax disputes; the 3% tax levied on the distribution of dividends to equity holders of Sanofi; the direct and indirect effects of the US tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, and the consequences of the French ConstitutionalCouncil ruling of October 6, 2017 on the additional 3% levy on dividends paid out in cash; those Animal Health items that are not included in business net income (3); the portion attributable to non-controlling interests of the items listed above; and the impairment loss taken in 2016 against our equity investment in Alnylam, which reflected a decline in the market value of that investment as of December 31, 2016 relative to its historical cost, most of the decline having occurred when Alnylam decided to discontinue the revusiran development program on October 5, 2016. Business net income also includes Sanofi's share of the business net income of Sanofi Pasteur MSD from the date when Sanofi and MSD announced their intention to end their joint venture.

(c) For 2017, this line item mainly comprises a provision for a vendor's liability guarantee relating to a past divestment, and for 2016, the pre-tax gain on the divestment of Sanofi's interest in the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture. (d) For 2017, this line includes the impact of changes in corporate income tax rates, mainly in France (25% standard rate effective as of January 1, 2022). For 2016, this line includes the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from the reconciling items (in particular amortization and impairment of intangible assets, and restructuring costs) as a result of changes in corporate income tax rates, mainly in France (28% standard rate effective January 1, 2020)and in Japan. (e) For 2017, this line comprises (i) the direct and indirect effects of the US tax reform (negative impact of \u20ac1,193 million) and (ii) the consequences of the French Constitutional Council ruling of October 6, 2017 on the additional 3% levy on dividends paid out in cash (positive impact of \u20ac451 million). (f) For 2017, this line shows the gain arising on the divestment of the Animal Health business. For 2016, this line shows the elimination of (i) the impact of the discontinuation of depreciation and impairment of property, plant & equipment with effect from the start date of IFRS 5 application and included in business netincome; (ii) the impact of the amortization and impairment of intangible assets until the start date of IFRS 5 application; (iii) costs directly incurred as a result ofthe divestment; and (iv) tax effects of items (i) to (iii). (g) For 2016, this line shows the elimination of Sanofi's share of the business net income of Sanofi Pasteur MSD from the date when Sanofi and Merck announced their intention to end their joint venture. The most significant reconciling items between our business net income and Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi relate to (i) the purchase accounting effects of our acquisitions andbusiness combinations, particularly the amortization andimpairment of intangible assets (other than software and otherrights of an industrial or operational nature), and (ii) the impacts ofevents regarded as non-recurring, where the amounts involved are particularly significant. We believe that excluding those non-cash or SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 79ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS non-recurring charges enhances an investor's understanding of our underlying economic performance, because we do not consider that the excluded charges reflect the combined entity's ongoing operating performance. Rather, we believe that each of theexcluded charges reflects the decision to acquire the businesses concerned. The principal purchase accounting effects of acquisitions and business combinations on net income are: amortization and net impairment losses charged againstintangible assets (other than software and other rights of an industrial or operational nature), net of taxes and non-controlling interests; and the incremental cost of sales incurred on the workdown ofacquired inventories remeasured at fair value, net of taxes. We believe (subject to the limitations described below) thatdisclosing our business net income enhances the comparability of our operating performance, for the following reasons: the elimination of charges related to the purchase accounting effect of our acquisitions and business combinations (particularly amortization and impairment of finite-lived intangible assets, other than software and other rights of an industrial or operational nature) enhances the comparability of our ongoing operating performance relative to our peers in thepharmaceutical industry that carry those intangible assets(principally patents and trademarks) at low book values either because they are the result of in-house research and development that has already been expensed in prior periods orbecause they were acquired through business combinations that were accounted for as poolings-of-interest; the elimination of selected items - such as the incremental costof sales arising from the workdown of acquired inventories remeasured at fair value in business combinations, major gains and losses on disposals, and costs and provisions associated with major litigation and any other major non-recurring items, improves comparability from one period to the next; and the elimination of restructuring costs and similar items enhancescomparability because those costs are incurred in connection with reorganization and transformation processes intended to optimize our operations. We remind investors, however, that business net income shouldnot be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi reported in accordance with IFRS. In addition, we strongly encourage investors and potential investors not to rely on any single financial measure but to review our financial statements, including the notes thereto, carefully and in their entirety. We compensate for the material limitations described above by using business net income only to supplement our IFRS financial reporting and by ensuring that our disclosures provide sufficientinformation for a full understanding of all adjustments included in business net income. Because our business net income is not a standardized measure, it may not be directly comparable with the non-GAAP financial measures of other companies using the same or a similarnon-GAAP financial measure. A.1.6. Presentation of Net Sales In the discussion below, we present our consolidated net sales for2017, 2016 et 2015. We analyze our net sales among various categories, including by business, product and geographical region. In addition to reported net sales, we analyze non-GAAP financialmeasures designed to isolate the impact on our net sales of currency exchange rates and changes in the structure of our group. When we refer to changes in our net sales at constant exchange rates (CER), that means that we have excluded the effect of exchange rates by recalculating net sales for the relevant periodusing the exchange rates that were used for the previous period. When we refer to changes in our net sales on a constant structure basis, that means that we eliminate the effect of changes in structure by restating the net sales for the previous period as follows: by including sales generated by entities or product rights acquired in the current period for a portion of the previous period equal to the portion of the current period during which we owned them, based on sales information we receive from the party fromwhom we make the acquisition; similarly, by excluding sales for a portion of the previous period when we have sold an entity or rights to a product in the current period; and for a change in consolidation method, by recalculating the previous period on the basis of the method used for the current period. A.1.7. Financial Presentation of Alliances We have entered into a number of alliances for the development,co-promotion and/or co-marketing of our products. We believe that a presentation of our two principal alliances is useful to an understanding of our financial statements. The financial impact of the alliances on the Company's income statement is described in \"- Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31,2016\" and \"- Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with YearEnded December 31, 2015\", in particular in \"- Net Sales\", \"- Other Revenues\", \"- Share of Investments Accounted forusing the Equity Method\" and \"- Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests\". 80 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 1/ ALLIANCE ARRANGEMENTS WITH REGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS INC. (Regeneron) Collaboration agreement on the discovery, development andcommercialization of human therapeutic antibodies In November 2007, Sanofi and Regeneron signed new agreements (amended in November 2009) for the discovery, development and commercialization of fully human therapeutic antibodies. Sanofi having decided not to extend the discovery agreement, thatagreement expired on December 31, 2017. Under the 2009 amended agreements Sanofi committed to funding the discovery and pre-clinical development of fully human therapeutic antibodiesby a maximum of $160 million per year through 2017. Sanofi hadan option to develop and commercialize antibodies discovered by Regeneron pursuant to the collaboration. Following the signature inJuly 2015 of the immuno-oncology collaboration agreement described below, $75 million (spread over three years) was reallocated to that new agreement. If the option was exercised, Sanofi co-develops and co-commercialize the antibody with Regeneron and is responsible for funding. Sanofi and Regeneron share co-promotion rights andprofits on sales of the co-developed antibodies. On receipt of thefirst positive Phase III trial results for any such antibody, thesubsequent Phase III costs for that antibody are split 80% Sanofi, 20% Regeneron. Amounts received from Regeneron under those arrangements are recognized by Sanofi as a reduction in the lineitemResearch and development expenses.Once a product begins to be commercialized, and provided that the share ofquarterly results under the agreement represents a profit, Sanofi isentitled to an additional profit-share (capped at 10% of Regeneron's share of quarterly profits) until Regeneron has paid 50% of the cumulative development costs incurred by the parties inthe collaboration. In addition, Sanofi may be required to makemilestone payments based on aggregate sales of all antibodies. As of December 31, 2017 the cumulative development costs incurredby the two parties were\u20ac5.2 billion (comprising\u20ac2.9 billion funded 100% 80% by Sanofi and 20%by Regeneron, amounts translated into euros at the closing US dollar exchange rate). On the earlier date of (i) 24 months beforethe scheduled launch date or (ii) the first positive Phase III trial results, Sanofi and Regeneron share the commercial expenses of the antibodies co-developed under the license agreement. Sanofirecognizes all the sales of those antibodies. Profits and losses arising from commercial operations in the United States are split 50/50. Outside the United States, Sanofi is entitled to between 55%and 65% of profits depending on sales of the antibodies, and bears55% of any losses. The share of profits and losses attributable to Regeneron under the agreement is recognized in the line items Other operating incomeorOther operating expenses, which are components of operating income. In addition, Regeneron is entitled to receive payments of up to $250 million contingent on the attainment of specified levels of sales outside the United States.Praluent \u00ae, Dupixent\u00ae, Kevzara\u00ae, and REGN3500 (SAR 440340) will continue to be developed, and commercialized as applicable, with Regeneron under the Antibody License and Collaboration Agreement (LCA), following the expiry of the Discovery Agreement. Immuno Oncology (IO) Discovery and Development Agreement and IO Licence and Collaboration Agreement (IO LCA) On July 1, 2015, Sanofi and Regeneron entered into a new global collaboration to discover, develop and commercialize new antibody cancer treatments in the emerging field of immuno-oncology. As part of the agreements, the two companies are jointly developing aprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor antibody currentlyin Phase IIb in the treatment of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and in Phase III for non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer, and expect to initiate clinical trials with newtherapeutic candidates based on ongoing innovative preclinical programs. Sanofi made an upfront payment of $640 million toRegeneron. The two companies will then invest approximately $1 billion from discovery through proof of concept (POC) development (usually a Phase IIa study) of monotherapy and novel combinations of immuno-oncology antibody candidates to befunded by Regeneron ($250 million) and 75% by Sanofi ($750 million). Under the terms of the IO Discovery and Development Agreement, Sanofi is entitled to an additional share of profits of upto 50% of the clinical development costs initially funded by Sanofi.That additional profit-share is capped at 10% of the share of Regeneron's quarterly profits arising under the agreement. Under the terms of the IO LCA Sanofi and Regeneron also committed to provide additional funding of no more than $650 million on a 50/50 basis ($325 million per company) for thedevelopment of REGN2810, a PD-1 inhibitor antibody. In Regeneron announced an agreement to increasethe PD1 development budget from the previously disclosed $650 million to $1.64 billion, which will continue to be shared 50-50. In addition, Sanofi will make a one-time milestone payment of$375 million to Regeneron in the event that sales of a PD-1 product and any other collaboration antibody sold for use in combinationwith a PD-1 product were to exceed, in the aggregate, $2 billion in any consecutive 12-month period. Finally, the two companies agreed to reallocate $75 million (spread over three years) to immuno-oncology antibody research and development fromSanofi's $160 million annual contribution to their existing antibodycollaboration, which has not been extended. Beyond the committed funding, additional funding will be allocated as programs enter post-POC development. Under the terms of the IO Discovery and Development Agreement, Sanofi can exercise opt-in rights to further development and commercialization under the IO LCA for candidates derived from the program. Once Sanofi has exercised its opt-in rights for a candidate, future development of that candidate will be conducted either by Sanofi and Regeneron. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 81ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS Where development is conducted by Sanofi, the entire cost of developing that candidate will be funded by Sanofi, and Regeneron will reimburse half of those costs, subject to a cap of 10% of Regeneron's quarterly profits. Where development is conducted by Regeneron, the two partieswill share the development costs equally. Investor agreement In January 2014, Sanofi and Regeneron amended the investoragreement that has existed between the two companies since 2007 (the \"Amended Investor Agreement\"). Under the terms of the amendment, Sanofi accepted various restrictions. Sanofi is boundby certain \"standstill\" provisions, which contractually prohibit Sanofi from seeking to directly or indirectly exert control of Regeneron or acquiring more than 30% of Regeneron's capital stock (consistingof the outstanding shares of common stock and the shares of Class A stock). This prohibition will remain in place until the earlier of (i) the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of the Zaltrap \u00ae collaboration agreement with Regeneron (related to the development and commercialization ofZaltrap \u00ae) or the collaboration agreement with Regeneron on monoclonal antibodies (see \"Collaboration agreement on thediscovery, development and commercialization of human therapeutics antibodies\" above), each as amended and (ii) otherspecified events. Sanofi has also agreed to vote as recommended by Regeneron's Board of Directors, except that it may elect to vote proportionally with the votes cast by all of Regeneron's other shareholders withrespect to certain change-of-control transactions, and to vote in itssole discretion with respect to liquidation or dissolution, stockissuances equal to or exceeding 20% of the outstanding shares or voting rights of Regeneron's Class A Stock and Common Stock(taken together), and new equity compensation plans or amendments if not materially consistent with Regeneron's historical equity compensation practices. As soon as it had passed the threshold of 20% ownership of the capital stock, Sanofi exercised its right under the Amended Investor Agreement to designate an independent director, who wasappointed to the Board of Directors of Regeneron. The interest heldby Sanofi in Regeneron has been accounted for using the equity method since April 2014. On the conditions set out in the Amended Investor Agreement entered into in January 2014, Sanofi's right to designate a Regeneron board member was contingent on Sanofi maintaining itspercentage share of Regeneron's outstanding capital stock (measured on a quarterly basis) at a level no lower than the highest percentage level previously achieved, with the maximumrequirement capped at 25%. In addition, Sanofi's interest in Regeneron is subject to a clause restricting Sanofi's ability to sell shares of Regeneron's capital stock, which has been amended by the letter agreement of January 2018 (the \"2018 Letter Agreement\"see below).In November 2015, the Independent Designee (as defined in theAmended Investor Agreement) designated by Sanofi as an independent director resigned from the Regeneron Board of Directors. At Sanofi's request, pursuant to the Amended Investor Agreement, Regeneron appointed N. Anthony \"Tony\" Coles, M.D. to its Board of Directors in January 2017 as a successor Sanofidesignee. The Amended Investor Agreement also gives Sanofi the right to receive certain reasonable information as may be agreed upon by the parties and which will facilitate Sanofi's ability to account for itsinvestment in Regeneron using the equity method of accounting under IFRS. In January 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron announced (i) amendments to their collaboration agreement on the discovery, development and commercialization of human therapeutic antibodies; (ii) amendments to their IO licence and collaborationagreement on the development of cemiplimab in the field ofimmuno-oncology; and (iii) a limited waiver and amendment of the Amended Investor Agreement pursuant to the 2018 Letter Agreement. The announcement included a series of amendments to the collaboration agreements relating to the funding of additional programs to develop REGN2810 in extended indications, and of additional programs on Dupixent\u00aeand IL33 (REGN3500). The $650 million development budget for the PD-1 inhibitor antibody will be increased to $1.64 billion through 2022, funded equally by the two companies (i.e. from $325 million to $820 million for each partner). The additional programs on Dupixent\u00aeand IL33 (REGN3500) will focus on extending the current range of indications and finding new indications, and improving co-morbidity between multiple pathologies. Pursuant to the 2018 Letter Agreement, Regeneron has agreed to grant a limited waiver of the \"lock-up\" and the obligation to maintain the \"Highest Percentage Threshold\" in the Amended and Restated Investor Agreement between the companies, so that Sanofi may elect to sell a small percentage of the Regeneron common stock itowns to fund a portion of the cemiplimab and dupilumabdevelopment expansion. This waiver will allow Sanofi to sell in private transactions to Regeneron up to an aggregate of 1.4 million shares of Regeneron common stock through the end of 2020. IfRegeneron decides not to purchase the shares, Sanofi will be allowed to sell those shares on the open market, subject to certain volume and timing limitations. Upon expiration of the limited waiverunder the 2018 Letter Agreement, the Amended Investor Agreement will be amended to define \"Highest Percentage Threshold\" as the lower of (i) 25% of Regeneron outstandingshares of Class A Stock and Common Stock (taken together) and(ii) the higher of (a) Sanofi's percentage ownership of Class A Stock and Common Stock (taken together) on such termination date and (b) the highest percentage ownership of Regeneron 82 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS outstanding shares of Class A Stock and Common Stock (taken together) Sanofi attains following such termination date. 2/ ALLIANCE ARRANGEMENTS WITH BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB (BMS) Two of Sanofi's leading products were jointly developed with BMS: the September 27, 2012, Sanofi and BMS signed an agreementrelating to their alliance following the loss of exclusivity of Plavix\u00ae and Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00aein many major markets. Under the terms of this agreement, which took effect on January 1, 2013, BMS returned to Sanofi its rights to Plavix\u00aeand Avapro\u00ae/ Avalide\u00aein all markets worldwide with the exception of Plavix\u00aein the United States and Puerto Rico, giving Sanofi sole control and freedom to operate commercially in respect of those products. In exchange, BMS will receive royalty payments on Sanofi's sales ofbranded and unbranded Plavix \u00aeand Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00aeworldwide (except for Plavix\u00aein the United States and Puerto Rico) until 2018, and will also receive a payment of $200 million from Sanofi in December 2018, part of which will be used to buy out the non-controlling interests (see Note D.18.). Rights to Plavix\u00aein the United States and Puerto Rico remain unchanged and continue to be governed by the terms of the original agreement until December 2019. In all of the territories managed by Sanofi (including the United States and Puerto Rico for Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00ae) as defined in the new agreement, Sanofi recognizes in its consolidated financialstatements the revenue and expenses generated by its own operations. The share of profits reverting to BMS subsidiaries ispresented within Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the income statement. In the territory managed by BMS (United States and Puerto Ricofor Plavix\u00ae), Sanofi recognizes its share of profits and losses within the line item Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method. A.1.8. Impact of Exchange Rates We report our consolidated financial statements in euros. Becausewe earn a significant portion of our revenues in countries where the euro is not the local currency, our results of operations can be significantly affected by exchange rate movements between theeuro and other currencies, primarily the US dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen, and currencies in emerging countries. We experience these effects even though certain of thesecountries do not account for a large portion of our net sales. In2017, we earned 33.8% of our net sales in the United States. Anincrease in the value of the US dollar against the euro has apositive impact on both our revenues and our operating income. A decrease in the value of the US dollar against the euro has anegative impact on our revenues, which is not offset by an equalreduction in our costs and therefore negatively affects our operating income. A variation in the value of the US dollar has a particularly significant impact on our operating income, which ishigher in the United States than elsewhere, and on the contributionto net income of our collaborations with Regeneron and BMS in the United States (see \"- Financial Presentation of Alliances\" above). For a description of arrangements entered into to manage operating foreign exchange risks as well as our hedging policy, see \"Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about MarketRisk\", and \"Item 3. Key Information - D. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Financial Markets - Fluctuations in currency exchangerates could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition\". A.1.9. Divestments On January 1, 2017, Sanofi and BI finalized the strategic transaction agreed in June 2016, involving the exchange of Sanofi's Animal Health business (Merial) for BI's Consumer Healthcare business. After final enterprise value adjustments, theexchange values of the two businesses effectively transferred during 2017 were determined to be\u20ac10,557 million for Sanofi's Animal Health business and\u20ac6,239 million for BI's ConsumerHealthcare business. The divestment of the Animal Healthbusiness generated an after-tax gain of\u20ac4,643 million in 2017. At the end of December 2016, Sanofi Pasteur and MSD ended their European joint venture Sanofi MSD (SPMSD). This transaction involves the divestment of Sanofi's share in the joint venture and the acquisition of the vaccines portfolio that reverts to Sanofi. The consideration for the transfer was (i) a fixed sum of\u20ac127 million received on January 4, 2017 and (ii) contingent consideration based on a percentage of MSD sales during the 2017-2024 period of specified products previously distributed bySPMSD, and receivable in annual installments over the sameperiod. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of the contingent consideration was measured at\u20ac458 million and recognized in the \"available-for-sale financial assets\" category. There were no material divestments in 2015. For further details about the divestments mentioned above, see Note D.1. and D.2. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. A.1.10. Acquisitions In 2017, as part of the strategic transaction between Sanofi and BI,we acquired BI's Consumer Healthcare business. The goodwill arising on that acquisition represents (i) the capacity to draw on a specialized structure to refresh the existing product portfolio; (ii) the SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 83ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS competencies of the staff transferred to Sanofi; (iii) the benefits derived from the creation of new growth platforms; and (iv) the expected future synergies and other benefits from combining the CHC operations of BI and Sanofi. The tax-deductible portion ofgoodwill amounts to\u20ac1,876 million out of total goodwill of \u20ac2,222 million. This business generated sales of\u20ac1,407 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. On August 25, 2017, Sanofi acquired 100% of Protein Sciences, a biotechnology company headquartered in Meriden, Connecticut (United States). The principal product of Protein Sciences is Flublok\u00ae, the only recombinant protein-based influenza vaccine approved by the FDA in the United States. The acquisition price includes two contingent purchase consideration elements of \u20ac42.3 million each. The impacts of this acquisition on Sanofi'sbusiness operating income and consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 are not material. Over the past three years Sanofi acquired further shares in the biopharmaceutical company Regeneron, at a cost of \u20ac184 million in 2017, \u20ac115 million in 2016 and \u20ac117 million in 2015. Sanofi's investment in Regeneron had a carrying amount of \u20ac2,512 million as of December 31, 2017, compared with\u20ac2,548 million as ofDecember 31, 2016 and\u20ac2,245 million as of December 31, 2015 (see Note D.6.). This represents an equity interest of 22.2% as of December 31, 2017, compared with 22.1% as of December 31,2016 and 2015. In 2016, as part of the dissolution of the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture, we acquired the vaccines portfolio that reverts to us. The purchase price essentially comprised (i) a fixed sum of\u20ac154 millionpaid on January 4, 2017 and (ii) contingent consideration of \u20ac354 million based on a percentage of future sales made by Sanofi Pasteur during the 2017-2024 period of specified former SPMSD products, to be paid in installments over that period. The impact of acquisitions in 2015 on our consolidated financial statements is not material. For further information about the acquisitions mentioned above, see Notes D.1. and D.2. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. A.1.11. Critical accounting and reporting policies Our consolidated financial statements are affected by the accounting and reporting policies that we use. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition, and in some casesthe application of these critical policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our consolidated financialstatements. The accounting and reporting policies that we haveidentified as fundamental to a full understanding of our results ofoperations and financial condition are the following: 1/ Revenue recognition Our policies with respect to revenue recognition are discussed inNote B.13.1. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Revenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement withinNet sales. Netsales comprise revenue from sales of pharmaceutical products, vaccines, and active ingredients, net of sales returns, of customer incentives and discounts, and of certain sales-based paymentspaid or payable to the healthcare authorities. Revenue isrecognized when all of the following conditions have been met: the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to thecustomer; we no longer have effective control over the goods sold; the amount of revenue and costs associated with the transaction can be measured reliably; and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to us. We offer various types of price reductions on our products. In particular, products sold in the United States are covered by various programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid) under which products are sold at a discount. Rebates are granted to healthcareauthorities, and under contractual arrangements with certain customers. Some wholesalers are entitled to chargeback incentives based on the selling price to the end customer, under specificcontractual arrangements. Cash discounts may also be granted for prompt payment. The discounts, incentives and rebates described above are estimated on the basis of specific contractualarrangements with our customers or of specific terms of the relevant regulations and/or agreements applicable for transactions with healthcare authorities, and of assumptions about theattainment of sales targets. We also estimate the amount of salesreturns, on the basis of contractual sales terms and reliable historical data. Discounts, incentives, rebates and sales returns arerecognized in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized, as a reduction of sales revenue. For additional details regarding the financial impact of discounts, incentives, rebates and sales returns, see Note D.23. to our consolidated financialstatements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Revenues from non-Sanofi products, mainly comprising royalty income from license arrangements and sales of non-Sanofi products by our US-based entity VaxServe, are presented withinOther revenues . 2/ Business combinations As in Note B.3. \"Business combinations and transactionswith non-controlling interests\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report, business 84 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS combinations are accounted for by the acquisition method. The acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria of IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) aremeasured initially at their fair values as at the acquisition date,except for (i) non-current assets classified as held for sale, whichare measured at fair value less costs to sell and (ii) assets andliabilities that fall within the scope of IAS 12 (Income Taxes) andIAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Business combinations completed onor after January 1, 2010 are accounted for in accordance with therevised IFRS 3 and the revised IAS 27, (Consolidated andIndividual Financial Statements), now superseded by IFRS 10(Consolidated Financial Statements). In particular, contingentconsideration payable to former owners agreed in a businesscombination, e.g. in the form of payments upon the achievement ofcertain R&D milestones, is recognized as a liability at fair value as of the acquisition date irrespective of the probability of payment. Ifthe contingent consideration was originally recognized as a liability,subsequent adjustments to the liability are recognized in profit orloss (see Note D.18. \"Liabilities related to business combinationsand non-controlling interests\" to our consolidated financialstatements included at Item 18 of this annual report). 3/ Goodwill impairment and intangible assets As discussed in Note B.6. \"Impairment of property, plant andequipment, intangible assets, and investments accounted for usingthe equity method\" and in Note D.5. \"Impairment of intangibleassets and property, plant and equipment\" to our consolidatedfinancial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report, wetest our intangible assets for impairment periodically or when thereis any internal or external indication of impairment. We test forimpairment on the basis of the same objective criteria that wereused for the initial valuation. Our initial valuation and ongoing testsare based on the relationship of the value of our projected futurecash flows associated with the asset to either the purchase price ofthe asset (for its initial valuation) or the carrying amount of theasset (for ongoing tests). The determination of the underlyingassumptions relating to the recoverability of intangible assets issubjective and requires the exercise of considerable judgment. Keyassumptions relating to goodwill impairment and intangible assetsare the perpetual growth rate and the post-tax discount rate. Anychanges in key assumptions could result in an impairment charge.A sensitivity analysis to the key assumptions is disclosed inNote D.5. \"Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant andequipment\" to our consolidated financial statements included atItem 18 of this annual report. 4/ Contingent consideration receivable As described in Note B.8.6. and D.7. to our consolidated financialstatements included at Item 18 of this annual report, contingentconsideration receivable such as earn-outs on disposals, forexample in the form of a percentage of future sales of the acquirer,are recognized as an asset at fair value as of the date ofdivestment. Subsequent remeasurements of the fair value of theasset are recognized in profit or loss.5/ Pensions and post-retirement benefits As described in Note B.23. \"Employee benefit obligations\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report, we recognize our pension and retirement benefit commitments as liabilities on the basis of an actuarial estimate ofthe rights vested in employees and retirees at the end of thereporting period, net of the fair value of plan assets held to meet these obligations. We prepare this estimate at least on an annual basis taking into account financial assumptions (such as discountrates) and demographic assumptions (such as life expectancy, retirement age, employee turnover, and the rate of salaryincreases). We recognize all actuarial gains and losses (including the impact of a change in discount rate) immediately through equity. A sensitivity analysis to the discount rate is set forth in Note D.19.1. \"Provisionsfor pensions and other benefits\" to our consolidated financialstatements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Depending on the key assumptions used, the pension and post- retirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. A sensitivityanalysis to these key assumptions is set forth in Note D.19.1.\"Provisions for pensions and other benefits\" to our consolidatedfinancial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. 6/ Deferred taxes As discussed in Note B.22. \"Income tax expense\" to ourconsolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report, we recognize deferred income taxes on tax loss carry- forwards and on temporary differences between the tax base andcarrying amount of assets and liabilities. We calculate our deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates applicable for the years during which we estimate that the temporary differences areexpected to reverse. We do not recognize deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will notbe realized. The recognition of deferred tax assets is determined on the basis of profit forecasts for each tax group, and of the taxconsequences of the strategic opportunities available to Sanofi. 7/ Provisions for risks Sanofi and its subsidiaries and affiliates may be involved inlitigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings. These proceedings typically are related to product liability claims, intellectual property rights, compliance and trade practices, commercial claims,employment and wrongful discharge claims, tax assessment claims, waste disposal and pollution claims, and claims under warranties or indemnification arrangements relating to businessdivestitures. As discussed in Note B.12. \"Provisions for risks\" at Item 18 of this annual report, we record a provision where we havea present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 85ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the outflow of resources. For additional details regarding the financial impact of provisions for risks see Notes D.19.3. \"Other provisions\" and D.22.\"Legal and Arbitral Proceedings\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. 8/ Provisions for restructuring costs Provisions for restructuring costs include early retirement benefits, compensation for early termination of contracts, and rationalization costs relating to restructured sites. Refer to Note D.19.2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 of this annualreport. Provisions are estimated on the basis of events and circumstances related to present obligations at the end of the reporting period and of past experience, and to the best of management's knowledge atthe date of preparation of the financial statements. The assessment of provisions can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.Given the inherent uncertainties related to these estimates and assumptions, the actual outflows resulting from the realization ofthose risks could differ from our estimates. 9/ Venezuelan Subsidiaries As described in Note A.4. to our consolidated financial statementsincluded at Item 18 of this annual report, Sanofi continues to account for subsidiaries based in Venezuela using the full consolidation method, on the basis that the criteria for control asspecified in IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements) are met. In the context of the existence of several exchange rates in Venezuela, Sanofi has decided to use the DICOM rate (establishedin February 2016) for the translation of transactions carried out bythe Venezuelan subsidiaries. 86 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5.

SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 87ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS A.2.1. Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were \u20ac35,055 million, 3.6% higher than in 2016. Exchange rate fluctuations had a negative effect of two percentage points overall, mainly as a result of unfavorable trends in the euro against the USdollar, the Egyptian pound, the Turkish lira, the Japanese yen andthe Chinese yuan renminbi. At constant exchange rates (CER), net sales were up 5.6%, reflecting the acquisition of BI's ConsumerHealthcare business and the first-time consolidation of Sanofi's European vaccines business. At constant exchange rates and on aconstant structure basis (CER/CS), net sales rose by 0.5%.

When we refer to changes in our net sales on a constant structure basis (CS), that means that we eliminate the effect of changes in structure by restating the net sales for the previous period as follows: by including sales generated by entities or product rights acquired in the current period for a portion of the previous period equal to the portion of the current period during which we ownedthem, based on sales information we receive from the party from whom we make the acquisition; similarly, by excluding sales for a portion of the previous period when we have sold an entity or rights to a product in the current period; and for a change in consolidation method, by recalculating the previous period on the basis of the method used for the current period.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 1/ Net Sales by Operating Segment Our net sales comprise the net sales generated by our Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Human Vaccines (Vaccines) segments. Following the integration of BI's Consumer Healthcare business, acquired on January 1, 2017, our Consumer Healthcare business represents a separate operating segment of Sanofi in accordance with IFRS 8. Consequently, we present our Consumer Healthcare net sales separately for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Sales growth was recorded across all geographies: 8.5% CER in Emerging Markets(1), 6.4% CER in the United States, 5.0% CER in Europe(2)and 3.9% CER in the Rest of the World region(3). In Gaucher disease, net sales of Cerezyme\u00aewere stable year-on-year at\u20ac730 million. Sales growth in Emerging Markets (+2.1% CER at\u20ac229 million) offset a decrease in the Rest of the World region ( -8.3% CER at \u20ac43 million). Cerdelga\u00aereported net sales of\u20ac126 million (+20.8% CER), of which\u20ac95 million were generated in the United States (+14.1% CER). In Europe, net salesof Cerdelga \u00aerose by 52.9% to \u20ac26 million. Myozyme\u00ae/ Lumizyme\u00aein Pompe disease rose by 10.1% CER to\u20ac789 million, driven by sales in the United States (+11.3% CER, at\u20ac262 million) and Europe (+8.6% CER, at\u20ac352 million). Net sales also rose in Emerging Markets (+12.7% CER, at \u20ac116 million) and in the Rest of the World region (+8.9% CER, at \u20ac59 million). This sales growth was fueled by increased diagnosis and treatment of Pompe disease. Fabrazyme\u00aeachieved net sales growth of 9.2% CER, to \u20ac722 million. Sales are advancing in many countries due to growthin the number of patients diagnosed with, and treated for, Fabry disease. Net sales of the product were up 9.3% CER in the United States (at\u20ac369 million); 5.8% CER in Europe (at\u20ac163 million)despite the launch of new rival products; 9.5% CER in the Rest ofthe World region (at\u20ac112 million); and 16.2% CER in EmergingMarkets (at\u20ac78 million).

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS Oncology franchise The Oncology franchise generated net sales of \u20ac1,519 million, up 4.5% on a reported basis and 6.4% CER, due largely to public-sector orders for Leukine\u00aein the United States, a good performance for the franchise in Emerging Markets, and overall growth in sales of Jevtana\u00aeand Thymoglobulin\u00ae. Net sales of Jevtana\u00aetotaled \u20ac386 million in 2017 (+9.8% CER), driven by growth in the United States (+6.6% CER, at\u20ac159million), Europe (+7.2% CER, at\u20ac148 million) and Japan CER, at\u20ac46 million). Thymoglobulin \u00aenet sales rose by 5.3% CER to \u20ac291 million, largely on a good performance in Emerging Markets (+13.6% CER, at\u20ac66 million). Net sales of Taxotere\u00aewere stable year-on-year at \u20ac173 million. This reflects stronger sales in Emerging Markets (+7.7% CER, at \u20ac136 million), especially in China (+13.6% CER, at\u20ac65 million), which more than offset the effect of competition from generics,especially in Japan (-38.5% CER, at\u20ac15 million). Net sales of Eloxatin \u00aerose by 8.2% CER to \u20ac179 million. This reflects stronger sales in Emerging Markets (+13.4% CER, at\u20ac147 million), especially in China (+15.2% CER, at\u20ac103 million), which more than offset a fall in Canadian sales due to competition fromgenerics. Immunology franchise Dupixent\u00ae (dupilumab, developed in collaboration with Regeneron), for adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, was approved by the FDA in March 2017 and made available in the US market. Since then, the product has generated US net sales of\u20ac216 million, reflecting substantial unmet medical needs and rapid access to the market. In Europe, Dupixent \u00aewas approved at the end of September 2017 for the treatment of adults with moderate tosevere atopic dermatitis requiring systemic treatment; the product was made available at the end of the year in Germany, where itgenerated net sales of\u20ac2 million. Kevzara \u00ae(sarilumab, developed in collaboration with Regeneron), a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, was approved by the FDA on May 22, 2017 and made available in June 2017 in the US market, where it achieved net sales of\u20ac10 million. The product has also been approved in Europe, and has been launched in a number of countries (Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom). Since its launch, Kevzara\u00aehas recorded \u20ac1 million of net sales in Europe. Diabetes franchise Net sales for the Diabetes franchise amounted to \u20ac6,395 million in 2017, down 12.9% on a reported basis and 11.1% CER. The main factor was a fall in sales of Lantus\u00aein the United States, where Diabetes franchise net sales were down 22.8% CER at\u20ac3,128 million. As previously indicated, the decline in US net salesfor the Diabetes franchise accelerated during 2017, following the consecutive exclusion of a number of diabetes treatments from the reimbursement lists of two of the country's leading healthcare insurance providers: UnitedHealth (from April 1, 2017) and CVS. Outside the United States, Diabetes franchise net sales advancedin Emerging Markets (+11.4% CER, at\u20ac1,494 million) but fell inEurope ( -2.0% CER, at \u20ac1,287 million), where a good performance from Toujeo\u00aepartially compensated for weaker sales of Lantus\u00ae. In 2017, net sales of insulin glargines (Lantus\u00aeand Toujeo\u00ae) were down 13.0% CER at\u20ac5,438 million. Net of Lantus\u00aewere down 17.5% CER in 2017, at \u20ac4,622 million. In the United States, sales were down 26.6% CER at \u20ac2,542 million, due mainly to a lower average net price, the switching of patients to Toujeo\u00ae, and the effect of the product's exclusion from reimbursement lists as described above. Net sales in Europe fell by 12.8% CER to\u20ac760 million, due largely to the launch of a biosimilar of Lantus\u00aeand the switching of patients to Toujeo\u00ae. Over the same period, sales of Lantus\u00aein Emerging Markets reached \u20ac1,005 million, up 9.2% CER, driven largely by Africa and Middle East (+18.8% CER,at\u20ac288 million) and Asia (+10.6% CER, at \u20ac424 million), especially China (+15.8% CER, at \u20ac319 million). During 2017, Sanofi filed two patent infringement suits relating to Lantus \u00aein the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (United States): oneagainst Merck (in August) and the other against Mylan (in October). For further information, refer to \"Item 8 - Information on Legal orArbitration Proceedings\". The new-generation basal insulin Toujeo of 27.0% CER in 2017, to\u20ac816 million. Net sales in the United States decreased by 2.1% CER to\u20ac455 million essentially as the result of a decrease in the average net price of the product duringthe fourth quarter of 2017 (negative net sales impact of 28.4% including VAT relative to the fourth quarter of 2016). However, this was more than offset by sales growth in Europe (+80.8% CER, at\u20ac217 million), Emerging Markets (+300.0% CER, at\u20ac79 million)and the Rest of the World region (+88.6% CER, at\u20ac65 million). Net sales of Amaryl \u00aefell by 1.4% CER in 2017, to \u20ac337 million. Sales growth in Emerging Markets (+2.1% CER, at \u20ac278 million) did not fully compensate for lower net sales in the Rest of the World region ( -10.0% CER, at \u20ac36 million) and in Europe ( -22.2% CER, at\u20ac21 million). Net sales of Apidra\u00aerose by 4.9% CER in 2017, to \u20ac377 million. Lower sales in the United States ( -10.4% CER, at \u20ac102 million) were offset by sales growth in Emerging Markets (+25.9% CER, at \u20ac97 million) and in Europe (+7.1% CER, million). SoliquaTM100/33 Suliqua Units/ mL and lixisenatide 33 mcg/mL) were launched at the start of 2017 in the United States, and at the end of 2017 in the Netherlands. SoliquaTM100/33 has generated \u20ac26 million of net sales in the United States since launch. Following negotiations with US payers, we have secured coverage of Lantus\u00aeand Toujeo\u00aein the vast majority of formularies for 2018. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 93ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS Given the improved sales visibility, we have fine-tuned our forecasts for Diabetes net sales for the 2015-2018 period, which we now expect to show an annualized average decrease in the range of 6% to 8% CER (for information about factors that mayimpact forward-looking statements, see \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\"). Cardiovascular franchise In 2017, net sales of Praluent\u00ae(alirocumab, developed in collaboration with Regeneron) reached \u20ac171 million, of which \u20ac116 million was generated in the United States and \u20ac46 million in Europe. The relatively limited rise in sales during the period reflects significant restrictions by US payers and limited access to the European market. In October 2017, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ordered a new trial and vacated the permanentinjunction in the dispute concerning Amgen's asserted patent claims for antibodies targeting PCSK9. This ruling means that Sanofi and Regeneron will continue marketing, selling andmanufacturing Praluent \u00aein the US. For further information on litigation relating to Praluent\u00ae, refer to Note D.22. to our consolidated financial statements (included as Item 18 of this Annual Report on Form 20-F) and \"- Item 8 - Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings\". Net sales of Multaq\u00aeamounted to \u20ac339 million in 2017, down 2.5% CER year-on-year. The bulk of the sales were generated in the United States ( -2.7% CER, at \u20ac286 million) and Europe ( -2.3% CER, at\u20ac42 million). Established Prescription Products Net sales of Established Prescription Products in 2017 were \u20ac9,761 million, down 5.3% on a reported basis and 3.4% CER. Growth in Emerging Markets net sales (+4.8% CER, at\u20ac3,800 million) failed to offset lower net sales in Europe ( -4.4% CER, at \u20ac3,473 million), the start of generic competition for Renvela\u00ae/ Renagel\u00aein the United States, and the impact of competition from generics of Plavix\u00aein Japan. In the United States and the Rest of the World region, net sales of Established Prescription Products fell by 13.8% CER (to \u20ac1,269 million) and 11.7% CER (to \u20ac1,219 million), respectively. Net sales of Lovenox\u00aewere\u20ac1,575 million, down 2.1% CER, due largely to increased competition in Europe ( -7.1% CER, at \u20ac951 million) with the arrival of biosimilars in the United Kingdom and Germany. This decline canceled out a good performance inEmerging Markets (+7.8% CER, at \u20ac475 million). Net \u00aein 2017 were \u20ac1,471 million ( -1.2% CER), reflecting generic competition in Japan (-30.7% CER, at \u20ac235 million) and Europe ( -7.4% CER, at \u20ac150 million). The effect was partly offset by growth in sales of Plavix\u00aein Emerging Markets(+10.4% CER, at \u20ac1,026 million), especially in China where the product posted net sales of \u20ac758 million (+12.1% CER). Sales of Plavix\u00aein the United States and Puerto Rico are handled by BMS under the terms of the Sanofi-BMS alliance (see Note C.2.,\"Alliance Arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)\", to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of thisAnnual Report on Form 20-F). Renvela \u00ae/Renagel\u00aeposted net sales of \u20ac802 million in 2017, down 12.3% CER, mainly on generic competition in the United States (-14.8% CER, at\u20ac645 million) where the first generic versions in powder and pill form were approved in June and July2017, respectively. In October 2017, Sanofi launched an approved generic version of Renvela \u00ae/Renagel\u00aein the United States. In Europe, sales of Renvela\u00ae/Renagel\u00aefell by 13.4% CER to \u20ac71 million, also due to competition from generics. Net sales of Aprovel\u00ae/Avapro\u00aefor 2017 were \u20ac691 million (+3.7% CER), largely on sales growth in Emerging Markets (+8.7% CER, at\u20ac433 million), especially China (+14.2% CER, at\u20ac264 million), and in the Rest of the World region (+3.1% CER, at\u20ac132 million). In Europe, net sales of Aprovel\u00ae/Avapro\u00aewere down 9.4% CER at \u20ac115 million, due to competition from generics. We have no comments on sales of our other Established Prescription Products. Generics Generics net sales for 2017 were \u20ac1,778 million, down 4.1% on a reported basis and 3.3% CER. Emerging Markets generated net sales of \u20ac758 million, down 2.9% CER, due mainly to lower sales in Asia ( -68.5% CER, at \u20ac22 million) following the divestment of a distribution business in China. The decrease in net sales in Asia more than offset increased Generics sales in Latin America (+1.7% CER, at\u20ac428 million),Africa and Middle East (+1.6% and Eurasia (+9.3% CER, at\u20ac190 million). Generics sales were also lower in Europe ( -4.9% CER, at \u20ac760 million) and the United States (-12.0% CER, at \u20ac150 million), but increased in the Rest of the World region (+23.9% CER, at \u20ac110 million). In line with our Strategic Roadmap 2020, we have been examiningall options and have decided to initiate a carve-out process with a view to divesting our European Generics business. We will be looking for a potential purchaser who will leverage the medium-to-long-term sustainable growth opportunities for thisbusiness. We have also confirmed our commitment to our Generics business in other parts of the world, and will focus more on Emerging Markets in order to develop the business in thosecountries. Signing of definitive transaction agreements (1)on the divestiture of European Generics is expected in the third quarter of 2018.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 5/ Net Sales - Consumer Healthcare Segment During 2017, we gradually integrated the Consumer Healthcare operations of BI into our Consumer Healthcare GBU. Following completion of the integration process and with effect from December 31, 2017, we have identified our Consumer Healthcare business as an operating segment. Consequently, the net sales of our Consumer Healthcare business are presented separately below, for 2017 and comparative periods. Net sales of Consumer Healthcare products reached \u20ac4,832 million in 2017, up 45.1% on a reported basis and 46.3% at constant exchange rates, reflecting the acquisition of BI's Consumer Healthcare business. On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, Consumer Healthcare net sales rose by 2.1%, driven by growth in Emerging Markets and Europe.

On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates (CER/CS), net sales rose by 3.0%, driven by growth for Pain Relief (+43.9% CER and +5.5% CER/CS, at \u20ac454 million), Allergy, Cough and Cold (+33.1 CER and +5.0% CER/CS, at \u20ac349 +3.3% CER/CS, at\u20ac377 million), though theeffect was mitigated by lower sales in Food Supplements (+36.5%CER but -3.6% CER/CS, at\u20ac273 million). In Europe, net sales rose by 62.0% CER to \u20ac1,422 million. On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, net sales were up 2.0%, propelled by growth in Pain Relief (+34.8% CERand +4.3% CER/CS, at \u20ac515 million) and in particular higher sales of Doliprane\u00aein France. In the United States, net sales advanced by 22.5% CER to \u20ac 1,133 million. On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, net sales rose by 1.3%, driven by strong growth in Allergy, Cough and Cold (+10.8% CER and CER/CS, at\u20ac367 million), largely as a result of the launch of Xyzal\u00aeAllergy 24HR (net sales\u20ac65 million) which was authorized for OTC sale inFebruary 2017. However the effect was offset by lower net sales in Digestive Health ( -13.1% CER/CS, at \u20ac188 / FORM 20-F 2017 97ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS In the Rest of the World region, Consumer Healthcare net sales for 2017 reached \u20ac661 million, up 145.1% CER. On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, net sales rose by 1.5%, driven by Pain Relief (+9.4% CER/CS, at\u20ac122 million) and Digestive Health (+13.5% CER/CS, at\u20ac58 million). The effect was partly offset by lower sales in Allergy, Cough and Cold ( -12.5% CER/CS, at \u20ac158 million).

On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, Vaccines net salesrose by 8.3%, driven mainly by the performance of the Polio/Pertussis/Hib franchise across all geographies. In theUnited States, Vaccines net sales increased by 5.6% CER to\u20ac2,570 million. Net sales for the Vaccines segment in Emerging Markets were up 7.8% CER at\u20ac1,575 million. In Europe, Vaccines net sales reached\u20ac630 million (+137.3% CER and +20.7% CER/CS). 98 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5.

On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, net sales for the franchise rose by 15.3%. In Emerging Markets, sales for this franchise reached \u20ac940 million (+14.5% CER), driven by strong growth in Asia (+44.1% CER, at \u20ac360 million) on higher sales of Pentaxim\u00aein China, although we expect more limited shipments there in the first half of 2018. Netsales of Polio/Pertussis/Hib vaccines also advanced in the United States (+10.1% CER, at \u20ac435 million) and in Europe (+37.3% CER/CS, at \u20ac300 million), reflecting good performances by Pentacel \u00aeand Hexaxim\u00ae, respectively. Net sales of Influenza vaccines rose by 9.5% CER, to \u20ac1,589 million. This performance reflected higher sales for thefranchise in the United States (+7.3% CER, at \u20ac1,128 million), largely as a result of sales to the Biomedical Advanced Researchand Development Authority (BARDA) of the US Department of Health and Human Services. Sales of influenza vaccines also rose in Emerging Markets (+7.4% CER, at \u20ac297 million) largely on sales growth in Brazil, and in Europe (+12.9% CER/CS, at \u20ac113 million) due in particular to the success of VaxigripTetra \u00ae. Net sales of Meningitis/Pneumonia vaccines were stable year-on-year at \u20ac623 million. Menactra\u00aeposted net sales of \u20ac600 million (+4.6% CER), of which \u20ac484 million was generated in the United States.Net sales of Travel and Other endemics vaccines increased by 35.9% CER in 2017, to \u20ac493 million. On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, net sales rose by 19.0%, reflectingincreased supply of rabies and hepatitis A vaccines. Net sales of Adult Booster vaccines in 2017 were \u20ac474 million, up 16.5% CER. On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates, net sales were virtually unchanged year-on-year( -0.2%). Increased sales in Europe (+6.2% CER/CS, at \u20ac119 million) and the Rest of the World region (+12.5% CER, at \u20ac26 million) offset lower sales in Emerging Markets (-22.9% CER, at\u20ac37 million). Dengvaxia \u00aeposted net sales of \u20ac3 million in 2017, reflecting repurchases of inventory following discontinuation of the public vaccination program initiated in the Philippines in early 2016. On November 29, 2017 Sanofi announced results of a new analysis oflong-term Dengvaxia \u00aedata which found differences in vaccine performance depending on whether or not the vaccinated individual had previously been infected with the dengue virus.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS Sales in the United States totaled \u20ac11,855 million in 2017, down 4.3% on a reported basis and 3.5% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates. The main factor was lower sales for two franchises: Diabetes ( -22.8% CER at \u20ac3,128 million), and Established Prescription Products ( -13.8% CER, at \u20ac1,269 million) due to competition from generics of Renvela\u00ae/Renagel\u00ae. The impact was partly offset by the performance of the Multiple Sclerosis franchise (+19.0% CER, at\u20ac1,330 million), the launch of Dupixent\u00ae, and growth in Vaccines sales (+5.6% CER at \u20ac2,570 million). InEmerging Markets , net sales reached \u20ac10,258 million, up 6.9% on a reported basis and up 9.7% CER. On a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates net sales rose by 6.0%, driven by sales growth for Established Prescription Products (+4.8% CER, at \u20ac3,800 million) and the Diabetes franchise (+11.4% CER, at \u20ac1,494 million), and a good performance from Vaccines (+7.8% CER, at \u20ac1,575 million). In Asia , net sales were \u20ac3,732 million, up 10.3% CER (+8.7% reflecting a solidperformance in China (+15.1% CER/CS, at \u20ac2,218 million) on a recovery in Vaccines sales and growth for Established PrescriptionProducts and the Diabetes franchise. In Latin America , net sales advanced by 12.8% CER (+5.9% CER/CS) to \u20ac2,837 million, boosted (+5.7% CER/CS) andArgentina (+21.0% CER/CS, at\u20ac311 million). Net sales in Brazil reached\u20ac1,133 million, driven by Established PrescriptionProducts and Consumer Healthcare. In theAfrica and MiddleEastregion, net sales totaled\u20ac2,326 million, up 2.5% CER but down 0.5% on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates. Solid performances in Egypt (+28.3% CER/CS) and Algeria(+6.8% CER/CS) were offset by lower sales in Morocco ( -27.0% CER/CS) following the ( In the Eurasia region net sales reached \u20ac1,242 million, up 18.3% CER (+12.6% CER/CS) reflecting strong sales growth in Turkey(+18.1% CER/CS) and in Russia (+8.2% CER/CS). Net sales inRussia were \u20ac642 million, driven by Consumer Healthcare and by the Diabetes and Rare Diseases franchises. InEurope , net sales were \u20ac9,525 million, up 10.2% CER and stable on a constant structure basis and at constant exchange rates. Lower sales of Established Prescription Products ( -5.6% CER/CS, at\u20ac3,473 million) were offset by growth in sales of Vaccines (+20.7% CER/CS, at\u20ac630 million) and the MultipleSclerosis franchise (+23.5% CER/CS, at\u20ac561 million). Net sales in France amounted to\u20ac2,330 million, down 2.3% CER/CS, as lower sales of Established Prescription Products and Generics were onlypartially offset by sales growth for Vaccines, Consumer Healthcareand the Multiple Sclerosis franchise. In the Rest of the World region, net sales rose by 10.6% CER to \u20ac 3,417 million. However, on a constant structure basis and atconstant exchange rates net sales for the region fell by 1.5%. This reflects a drop in sales for Established Prescription Products (-11.8% CER/CS, at \u20ac1,219 million) and the Diabetes franchise (-1.4% CER/CS, at \u20ac486 million), partly offset by stronger sales for Vaccines, the Specialty Care franchise, Generics and ConsumerHealthcare. In Japan, net sales were up 11.6% CER at \u20ac1,803 million. On a constant structure basis, Japanese net sales fell by 7.3% due to the impact of generic competition for Plavix \u00ae and lower sales of Lantus\u00ae. A.2.2. Other income statement items 1/ Other revenues Other revenues mainly comprise royalties under licensing agreements, and VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products. Other revenues rose by 29.5% to\u20ac1,149 million in 2017, compared with \u20ac887 million in 2016. This was mainly due to higher sales atVaxServe (\u20ac859 million, versus\u20ac581 million in 2016). 2/ Gross profit Gross profit reached \u20ac24,593 million in 2017, versus \u20ac24,006 million in 2016, a rise of 2.4%. The gross margin ratio (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) was 70.2% in 2017 compared with 71.0% in 2016. The decrease includes the impact ofthe fair value remeasurement of inventories acquired in the exchange transaction with BI ( \u20ac166 million in 2017). The gross margin ratio for the Pharmaceuticals segment (1) decreased by 0.2 of a percentage point to 72.2%, mainly reflecting the negative effect of lower US sales for the Diabetes franchise, though the effect was partly offset by Emerging Markets (especially China), and the Multiple Sclerosis and Immunology franchises. The gross margin ratio for the Vaccines segment(2)was 0.2 of a percentage point lower at 61.7%. 3/ Research and development expenses Research and development ( R&D ) expenses amounted to \u20ac5,472 million in 2017 (versus\u20ac5,172 million in 2016) and represented 15.6% of net sales (versus 15.3% in 2016). The overall year-on-year increase of\u20ac300 million (+5.8%) included\u20ac217 million for the Pharmaceuticals segment (1)(+4.7%) and \u20ac83 million for the Vaccines segment(2)(+15.0%). The year-on-year increase in R&D expenses was due partly to the integration of BI Consumer Healthcare products and of Sanofiproducts that were previously in the SPMSD portfolio, and partly toprogress on development projects in immuno-oncology(isatixumab, PD-1) and for sotagliflozin.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 4/ Selling and general expenses Selling and general expenses totaled \u20ac10,058 million (28.7% of net sales), compared with\u20ac9,486 million in 2016 (28.0% of net sales). This represents a year-on-year rise of\u20ac572 million (+6.0%). Selling and general expenses for the Pharmaceuticals(1)and Vaccines(2) segments rose by \u20ac433 million (+5.0%) and \u20ac138 million (+18.6%), respectively. This increase mainly reflected the launch costs of Dupixent\u00ae, Kevzara\u00aeand Xyzal\u00ae, plus investment in marketing and sales efforts in key emerging marketsand in the European vaccines business. 5/ Other operating income and expenses Overall, this represented net income of \u20ac4 million in 2017, compared with a net expense of\u20ac127 million in 2016. (\u20acmillion) 2017 2016Change 2017/2016 Other operating income 237 355 (118) Other operatingexpenses 233 482 (249) Other operatingincome/(expenses),net 4 (127) 131 The overall year-on-year improvement of \u20ac131 million reflected (i) a reduction in operating foreign exchange losses from \u20ac146 million (including\u20ac102 million on our Venezuelan operations) in 2016 to\u20ac80 million in 2017; and (ii) a decrease in income from our pharmaceutical alliance partners from\u20ac191 million in 2016 to \u20ac7 million in 2017, mainly relating to Regeneron following thelaunch of Dupixent \u00aeand Kevzara\u00ae. This was partly offset by (i) gains on disposals relating to ongoing operations (\u20ac90 million in 2017, compared with\u20ac40 million in 2016) and (ii) impairment losses of\u20ac87 million taken against property, plant and equipmentassociated with the dengue vaccine (see Notes D.25. and D.26. to our consolidated financial statements). 6/ Amortization of intangible assets Amortization charged against intangible assets amounted to \u20ac1,866 million in 2017, versus\u20ac1,692 million in 2016. The\u20ac174 million year-on-year increase was mainly due to a \u20ac 245 million rise in amortization expense following the recognition of intangible assets in connection with the exchange transaction with BI finalized on January 1, 2017. The effect was partly offset by a reduction in amortization charged against intangible assets recognized on the acquisition of Aventis (\u20ac365 million in 2017,versus\u20ac482 million in 2016) as some products reached the end of their life cycles.7/ Impairment of intangible assets In 2017, this line item showed impairment losses of \u20ac293 million against intangible assets, compared with\u20ac192 million in 2016. In 2017, this line item included (i) a \u20ac190 million impairment loss taken against intangible assets associated with the dengue vaccine; (ii) a \u20ac54 million impairment loss relating to Clostridium difficilevaccine development projects following our decision to discontinue the related programs; and (iii) impairment losses of\u20ac23 million taken against rights relating to a number of marketedproducts in the Pharmaceuticals segment. In 2016, this line item included (i) a net impairment loss of \u20ac 58 million on various R&D projects in the Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines segments; and (ii) impairment losses of\u20ac134 milliontaken against rights relating to a number of marketed products in the Pharmaceuticals segment. 8/ Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration Fair value remeasurements of contingent consideration liabilitiesrecognized on acquisitions in accordance with the revised IFRS 3 represented a net expense of\u20ac159 million in 2017, versus a net expense of\u20ac135 million in 2016. The 2017 remeasurements relate to contingent consideration arising from the dissolution of the SPMSD joint venture (expense of \u20ac187 million), and to contingent consideration payable to Bayer asa result of an acquisition made by Genzyme prior to the latter'sacquisition by Sanofi (gain of \u20ac28 million in 2018, versus expense of\u20ac78 million in 2016). See Note D.18. to our consolidated financial statements. 9/ Restructuring costs and similar items Restructuring costs and similar items amounted to \u20ac731 million in 2017, compared with\u20ac879 million in 2016. In 2017, restructuring costs mainly comprised employee-related expenses arising from headcount adjustment plans in the United States and Europe, and write-downs of industrial assets in Franceand the United States. 10/ Other gains and losses, and litigation In 2017, the line item Other gains and losses, and litigation shows an expense of\u20ac215 million, due mainly to a provision for a vendor's liability guarantee relating to a past divestment. At the end of December 2016, Sanofi Pasteur and MSD ended their SPMSD joint venture. The derecognition of Sanofi's investment in SPMSD generated a pre-tax gain on disposal of \u20ac211 million in 2016.

(2) Includes an allocation of global support function costs. For more information see \"- A.2.3 - Segment Results\" below. 102 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 11/ Operating income Operating income totaled \u20ac5,803 million for 2017, compared with \u20ac6,534 million for 2016. The year-on-year decrease of 11.2% was attributable mainly to increases in cost of sales, R&D expenses, selling and general expenses, and amortization and impairment of intangible assets. 12/ Financial income and expenses Net financial expenses for 2017 were \u20ac273 million, compared with \u20ac856 million for 2016, a decrease of \u20ac583 million. This decrease mainly reflected the impairment loss of \u20ac457 million taken against our equity investment in Alnylam in 2016, in line with a decline in itsmarket value of as of the reporting date relative to historical cost. Most of that decline occurred when Alnylam decided to discontinue the revusiran development program on October 5, 2016. Net financial expenses directly related to our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (see the definition in section \"4. Consolidated Balance sheet\" below) amounted to \u20ac221 million in 2017, compared with\u20ac218 million in 2016, reflecting an increase in thecost of debt. The net interest cost relating to employee benefits amounted to \u20ac 92 million in 2017, compared with \u20ac114 million in 2016. 13/ Income before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method Income before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method totaled\u20ac5,530 million in 2017, compared with \u20ac5,678 million in 2016, a fall of 2.6%. 14/ Income tax expense Income tax expense represented \u20ac1,722 million in 2017, versus \u20ac1,326 million in 2016, giving an effective tax rate (based onconsolidated net income) of 31.1% in 2017, compared with 23.4% in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate was mainly due tothe direct and indirect effects of the US tax reform (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which came into force on January 1, 2018). The effect was partially offset by the consequences of the FrenchConstitutional Council ruling of October 6, 2017 with respect to theadditional 3% levy on dividends paid out in cash. The net effect of those two items was to increase the effective tax rate by 8% (seeNote D.30. to our consolidated financial statements). The effects of the US tax reform are based on a preliminary analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The final impact may differ and will be adjusted in 2018 to reflect the completion of our analysis and final calculations, and/or further clarifications or guidance issuedby the US Congress, the US Internal Revenue Service, the US Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulators.Changes in the level of income tax expense are also significantly impacted by the tax effects of the amortization and impairment of intangible assets ( \u20ac719 million in 2017, versus \u20ac694 million in 2016) and of restructuring costs (\u20ac134 million in 2017, versus \u20ac95 million in 2016). The effective tax rate on our business net income(1)is a non-GAAP financial measure. It is calculated on the basis of business operating income, minus net financial expenses and before (i) the share of profit/loss from investments accounted for using the equitymethod and (ii) net income attributable to non-controlling interests. We believe the presentation of this measure, used by our management, is also useful for investors as it provides a means toanalyze the effective tax cost of our current business activities. Itshould not be seen as a substitute for the effective tax rate based on consolidated net income. When calculated on business net income (1), our effective tax rate was 23.5% in 2017, compared with 23.3% in 2016. The main impacts on this tax rate are the geographical mix of the profits of Sanofi entities; the tax effects of the elimination of intragroupmargin on inventory; favorable settlements of recent proceedings involving the tax authorities in various countries; and changes in tax rates, particularly in France, the Netherlands and Belgium. The table below reconciles our effective tax rate based on consolidated net income to our effective tax rate based on business net income: (as a percentage) 2017 2016(a) Effective tax rate based on consolidated net income 31.1 23.4 Tax effects: Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 3.2 3.7 Restructuring costs and similar items (0.2) (1.3) Impairment loss charged against theinvestment in Alnylam (1.5) Other tax effects(b) (10.6) (1.0) Effective tax rate based onbusiness net income 23.5 23.3 (a) The results of the Animal Health business are presented separately in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations); see Notes D.1. and D.36. to our consolidatedfinancial statements.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 15/ Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method Investments accounted for using the equity method contributed net income of\u20ac104 million in 2017, compared with\u20ac134 million in 2016. This line item mainly comprises our share of the profits and losses of Regeneron, which represented net income of \u20ac101 million in 2017 and\u20ac126 million in 2016. 16/ Net income excluding the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business Net income excluding the held-for-exchange Animal Health business amounted to\u20ac3,912 million in 2017, versus \u20ac4,486 million in 2016. 17/ Net income/(loss) of the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business In accordance with IFRS 5, the net income or loss of the Animal Health business is presented in a separate line item,Net income/ (loss) of the held-for-exchange Animal Health business(see Notes D.1. and D.36. to our consolidated financial statements). Atthe start of January 2017, Sanofi and BI confirmed that they had finalized the strategic transaction agreed in June 2016, involving the exchange of Sanofi's Animal Health business (Merial) for BI'sConsumer Healthcare business. Consequently, for 2017 this lineitem shows the net after-tax gain of\u20ac4,643 million on the divestment of the Animal Health business. 18/ Net income Net income amounted to \u20ac8,555 million in 2017, compared with \u20ac4,800 million in 2016.19/ Net income attributable to non-controlling interests Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was \u20ac121 million in 2017, versus\u20ac91 million in 2016. This line item mainly comprises the share of pre-tax profits paid to BMS from territories managed by Sanofi (\u20ac84 million, versus\u20ac86 million in 2016). The year-on-year decrease was directly related to competition from generics of clopidogrel (active ingredient of Plavix\u00ae) and irbesartan (active ingredient of Aprovel\u00ae) in Europe. 20/ Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi amounted to\u20ac8,434 million, versus\u20ac4,709 million in 2016. Basic earnings per share for 2017 was \u20ac6.71 (including the net gain on the divestment of the Animal Health business), 83.3% higher than the 2016 figure of\u20ac3.66, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,256.9 million in 2017 (1,286.6 million in2016).

Our business net income for 2017 was \u20ac6,964 million, 4.7% lower than in 2016 ( \u20ac7,308 million, including \u20ac476 million of business net income from Animal Health). Excluding Animal Health, our businessnet income was \u20ac6,964 million in 2017 (19.9% of net sales) in 2017, compared with \u20ac6,832 million (20.2% of net sales) in 2016. We also report \"business earnings per share\", a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as business net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Business earnings per share was \u20ac5.54 in 2017, 2.5% lower than the 2016 figure of \u20ac5.68, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,256.9 million in 2017 and 1,286.6 million in 2016.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS A.3.1. Net sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were \u20ac33,821 million, 0.7% lower than in 2015. Exchange rate fluctuations had a negative effect of 1.9 percentage points overall, with adverse trends in the Argentine peso, Chinese yuan renminbi,Mexican peso and pound sterling outweighing the positive effect of the Japanese yen and US dollar. At constant exchange rates (CER), net sales rose by 1.2%. This performance included the negative effects of a change in the exchange rate applied in translating the results of our Venezuelanoperations into euros. This change reflected reforms to theVenezuelan foreign exchange system in February 2016, and thecontinued impossibility of converting bolivars to US dollars at theofficial preferential exchange rate (1). In addition, in the first half of 2015, Sanofi benefited from a significant increase in product demand in Venezuela, due to buying patterns associated with local market conditions. As a result, our net sales in Venezuelaamounted to \u20ac18 million in 2016, compared with \u20ac455 million in 2015. Excluding Venezuela, our net sales increased by 2.6% CER. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our reported net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 to our net sales at constant exchange rates: (\u20acmillion) 2016(a)(b) 2015(a)(b) Change Net sales 33,821 34,060 -0.7% Effect of exchange rates (661) Net sales at constant exchange rates 34,482 34,060 +1.2% (a) In accordance with the presentation requirements of IFRS 5, the consolidated income statement line item Net sales does not include the net sales of the Animal Health business. (b) Due to a change in accounting presentation, VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products are included in Other revenues from 2016 onwards. The presentation of prior period Net sales and Other revenues has been amended accordingly. 1/ Net Sales by Operating Segment Our net sales comprise the net sales generated by our Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Human Vaccines (Vaccines) segments. Following the integration of BI's Consumer Healthcare business, acquired on January 1, 2017, our Consumer Healthcare business represents a separate operating segment of Sanofi in accordance with IFRS 8. Consequently, we present our Consumer Healthcare net sales separately for the year ended December 31, 2017; see section \"A.2.2. Net sales\" above. Comparatives for the year endedDecember 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 have been restated accordingly (Consumer Healthcare was previously included within the Pharmaceuticals segment).

The year-on-year decrease of \u20ac393 million reflected the negative effect of exchange rates (down\u20ac498 million), and the following impacts at CER: growth in net sales for the Multiple Sclerosis franchise (up \u20ac625 million), the Rare Diseases franchise (up \u20ac298million), theCardiovascular franchise (up \u20ac109 million) and the Generics (up \u20ac 13 million); and lower net sales for Established Prescription Products (down \u20ac 770 million), the Diabetes franchise (down \u20ac137 million) and the Oncology franchise (down \u20ac33 million). Excluding Venezuela, pharmaceuticals net sales rose by 1.7% CER. Comments on the performances of major Pharmaceuticals segment products are provided below.

SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 113ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS Net sales of Myozyme\u00ae/ Lumizyme\u00aein Pompe disease rose by 13.5% CER to\u20ac725 million, driven by sales in the United States (+16.6% CER, at\u20ac240 million) and Europe (+8.5% CER, at \u20ac327 million). Net sales also rose sharply in Emerging Markets(+20.2% CER, at\u20ac102 million) and in the Rest of the World region (1)(+20.5% CER, at \u20ac56 million). This performance was mainly due to increased worldwide diagnosis. In Fabry disease, Fabrazyme\u00aeposted net sales growth of 14.7% CER to\u20ac674 million. The product reported growth in many countries due to an increase in the number of patients treated, with notable performances in the United States (+12.8% CER, at\u20ac345 million), Europe (+13.6% CER, at\u20ac156 million), but also in Japan (+14% CER, at\u20ac73 million), and in Emerging Markets (+25.4% CER, at\u20ac68 million). Multiple Sclerosis franchise Net sales for the Multiple Sclerosis franchise reached\u20ac1,720 million in 2016, up 54.4% on a reported basis and 56.1% CER. This progression was mainly due to net sales ofAubagio \u00ae, which advanced by 49.7% CER to \u20ac1,295 million. In the United States, net sales reached \u20ac908 million, up 46.6% CER. In Europe, the product continued to extend its geographical reach, and net sales rose by 56.9% CER to \u20ac308 million. Aubagio\u00aewas the fastest-growing oral treatment in the multiple sclerosis market, with a patient market share of 8.8% in the United States (IMS NSP TRX - Q4 2016). Net sales of Lemtrada\u00aeamounted to \u20ac425 million (+79% CER), including\u20ac233 million in the United States and\u20ac151 million in Europe, mainly in Germany and the United Kingdom. Oncology franchise The Oncology franchise generated net sales of \u20ac1,453 million, down 3.4% on a reported basis and 2.2% CER, reflecting lowersales of Taxotere \u00ae, Eloxatin\u00aeand Zaltrap\u00ae, though the effect was partially compensated by increased sales of Jevtana\u00ae, Thymoglobulin\u00aeand Mozobil\u00ae. Net sales of Jevtana\u00aetotaled \u20ac358 million in 2016, up 11.5% CER, driven by a strong performance in the United States (+18.9%CER, at \u20ac152 million) and in Japan (+85% CER, at \u20ac41 million). Net sales of Thymoglobulin \u00aerose by 10.9% CER to \u20ac281 million on good performances in Emerging Markets (+23.5% CER, at\u20ac59 million), the United States (+10.3% CER, at\u20ac160 million) and the Rest of the World region (+10% CER, at\u20ac24 million). Taxotere \u00aesaw net sales fall by 17.1% CER to \u20ac179 million, reflecting competition from generics in Emerging Markets ( -3.5% CER, at \u20ac130 million) and in Japan ( -60% CER, at \u20ac26 million),though the effect was partly offset by stronger sales in China (+26.5% CER, at \u20ac59 million). Net sales of Eloxatin\u00aewere down 21.6% CER at \u20ac170 million, hit by a slump in sales in Canada ( -86.2% CER, at \u20ac8 million) due to competition from generics. Net sales of Mozobil\u00aereached \u20ac152 million, up 7% CER, mainly on sales growth in the United States (+14.5% CER, at\u20ac95 million).Zaltrap \u00ae(aflibercept, developed in collaboration with Regeneron) reported a decline in net sales of 14.3% CER to\u20ac65 million. This reflected lower sales in the United States ( -33.3% CER, at \u20ac14 million) and also in Europe ( -7.8% CER, at \u20ac47 million). Diabetes franchise Net sales for the Diabetes franchise amounted to \u20ac7,341 million in 2016, down 3.2% on a reported basis and 1.8% CER. The mainfactor was reduced sales of Lantus \u00aein the United States, where net sales for the Diabetes franchise fell by 4.6% CER to\u20ac4,127 million. Outside the United States, Diabetes franchise net sales reached\u20ac3,214 million, driven by Emerging Markets(+7% CER at\u20ac1,395 million, or +10.7% CER excluding Venezuela). In Europe, net sales were\u20ac1,319 million, down 0.4% CER, as a strong performance from Toujeo \u00aeoffset lower sales of Lantus\u00ae. Net sales of insulin glargines (Lantus\u00aeand Toujeo\u00ae) fell by 1.8% CER to\u20ac6,363 million. Net sales of Lantus\u00aewere down 9.4% CER in 2016, at \u20ac5,714 million. In the United States, sales were down 12.5% CER at\u20ac3,528 million, mainly due to a decrease in the average selling price and patients switching to Toujeo\u00ae. Net sales in Europe fell by 10.3% CER to\u20ac878 million, due largely to the launch of a biosimilar of Lantus\u00aein July 2015. Over the same period, sales of Lantus\u00aein Emerging Markets reached \u20ac953 million, up 6.0% CER (+8.5% CER excluding Venezuela), driven largely by Asia(+13.6% CER, at \u20ac351 million) and especially China. Toujeo \u00ae, a new-generation basal insulin which saw its first launches in 2015, posted net sales of \u20ac649 million, including \u20ac475 million in the United States and \u20ac120 million in Europe. Worldwide rollout continued in 2016, and Toujeo\u00aebecame available in more than 40 countries including United States,Germany, Spain, France, the United Kingdom and Japan. In Japan, the two-week prescription limit was lifted in September2016, resulting in a significant increase in market share (10.8% in December 2016, based on IMS basal insulin market share by value). Net sales of Amaryl \u00aefell by 3.8% CER to \u20ac362 million, mainly due to a drop in sales in Japan ( -30.4% CER, at \u20ac36 million) due to competition from generics. This was to some extent compensated 114 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017(1) Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Puerto Rico.ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS forby sales growth in Europe (+3.8% CER, at \u20ac27 million) and the United States (+50% CER, at \u20ac3 million). In Emerging Markets, the product's sales held steady at \u20ac292 million, although if Venezuela is excluded sales grew by 8.4%. Net sales of Apidra\u00aefell by 1.1% CER to \u20ac367 million. Sales declined in the United States ( -20.7% CER, at \u20ac115 million), reflecting a tougher competitive and pricing environment. However, the effect was partly cushioned by increased sales in EmergingMarkets (+32.4% CER, at \u20ac81 million) and Europe (+2.4% CER, at \u20ac127 million). Lyxumia \u00aegenerated \u20ac33 million of net sales in 2016, down 13.2% CER. Cardiovascular franchise Net sales of Praluent\u00ae(alirocumab, developed in collaboration with Regeneron) reached\u20ac105 million in 2016, of which\u20ac85 million was generated in the United States and\u20ac18 million in Europe, where the product became available in a number of countriesincluding Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and some Nordic countries. Praluent \u00aewas also launched in Japan, Canada and Mexico. Amgen initiated patent infringementproceedings in several countries against Sanofi and Regeneron relating to Praluent \u00aein which Amgen has requested injunctive relief (see Note D.22. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 and Item 8 - \"Updates to Note D.22\" of the annual report for more information). Net sales of Multaq\u00aewere\u20ac353 million (+3.8% CER), of which \u20ac299 million was generated in the United States (+4.2% CER) and \u20ac44 million in Europe (+2.3% CER). Established Prescription Products Net sales of established prescription products in 2016 amounted to \u20ac10,311 million, down 8.7% on a reported basis and 6.8% CER. This mainly reflected the situation in Venezuela (net sales were down 4.9% CER excluding Venezuela), and competition fromgenerics of Plavix \u00aein Japan. In Europe and the United States, net sales of established prescription products fell by 4.8% (to \u20ac3,642 million) and 2.4% (to \u20ac1,490 million), respectively. Net sales of Lovenox\u00aewere\u20ac1,636 million, down 1.7% CER, due largely to competition from generics in the United States ( -29.9% CER, at\u20ac54 million). In Europe, sales of Lovenox\u00aewere 1.1% lower CER at\u20ac1,027 million, as a result of competition from twobiosimilars containing enoxaparin sodium that received a positiveopinion from the CHMP (Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use) of the EMA (European Medicines Agency) in July 2016. Net sales of the product rose by 1.6% CER in Emerging Markets (to \u20ac462 million), or by 3.7% CER if Venezuela is excluded. Net sales of Plavix\u00aewere\u20ac1,544 million ( -18.8% CER), reflecting generic competition in Japan ( -54% CER, at \u20ac355 million) and Europe ( -11.4% CER, at \u20ac162 million). The effect was partly offset by growth in sales of Plavix\u00aein Emerging Markets (+3.4% CER, at \u20ac970 million, or 7.9% excluding Venezuela), especially in China where the product posted net sales of \u20ac701 million (+12.3% CER). Sales of Plavix\u00aein the United States and Puerto Rico are handled by BMS under the terms of the Sanofi-BMS alliance (see Note C.2.,\"Alliance Arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)\", to our consolidated financial statements). Net sales of Renvela \u00ae/Renagel\u00aefell by 1.1% CER to \u20ac922 million. In the United States, net sales advanced by 5.5% CER to\u20ac764 million. Generics of this product began to be sold in some European countries, as a result of which net sales ofRenvela \u00ae/Renagel\u00aein Europe slipped by 31.4% to \u20ac82 million. We expect potential generic competition in the United States in the first half of 2017. Aprovel\u00ae/Avapro\u00aereported a drop in net sales of 7.0% CER to \u20ac681 million, mainly as a result of competition from generics in Europe ( -13.5% CER, at \u20ac127 million) and Japan ( -10.6% CER, at \u20ac82 million). In Emerging Markets (excluding Venezuela), net sales rose by 6.4% CER to\u20ac410 million, mainly on a good performance in China (+9.1% CER, at\u20ac239 million). We have no comments on sales of our other prescription products. Generics Net sales of Generics amounted to \u20ac1,854 million, down 3.3% on a reported basis but up 0.7% CER and 2.5% CER if Venezuela is excluded. Emerging Markets generated net sales of \u20ac785 million (+1.8% CER, or +6.1% CER excluding Venezuela), boosted by Latin America (other than Venezuela), Turkey and China. In Europe, net sales were flat at\u20ac802 million. In the United States, net sales increased by 1.8% CER to\u20ac175 million. In the Rest of the Worldregion, sales reached\u20ac92 million (+1.2% CER), mainly on increased sales of generics in Japan (+1.5% CER, at\u20ac74 million). SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 115ITEM 5.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 5/ Net Sales - Consumer Healthcare (CHC) Segment During 2017, we gradually integrated the Consumer Healthcare operations of BI into our Consumer Healthcare GBU. Following completion of the integration process and with effect from December 31, 2017, we have identified our Consumer Healthcare business as an operating segment. Consequently, the net sales of our Consumer Healthcare business are presented separately below for 2016 and 2015 in the interests of comparability. In 2016,Consumer Healthcareproducts generated net sales of\u20ac3,330 million, down 4.6% on a reported basisand 1.6% CER.

In Emerging Markets, net sales slipped by 7.9% CER to\u20ac1,238 million, reflecting the impact of Venezuela but also lower sales in Russia and China. In Russia, net sales mainly decreased due to the challenging local economic situation. In the Rest of the World region, net sales were up 9.9% at \u20ac275 million, driven by sales in Australia (+10.2% CER, at \u20ac203 million).

SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 119ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 6/ Net Sales - Human Vaccines (Vaccines) Segment In 2016, net sales for the Vaccines segment were \u20ac4,577 million, up 7.4% on a reported basis and 8.8% CER. This rise was driven mainly by sales of influenza vaccines in the United States and Polio/Pertussis/Hib vaccines in Emerging Markets plus sales of Dengvaxia\u00ae, the world's first dengue vaccine. The table below sets forth 2016 and 2015 net sales for our Vaccines segment by product range: (\u20acmillion) 2016 2015Change on a reported basisChange at Vaccines (including Adacel\u00ae) 417 496 -15.9% -15.5% Travel and Other Endemics Vaccines 368 375 -1.9% -0.8% Dengvaxia\u00ae 55 - - - Other Total Vaccines segment(a) 4,577 4,261 +7.4% +8.8% (a) Due to a change in accounting presentation, VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products are included in Other revenues from 2016 onwards. The presentation of prior period Net sales and Other revenues has been amended accordingly. Polio/Pertussis/Hib vaccines posted net sales of \u20ac1,495 million (+12.7% CER). In Emerging Markets, sales for this franchise reached \u20ac832 million (+18.2% CER) due to sales growth for Hexaxim\u00aein the Middle East and Africa (+238.1% CER, at \u20ac205 million). This more than compensated for local disruption inthe Chinese market, which hampered sales for the franchise ( -59.9% CER, at \u20ac112 million). In the United States, net sales amounted to \u20ac405 million (+2.5% CER), with an expected decline in sales of Pentacel\u00ae(-2.0% CER, at \u20ac246 million) more than compensated for by stronger sales of Imovax\u00ae(+22.2% CER, at \u20ac55 million). During 2016, Sanofi Pasteur experienced delays in production of Pentacel\u00ae, which eased during the fourth quarter. Net sales of Influenza vaccines rose by 16.6% CER, to \u20ac 1,521 million. This performance was mainly driven by higher sales for this franchise in the United States (+24.4% CER, at\u20ac1,117 million), supporting Sanofi Pasteur's differentiation strategy in influenza vaccines. Sales of influenza vaccines also rose in Emerging Markets (+3.7% CER, at\u20ac282 million) and in the Rest of the World region (+8.3% CER, at\u20ac39 million), but fell in Europe( -13.5% CER, at \u20ac83 million) mainly due to Sanofi sales to Sanofi Pasteur MSD being deferred to 2017 as a result of inventory repurchases in connection with the termination of Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture.Net sales Menactra\u00aegenerated net sales of \u20ac586 million (+4.8% CER); sales in the United States rose by +4.4% CER to\u20ac516 million largely as a result of trends in orders from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a USfederal agency. Net sales of Dengvaxia \u00aeamounted to \u20ac55 million, reflecting two deliveries for the public dengue vaccination program in the Philippines, the first dose for the public vaccination program in Paran\u00e1 state (Brazil), and sales to the private sector. Net sales of Adult Booster vaccines fell by 15.5% CER to \u20ac417 million, reflecting lower sales in the United States( -16.4% CER, at \u20ac302 million) due to increased competition for Adacel\u00ae. The franchise also recorded a drop in sales in Europe (-29% CER, at \u20ac44 million) mainly driven by supply issues with Repevax\u00aeand Emerging Markets ( -7.4% CER, at \u20ac48 million). Net sales of Travel and Other Endemics vaccines were relatively stable year-on-year at \u20ac368 million. 120 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5.

SPMSD, our joint venture with Merck & Co. in Europe, reported net sales (not included in our consolidated net sales) of\u20ac940 million in 2016, up 14.1% on a reported basis from 2015. The main drivers were growth in sales of Gardasil\u00ae(+30.6%, at \u20ac214 million), the new hexavalent pediatric vaccine Hexyon\u00ae(+201% on a reported basis, at\u20ac110 million), and the chickenpox vaccine Varivax\u00ae(+73.0% on a reported basis, at \u20ac54 million). In March 2016, Sanofi Pasteur and Merck announced their intention to end the SPMSD joint venture, in order to pursue their own distinct growthstrategies in Europe. Sanofi Pasteur and MSD ended their joint venture at the end of December 2016. 7/ Net Sales by Geographical Region The following table presents our net sales by geographical region for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: (\u20acmillion) 2016 2015Change on a reported basisChange at constant Of which Latin America 2,503 Africa 33,821 34,060 -0.7% +1.2% (a) World excluding United States, Canada, Western and Eastern Europe (apart from Eurasia), Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Puerto Rico.

SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 121ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS In the United States , net sales rose by 5.1% CER to \u20ac12,391 million. Lower sales for the Diabetes franchise ( -4.6% CER, at \u20ac4,127 million) and Established Prescription Products (-2.4% CER, at \u20ac1,490 million) were more than compensated for by solid performances for the Vaccines segment (+8.3%, at \u20ac2,540 million), and for the Multiple Sclerosis (+52.7%, at \u20ac1,141 million) and Rare Diseases (+9.4% CER, at \u20ac1,014 million) franchises. InEmerging Markets , net sales reached \u20ac9,593 million, up 2.4% CER (but +7% CER excluding Venezuela). Growth in Emerging Markets was driven by increased sales for Vaccines (+12.4% CER, at\u20ac1,478 million), and the Rare Diseases (+22.9% CER, at \u20ac507 million), and Diabetes (+7% CER, at \u20ac1,395 million) franchises. In Asia , net sales amounted to \u20ac3,468 million (including \u20ac2,039 million in China), representing a rise of 4.8% CER. In theAfrica and Middle East region, net sales were up 10.2% at \u20ac2,405 million, driven by the Middle East (+8.7% CER, at\u20ac1,326 million) and South Africa (+26.2% CER, at \u20ac253 million). Net sales in Latin America totaled \u20ac2,503 million, a fall of 7.1% CER, due mainly to the situation in Venezuela; excludingVenezuela, net sales were up 8.5% CER. The main driver of LatinAmerican sales growth (excluding Venezuela) was the increase insales in Mexico (+5.8% CER, at \u20ac548 million), Argentina (+47.3% CER, at \u20ac267 million), and Colombia (+10% CER, at \u20ac268 million). In Brazil, net sales were \u20ac983 million (+1.7% CER) thanks to the performances of the Rare Diseases franchise, Generics, and the contribution from Dengvaxia \u00ae. In the Eurasia region net sales were up 5.2% CER at\u20ac1,090 million, reflectingstrong sales growth in Turkey and Ukraine, which more than compensated for lower sales in Russia ( -7.1% CER, at \u20ac499 million). Net sales in Russia were adversely affected by a decrease in sales for Consumer Healthcare and the Oncology franchise, partially offset by strong performances from EstablishedPrescription Products, Vaccines, and the Diabetes franchise. In Europe , net sales reached \u20ac8,679 million (+0.6% CER). Positive performances from the Multiple Sclerosis franchise (+62.2% CER, at \u20ac459 million) and the Rare Diseases franchise (+8.6% CER, at \u20ac922 million) offset weaker sales in Established Prescription Products (-4.8% CER, at \u20ac3,642 million) and Vaccines (-5.3% CER, at \u20ac268 million). Net sales in France were \u20ac2,206 million, down 1.9% CER, mainly reflecting lower sales of Lantus\u00ae, Plavix\u00aeand Aprovel\u00ae. In the Rest of the World region, net sales fell by 13.4% CER to\u20ac 3,158 million. This reflects negative performances for Established Prescription Products ( -25.7% CER, at \u20ac1,420 million), and the Diabetes ( -6.5% CER, at \u20ac500 million) and Oncology (-30.3% CER, at \u20ac173 million) franchises, partially offset by positive performances for the Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseasesfranchises and for Consumer Healthcare. In Japan, net sales were \u20ac 1,688 million ( -24.8% CER) reflecting the negative impact of competition from generics of Plavix\u00ae(-54% CER, at \u20ac355 million), though the effect was somewhat cushioned by the performances of the Rare Diseases franchise and Consumer Healthcare. A.3.2. Other income statement items 1/ Other revenues Other revenues mainly comprise royalties under licensing agreements contracted in the ordinary course of business. Due to a change in accounting presentation, VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products are included inOther revenuesfrom 2016 onwards. The presentation of prior periodNet salesandOther revenueshas been amended accordingly. Other revenues rose by 10.7% to \u20ac887 million in 2016, compared with \u20ac801 million in 2015. This year-on-year increase reflects a higher level of sales of non-Sanofi products by VaxServe. 2/ Gross profit Gross profit reached \u20ac24,006 million in 2016 (71.0% of net sales), versus\u20ac23,942 million in 2015 (70.3% of net sales), a rise of 0.3%. The gross margin ratio for the Pharmaceuticals(1)segment was 0.9 of a point higher at 72.4%, mainly due to improved productivity in our industrial facilities. Other factors included a positive impact from the Sanofi Genzyme GBU and the Cardiovascular franchise inthe United States, which more than offset weaker sales for the Diabetes franchise in the United States and competition from generics of Plavix \u00ae. The gross margin ratio for the Vaccines(2)segment was unchanged year-on-year at 62%. 3/ Research and development expenses Research and development ( R&D ) expenses amounted to \u20ac5,172 million in 2016 (versus\u20ac5,082 million in 2015) and represented 15.3% of net sales (versus 14.9% in 2015). The overall year-on-year rise of\u20ac90 million (+1.8%) included\u20ac88 million for the Pharmaceuticals (1) segment (+1.9%) and \u20ac2 million for the Vaccines(2)segment (+0.4%). This slight overall increase reflected cost control measures and reduced spending on Praluent\u00aeand dupilumab, more than offset by higher costs linked to the commencement of a number of PhaseIII studies, in particular on isatuximab. (1) Includes the Consumer Healthcare business and an allocation of global support function costs. For more information see \"- A.2.3 - Segment Results\" above. (2) Includes an allocation of global support function costs. For more information see \"- A.2.3 - Segment Results\" above. 122 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 4/ Selling and general expenses Selling and general expenses totaled \u20ac9,486 million (28.0% of net sales), compared with \u20ac9,382 million in 2015 (27.5% of net sales). This represents a year-on-year rise of \u20ac104 million (+1.1%). By segment, the year on-year increase was \u20ac87 million (+1.0%) for Pharmaceuticals(1)and\u20ac17 million (+2.3%) for Vaccines(2). The rise in costs was mainly due to preparations for the launches of sarilumab (Kevzara\u00ae) and dupilumab (Dupixent\u00ae). 5/ Other operating income and expenses In 2016, other operating income totaled \u20ac355 million (versus \u20ac254 million in 2015), and other operating expenses\u20ac482 million(versus\u20ac462 million in 2015). Overall, this represented a net expense of\u20ac127 million in 2016, versus a net expense of\u20ac208 million in 2015. These items included gains on disposal amounting to \u20ac40 million in 2016; this compares with \u20ac146 million in 2015, which mainly related to intangible assets in the United States.In 2016, they also included \u20ac192 million received under an arbitration settlement of a contractual dispute, and a payment of \u20ac90 million in settlement of litigation regarding generics of Cipro\u00ae. The net overall improvement of \u20ac81 million in other operating income and expenses also reflected a reduction in operating foreign exchange losses on our Venezuelan operations, which fell from\u20ac240 million in 2015 to \u20ac102 million in 2016 (see Note D.26. to our consolidated financial statements). 6/ Amortization of intangible assets Amortization charged against intangible assets amounted to\u20ac1,692 million in 2016, versus\u20ac2,137 million in 2015. This year-on-year decrease of \u20ac445 million reflected (i) the amortization in full, in December 2015, of a priority review voucher acquired in May 2015 for $245 million and used for the filing of a new drug application with the FDA for LixiLan; and (ii) a decrease in amortization charged against the intangible assets recognized on the acquisition of Aventis ( \u20ac482 million in 2016, versus \u20ac637 million in 2015) as some products reached the end of their life cycles. 7/ Impairment of intangible assets In 2016, this line item showed impairment losses of \u20ac192 million against intangible assets, compared with \u20ac767 million in 2015. In 2016, this line item included (i) a net impairment loss of \u20ac 58 million on R&D projects in the Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines segments; and (ii) impairment losses of\u20ac134 million taken against rights relating to a number of marketed products in the Pharmaceuticals segment.In 2015, this line item included (i) a net impairment loss of \u20ac 340 million on R&D projects in the Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines segments, primarily Synvisc-One\u00aein osteoarthritis of the hip and the rotavirus vaccine project (Shantha); and (ii) impairment lossesof\u20ac427 million taken against rights relating to a number of marketed products in the Pharmaceuticals segment, mainlyAfrezza \u00aein the United States (following termination of the license and collaboration agreement with MannKind Corporation) and Auvi-Q\u00ae/Allerject\u00aein the United States and Canada (following the voluntary recall of this product in the fourth quarter of 2015). 8/ Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration Fair value remeasurements of contingent consideration liabilities recognized on acquisitions in accordance with the revised IFRS 3 represented a net expense of\u20ac135 million in 2016, compared with a net gain of\u20ac53 million in 2015. These remeasurements mainly related to (i) the contingent consideration payable to Bayer as a result of an acquisition made by Genzyme prior to the latter's acquisition by Sanofi (expense of\u20ac78 million in 2016 and of\u20ac104 million in 2015); and (ii) anincrease in the market value of the contingent value rights (CVRs) issued by Sanofi in connection with the Genzyme acquisition,which represented a net expense of\u20ac58 million in 2016 and a net gain of\u20ac143 million in 2015 (see Note D.18. to our consolidated financial statements). 9/ Restructuring costs and similar items Restructuring costs and similar items amounted to \u20ac879 million in 2016, compared with\u20ac795 million in 2015. The restructuring costs recognized in 2016 related mainly to the implementation of an organizational transformation program in France ( \u20ac457 million) and in the Rest of the World as part of the 2020 strategic roadmap. With effect from January 1, 2016, this line item includes expenses regarded as equivalent to restructuring costs that have arisen from certain transformation programsimplemented by Sanofi as part of the transformation strategy announced in November 2015, and more specifically programsintended to deliver a global information systems solution, to standardize and consolidate processes, and to transition towards a worldwide services platform. See Note D.27. to our consolidated financial statements. 10/ Other gains and losses, and litigation At the end of December 2016, Sanofi Pasteur and MSD ended their joint venture SPMSD. The derecognition of Sanofi's investment in SPMSD generated a pre-tax gain on disposal of \u20ac211 million. (1) Includes the Consumer Healthcare business and an allocation of global support function costs. For more information see \"- A.2.3 - Segment Results\" above. (2) Includes an allocation of global support function costs. For more information see \"- A.2.3 - Segment Results\" above. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 123ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 11/ Operating income Operating income totaled \u20ac6,534 million for 2016, versus \u20ac5,624 million for 2015, an improvement of 16.2%; this was attributable mainly to lower charges for amortization and impairment of intangible assets, and the gain on disposal of theinvestment in the SPMSD joint venture. 12/ Financial income and expenses Net financial expenses for 2016 were \u20ac856 million in 2016, compared with\u20ac381 million in 2015, an increase of\u20ac475 million. This increase was mainly a result of an impairment loss of \u20ac457 million taken against our shares in Alnylam, which reflected adecline in the market value of those shares as of the reporting date relative to their historical cost; most of that decline occurred when Alnylam decided to discontinue the revusiran developmentprogram on October 5, 2016. Financial expenses directly related to our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (see the definition in \"- Consolidated Balance sheet\" below) amounted to\u20ac218 million in 2016, compared with \u20ac274 million in 2015, in line with a reduction in the cost of debt. Interest expenses relating to post-employment benefit obligations amounted to\u20ac114 million in 2016, the same as in 2015. 13/ Income before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method Income before tax and associates and joint ventures totaled \u20ac5,678 million in 2016, versus\u20ac5,243 million in 2015, a rise of 8.3%. 14/ Income tax expense Income tax expense totaled \u20ac1,326 million in 2016, versus \u20ac709 million in 2015, giving an effective tax rate (based onconsolidated net income) of 23.4% in 2016 compared with 13.5% in 2015 (see Note D.30. to our consolidated financial statements).The year-on-year trend in the effective tax rate was mainly attributable to changes in the geographical mix of our profits and of local tax rates in the territories where we operate, and changes intax rates notably in France and Japan (see Note D.30. to ourconsolidated financial statements). Changes in the level of income tax expense were significantly impacted by the tax effects of the amortization and impairment of intangible assets ( \u20ac694 million in 2016, versus \u20ac1,019 million in 2015) and of restructuring costs ( \u20ac95 million in 2016, versus \u20ac273 million in 2015). The effective tax rate on our business net income(1)is a non-GAAP financial measure. It is calculated on the basis of businessoperating income, minus net financial expenses and before the share of profit/loss from investments accounted for using the equity method and net income attributable to non-controlling interests. We believe the presentation of this measure, used by our management, is also useful for investors as it provides a means to analyze the effective tax cost of our current business activities. Itshould not be seen as a substitute for the effective tax rate on consolidated net income. Our effective tax rate was 23.3% in 2016, compared with 21.7% in 2015. The main impacts on this tax rate were the geographical mix of the profits of Sanofi entities; the tax effects of the elimination of intragroup margin on inventory; favorable settlements of recent proceedings involving the tax authorities in various countries; andchanges in tax rates, particularly in Italy, Japan, Hungary and France. In 2015, there was also a favorable effect as a result of changes in the taxation of dividends in France following a ruling bythe Court of Justice of the European Union and the resulting amendments to the 2015 Finance Act. The table below reconciles our effective tax rate (based on consolidated net income) and the effective tax rate on our business net income: (as a percentage) 2016(a) 2015(a) Effective tax rate on consolidated net income 23.4 13.5 Tax effects: Amortization and impairment of intangible assets 3.7 6.5 Restructuring costs and similar items (1.3) 2.9 Impairment loss charged against theinvestment of Alnylam (1.5) 0 Other items (1.0) (1.2) Effective tax rate on business net income 23.3 21.7 (a) The results of the Animal Health business are presented separately in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations); refer to Notes D.1. and D.36. to ourconsolidated financial statements. 15/ Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method Investments accounted for using the equity method contributed net income of\u20ac134 million in 2016, compared with a net loss of \u20ac22 million in 2015. This line item mainly comprises our share of the profits and losses of Regeneron, which represented net income of \u20ac126 million in 2016 and a net loss of\u20ac54 million in 2015. (1) See definition under section \"A.1.5. Segment information - 3/ Business Net Income\". 124 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS 16/ Net Income excluding the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business Net income excluding the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business amounted to\u20ac4,486 million in 2016, versus \u20ac4,512 million in 2015. 17/ Net income/(loss) of the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business In accordance with IFRS 5, the net income or loss of the Animal Health business is presented in a separate line item,Net income/ (loss) of the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business(see Notes D.1. and D.36. to our consolidated financialstatements). This business reported net income of\u20ac314 million in 2016, compared with a net loss of\u20ac124 million in 2015. The Animal Health business generated operating income of\u20ac678 million in 2016, against\u20ac101 million in 2015. Theyear-on-year increase was mainly due to the discontinuation of depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization ofintangible assets with effect from the end of 2015, when these non-current assets of the Animal Health business were reclassified asAssets held for sale or exchangein accordance with IFRS 5. Income tax expense for the year was\u20ac359 million, compared with\u20ac216 million in 2015.18/ Net income Net income amounted to \u20ac4,800 million in 2016, compared with \u20ac4,388 million in 2015. 19/ Net income attributable to non-controlling Interests Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was \u20ac91 million in 2016, versus \u20ac101 million in 2015. This line item mainly comprises the share of pre-tax profits paid to BMS from territoriesmanaged by Sanofi ( \u20ac86 million, versus \u20ac94 million in 2015). The year-on-year fall was directly related to competition from generics of clopidogrel (active ingredient of Plavix \u00ae) and irbesartan (active ingredient of Aprovel\u00ae) in Europe. 20/ Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi amounted to \u20ac4,709 million, versus\u20ac4,287 million in 2015. Basic earnings per share for 2016 was \u20ac3.66, 11.6% higher than the 2015 figure of \u20ac3.28, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,286.6 million in 2016 (1,306.2 million in 2015). Diluted earnings per share for 2016 was\u20ac3.63, 11.7% higher than the 2015 figure of\u20ac3.25, based on an average number of shares outstanding after dilution of 1,296 million in 2016 and1,320.7 million in 2015. A.3.3. Segment Results Business operating income (as defined in Note D.35. to our consolidated financial statements) amounted to \u20ac9,285 million in 2016 (27.5% of net sales), 0.3% lower than the 2015 amount of\u20ac9,313 million (27.3% of net sales). As indicated in Notes B.26 and D.35. (\"Segment Information\") to our consolidated financial statements, Sanofi has three operating segments: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Human Vaccines (Vaccines). Due to lack of available data and the unduly complex and significant adjustments that would be required (in particular to our reporting tools),the comparative information has not been restated to reflect the changes arising from our new segment reporting model. Consequently, we present segment information for 2016 and 2015 using our previous segment reporting model in the tables below. Business operating income by segment for 2016 and 2015 is set forth below: (\u20acmillion)December 31, income 9,285 9,313 -0.3% (a) Includes Consumer Healthcare and an allocation of global support function costs.

Business Net Income Business net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use to evaluate our performance. See \"- Business Net Income\" above for the definition of this measure, and for a reconciliation toNet income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi. Our business net income for 2016 was \u20ac7,308 million, 0.9% lower than in 2015 ( \u20ac7,371 million). These figures include the business net income of the Animal Health business ( \u20ac476 million in 2016, \u20ac368 million in 2015). Excluding Animal Health, our business net income was \u20ac6,832 million in 2016 (20.2% of net sales) and \u20ac7,003 million in 2015 (20.6% of net sales). We also report \"business earnings per share\", a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as business net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Business earnings per share was \u20ac5.68 in 2016, 0.7% higher than the 2015 figure of \u20ac5.64, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,286.6 million in 2016 and 1,306.2 million in 2015. B/ Liquidity and Capital Resources Our operations generate significant positive cash flows. We fund our day-to-day investments (with the exception of significant acquisitions) primarily with operating cash flow, and pay regular dividends on our shares. We define \"debt, net of cash and cash equivalents\" as (i) the sum total of short-term debt, long-term debt and interest rate and currency derivatives used to hedge debt, minus (ii) the sum total of cash and cash equivalents and interest rate and currencyderivatives used to hedge cash and cash equivalents. We believe the presentation of this non-GAAP financial indicator reviewed by our management is useful as it provides information to measureoverall liquidity and capital resources. As of December 31, 2017 we had reduced our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents to \u20ac5,229 million (versus \u20ac8,206 million), due largely to the receipt of a balancing cash payment as part of the transaction with BI. As of December 31, 2016, our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents stood at\u20ac8,206 million versus\u20ac7,254 million as of December 31, 2015 mainly due to share repurchases made at the end of 2016, carried out in anticipation of the receipt of net proceeds from the transaction with BI finalized in most markets in early 2017. See Note D.17. to our consolidated financial statements. In order to assess the Company's financing risk, we also use the \"gearing ratio\", a non-GAAP financial measure (see table in section \"B.2. Consolidated Balance Sheet and Debt\" below). The gearing ratio is defined as the ratio of debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, to total equity. As of December 31, 2017, our gearingratio was 9.0% of our net equity versus 14.2% as of December 31, 2016 and 12.5% as of December 31, 2015. B.1. Consolidated statement of cash flows Generally, factors that affect our earnings - for example, pricing, volume, costs and exchange rates - flow through to cash from operations. The most significant source of cash from operations is sales of our branded pharmaceutical products and humanvaccines. Receipts of royalty payments also contribute to cash from operations. Summarized consolidated statements of cash flows (\u20acmillion) 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities 7,379 7,838 8,290 Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities (2,896) (2,511) (3,011) Net cash inflow from the exchange of the Animal Health business for BI's Consumer Healthcare business 3,535 - - Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities (7,902) (4,101) (3,578) Impact of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (74) (101) (232) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 42 1,125 1,469 B.1.1. Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to \u20ac7,379 million in 2017, versus\u20ac7,838 million in 2016. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital for 2017 was \u20ac7,231 million, versus \u20ac7,010 million in 2016. Working capital requirements fell by \u20ac148 million in 2017, compared with areduction of \u20ac828 million in 2016; the main factors in 2017 were an increase in accounts receivable of \u20ac529 million and an increase in accounts payable of \u20ac577 million. We run the risk of delayed payments or even non-payment by our customers, who consist principally of wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and government agencies (see \"Item 3.D - Risk Factors - 2. Risks Relating to Our Business - We are subject to the risk of non payment by our customers\"). Over our 128 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS business as a whole, the amount of trade receivables overdue by more than 12 months - which primarily consists of amounts due from public sector bodies - decrease to\u20ac93 million as of December 31, 2017 from\u20ac198 million as of December 31, 2016(see Note D.10. to our consolidated financial statements). Net cash used in investing activities amounted to \u20ac2,896 million in 2017, compared with \u20ac2,511 million in 2016. Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets totaled \u20ac1,956 million, versus \u20ac2,083 million in 2016. There were \u20ac1,388 million of acquisitions of property, plant and equipment(versus\u20ac1,219 million in 2016), most of which were in thePharmaceuticals segment, primarily in industrial facilities. The Vaccines segment invested\u20ac346 million in property, plant and equipment in 2017 (versus\u20ac315 million in 2016). Acquisitions ofintangible assets (\u20ac568 million, versus\u20ac864 million in 2016) mainly comprised contractual payments for intangible rights under license and collaboration agreements. Acquisitions of investments during 2017 amounted to \u20ac 1,312 million, net of cash acquired and after including assumed liabilities and commitments, compared with\u20ac634 million in 2016. In 2017, these included the acquisition of Protein Sciences (\u20ac594 million), our contribution to the Onduo joint venture (\u20ac50 million),and purchases of additional shares (\u20ac184 million). After-tax proceeds from disposals ( \u20ac535 million) arose mainly from the sale of mutual fund investments previously held to meet commitments under post-employment plans; divestments of Consumer Healthcare brands in the United States; and thedivestment of Consumer Healthcare products to Ipsen (for\u20ac83 million). After-tax proceeds from disposals in 2016 amounted to \u20ac209 million and arose mainly from the divestment of the equity interest in Nichi-Iko Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. and the divestment ofproduct rights relating to Oenobiol. Net cash inflow from the exchange of the Animal Health business for BI's Consumer Healthcare business comprised the following items for 2017: (i) the receipt by Sanofi of a balancingcash payment of \u20ac4,207 million; (ii) reimbursements of intragroup accounts with Merial entities totaling \u20ac967 million; (iii) a tax payment of \u20ac1,784 million on the gain arising on the divestment; and (iv) the cash held by the BI subsidiaries acquired by Sanofi.After final enterprise value adjustments, the exchange values of the two businesses effectively transferred during 2017 were determined to be \u20ac10,557 million for Sanofi's Animal Health business and \u20ac6,239 million for BI's Consumer Healthcare business (see Note D.1. to the consolidated financial statements). Net cash used in financing activities amounted to \u20ac7,902 million in 2017, compared with \u20ac4,101 million in 2016. The 2017 figure includes net external debt finance repaid (i.e. net change in short-term and long-term debt) of\u20ac2,297 million; this compares with net external debt financing raised of\u20ac2,293 million in 2016. It also includes the effect of changes in share capital (repurchases ofown shares, net of capital increases), amounting to \u20ac1,843 million (versus \u20ac2,603 million in 2016), and the dividend payout to our shareholders of\u20ac3,710 million (versus\u20ac3,759 million in 2016). The net change in cash and cash equivalents during 2017 was an increase of \u20ac42 million. B.1.2. Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities excluding the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business amounted to\u20ac7,838 million in 2016, versus\u20ac8,290 million in 2015. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital (excluding the net income or loss of the held-for-exchange Animal Health business) for 2016 was\u20ac7,010 million, versus\u20ac7,235 million in 2015. Working capital requirements fell by\u20ac828 million in 2016, compared with a reduction of\u20ac1,055 million in 2015, mainly reflecting a\u20ac447 million increase in accounts payable and a\u20ac168 million reduction in accounts receivable. Our operating cash flow before changes in working capital is generally affected by the same factors that affect Operating income , which is discussed in detail above under \"Results of Operations - Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2015\". The principal difference is that operating cash flow before changes in working capital includes our share of the profits and losses from investments accounted forusing the equity method, net of dividends and similar income received. Net cash used in investing activities excluding the exchange d/held-for-exchange Animal Health business amounted to \u20ac2,511 million in 2016, compared with \u20ac3,011 million in 2015. Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets totaled \u20ac2,083 million, compared with \u20ac2,772 million in 2015. The main items were investments in industrial and research facilities (\u20ac1,267 million, versus\u20ac1,163 million in 2015) and contractualpayments for intangible rights, primarily under license and collaboration agreements (\u20ac668 million, versus\u20ac1,465 million in 2015). Acquisitions of investments during 2016 amounted to \u20ac634 million, net of cash acquired and after including assumed liabilities and commitments, versus\u20ac362 million in 2015. In 2016, these acquisitions included our contribution to the Onduo joint venture, and purchase of additional shares in Regeneron. After-tax proceeds from disposals amounted to \u20ac209 million, and arose mainly from the sale of the equity interest in Nichi-Iko Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. and of product rights relating to Oenobiol\u00ae. In 2015, after-tax proceeds from disposals totaled \u20ac211 million, and related mainly to the divestment of our equityinterest in Merrimack Pharmaceuticals and the sale of rights to Sklice \u00aeto Arbor Pharmaceuticals LLC in the United States. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 129ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS Net cash used in financing activities excluding the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business amounted to\u20ac4,101 million in 2016, compared with\u20ac3,578 million in 2015. The 2016 figure includes net external debt financing raisedof\u20ac2,293 million (\u20ac1,346 million in 2015); the effect of changes in our share capital (repurchases of own shares, net of capital increases), amounting to\u20ac2,603 million (\u20ac1,211 million in 2015);and the dividend payout to our shareholders of\u20ac3,759 million (\u20ac3,694 million in 2015). The net change in cash and cash equivalents excluding the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business was an increase of \u20ac1,125 million in 2016, compared with an increase of \u20ac1,469 million in 2015.Net cash flows for the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business represented net cash inflows of \u20ac339 million in 2016 and \u20ac361 million in 2015. This comprised a net cash inflow from operating activities of \u20ac346 million in 2016 ( \u20ac630 million in 2015); a net cash outflow from investing activities of \u20ac126 million (\u20ac246 million in 2015); and a net cash outflow from financing activities of \u20ac111 million ( \u20ac23 million in 2015). B.2. Consolidated balance sheet and debt Total assets were \u20ac99,826 million as of December 31, 2017, compared with \u20ac104,672 million a year earlier, a decrease of \u20ac4,846 million. Our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents was\u20ac5,229 million as of December 31, 2017, compared with \u20ac8,206 million as of December 31, 2016. We believe the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure, which is reviewed by our management, provides useful information to measure our overall liquidity and capital resources. We define \"debt, net of cash and cash equivalents\" as (i) the sum total of short term debt, long term debt, and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to hedge debt, minus (ii) the sum total of cash and cash equivalents and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to hedge cash and cash equivalents.

Our gearing ratio (debt, net of cash and cash equivalents as a proportion of total equity) fell from14.2% in 2016 to 9.0% in 2017. Analyses of debt as ofDecember 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, by type, maturity, interest rate and currency, are provided in Note D.17. to ourconsolidated financial statements. We expect that the future cash flows generated by our operating activities will be sufficient to repay our debt. The financing arrangements in place as of December 31, 2017 at Sanofi parent company level are not subject to covenants regarding financial ratios and do not contain any clauses linking credit spreads or feesto our credit rating. Other key movements in the balance sheet are described below.Total equity amounted to \u20ac58,258 million as of December 31, 2017, versus \u20ac57,724 million as of December 31, 2016. The net year-on-year increase in equity was attributable primarily to:increases: our net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 (\u20ac8,555 million); and decreases: the dividend payout to our shareholders in respect ofthe 2016 financial year ( \u20ac3,710 million), the net change in currency translation differences ( \u20ac3,240 million, mainly on the US dollar), repurchases of our own shares ( \u20ac2,159 million), and actuarial losses on pensions and other post-employment benefits (\u20ac117 million). As of December 31, 2017, we held 0.2 million of our own shares, recorded as a deduction from equity and representing 0.01% of our share capital. 130 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS Goodwill and Other intangible assets (\u20ac53,344 million in total) rose by \u20ac2,178 million year-on-year, the main factors being: increases: movements related to the acquisition of BI's Consumer Healthcare business ( \u20ac2,222 million of goodwill and \u20ac3,771 million of other intangible assets); and decreases: amortization and impairment charged during the period (\u20ac2,311 million) and movements in currency translation differences ( \u20ac3,315 million). Investments accounted for using the equity method (\u20ac2,863 million) decreased by \u20ac27 million mainly as a result of currency translation differences on the investment in Regeneron, partlyoffset by acquisitions of additional Regeneron shares and ourshare of the net income of Regeneron. Other non-current assets were \u20ac544 million higher at \u20ac 3,364 million. The main movement during the year was an appreciation of \u20ac780 million (including currency translation effects) in the market value of our equity investment in Alnylam.Non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities were \u20ac 320 million higher year-on-year at \u20ac9,154 million, mainly as a result of the recognition at December 31, 2017 of the portion of the tax liability arising from the US tax reform that falls due after morethan one year. Deferred taxes represented a net asset of \u20ac2,685 million, a year-on-year increase of \u20ac308 million, mainly due to reversals of deferred tax liabilities on the remeasurement of acquired intangible assets ( \u20ac1,084 million). The effect was partly offset by a reduction in accrued expenses and provisions that are tax-deductible at thetime of payment, and the effects of reduced tax rates in France and the United States. Liabilities related to business combinations and to non-controlling interests decreased by \u20ac207 million to \u20ac1,369 million. The main movements in this item are fair value remeasurements of contingent consideration payable to Bayer as a result of an acquisition made by Genzyme prior to the latter'sacquisition by Sanofi (see Note D.18. to our consolidated financialstatements). B.3. Liquidity We expect that our existing cash resources and cash fromoperations will be sufficient to finance our foreseeable working capital requirements. At year-end 2017, we held cash and cash equivalents amounting to\u20ac10,315 million, substantially all of whichwere held in euros (see Note D.13. to our consolidated financialstatements included at Item 18 of this annual report). As at December 31, 2017, our subsidiaries based in Venezuela held cash and cash equivalents in bolivars representing\u20ac7 million,which are subject to foreign exchange controls (see Note A.4. toour consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report). As at December 31, 2017,\u20ac556 million of our cashand cash equivalents were held by our captive insurance and reinsurance companies in accordance with insurance regulations. We run the risk of delayed payments or even non-payment by our customers, who consist principally of wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and government agencies (see \"Item 3.D. Risk Factors - 2. Risks Relating to Our Business - We are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers\").Deteriorating credit and economic conditions and other factors in some countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time taken to collect our accounts receivable in these countries. Should these factors continue, it mayrequire us to re-evaluate the collectability of these receivables in future periods. We carefully monitor sovereign debt issues andeconomic conditions and evaluate accounts receivable in thesecountries for potential collection risks. We have been conducting an active recovery policy, adapted to each country and including intense communication with customers, negotiations of paymentplans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal action. Over our business as a whole, the amount of trade receivables overdue by more than 12 months (which primarily consists of amounts duefrom public sector bodies) decreased from \u20ac198 million as of December 31, 2016 to\u20ac93 million as of December 31, 2017 (seeNote D.10. to our consolidated financial statements). In November 2011, Sanofi obtained the necessary corporate authorizations to purchase any or all of the outstanding Contingent Value Rights (\"CVR\") and subsequently purchased CVRs in 2011.In 2012 following a tender offer initiated in September 2012 on thebasis of the same corporate authorization, Sanofi purchased anadditional 40,025,805 CVRs (for a total consideration of approximately $70 million), followed by a further 10,928,075 CVRs(for approximately $9 million) in 2013, 1,879,774 CVRs (for approximately $1 million) in 2014, and none in 2015, 2016 and 2017. As of December 31, 2017, a total of 236,457,284 CVRs were outstanding out of the 291,313,510 issued at the time of theGenzyme acquisition. At year-end 2017, we had no commitments for capital expenditures that we consider to be material to our consolidated financial position. Undrawn confirmed credit facilities amounted to a total of \u20ac8 billion at December 31, 2017. For a discussion of our treasury policies, see \"Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\" We expect that cash from our operations will be sufficient to repay our debt. For a discussion of our liquidity risks, see \"Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\" SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 131ITEM 5.

The table above does not include the ongoing annual employer's contributions to plan assets, estimated at \u20ac136 million in 2017. 132 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS We may have payments due to our current or former research and development partners under collaborative agreements. These agreements typically cover multiple products, and give us the option to participate in development on a product-by-product basis.When we exercise our option with respect to a product, we pay our collaboration partner a fee and receive intellectual property rights to the product in exchange. We are also generally required to fundsome or all of the development costs for the products that we select, and to make payments to our partners when those products reach development milestones. We have entered into collaboration agreements under which we have rights to acquire products or technology from third parties through the acquisition of shares, loans, license agreements, joint development, co-marketing and other contractual arrangements. Inaddition to upfront payments on signature of the agreement, our contracts frequently require us to make payments contingent upon the completion of development milestones by our alliance partneror upon the granting of approvals or licenses.Because of the uncertain nature of development work, it isimpossible to predict (i) whether Sanofi will exercise further options for products, or (ii) whether the expected milestones will be achieved, or (iii) the number of compounds that will reach therelevant milestones. It is therefore impossible to estimate the maximum aggregate amount that Sanofi will actually pay in the future under existing collaboration agreements. Given the nature of its business, it is highly unlikely that Sanofi will exercise all options for all products or that all milestones will be achieved. The main collaboration agreements relating to development projects are described in Note D.21.1. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18 of this annual report. Milestone payments relating to development projects under theseagreements included in the table above exclude projects still in the research phase ( \u20ac7.2 billion in 2017, \u20ac6.2 billion in 2016) and payments contingent upon the attainment of sales targets once a product is on the market ( \u20ac10.1 billion in 2017, \u20ac8.2 billion in 2016). SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 133ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees A. Directors and Senior Management Since January 1, 2007, Sanofi has separated the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Successive annual evaluations conducted since that date have indicated that this governance structure is appropriate to Sanofi's currentconfiguration. This arrangement was maintained with the appointment of Serge Weinberg to the office of Chairman firstly on May 17, 2010, then on May 6, 2011 and again on May 4, 2015.The Board of Directors regards this governance structure as appropriate to the current context. The Chairman organizes and directs the work of the Board, and is responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of the corporate decision-making bodies in compliance with good governance principles. The Chairman coordinates the work of the Board of Directors with that of its Committees. He ensures that theCompany's management bodies function properly, and in particular that the directors are able to fulfil their duties. The Chairman is accountable to the Shareholders' General Meeting, which he chairs. In addition to these roles conferred by law, the Chairman: in coordination with the Chief Executive Officer, liaises between the Board of Directors and the shareholders of the Company; is kept regularly informed by the Chief Executive Officer ofsignificant events and situations affecting the affairs of the Company, and may request from the Chief Executive Officer anyinformation useful to the Board of Directors; may, in close collaboration with the Chief Executive Officer, represent the Company in high-level dealings with governmental bodies and with key partners of the Company and/or of its subsidiaries, both nationally and internationally; seeks to prevent any conflict of interest and manages anysituation that might give rise to a conflict of interest. He also gives rulings, in the name of the Board, on requests to take upexternal directorships of which he may become aware or that may be submitted to him or her by a director; may interview the statutory auditors in preparation for the work of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee; and strives to promote in all circumstances the values and image ofthe Company. The Chairman is also required to develop and maintain a properrelationship of trust between the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, so as to ensure that the latter consistently and continuouslyimplements the orientations determined by the Board. In fulfilling his remit, the Chairman may meet with any individual, including senior executives of the Company, while avoiding anyinvolvement in directing the Company or managing its operations, which are exclusively the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer. Finally, the Chairman reports to the Board on the fulfilment of his remit. An internal rule applied within Sanofi stipulates that a director cannot be appointed or reappointed once he or she has reached the age of 70. A resolution to incorporate that rule into our Articlesof Association, bringing the situation of the Chairman of the Boardinto line with that of the other directors, will be submitted to the approval of the Annual General Meeting of May 2, 2018. The Chief Executive Officer manages the Company, and represents it in dealings with third parties within the limit of the corporate purpose. The Chief Executive Officer has the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of the Company, subject to the powers that are attributed by law to the Board ofDirectors and to the Shareholders' General Meeting and within the limits set by the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer must be less than 65 years old. Limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer set by the Board With effect from March 6, 2018, the limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer are specified in the Board Charter. Without prejudice to legal provisions regarding authorizations that must be granted by the Board (regulated agreements, guarantees,divestments of equity holdings or real estate, etc.), prior approval from the Board of Directors is required for transactions or decisions resulting in an investment or divestment, or an expenditure orguarantee commitment, made by the Company and its subsidiaries, in excess of: a cap of \u20ac500 million (per transaction) for transactions, decisions or commitments pertaining to a previously approved strategy; and a cap of \u20ac150 million (per transaction) for transactions, decisions or commitments not pertaining to a previously approved strategy. When such transactions, decisions or commitments give rise to installment payments to the contracting third party (or parties) that are contingent upon future results or objectives, such as theregistration of one or more products, attainment of the caps iscalculated by aggregating the various payments due from signature of the contract until (and including) filing of the first application for marketing authorization in the United States or in Europe. Attainment of the above caps is also assessed after taking into account all commitments to make payments on exercise of a firm 134 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES orconditional option with immediate or deferred effect, and all guarantees or collateral to be provided to third parties over the duration of such commitments. The prior approval procedure does not apply to transactions and decisions that result in the signature of agreements that solely involve subsidiaries and the Company itself. Board of Directors Each year, the Board of Directors conducts a review to ensure thatthere is an appropriate balance in its composition and in the composition of its Committees. In particular, the Board seeks to ensure gender balance, a broad diversity of competencies andcountries of origin, and international experiences, reflecting our status as a diversified global business. The Board investigates and evaluates not only potential candidates, but also whether existingdirectors should seek reappointment. Above all, the Board seeksdirectors who show independence of mind and are competent, dedicated and committed, with compatible and complementary personalities. As of December 31, 2017 the Board of Directors had 16 members, including two directors representing employees. 44% of the directors were women and 38% were non-French nationals. Subject to the powers expressly attributed to the Shareholders' General Meeting and within the scope of the Company's corporate purpose, the Board of Directors' remit covers all issues relating to the proper management of the Company, and through its decisions the Board determines matters falling within its authority. The rules and operating procedures of our Board of Directors are defined by law, by our Articles of Association, and by our Board charter (an English language version of which is reproduced in full as Exhibit 1.2 to this Annual Report on Form 20-F). Term of office The term of office of directors is four years. Directors are required to seek reappointment by rotation, such that members of the Board are required to seek reappointment on a regular basis in the most equal proportions possible. Exceptionally, the Shareholders'Ordinary General Meeting may appoint a director to serve for aterm of one, two or three years, in order to ensure adequate rotation of Board members. Each director standing down is eligible for reappointment. Should one or more directorships fall vacant asa result of death or resignation, the Board of Directors may make provisional appointments in the period between two Shareholders'General Meetings, in accordance with applicable laws. Directors may be removed from office at any time by a Shareholders' General Meeting.Independence of Board Members Under the terms of the AFEP-MEDEF corporate governance code(the AFEP-MEDEF Code), a director is independent when he or she has no relationship of any kind whatsoever with the Company, its group or its senior management that may color his or herjudgment. More specifically, a director can only be regarded asindependent if he or she: is not (and has not been during the past five years):-an employee or executive officer of the Company; -an employee, executive officer or director of an entity consolidated by the Company; or -an employee, executive officer or director of the Company's parent, or of an entity consolidated by that parent (criterion 1); is not an executive officer of an entity in which (i) the Company directly or indirectly holds a directorship or (ii) an employee of the Company is designated as a director or (iii) an executive officer of the Company (currently, or who has held office within the past five years) holds a directorship (criterion 2); is not a customer, supplier, investment banker or corporate banker that is material to the Company or its group, or for whom the Company or its group represents a significant proportion of its business (criterion 3); has no close family ties with a corporate officer of the Company (criterion 4); has not acted as auditor for the Company over the course of thepast five years (criterion 5); does not represent a shareholder that has a significant or controlling interest in the Company (criterion 6); or does not receive variable compensation in cash or in the form of shares or any compensation linked to the performance of the Company or its group (criterion 7). The influence of other factors such as length of service on the Board, the ability to understand challenges and risks, and the courage to express ideas and form a judgment, is also evaluated before it is decided whether a director can be regarded as independent. In compliance with our Board Charter and pursuant to the AFEP- MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors' meeting of March 6, 2018 discussed the independence of the current directors. Of the sixteendirectors, eleven were deemed to be independent directors byreference to the independence criteria used by the Board ofDirectors pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code: Serge Weinberg, Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Melanie CarolePiwnica, Diane Souza C. S\u00fcdhof. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 135ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES Consequently, the proportion of independent directors is 79%. This compares with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendation of 50% in companies with dispersed ownership and no controlling shareholder (which is the case for Sanofi). In accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, directors representing employees are excluded when calculating the proportion of independent directors.

S\u00fcdhof Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Independent Failure to fulfil one of the criteria does not automatically disqualify adirector from being independent. The Board's conclusions on specific cases are set out below. (1) Business Relationships Review In its examination of the independence of each director, the Board of Directors took into account the various relationships between directors and Sanofi and concluded that no relationships were of akind that might undermine their independence. The Board ofDirectors noted that the Company and its subsidiaries had, in the normal course of business, over the past three years, sold products and provided services to, and/or purchased products and receivedservices from, companies in which certain of the Company's directors who are classified as independent (or their close family members) were senior executives or employees during 2017. Ineach case, the amounts paid to or received from such companies over the past three years were determined on an arm's length basis and did not represent amounts that the Board regarded asundermining the independence of the directors in question. (2) Serge Weinberg When the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer were temporarily combined on October 29, 2014, the Board of Directors determined that Serge Weinberg - given his role as Chief Executive Officer - could no longer be regarded asindependent. When the two offices were separated again in April2015, the Board of Directors determined that Serge Weinberg could be regarded as independent and could therefore resume the chairmanship of the Appointments and Governance Committee. Under Article 8.6 of the amended AFEP-MEDEF Code issued in November 2016, a non-executive officer cannot be regarded asindependent if he or she receives variable compensation in cash or shares or any compensation linked to the performance of theCompany or group. This is consistent with recommendations madeby the AMF in its 2017 report on corporate governance, executivecompensation, internal control and risk management. Serge Weinberg complies with this criterion, in that he receives fixedcompensation only, with no entitlement to variable compensation in either cash or shares. (3) Robert Castaigne The Board of Directors considers that the situation of Robert Castaigne has changed since his first appointment to the Board.Prior to 2012, Robert Castaigne had not been regarded as an independent director due to his past relationship with Total. Since April 2008, when the independence criteria of the AFEP-MEDEFCode were adopted, his situation has changed in two ways: Robert Castaigne retired from Total more than four years ago; Total passed below the 5% threshold of our voting rights (as per the notification of February 16, 2012). Later in 2012, Total ceased to have any equity interest in Sanofi. Consequently, the Board of Directors took the view that Robert Castaigne's historical links with Total no longer created apresumption of non-independence. Moreover, the Board of Directors does not believe that belonging to the Board for more than 12 years of itself disqualifies a directorfrom being independent. The length of Board service criterion isintended to address the concern that the passage of time may deprive a director of his ability to challenge senior management. This is a legitimate concern, which Sanofi takes very seriously. This is why the Board of Directors applies this criterion pragmatically in light of the specific circumstances of each case. In the case of Robert Castaigne, the Board considers that he has demonstrated great independence of mind, which is fundamentallywhat the AFEP-MEDEF criteria are seeking to ensure. For more 136 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES information see \"C. Board Practices - Application of the AFEP- MEDEF Code\", below. Finally, there was no other factor calling into question Robert Castaigne's independence. Consequently, the Board determined on that basis, at its meeting ofMay 4, 2012 and upon the recommendation of its Appointments and Governance Committee, that Robert Castaigne qualified as anindependent director. That position was reiterated at the Boardmeeting of March 6, 2018. This decision has no effect on compliance with the independence rules of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, which is the main objective of the Code. The fact that the proportion of independent directors on the Board is 79% demonstrates that the Board in no wayunderestimates the importance of having a majority of independent directors in its governance. Robert Castaigne's term of office expires at the Annual General Meeting of May 2, 2018, and he will not be proposed for reappointment. That decision has been taken pursuant to an internal rule whereby a director cannot be appointed or reappointed once he or she has reached the age of 70. That rule was previously appliedon the expiry of the terms of office of other Sanofi directors, namely Klaus Pohle, Igor Landau, Jean-Ren\u00e9 Fourtou and Uwe Bicker. In the interests of clarity and transparency, a resolution to amend ourArticles of Association to incorporate that rule will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting of May 2, 2018 for approval. Board evaluation Under the terms of the Board Charter, a discussion of the Board's operating procedures must be included on the agenda of one Board meeting every year. The Charter also requires a formal evaluation to be performed every three years under the direction ofthe Appointments and Governance Committee, with assistance from an independent consultant if deemed necessary. In 2016, the evaluation was conducted using a questionnaire, supplemented by subsequent meetings between some directors and the Secretary to the Board. The results were presented at the Board meeting of March 2, 2017, with the directors welcoming theprogress made since the previous evaluation. The 2017 Board evaluation was again based on a questionnaire, containing more than one hundred questions. Each director was allowed a few weeks to complete the questionnaire using a secure digital platform. The responses were then analyzed by theSecretary to the Board, and supplemented by one-on-oneinterviews. The results were presented to, and discussed by, the Appointments and Governance Committee. A detailed report prepared at that meeting was presented at the Board meeting ofMarch 6, 2018. Once again, directors welcomed the improvements in how the Board and its Committees operate since the previous evaluation: meetings were well prepared, the time spent on meetings has beenbetter used, discussions were lively and decisions taken by theBoard rigorously followed up. The Board also appreciated the addition of further high-level scientific and pharmaceutical expertise to the Board, coupled with further progress on increasing the proportions of non-French and female directors. Finally, the directors judged the current governance structure (separation of the office of Chairman of the Board from that of Chief Executive Officer) to be appropriate to the Company's needs and tobe working effectively. The issues most frequently raised in the evaluation were the diversity and complementarity of the Board following the appointment of the new directors, the role of the Committees, executive sessions, an update on the implementation of the Company's digital strategy, and implementation of the external growth strategy. The areas for progress and vigilance identified by the Board in the latest evaluation were: continuing to work on succession planning for the ChiefExecutive Officer and key executive posts; closer monitoring of the principal risks facing Sanofi; deeper understanding of changes in the industry environment(markets and competition), and the potential implications for Sanofi; deeper strategic thinking; ex post assessment of the impact of strategic decisions,especially acquisitions; preparation of more detailed reports by the Appointments andGovernance Committee; increase in the number of executive sessions. With the terms of office of some directors coming up for renewal in2018, their contribution to the work of the Board and its Committees was assessed and in each case was judged to havemet the Group's needs and to have been in line with its expectations. More generally, the Board found that directors hadonce again demonstrated strong commitment and were working well together. The diversity of their competencies, expertise andprofiles contributed significantly to the quality of the work done by the Board and its Committees. Succession planning The remit of the Appointments and Governance Committee includes preparing for the future of the Company's executive bodies, in particular through the establishment of a succession plan for executive officers. This plan, which is regularly reviewed, addresses three scenarios:unplanned vacancy due to prohibition, resignation or death; forced vacancy due to poor performance, mismanagement or misconduct; and planned vacancy due to retirement or expiration of term of office. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 137ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES Through its work and discussions, the Committee seeks to devise a succession plan that is adaptable to situations arising in the short, medium or long term. Although aware that separating the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer provides continuity of power, the Committee nonetheless assesses the situation of the Chairman as well as that of the executive team. To fulfill its remit, the Appointments and Governance Committee:provides the Board with progress reports, in particular at executive sessions, so as to ensure that the Committee's work is consistent with the Company's strategic ambitions; co-ordinates with the Compensation Committee. In that regard,having directors that sit on both Committees is a great advantage;works closely with the Chief Executive Officer to (i) ensure theplan is consistent with the Company's own practices and market practices, (ii) ensure high-potential internal prospects receive appropriate support and training, and (iii) check there is adequate monitoring of key posts likely to fall vacant; meet with key executives as needed; and involve the Chief Executive Officer insofar as he has a key role in planning for his own successor, though without him directing the process. In fulfilling their remit, Committee members are acutely consciousof confidentiality issues.

In assessing its composition, the Board takes account of the corporate strategy, and of the new challenges facing the Company, and determines whether the qualities of serving directors are sufficient for the Board to deliver on its remit.Over the past two years, the Board has altered its composition in line with its roadmap by: bringing additional scientific expertise onto the Board; further raising the proportion of non-French directors; increasing the proportion of women on the Board; and developing its competencies in digital. The Board has completed an overview of the key competencies currently represented. The matrix below shows a comprehensive, balancedspread of the types of competencies required, both in general terms and by reference to our strategic ambitions (the matrix shows the number of directors possessing each of those competencies)(1): Scientific training 5 Healthcare/pharmaceutical industry experience5 CEO role in international group 4 Board membership in international group7 International experience 8 Mergers & acquisitions 7 Finance/Accounting 4 Regulatory 6 Digital 1 The Annual General Meeting of May 2, 2018 will be asked toreappoint Olivier Brandicourt, Patrick Kron, and Christian Mulliez as directors.

B. Compensation Compensation and arrangements for corporate officers Compensation policy for executive officers This section describes the compensation policy for executiveofficers, as established pursuant to Article L. 225-37-2 of the French Commercial Code. It sets forth the principles and criteria used in determining, allocating and awarding the fixed, variable andexceptional components that collectively comprise the total compensation and benefits of whatever kind awarded to our executive officers in respect of the office they hold. 160 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES The payment and award in a given year of any variable and exceptional components of compensation as described below that may arise in respect of the previous year are contingent on approval by the shareholders in an Ordinary General Meeting ofthe compensation package of the executive officer in question, on the terms stipulated in Article L. 225-100 of the French Commercial Code. That condition - which affects the Chief Executive Officer only,given that the compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors (when the two offices are separated) consists solely offixed compensation and benefits in kind - applies in this case tothe following components of compensation: annual variable compensation (established on the basis partly of quantitative criteria, and partly of qualitative criteria); equity-based compensation (subject to fulfillment of performance conditions). The compensation policy for executive officers is established by the Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. The members of that Committee, the majority of whom are independent directors, were chosen for their technical competencies and their good understanding of currentstandards, future developments and Sanofi's practices. To fulfill their remit, the Committee regularly invites the Head of Human Resources and the Head of Compensation and Employee Benefits to attend their meetings, although they absent themselveswhen the Committee deliberates. Committee members also work with the Secretary to the Board, who has contacts with our principal shareholders ahead of the Annual General Meeting. In addition, the Chairman of the Committee:discusses the financial, accounting and tax impacts of the proposed compensation policy with the Chairman of the Audit Committee; plays an active role at meetings of the Appointments and Governance Committee and the Strategy Committee (to both of which he belongs), thereby gaining assurance that the proposedcriteria are consistent and appropriate in light of Sanofi'sstrategic ambitions. The Committee obtains assurance at the start of each year as to the level of attainment of the performance criteria for the past financial year. The Board of Directors applies the AFEP-MEDEF Code when determining the compensation and benefits awarded to our corporate officers and executive officers.Compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors The compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors is identical to that approved by the Annual General Meeting of Sanofi shareholders on May 10, 2017. The compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors (where the office of Chairman is separate from that of Chief Executive Officer, as is currently the case) consists solely of fixed compensation and benefits in kind and excludes any variable or exceptional compensation, any awards of stock options orperformance shares, and any directors' attendance fees. Where the office of Chairman is separate from that of Chief Executive Officer, as is currently the case, the Chairman of the Board is not entitled to the Sanofi top-up defined-benefit pensionplan. Nor is he entitled to a termination benefit or a non-compete indemnity. Executive officers do not receive attendance fees in their capacity as directors. The Chairman of the Board does not receive attendance fees in his capacity as Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Appointments and Governance Committee or Chairman of the Strategy Committee. Compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer The compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer is identical to that approved by the Annual General Meeting of Sanofi shareholders on May 10, 2017. Clarifications were nevertheless given on: the composition of the benchmark panel used as a basis for comparison for the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, which has been aligned on that used for TSR in our equity-basedcompensation plans; the performance conditions applicable to the pension entitlement of the Chief Executive Officer. The compensation policy of the Chief Executive Officer is based on the same structures and principles as the general Sanofi compensation policy. General principles The Sanofi compensation policy seeks to be consistent with market and industry practice in order to provide competitive levels of compensation, create a strong link between company and individual performance, and maintain a balance between short- term performance and medium-/long-term performance. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 161ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES The compensation of the Chief Executive Officer is set by the Board of Directors acting on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, with reference to compensation paid to the chief executive officers of the following ten leading globalpharmaceutical companies: AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol- Myers-Squibb Inc., Eli Lilly and Company Inc., Johnson & Johnson Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., andRoche Holding Ltd. This panel comprises companies that are comparable to Sanofi. Consistency with market practice is fundamental in order to attract and retain the talents necessary to our success. We also review the practices of the principal CAC 40 companies in order to reach a fair balance and to take into account our corporate interest, market practices, the performance of the Chief Executive Officer, and ourother stakeholders. Equity-based compensation is a critical tool for our worldwide attractiveness as an employer, and aims to align employee and shareholder interests and reinforce employees' ties to Sanofi. Acting on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors determines the performance conditions attached to equity-based compensation for all beneficiaries at Sanofi and its subsidiaries worldwide, favoring the attainment of objectives based on our consolidated results and balance sheet. Our equity-based compensation plan rules are made available toour shareholders on the governance page of our website( www.sanofi.com ) in the same form as that distributed to our employees. Since 2011, the Board of Directors has substantially reworked our equity-based compensation policy to reinforce the link with long- term performance for all beneficiaries and to reduce potentialdilution. As a result of very positive and encouraging shareholderfeedback collected through corporate governance roadshows, contacts with governance professionals and the results of votes atAnnual General Meetings, the Board decided to maintain this policy. The current policy can generally be characterized by reduced dilution; diversified, multi-year performance conditions; increased transparency; and specific additional requirements for the Chief Executive Officer. The policy requires that grants be primarily based on performance shares with only a limited number of high-level executives continuing to receive stock options. Greater reliance on performance shares makes it possible to maintain a comparable level of employee incentivization while reducing the dilutive effect of equity-based compensation plans for existing shareholders. However, the Board of Directors continues to believe that due to their ratchet effect, options remain an appropriate component of the compensation of high levelexecutives.The Board of Directors makes any grant of stock options or performance shares contingent on several distinct performance criteria in order to ensure that our equity-based compensation plans incentivize overall performance and do not encourage excessive risk taking. Failure to achieve these criteria over the entire performance measurement period results in a reduction orloss of the initial grant. Grants are also contingent on the beneficiary's continued employment in the Sanofi group during the lock-up period (4 years for options, 3 years for performance shares, followed by further stringent lock-up obligations in the case of the Chief Executive Officer). The exercise price of stock options is set by the Board, never incorporates a discount, and must be at least equal to the average of the quoted market prices on the 20 trading sessions preceding the date of grant by the Board. The Board is not allowed to reset the terms of prior grants, for instance with easier performance conditions or a lower exercise price. On taking up office When the Chief Executive Officer is an outside appointment, theBoard of Directors may decide, acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, to compensate the appointee for some or all of the benefits he may have forfeited on leaving his previous employer. In such a case, the terms on which the Chief Executive Officer is hired aim to replicate the diversity of what wasforfeited, with a comparable level of risk (variable portion, medium-term equity-based or cash compensation) During the term of office Compensation structure Our policy aims at achieving a balance in the compensationstructure between fixed compensation, benefits in kind, short-term variable cash compensation, and medium-term variable equity- based compensation. The proportions of annual fixed and variablecompensation are not subject to annual review. Compensation adjustments based on performance and market practice are effected primarily through equity-based compensation, which ismedium-term and aims at aligning the interests of the Chief Executive Officer with those of our shareholders and stakeholders. Our overall compensation policy is designed to motivate and reward performance by ensuring that a significant portion of compensation is contingent on the attainment of financial,operational and social criteria aligned with the corporate interest and with the creation of shareholder value. Variable cashcompensation and equity-based compensation are the two principal levers for action. 162 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES Annual variable compensation Annual variable compensation is in a range between 0% and 250% of fixed compensation, with a target of 150%. It is determined by reference to quantitative and qualitative criteria. The percentage of variable compensation linked to the attainment of quantitativecriteria may be scaled down regardless of actual performance, in order to give greater weight to the attainment of qualitative criteria. This flexibility can only operate to reduce the amount of variablecompensation, and cannot compensate for underperformance on quantitative criteria. In accordance with Article L. 225-100 of the French Commercial Code, payment of annual variable compensation in a given year in respect of the previous year is contingent on a favorableshareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting. Equity-based compensation The Chief Executive Officer's equity-based compensation may not exceed 250% of his target short-term compensation (fixed plus variable). The valuation of stock options is calculated at the date of grant using the Black & Scholes method. The valuation ofperformance shares is also calculated at the date of grant, and represents the difference between the quoted market price of the share on the date of grant and the aggregate present value of thedividends to be received over the next three years. The parameters used to calculate the valuations are market parameters available in the financial press. The Chief Executive Officer's equity-based compensation is contingent upon attainment of the performance conditions. In 2017, on the basis of the information published as of the date of this annual report on Form 20-F, the median fixed compensation of the chief executive officers of the aforementioned ten leading global pharmaceutical companies was in the region of\u20ac1,300,000, the median of the annual variable compensation was in the regionof\u20ac2,200,000 and the median of the long-term compensation granted (whether in shares or in cash) represented around 800% of the fixed compensation. Each grant to our Chief Executive Officer takes into account previous grants and his overall compensation. In any event, the maximum number of exercisable options orshares to be delivered may not be more than the number of options initially granted or performance shares initially awarded. Any award of equity-based compensation in a given year is contingent on a favorable shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting. Attendance fees Executive officers do not receive attendance fees in their capacity as directors. Consequently, the Chief Executive Officer does notreceive attendance fees in his capacity as a director or as amember of the Strategy Committee. Exceptional compensation No exceptional compensation can be awarded to the ChiefExecutive Officer. On leaving office The Chief Executive Officer is entitled to a top-up defined-benefit pension plan, a termination benefit, and a non-compete indemnity. Each of those benefits is taken into account by the Board of Directors when fixing the overall compensation of the ChiefExecutive Officer. Pension arrangements The Chief Executive Officer is covered by a top-up defined-benefitpension plan falling within the scope of Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code. The plan is offered to all employees of Sanofi and its French subsidiaries who meet the eligibility criteriaspecified in the plan rules. The plan, which remains open, was set up on October 1, 2008 as the final stage in the process of harmonizing the status of personnel across the Frenchsubsidiaries. This top-up defined-benefit pension plan is offered to executives (as defined by AGIRC, a confederation of executive pension funds) of Sanofi and its French subsidiaries who meet the eligibility criteria specified in the plan rules; the benefit is contingent upon the plan member ending his or her career within the Sanofi group. The plan is reserved for executives with at least ten years of service whoseannual base compensation has for ten calendar years (not necessarily consecutive) exceeded four times the French social security ceiling, and is wholly funded by the Company andoutsourced to an insurance company. The top-up pension, which may not exceed 37.50% (1.5% per year of service, capped at 25 years) of the reference compensation, is in the form of a life annuity, and is transferable as a survivor's pension. The annuity is based on the arithmetical average of the three highest years' average annual gross compensation paid during any three of the five years (not necessarily consecutive)preceding final cessation of employment. This referencecompensation is capped at 60 times the French social security ceiling applicable in the year in which the pension is taken. In addition, vesting of new rights for the Chief Executive Officer has been subject to a performance condition since January 1, 2017.The performance condition is applied on the following basis: if the level of attainment for variable compensation is equal to or greater than the target (i.e. 150% of fixed compensation), 100% of the contingent top-up pension rights will vest, corresponding toan uplift of 1.5% in the annual reference compensation used tocalculate the annuity payable under the plan; SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 163ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES if the level of attainment for variable compensation is less than 100% of fixed compensation, no top-up pension rights will vest for the year in question; and between those two limits, vested rights are calculated on aprorata basis. Consequently, the annual uplift in contingent rights is capped at 1.5%of the annual reference compensation used to calculate the annuity payable under the plan, which is below the upper limit of 3% of annualreference compensation stipulated in Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code. The annuity supplements any other schemes for which the plan member may be eligible in France or abroad, subject to a cap on the total pension from all sources set at 52% of the referencecompensation. If the total amount of the annuities paid under all suchschemes were to exceed the 52% cap, the amount of the Sanofi top-up defined-benefit pension annuity would be reduced accordingly in order to respect that cap. This retirement plan is subject to various charges and contributions within France: CSG, CRDS, CSAM, CASA, contributions of 7% and 14% on the annuity, and of 24% on the external funding. Termination arrangements The termination benefit only becomes payable if the departure of theChief Executive Officer is forced, i.e. in the event of removal from office or resignation linked to a change in strategy or control of the Company. Compensation for non-renewal of the term of office isirrelevant in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, because this office is held for an indefinite term. In addition, no termination benefit is payable in the following circumstances: in the event of removal from office for gross or serious misconduct (faute grave ou lourde); if the Chief Executive Officer elects to leave the Company to take up another position; if the Chief Executive Officer is assigned to another position within Sanofi; if the Chief Executive Officer takes his pension. The amount of the termination benefit is capped at 24 months of theChief Executive Officer's most recent total compensation on the basis of (i) the fixed compensation effective on the date of leaving office and (ii) the last variable compensation received prior to that date, subjectto fulfilment of the performance criteria for the three financial years preceding the date of leaving office.The amount of the termination benefit is reduced by any amount received as consideration for the non-compete undertaking, such that the aggregate amount of those two benefits may never exceedtwo years of total fixed and variable compensation. Non-compete undertaking In the event of his departure from the Company, the ChiefExecutive Officer undertakes, during the 12-month period following his departure, not to join a competitor of the Company as an employee or corporate officer, or to provide services to orcooperate with such a competitor. In return for this undertaking, he receives an indemnity corresponding to one year's total compensation effective on the day he ceases to hold office and the last individual variable compensation received prior to that date. This indemnity is payable in 12 monthly installments. However, the Board of Directors reserves the right to release the Chief Executive Officer from the undertaking for some or all of that 12-month period. In such cases, the non-compete indemnity wouldnot be due for the period of time waived by the Company. Consequences of the Chief Executive Officer's departure for equity-based compensation If the Chief Executive Officer leaves the Company for reasons other than resignation or removal from office for gross or serious misconduct (in which case any award of equity-based compensation is forfeited), the overall allocation percentage will be prorated to reflect the amount of time the Chief Executive Officer remained with Sanofi during the vesting period. If at any time prior to the expiration of (i) the period of validity of the options or (ii) the vesting period of the performance shares the Chief Executive Officer joins a competitor of Sanofi as an employee or corporate officer, or provides services to or cooperates with such a competitor, he irrevocably loses those options and performance shares regardless of any full or partial waiver by the Board of Directors of the non-compete undertaking relating to his office asChief Executive Officer. If the Chief Executive Officer retires at statutory retirement age prior to the expiration of (i) the period of validity of the options or (ii) the vesting period of the performance shares, he will retainentitlement to the options and performance shares initially awarded but will continue to be bound by the other terms of the plan, including performance conditions. There is no acceleration clause in the event of a change of control. 164 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6.

DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES Compensation of the Chairman of the Board, Serge Weinberg Serge Weinberg has held the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors since May 17, 2010. He has never had, and does not currently have, a contract of employment with Sanofi. The Chairman of the Board also chairs the Appointments and Governance Committee and the Strategy Committee. The remits of the Chairman of the Board are specified in the Board Charter, which is reproduced in its entirety in Exhibit 1.2. During the course of 2017, Chairman's activities included: chairing all the meetings of the Board of Directors (nine in 2017) and of the Committees of which he is a member (three meetings of the Appointments and Governance Committee, ten meetings of the Strategy Committee), and participating in Committee meetings to which he was invited (Audit Committee and Compensation Committee); close monitoring of the proper implementation of the decisionstaken by the Board; meetings with directors, including (i) on the appointments ofBernard Charl\u00e8s, Melanie Lee, Marion Palme and Christian Senectaire, to explain to them how the Board operates and to answer their questions, (ii) in connection with the annual evaluation of the Board's operating procedures and (iii) onmatters relating to the projects presented to the Board; regular meetings with members of the senior management team; interviews with the media; on-site visits to group locations in France or abroad, and meetingthe employees; meetings with biotechs and medtechs in France and abroad; and representing Sanofi at events or official meetings withrepresentatives of the public authorities and other stakeholders, in line with his remit as defined by the Board Charter. The Chairman also has a role in explaining positions taken by theBoard within its sphere of competence, especially in terms of strategy, governance and executive compensation. In furtheranceof this role, Serge Weinberg drew on his experience of corporate communication in:answering letters from investors and shareholders; holding meetings with certain shareholders and proxy advisors;and attending a meeting of the Individual Shareholders Committee at Sanofi headquarters in March 2017, answering questions about the Company's latest news, future prospects and dividend policy. Those tasks were carried out after coordination with the ChiefExecutive Officer, and in close collaboration with our Investor Relations department. Compensation in respect of 2017 On March 2, 2017, acting on a recommendation from theCompensation Committee, the Board of Directors set the terms of Serge Weinberg's compensation for the 2017 financial year. For the 2017 financial year, his annual fixed compensation was maintained at\u20ac700,000. In line with our compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board, as approved by our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of May 10, 2017, he did not receive any variable compensation and was not awarded any stock options or performance shares. Nor did he receive any attendance fees in his capacity as a Director. The amount reported for benefits in kind relates mainly to a company car with a chauffeur. Serge Weinberg is not covered by the Sanofi top-up defined-benefit pension plan. Compensation in respect of 2018 On March 6, 2018, acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors set the terms of Serge Weinberg's compensation. For the 2018 financial year, his annual fixed compensation was maintained at\u20ac700,000.Consequently, Serge Weinberg's compensation has remained unchanged since his arrival in 2010. In line with AMF recommendations, he will not receive any variable compensation,stock options or performance shares. Nor will he receive any attendance fees.

Compensation in respect of 2017 On March 2, 2017, acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors set the terms of Olivier Brandicourt's compensation for the 2017 financial year. In line with our compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer, as approved by our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of May 10, 2017 his annual compensation for 2017 comprised (i) fixedannual gross compensation of \u20ac1,200,000 (unchanged since he took office) and (ii) variable annual compensation in a range from 0% to 250% of his fixed annual compensation, with a target of 150%, and subject to both quantitative and qualitative criteria. These objectives were 40% based on financial indicators (sales growth one-third, business net income(1)two-thirds), and 60% based on specific individual objectives. The Board of Directors, acting on recommendations from the Compensation Committee, adjusts the individual performance criteria annually, while always seeking to maintain continuity and consistency from one year to the next. Individual objectives for 2016 Individual objectives for 2017 excellence of product launches (10%); new product launches (10%); external growth (14%); research and development (15%); operational transformation (12%); ongoing transformation of Sanofi (25%); organization and staff relations (12%); organization and staff relations (10%); the new product pipeline (12%). (1) For a definition, see \"- Item 5 - Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - Business Net Income\". 168 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6.

This flexibility can only operate to reduce the amount of variable compensation, and cannotcompensate for underperformance on quantitative criteria.In general, the performance criteria applied to variablecompensation and to the vesting of stock options and performance shares are exacting, and consistent with our corporate objectives. For confidentiality reasons, neither the level of attainment required (target) for the quantitative criteria nor the details of the qualitative criteria can be disclosed; however, they were pre-determined on a precise basis. In evaluating those criteria, the performance of major global pharmaceutical companies is always taken into account. Acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors meeting of March 6, 2018 reviewed the attainmentof each criterion and sub-criterion.

SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 169ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES Acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors meeting of March 6, 2018 set Olivier Brandicourt's variable compensation for 2017 at \u20ac1,792,800, equivalent to 149.4% of his fixed compensation. Payment of his variable compensation in respect of the 2017 financial year is contingent on approval of his compensation package by the shareholders in an Ordinary General Meeting, on the terms stipulated in Article L. 225-100 of the French CommercialCode. Olivier Brandicourt is subject to, benefits from and contributes to the same health cover, and death and disability plans as are applicable to other employees of Sanofi based in France. He received a benefit in kind in 2017 representing social contribution payments of \u20ac318 made by Sanofi on his behalf. Sanofi's policy is to make these payments (which arise on the employer's pension contributions and are normally payable by the employee) on behalf of all of its employees in France, includingOlivier Brandicourt. In line with our compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer as approved by our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of May 10, 2017, and acting on the recommendations of theCompensation Committee, the Board of Directors meeting of May 10, 2017 decided to award Olivier Brandicourt 220,000 stock subscription options and 50,000 performance shares in respect ofthe 2017 financial year. Using the Black & Scholes model, thevaluation of those awards, as of May 10, 2017, was equivalent to 5.6 times his fixed compensation for 2017.In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the entire amount of these awards is contingent upon both internal criteria based upon business net income(1)and return on assets (ROA), and an external criterion based on total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a benchmark panel of ten of the leading global pharmaceutical companies. The panel is the same as that used to determine theoverall compensation of the Chief Executive Officer: AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers-Squibb Inc., Eli Lilly and Company Inc., Johnson & Johnson Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck Inc.,Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc. and Roche Holding Ltd. Those criteria were selected because they align medium-term equity-based compensation with the strategy adopted by Sanofi. The arrangements relating to these awards are as follows:The performance criterion based on business net income accounts for 50% of the award. This criterion corresponds to the ratio, at constant exchange rates, of actual business net income to budgeted business net income. It represents the averageactual-to-budget ratio for business net income attained over the entire period. Budgeted business net income is derived from the budget as approved by the Board of Directors at the beginning ofeach financial year. The business net income objective may not be lower than the bottom end of the full-year guidance range publicly announced by Sanofi at the beginning of each year. Ifthe ratio is less than 95%, the corresponding options or performance shares are forfeited. Actual-to-budget attainment ratio (\"R\") Business net income allocation If R is less than 95% 0% If R is 95% 50% If R is > 95% but < 98% (50 + [(R - 95) x 16])% If R is 98% but 105% R% If R is > 105% but < 110% (105 + [(R - 105) x 3])% If R is 110% 120% The ROA criterion accounts for 30% of the award. The award is based on a target ROA, below which some or all of the options or performance shares are forfeited. Average ROA (\"P\") ROA allocation If P is the minimum target (M) 0% If P is between the minimum (M) and intermediate (I) performance [30 x (P-M)/(I-M)]% If P is equal to the intermediate performance (I) 30% If P is between the intermediate performance (I) and the target ROA (T) [70 x (P-T)/(T-I) + 100]% If P is the target ROA 100% (1) For a definition, see \"\u2014 Item 5 - Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - Business Net Income\". 170 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES The TSR criterion accounts for 20% of the award. Total shareholder return (TSR) reflects both the appreciation in the value of our shares (the increase in the share price) and thevalue distributed to our shareholders (dividends), i.e. the twosources of return on investment in Sanofi shares. Our TSR is compared with the benchmark panel of ten companies listed above. The number of options exercisable and performanceshares vesting depends upon our position relative to the TSR for the other companies in the panel. Below the median, the corresponding options or performance shares are forfeited. The median is the performance of the company ranked sixth. Theupper bound is the arithmetical average of the performances of the panel companies ranked first and second. The intermediate level is equal to: median + [(upper bound - median)\u00f72]. -if Sanofi's TSR is below will be 0%; -if Sanofi's TSR is equal to the allocation will be 50%; -if Sanofi's TSR is equal to the intermediate TSR allocation will be 100%; -if Sanofi's TSR is the will be 150%; -if Sanofi's TSR is above the median but below the upper bound,the TSR allocation will be calculated using linear interpolation. In addition to the three criteria described above, in the case of stock options there is an implicit condition in the form of the exercise price, and a condition of continuing employment within Sanofi. In order to align equity-based compensation with medium-term performance, performance is measured over three financial years. Vesting is subject to a non-compete clause. In the event that Olivier Brandicourt leaves the Company forreasons other than resignation or removal from office for gross orserious misconduct, the overall allocation percentage will be prorated to reflect the amount of time he remained with Sanofi during the vesting period.Until he ceases to hold office, the Chief Executive Officer is required to retain a quantity of Sanofi shares equivalent to(i) 50% of any gain (net of taxes and social contributions) arising on the exercise of stock options and (ii) 50% of any gain (net oftaxes and social contributions) arising on the vesting of performance shares, calculated as of the date on which those shares vest. Those shares must be retained in registered formuntil he ceases to hold office. In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Chief ExecutiveOfficer is bound by insider trading rules (contained in the BoardCharter) which stipulate periods during which he must refrain from trading in Sanofi shares. In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and our Board Charter, Olivier Brandicourt has undertaken to refrain fromentering into speculative or hedging transactions, and so far as the Company is aware no such instruments have been contracted. The Board regards these performance conditions as good indicators of the development of shareholder value in terms of: the quality of investment decisions in a period where external growth plays a greater role than in the past (ROA condition); a commitment to delivering challenging bottom-line results in a tough business environment (business net income condition); and matching or bettering our peer group in terms of shareholderreturns (TSR condition). For confidentiality reasons, the amount of the quantitative measures for the internal criteria cannot be disclosed. However,they were determined on a precise basis, and the level of attainment for the internal criteria will be disclosed at the end of the performance measurement period. In line with our commitment to transparency, we publish in our annual report the attainment level determined by the Board of Directors for performance conditions (and the corresponding allocation rate) applicable to equity-based compensation plansawarded to the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the Executive Committee. The Board believes that disclosing the attainment level allows our shareholders to better understand thedemanding nature of the performance conditions. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 171ITEM 6.

The Board of Directors had previously decided to limit the number of options that could be awarded to executive officers to 15% of the total limit approved by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting of May 4, 2016 (0.5% of the share capital). The number of options awarded to the Chief Executive Officer in 2017 represents 3.49%of the total limit approved by that Meeting and 58.19% of the totalamount awarded to all beneficiaries on May 10, 2017. It is important to note that since 2015, stock options have been restricted to members of the Executive Committee residing outside France and to beneficiaries in countries where shares cannot beawarded; they are no longer awarded to all beneficiaries of equity-based compensation plans. This explains why the proportion of options granted to the Chief Executive Officer is higher than in the past.

Compensation in respect of 2018 Acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee,the Board of Directors meeting of March 6, 2018 decided to maintain Olivier Brandicourt's fixed annual compensation for 2018 at the same level as for 2016 and 2017 (\u20ac1,200,000), and also toretain the same variable annual compensation structure whereby 40% is based on financial indicators (sales growth one-third, business net income two-thirds) and 60% on specific individualobjectives. Those individual objectives comprise:business transformation (20%); pipeline of products (12%); organization and people (12%); new products (10%); and mergers and acquisitions (6%). For 2018, the variable compensation of Olivier Brandicourt will remain in a range between 0% and 250% of his fixed compensation, with a target of 150%. Acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors meeting of March 6, 2018 proposed to award Olivier Brandicourt 220,000 stock subscription options and 50,000 performance shares in respect of the 2018 financial year. The award of these stock subscription options and performanceshares to Olivier Brandicourt in respect of the 2018 financial year is contingent on approval of his compensation package by theshareholders at the Ordinary General Meeting, on the termsstipulated in Article L. 225-100 of the French Commercial Code.Arrangements for executive officers 1. Pension arrangements Olivier Brandicourt is covered by the Sanofi top-up defined-benefit pension plan, which falls within the scope of Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code. For a fuller description of the plan, refer to \"- Compensation policy for executive officers\" above. Based on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of the plan, 532 executives were eligible for this plan (50 retirees, 108 early retirees and 374 active employees) as ofDecember 31, 2017. Because Olivier Brandicourt has pursued his career in different countries and in different groups, he has not continuously paid into the French compulsory industry schemes. Consequently, he was awarded a deemed ten years of service on taking up office at Sanofi. The Shareholders' Annual General Meeting of May 4, 2015 approved the section on the pension benefit contained in the auditors' special report on related-party agreements. Under the terms of Article 229 II of the law on growth, the economy and equality of opportunity (the \"Macron Law\"), Olivier Brandicourt's top-up pension arrangements fall outside the scope of that law in terms of the requirement for pension arrangements to be contingent on performance conditions. Nonetheless our Board of Directors, acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, decided at its meeting of February 7, 2017 to voluntarily apply a performance condition tothe vesting of new contingent rights arising under OlivierBrandicourt's top-up pension plan with effect from January 1, 2017. This alteration in pension arrangements was approved at the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting of May 10, 2017. The terms of this performance condition are described in \"B. Compensation -Compensation and arrangements for corporate officers\". 174 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES At a meeting on March 6, 2018, our Board of Directors ascertained whether the performance condition had been met, noting that the level of attainment for the Chief Executive Officer's variable compensation for the 2017 financial year was 99.6%, i.e. 149.4%of his fixed compensation. Consequently, 99.6% of his contingent top-up pension rights vest, corresponding to an uplift of 1.49% in the annual reference compensation used to calculate the annuitypayable under the plan. Taking into account the award of a deemed ten years of service, he has therefore accumulated 12.75 years of service as of December 31, 2017. His reference compensation being limited to 60 times the French social security ceiling (i.e. \u20ac2,353,680 in 2017, based on a ceiling of \u20ac39,228), the theoretical maximum of his top-up pension is currently 19.115% of that amount, i.e. \u20ac449,906. On leaving Sanofi, Olivier Brandicourt may not benefit from our top-up pension plan unless he is entitled to benefit fully from compulsory industry schemes; this requires him to have reached statutory retirement age (which he did in February 2018) and to have accumulated the required number of three-month periods ofqualifying employment. We do not have sufficient information to determine whether retirement in 2018 is a realistic scenario interms of his period of qualifying employment, since most of his career has been spent outside France. If Olivier Brandicourt were to retire in 2018, as mentioned above he would have accumulated 12.75 years of service, entitling him to an annuity equal to 19.115% of his reference compensation. Thatannuity would supplement any other schemes for which he may beeligible in France or abroad, subject to a cap on the total pensionfrom all sources set at 52% of the reference compensation. If the total amount of the annuities paid under all such schemes were to exceed the 52% cap, the amount of the Sanofi top-up defined-benefit pension annuity would be reduced accordingly in order to respect this cap. 2. Termination arrangements The termination benefit only becomes payable if the departure of the Chief Executive Officer is forced, i.e. in the event of removalfrom office linked to a change in strategy or control of the Company; for a fuller description of the benefit, refer to \"- Compensation policy for executive officers\" above. In accordance with article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code and with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, payment of the termination benefit is contingent upon fulfillment of twoperformance criteria, assessed over the three financial years preceding his ceasing to hold office. The two criteria are: the average of the ratios of business net income (1)to net sales for each financial year must be at least 15%; the average of the ratios of operating cash flow before changes in working capital to net sales for each financial year must be at least 18%. The Shareholders' Annual General Meeting of May 4, 2015 approved the section on the termination benefit contained in the auditors' special report on related-party agreements. 3. Non-compete undertaking This undertaking stipulates that in the event of his departure from the Company, Olivier Brandicourt will not join a competitor of the Company as an employee or corporate officer, or provide services to or cooperate with such a competitor, during the 12-month periodfollowing his departure. In return for this undertaking, he may receive an indemnity corresponding to one year's total compensation on the basis of his fixed compensation payable in 12 monthly installments, it beingspecified that the Board of Directors reserves the right to release him from that undertaking for some or all of the period covered bythe undertaking. In that case, the non-compete indemnity would not be due for the period of time waived by the Company. For a fuller description of the benefit, refer to \"- Compensation policy for executive officers\" above. The Shareholders' General Meeting of May 4, 2015 approved the section on the non-compete undertaking contained in the auditors' special report on related party agreements.

SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 175ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES Share ownership and lock-up obligation of the Chief Executive Officer for shares obtained on exercise of stockoptions or performance shares The Chief Executive Officer is bound by the same obligations regarding share ownership specified in our Articles of Association and Board Charter as the other corporate officers. In addition, until he ceases to hold office the Chief Executive Officer is required to retain a quantity of Sanofi shares equivalent to: 50% of any gain (net of taxes and social contributions) arising on the exercise of stock options; 50% of any gain (net of taxes and social contributions) arising onthe vesting of performance shares, calculated as of the date on which those shares vest. Those shares must be retained in registered form until he ceases to hold office.In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and our Board Charter, Olivier Brandicourt has undertaken to refrain from entering into speculative or hedging transactions, and so far as the Company is aware no such instruments have been contracted. Compensation and pension payments for Directors other than the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of theBoard of Directors Attendance fees (table no. 3 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code) Attendance fees in respect of 2016, the amount of which was approved at the Board meeting of March 2, 2017, were partially paid in July 2016. The balance was paid in 2017. Attendance fees in respect of 2017, the amount of which was approved at the Board meeting of March 6, 2018, were partially paid in July 2017. The balance will be paid in 2018. For 2017 and 2018, the basic annual attendance fee was maintained at\u20ac30,000, apportioned on a time basis for directors who assumed or left office during the year. The variable portion was determined on the basis of actual attendance by directors at meetings in accordance with the principles specified in our Board Charter, and in the proportions described below: Amount of the attendance fee per meeting Directors resident in FranceDirectors resident outside France but within EuropeDirectors resident outside Europe Board of Directors \u20ac5,000 \u20ac7,000 \u20ac5,000 ( \u20ac7,500 for the Chairman) \u20ac7,500 \u20ac10,000 \u20ac7,500 \u20ac7,500 Strategy \u20ac5,000 \u20ac7,500 \u20ac10,000 Hence, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, attendancefees are allocated predominantly on a variable basis. The attendance fee payable to a director who participates byconference call or by video-conference is equivalent to half of the attendance fee received by a director resident in France whoattends in person. As an exception, in certain cases two meetings held on the same day give entitlement to a single attendance fee: if on the day of a Shareholders' General Meeting, the Board of Directors meets both before and after the Meeting, only one attendance fee is paid for the two Board meetings; if on the same day a Director participates in one meeting of theCompensation Committee and in one meeting of theAppointments and Governance Committee, only the highest oneis paid for both meetings. The introduction of a separate attendance fee scale depending onwhether or not the director is a European resident is intended to take into account the significantly longer travel time required toattend meetings in person. The Shareholders' Annual General Meeting of May 10, 2017 approved a proposal to increase the maximum overall amount of annual attendance fees to \u20ac1,750,000, largely to take account of an increase in the size of the Board. The overall amount of annualattendance fees had previously remained unchanged since theAnnual General Meeting of May 6, 2011. Neither the Chairman nor the Chief Executive Officer receives attendance fees. 176 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6.

The two directors representing employees both have a contract of employment with a Sanofi subsidiary, under which they receive compensation unrelated to their office as director. Consequently, that remuneration is not disclosed. Pensions The amount recognized in the 2017 consolidated income statementin respect of corporate pension plans for corporate officers withcurrent or past executive responsibilities at Sanofi (or companieswhose obligations have been assumed by Sanofi) was \u20ac1.3 million. Compensation of Senior Management The compensation of Executive Committee members other than theChief Executive Officer is established upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, taking into consideration the practices of the leading global pharmaceutical companies. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 177ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES In addition to fixed compensation, they receive variable compensation. Their target variable compensation depends on their position, and can represent up to 100% of their fixed compensation. The target amount of individual variablecompensation is determined in line with market practice. It rewards the individual contribution of each Executive Committee member both to Sanofi's performance and to the performance of theoperations or functions for which he or she has responsibility. For 2017, the variable component consisted of two elements: attainment of quantitative objectives (accounting for 50%) which are measured (i) at consolidated level (sales growth 30%, business net income 50%, research and development outcomes 20%, plus an upward/downward adjustment mechanism of up to 5% linked to cash flow optimization and an upward/downwardadjustment mechanism of up to 5% linked to new product launches) and (ii) at the level of the operations or functions for which the Executive Committee member has responsibility; and attainment of quantitative and qualitative objectives both individually (30%) and collectively (20%) within the Executive Committee (together accounting for 50%). The indicators used are intended to measure growth (in terms of net sales, business net income, research and development outcomes, sales of new products, and cash flow optimization);talent and critical skills management (including hirings in criticalareas for the Group); talent retention; increase in the proportion ofwomen in senior management positions; and promotion of high potential individuals. In addition to this cash compensation, Executive Committee members may be awarded stock options and/or performance shares (see \" - E. Share Ownership\" below for details of therelated plans).For 2017, the total gross compensation paid and accrued in respect of members of the Executive Committee (excluding Olivier Brandicourt) amounted to\u20ac19.3 million, including\u20ac8.4 million in fixed compensation. On May 10, 2017, 145,240 stock subscription options and 233,207 performance shares, (excluding options and performance shares awarded to Olivier Brandicourt) were awarded to members of the Executive Committee. In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, these entire awards are contingent upon two internal criteria, based on business net income(1)and return on assets (ROA). These criteria were selected because they align medium-term equity-based compensation with the strategy adopted by Sanofi. The arrangements relating to these awards are as follows:The performance criterion based on business net income accounts for 60% of the award. This criterion corresponds to the ratio, at constant exchange rates, of actual business net incometo budgeted business net income. It represents the averageactual-to-budget ratio attained over the entire period. Budgeted business net income is derived from the budget as approved bythe Board of Directors at the beginning of each financial year. The business net income objective may not be lower than the bottom end of the full-year guidance range publicly announced by Sanofi at the beginning of each year. If the ratio is less than95%, the corresponding options or performance shares areforfeited. Actual-to-budget attainment ratio (\"R\") Business net income allocation If R is less than 95% 0% If R is 95% 50% If R is > 95% but < 98% (50 + [(R -95) x 16])% If R is 98% but 105% R% If R is > 105% but < 110% (105 + [(R -105) x 3])% If R is 110% 120% (1) For a definition, see \"- Item 5 - Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - Business Net Income\". 178 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES The ROA criterion accounts for 40% of the award. The award is based on a target ROA, below which some or all of the options or performance shares are forfeited. Average ROA (\"P\") ROA allocation If P is the minimum target (M) 0% If P is between the minimum (M) and intermediate (I) performance [30 x (P-M)/(I-M)]% If P is equal to the intermediate performance (I) 30% If P is between the intermediate performance (I) and the target ROA (T) [70 x (P-T)/(T-I) + 100]% If P is the target ROA 100% In addition to the two criteria described above, in the case ofstock options there is an implicit condition in the form of the exercise price, and a condition of continuing employment withinSanofi. In order to align equity-based compensation with medium-term performance, performance is measured over three financialyears. Vesting is subject to a non-compete clause. The entire award is forfeited in the event of resignation, ordismissal for gross or serious misconduct. In the event of individual dismissal other than for gross or seriousmisconduct or retirement before the age of 60, or if thebeneficiary's employer ceases to be part of the Sanofi group, theoverall allocation percentage is prorated to reflect the amount of time the person remained with the Sanofi group during the vesting period. if any of the following events occur, full rights to the award are retained: (i) dismissal as part of a collective redundancy plan, or of an equivalent plan negotiated and approved by the ChiefExecutive Officer; (ii) retirement on or after reaching the statutory retirement age, or early retirement under a statutory orcontractual early retirement plan implemented by the relevant Sanofi entity and duly approved by the Chief Executive Officer ofSanofi; (iii) disability classified in the second or third categories stipulated in Article L. 314-4 of the French Social Security Code; and (iv) death of the beneficiary. The Board regards these performance conditions as good indicators of the development of shareholder value in terms of (i) the quality of investment decisions in a period where externalgrowth plays a more critical role than in the past (ROA condition)and (ii) the commitment to delivering challenging bottom-line results in a tough business environment (business net income condition). For confidentiality reasons, the amount of the quantitative measures for the internal criteria cannot be disclosed. However, they were determined on a precise basis, and the level ofattainment for the internal criteria will be disclosed at the end of the performance measurement period. In line with our commitment to transparency, we publish in our annual report the level of attainment determined by the Board ofDirectors for performance conditions applicable to equity-based compensation plans awarded to the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the Executive Committee. The Board believes that disclosing the level of attainment allows our shareholders tobetter understand the demanding nature of the performanceconditions. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 179ITEM 6.

During 2017, 179,398 stock options were exercised by individuals who were members of the Executive Committee when they exercised. One of the plans involved pre-dated the creation of the Executive Committee (sanofi-aventis plan of December 14, 2006, exercise price\u20ac66.91), while the other four post-dated the creation of the Executive Committee (sanofi-aventis plan of December 13, 2007, exercise price\u20ac62.33; sanofi-aventis plan of March 3, 2009,exercise price\u20ac45.09; sanofi-aventis plan of March 9, 2011, exercise price\u20ac50.48; and sanofi-aventis plan of March 5, 2012,exercise price\u20ac56.44). Under French law, Directors may not receive options or performance shares solely as compensation for service on our Board, and consequently our Company may grant options only to those Directors who are also our officers. Because some of our non-executive Directors were formerly officers or executive officers of our Company or its predecessor companies, some of our non-executive Directors hold Sanofi stock options.We do not have separate profit-sharing plans for key executives.As employees, they are able to participate in our voluntary and statutory profit-sharing schemes on the same terms as our otheremployees. These plans are described below under\" - Employees - Profit-sharing schemes.\" The total amount accrued as of December 31, 2017 in respect of corporate pension plans for corporate officers with current or past executive responsibilities at Sanofi (or at companies whose obligations have been assumed by Sanofi) and for members of the Sanofi Executive Committee was \u20ac68 million, of which \u20ac6 million was recognized in the income statement for the year then ended.

DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES Application of the AFEP-MEDEF Code The AFEP-MEDEF Code requires us to specifically report on the application of its recommendations and, if applicable, explain why any of them have not been applied. Currently our departures from this Code are as follows: Paragraph of the AFEP-MEDEF Code Recommendation of the AFEP-MEDEF code Application by Sanofi 8.5.6 Independent DirectorsThe criteria to be reviewed by the committee and theBoard in order to qualify as independent and to prevent risks of conflicts of interest between thedirector and the management, the corporation, or itsgroup, are the following: -not to have been a director of the corporation for more than twelve years. -[...]Our Board of Directors does not strictly follow the recommendation according to which being a Board member for more than 12 consecutive years is of itself sufficient to automatically disqualify a director from being regarded as independent. The influence of the passage of time on the relationship between a director and the Company and its management must therefore be evaluatedon a case by case basis, and not mechanically. Itis only after reviewing all the factors that a director can be determined as being independent or non-independent. While length of service may in certain circumstances be associated with a loss of independence, in other circumstances it may enhance the capacity of a director to questionsenior management and give greater independence of mind. In response to a question asked in 2014 by the Haut Comit\u00e9 de Gouvernement d'Entreprise (the body in charge of overseeing the implementation of the AFEP-MEDEF Code), our Board explained that it considers its Appointments and Governance Committee to be best placed to assess thebehavior and hence the true independence of a director. The Board of Directors takes the view that it is in no way favoring competence over independence but rather checking a director's willingness and ability to form his or her own opinion, ask forfurther information and question the decisions of Senior Management. Consequently, our Board ofDirectors provides explanations for the specific cases it reviews (see \"- A. Directors and Senior Management - Independence of Board Membersbelow\"). Nevertheless, the Board would point out that the term of office of the director who has been on the Board for more than 12 years expires at theAnnual General Meeting of May 2, 2018, and he will not be proposed for reappointment. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 181ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES Paragraph of the AFEP-MEDEF Code Recommendation of the AFEP-MEDEF code Application by Sanofi 9.3. Evaluation of the Board of DirectorsThe evaluation has three objectives: -[. . .]; -measure the actual contribution of each director to the Board's work.Director independence is assessed every year. The issue of competence and individual contribution to the work of the Board and its Committees is addressed on a continuous basis,with a specific review when a director is up forreappointment as a Board or Committee member. Annual evaluations involve each director responding to a detailed questionnaire using adedicated IT platform. The questionnaire deals specifically with the operating procedures of the Board and gives directors an opportunity to express freely their assessment of the individualcontributions of other directors. These evaluations are followed by individual meetings with theSecretary to the Board, at which the responses tothe questionnaire are analyzed and discussed. For the formal evaluation conducted every three years, the Board may retain an external consultant. In 2015, when a specialist consultancyfirm conducted the evaluation, directors expressedpositive opinions about the collegiate nature of the way the Board and its Committees operate, which is only possible through serious contributions fromindividual directors and high attendance rates. This also reflects a good mix of profiles and a diversity of competencies, experience and geographicalorigins among Board members. 17.1. Membership of the Compensation CommitteeIt is recommended that one of its members be anemployee director.The Board intends to appoint a directorrepresenting employees to the Compensation Committee after an induction period of twelvemonths from the date of his or her initial appointment to the Board in June 2017. This will give the new director time to adapt to how theCompany operates, understand its specific characteristics, familiarize himself or herself with the challenges and broad outlines of the Board'sremit, and undertake any necessary training. Furthermore, until now, the limitations on the powers of the ChiefExecutive Officer have not been contained in our Board Charter (the equivalent document to the \"internal rules of the Board\" as referred to in the AFEP-MEDEF Code), contrary torecommendation 3.2 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, but rather in a Board decision of July 28, 2009. Those limitations were nonetheless disclosed every year in our annual report and on ourcorporate website. Because there was no difference in terms oftransparency or decision making process, this departure was technical and had no practical repercussions.However, because we are committed to following best practice incorporate governance, we have incorporated the limitations on the Chief Executive Officer's powers into our Board Charter with effectfrom March 6, 2018, the date of its most recent update. An English version of the full text of our Board Charter is included as Exhibit 1.2 to our Annual Report on Form 20-F, and on our corporatewebsite. 182 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES Activities of the Board of Directors in 2017 During 2017, the Board of Directors met nine times, with an overall attendance rate among Board members of over 95%. This attendance rate includes participation by conference call, though only a limited number of Directors participated in this way.Individual attendance rates varied between 75% and 100%. The following persons attended meetings of the Board of Directors:the directors; the Secretary to the Board; frequently: members of the Executive Committee; and occasionally: managers of our global functions. Pursuant to the agreement of February 24, 2005 setting up a European Works Council, and prior to the appointment of two directors representing employees in June 2017, five employee representatives attended Board meetings in a consultative capacity. The agenda for each meeting of the Board is prepared by the Secretary after consultation with the Chairman, taking account of the agendas for the meetings of the specialist Committees and thesuggestions of the directors. Approximately one week prior to each meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors each receive a file containing the agenda, the minutes of the previous meeting, and documentation relating to the agenda. The minutes of each meeting are expressly approved at the next meeting of the Board of Directors. In compliance with our Board Charter, certain issues are examinedin advance by the various Committees according to their areas of competence to enable them to make a recommendation; these issues are then submitted for a decision by the Board of Directors. At the end of 2015, acting on a recommendation from the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board decided to raise the number of executive sessions (i.e. Board meetings heldwithout the Chief Executive Officer present) to at least two peryear. The primary purpose of such sessions is to assess the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and to discuss succession planning. Three executive sessions have taken placeduring the 2017 financial year. In 2017, the main activities of the Board of Directors related to the following issues: financial statements and financial matters: -review of the individual company and consolidated financial statements for the 2016 financial year and for the first half of 2017, review of the consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of 2017, review of the draft press releases and presentations to analysts with respect to the publicationof such financial statements, examination of documentsrelating to management forecasts; -delegation of authority to the Chief Executive Officer to issue bonds and guarantees, and renewal of the share repurchase program; -recording the amount of share capital, reducing the sharecapital through cancellation of treasury shares, and amending the Articles of Association accordingly; -presentation of the 2017 budget and financial forecats 2017-2019. compensation matters: -determination of the 2016 variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, the 2017 fixed and variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the 2017 fixedcompensation of the Chairman of the Board, plus an update on fixed and variable compensation of members of the Executive Committee for 2016 and 2017. During thepresentation of the report of the Compensation Committee on the compensation of corporate officers, the Board of Directors deliberates in executive session in their absence: the Board ofDirectors first discusses the compensation of the Chairman of the Board in his absence, and then the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer with the Chairman present but theChief Executive Officer still absent; -allocation of Directors' attendance fees for 2016, principles of allocation for 2017 and allocation of attendance fees for the first half of 2017, and expenses of corporate officers; -adoption of equity-based compensation plans, consisting ofstock subscription option plans and performance share plans in respect of 2017, and determination of the fulfillment of performance conditions of previous equity-based compensation plans. appointments and governance matters: -composition of the Board, proposed reappointment of directors and appointment of a new director at the 2017 Annual General Meeting, and director independence; -review of succession planning; -reviews of the Board of Directors' Management Report, theChairman's Report and the reports of the statutory auditors; -the notice of meeting for the Annual General Meetings ofShareholders and of Holders of Participating Shares (Series issued in 1983, 1984 and 1987 and Series A participating shares issued in 1989), adoption of (i) the draft resolutions (ii) the report of the Board of Directors on the resolutions and(iii) the special reports on the awards of stock subscription options and performance shares, and examination ofquestions submitted in writing; SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 183ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES -evaluation of the activities of the Board and its Committees; -review of the Board Charter; and -review of previously-approved related party agreements. presentation on the Vaccines business; update on the cost reduction program; update on the Diabetes business; update on the anti-infectives; update on Dupixent\u00ae; update on Depakine\u00ae; review of significant proposed alliances and acquisitions, and strategic opportunities; Company policy on equal pay and opportunities; and approval in principle of a share issue reserved for employees. Activities of the Board Committees in 2017 Since 1999, our Board of Directors has been assisted in its deliberations and decisions by specialist Committees (see ourBoard Charter, provided as Exhibit 1.2 to this Annual Report on Form 20-F). Chairmen and members of these Committees are chosen by the Board from among its members, based on their experience. The Committees are responsible for the preparation of certain items on the agenda of the Board of Directors. Decisions of the Committees are adopted by a simple majority with the chairman of the Committee having a casting vote. Minutes are drafted, and approved by the Committee members. The chairman of each Committee reports to the Board on the work of that Committee, so that the Board is fully informed whenever it takes a decision. Because the Board of Directors has decided to allow an average period of one year to elapse between the date on which a Director is first appointed to serve on the Board and the appointment of that Director to a Committee, the composition of the Committees did not change in 2017.

In 2017, the Strategy Committee met ten times, including twice in expanded sessions that included other directors. The Committee members have a good attendance record, with anoverall attendance rate of 100%. In 2017, the main activities of the Strategy Committee related to: review of external growth opportunities, including Bioverativ and Ablynx; partnership opportunities; review of the strategy, with a focus on digital; global environment (healthcare trends, competitive landscape, access to drugs); research and development (pipeline, Regeneron, researchplatforms);long range financials; and Sanofi's international presence. The Committee did not use external consultants in 2017. Scientific Committee In line with Sanofi's strategic roadmap, the Board decided, onMarch 6, 2018, to set up a fifth permanent Committee to address scientific and R&D issues. The main roles of this Committee are: to assist the Board in scrutinizing the strategic orientation and investments proposed by the Chief Executive Officer in those areas; to identify and discuss emerging trends and new challenges, andensure that Sanofi is well prepared for them; and to ensure that processes are in place to enable optimal decision- making on investments in R&D , consistent with the strategy determined by the Board. The Board Charter will be amended so that the remit, compositionand operating procedures of the new Committee are precisely defined. However, it will not be necessary to increase the overall amount allocated to directors' attendance fees, since the amount approved by the Annual General Meeting of May 10, 2017 will be sufficient to cover the extra fees that will be due. Attendance rate of Board members In 2017, the average attendance rate of directors at Board andCommittee meetings was 96% (95% for Board meetings, 98% for Committee meetings). Directors who were absent from some meetings provided clear and substantiated explanations for their absence, which related mainly to personal matters or to unscheduled meetings called at shortnotice (especially where sudden developments on an ongoingproject necessitated a Board meeting). The Board pays particularattention to the availability of directors, and makes sure that their other professional commitments do not prevent them from fully discharging their remit with respect to the Company. D. Employees Number of Employees In 2017, Sanofi employed 106,566 people worldwide, 293 less thanin 2016. The tables below give a breakdown of employees by geographic area and function for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. 186 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6.

Industrial Relations In all countries where we operate, we seek to strike a balance between our economic interests and those of our employees, which we regard as inseparable. Our responsibility towards our employees is based on the basic principles of our Social Charter, which outlines the rights and duties of all Sanofi employees. The Social Charter addresses our key commitments towards our workforce: equal opportunity for all people without discrimination, the right to health and safety,respect for privacy, the right to information and professional training, social protection for employees and their families, freedomof association and the right to collective bargaining, and respect for the principles contained in the Global Compact on labor relations and ILO treaties governing the physical and emotional well-being and safety of children. Our labor relations are based on respect and dialogue. In this spirit, management and employee representatives meet regularly to exchange views, negotiate, sign agreements and ensure thatagreements are being implemented. Employee dialogue takes place in different ways from country to country, as dictated by specific local circumstances. Depending on the circumstances, employee dialogue relating to information, consultation and negotiation processes may take place at national, regional or company level. It may be organized on an interprofessional or sectorial basis, or both. Employee dialoguemay be informal or implemented through a specific formal body, ora combination of both methods. Whatever the situation, Sanofiencourages employees to voice their opinions, help create a stimulating work environment and take part in decisions aiming to improve the way we work. These efforts reflect one of theprinciples of the Social Charter, whereby improving working conditions and the necessary adaptation to our business environment go hand-in-hand. Profit-sharing Schemes, Employee Savings Schemes and Employee Share Ownership Profit-sharing Schemes All employees of our French companies belong to voluntary and statutory profit-sharing schemes. Voluntary Scheme (Int\u00e9ressement des salari\u00e9s) These are collective schemes that are optional for the employerand contingent upon performance. The aim is to give employees an interest in the growth of the business and improvements in its performance. The amount distributed by our French companies during 2017 in respect of voluntary profit-sharing for the year ended December 31, 2016 represented 1.33% of total payroll. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 187ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES In June 2017, we entered into a new fixed-term statutory profit- sharing agreement for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years. That agreement applies to all employees of our French companies. Under the agreement, Sanofi pays collective variablecompensation determined on the basis of the more favorable of (i) growth in consolidated net sales (at constant exchange rates and on a constant structure basis) or (ii) the level of business netincome. For each of those criteria, a matrix determines what percentage of total payroll is to be allocated to the scheme. This overall allocation is then reduced by the amount required by law to be transferred to a special profit-sharing reserve. The balance is then distributed between the employees unless the transfer to the reserve exceeds the maximum amount determined under the specified criteria, in which case no profit share is paid to theemployees. Statutory Scheme (Participation des salari\u00e9s aux r\u00e9sultats de l'entreprise ) This scheme is a French legal obligation for companies with morethan 50 employees that made a profit in the previous financial year. In November 2007, we entered into a new statutory profit-sharing agreement for an indefinite period, covering all the employees of our French companies. An amendment to this agreement was signed in April 2009, primarily to align the agreement on a change in French legislation (Law no. 2008-1258 of December 3, 2008) intended to protect against erosion in purchasing power, under which each qualifying employee can elect to receive some or all of his or her profit-sharing bonus immediately without observing the normal mandatory lock-up period. The amount distributed by our French companies during 2017 in respect of the statutory scheme for the year ended December 31, 2016 represented 8.08% of total payroll. Distribution Formula In order to favor lower-paid employees, the voluntary and statutory profit-sharing agreements entered into since 2005 split the benefit between those entitled as follows: 60% prorated on the basis of time spent in the Company's employment in the year; and 40% prorated on the basis of gross annual salary during theyear, subject to a lower limit equal to the social security ceiling and an upper limit of three times the social security ceiling. Employee Savings Schemes and Collective Retirement Savings Plan The employee savings arrangements operated by Sanofi are based on a collective savings scheme (Plan d'Epargne Groupe )and a collective retirement savings scheme (Plan d'Epargne pour laRetraite Collectif ).Those schemes reinvest the sums derived from the statutory and voluntary profit-sharing schemes, plus voluntarycontributions from employees. In June 2017, more than 91% of the employees who benefited from the profit-sharing schemes opted to invest in the collective savings scheme, and nearly 79% opted to invest in the collective retirement savings scheme. Sanofi supplements the amount invested by employees in these schemes by making a top-up contribution. In 2017, \u20ac130.1 million and \u20ac56.9 million were invested in the collective savings scheme and the collective retirement savings scheme respectively through the voluntary and statutory schemesfor 2016, and through top-up contributions. In December 2017, we entered into a new agreement for an indefinite period, setting out revised terms for the top-up contribution to the collective savings scheme and covering all the employees of our French companies. Employee Share Ownership As of December 31, 2017, shares held under the collective savingsscheme by employees of Sanofi, employees of related companies and former employees amounted to 1.54% of our share capital. For more information about our most recent employee share ownershipplan, refer to \"Item 10. Additional Information\u2014Changes in Share Capital\u2014Increases in Share Capital\". E. Share Ownership Senior Management Members of the Executive Committee hold shares of our Company amounting in the aggregate to less than 1% of our share capital. During 2017, 179,398 stock options were exercised by individuals who were members of the Executive Committee when they exercised. One of the plans involved pre-dated the creation of the Executive Committee (sanofi-aventis plan of December 14, 2006, exercise price\u20ac66.91), while the other four post-dated the creation of the Executive Committee (sanofi-aventis plan of December 13, 2007, exercise price\u20ac62.33; sanofi-aventis plan of March 3, 2009, exercise price\u20ac45.09; sanofi-aventis plan of March 9, 2011,exercise price\u20ac50.48; and sanofi-aventis plan of March 5, 2012, exercise price\u20ac56.44). Existing Option Plans as of December 31, 2017 As of December 31, 2017, a total of 7,889,020 options were outstanding: 104,701 stock purchase options and 7,784,319 stock subscription options. As of that same date, 5,812,165 options were immediately exercisable: 104,701 stock purchase options and5,707,464 stock subscription options. 188 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES Equity-based compensation, consisting of share subscription option plans and performance share plans, aims to align our employees' objectives with those of our shareholders and to reinforce the link between our employees and Sanofi. UnderFrench law, awarding such plans falls within the powers of the Board of Directors. Stock options are awarded to employees and executive officers by our Board of Directors on the basis ofrecommendations from the Compensation Committee. Granting options is a way of recognizing the grantee's performance and contribution to the development of Sanofi, and also of securing his or her future commitment. For each plan, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors assess whether it should take the form of options to subscribe for shares or options to purchase shares, based on criteria that are primarily financial. A list of grantees is proposed by the Chief Executive Officer to the Compensation Committee, which reviews the list and then submits it to the Board of Directors, which takes the decision to grant the options. The Board of Directors also sets the terms for the exerciseof the options (including the exercise price) and the lock-up period. The exercise price never incorporates a discount, and is at leastequal to the average of the quoted market prices on the 20 trading days preceding the date of grant. Stock option plans invariably specify a lock-up period of four years and a total duration of tenyears. In 2011, the Board of Directors made substantial changes to our equity-based compensation policy. To limit the dilutive effect on our shareholders, the Board of Directors decided to primarily awardperformance shares, except for a limited number of high-levelexecutives who may continue to receive options. Regardless of the identity of the grantee, any award of options or performance shares is fully contingent upon performance targets being achieved over three financial years. At its meeting of May 10, 2017 the Board of Directors (in addition to the 220,000 options awarded to Olivier Brandicourt) awarded 14 grantees a total of 158,040 stock options, each of which givesentitlement to subscribe for one of our shares. The 2017 awards represent a dilution of approximately 0.03% of our undiluted share capital as of December 31, 2017. The entire award is contingent upon the same criteria, based onbusiness net income(1)and return on assets (ROA), as the award made to members of the Executive Committee. The attainment levels are also the same as for the award made to members of the Executive Committee. Vesting is also subject to a non-competeclause. The number of options awarded to the Chief Executive Officer in 2017 represents 3.49% of the total limit approved by the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting of May 4, 2016 (0.5% of our share capital) and 58.19% of the total award to all beneficiaries made on May 10, 2017. Not all of our employees were awarded stock options, but a new voluntary profit-sharing agreement was signed in June 2017 which gives all of our employees an interest in Sanofi's performance (formore details refer to \"- Profit-Sharing Schemes, Employee SavingsSchemes and Employee Share Ownership\", above).

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the ten employees (other than corporate officers) granted the most options were collectively awarded a total of 157,140 options. During the same period, a total of 261,898 shares were purchased or subscribed for by the ten employees (other than corporate officers) who exercised the most options during the period, at a weighted average exercise price of approximately\u20ac59.86 pershare. Existing Restricted Share Plans as of December 31, 2017 Since 2009, the Board of Directors has awarded shares to certain employees in order to give them a direct stake in our future and performances via trends in the share price, as a partial substitute for the granting of stock options. Shares are awarded to employees on the basis of a list submitted to the Compensation Committee. This Committee then submits the list to the Board of Directors, which decides whether to award theshares. The Board of Directors sets the continuing employmentconditions to which vesting is subject, and any lock-up conditions for the shares. In 2011, the Board of Directors made substantial changes to our equity-based compensation policy. To limit the dilutive effect on our shareholders, the Board of Directors decided to primarily award performance shares, except for a limited number of high-level executives who could continue to receive options. Under thisrevised policy, any award of options or performance shares is fully contingent upon performance targets being achieved over three financial years, regardless of the identity of the grantee. Our share plans have a three-year vesting period, with no lock-up period. At its meeting of May 10, 2017, the Board of Directors awarded two plans, in addition to the plan awarded to the Chief Executive Officer: a \"France\" plan, under which 2,289 beneficiaries were awarded a total of 1,174,270 shares; and an \"International\" plan, under which 5,278 beneficiaries wereawarded a total of 2,363,195 shares. 190 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 6.

The entire award is contingent upon the same criteria, based onbusiness net income (1)and return on assets (ROA), as the award made to members of the Executive Committee. The attainment levels are also the same as for the awards made to members of the Executive Committee. Vesting is subject to a non-competeclause. The number of performance shares awarded to the Chief Executive Officer in 2017 represents 0.26% of the total limit approved by theShareholders' Annual General Meeting of May 4, 2016 (1.5% of the share capital) and 1.39% of the total amount awarded to allbeneficiaries on May 10, 2017.

DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(R) OF THE UNITED STATES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Sanofi conducts limited business relating to human and animal health products with Iran contributing well under 1% of Sanofi's consolidated net sales in 2017. These activities, which are not financially material to Sanofi, are being disclosed pursuant toSection 13(r) of the United States Exchange Act of 1934, asamended. Sales consisted of bulk and branded pharmaceuticals, and vaccines. US affiliates of Sanofi, or foreign affiliates controlled by US affiliates of Sanofi, are either not involved in these activitiesor operate under humanitarian licenses issued by the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Limited businessamounting to approximately\u20ac0.9 million in gross revenues has been conducted by non-US subsidiaries of Sanofi not requiring an OFAC license with entities such as public hospitals or distributors tied to the Ministry of Health. It is estimated that this activitycontributed no more than \u20ac0.5 million to net profits. A representative office in Tehran incurs incidental expenses from state-owned utilities. In January 2016, Sanofi and the Iran Food and Drug Administration,affiliated with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran, signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) regarding (i) potential future projects to reinforce current partnershipswith reputable Iranian manufacturers (in particular to enhance industrial quality standards), (ii) collaborating with the Ministry of Health on programs for the prevention and control of certain chronic and non-communicable diseases (in particular diabetes) and (iii) potential futurecollaboration on epidemiological studies. Following the MOC, Sanofi and the Iranian company BarkatPharmed Co. entered into a non-binding letter of intent on June 16, 2017 to evaluate the possibility of a transaction involving the creation of a joint venture, or other possible forms of transaction,the business purpose of which would be the manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products in Iran. The MoC and the letter of intent did not generate any revenue, nor any net profit. Sanofi has determined that its activities are compliant with applicable law. In light of the nature of the activities concerned, Sanofi and its affiliates intend to continue their activities in Iran. INFORMATION ON LEGAL OR ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS This Item 8 incorporates by reference the disclosures found in Note D.22. to the consolidated financial statements at Item 18 of SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 195ITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION this annual report; material updates thereto as of the date of this annual report are found below under the heading \"- B. Significant Changes - Updates to Note D.22\". Sanofi and its subsidiaries are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings. These proceedings typically are related to product liability claims, intellectual property rights (particularlyclaims against generic companies seeking to limit the patentprotection of Sanofi products), competition law and trade practices, commercial claims, employment and wrongful discharge claims, taxassessment claims, waste disposal and pollution claims, and claims under warranties or indemnification arrangements relating to business divestitures. As a result, we may become subject to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance andcould affect our business and reputation. While we do not currentlybelieve that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable. As a consequence, we may in the future incurjudgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, cash flows and/or our reputation. Patents Co-Aprovel\u00aePatent Infringement Actions (Europe) Sanofi has been involved since early 2012 in a number of legalproceedings involving generic companies that attempted to launch or launched generic versions of Sanofi's Co-Aprovel \u00aein several European countries including the United Kingdom, Belgium,France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Norway. Sanofi filed for and was granted preliminary injunctions (PI) against severalgeneric companies based on Sanofi's Supplemental Protection Certificate (SPC) covering Co-Aprovel \u00aeuntil October 15, 2013. The UK Court referred the question on the validity of the Co-Aprovel\u00ae SPC to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in October 2012. Following the CJEU decision of December 12, 2013 that declared the Co-Aprovel\u00aeSPC invalid, generic companies (whose products were withdrawn from the market due to national preliminary injunctions or cross-undertakings) have filed damages claims against Sanofi in several countries. Lantus\u00aeMerck Patent Litigation (United States) On September 16, 2016, several Sanofi entities filed a patentinfringement suit against Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (\"Merck\") in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. In its suit, Sanofi alleges infringement of several patents. The suit wastriggered by a notification received from Merck in early August2016, in which Merck stated that it had filed an NDA (505(b)(2) New Drug Application) with FDA for an insulin glargine drug pen product. Merck also stated that its NDA included aparagraph IV certification challenging all of the Sanofi patents then listed in the FDA Orange Book for Sanofi's Lantus \u00aeand Lantus\u00aeSoloStar\u00aeproducts. This suit resulted in a stay during which the FDA cannot approve Merck's NDA. The 30 month stay is expectedto expire on the earlier of (i) February 8, 2019 or (ii) a court decision in favor of Merck. The Court has scheduled a bench trial to begin onMay 29, 2018, a claim construction hearing took place on November 6, 2017, and briefing on summary judgment motions on certain issues pertaining to some of the patents-in-suit is complete. On August 8, 2017, several Sanofi entities filed a patent infringement suit against Merck in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In its suit, Sanofi alleges infringement of two patents. The suit was triggered by a notification received fromMerck in late June 2017, in which Merck stated that it had filed an NDA with the FDA for an insulin glargine drug vial product. Merckalso stated that its NDA included a paragraph IV certification challenging all of the Sanofi patents then listed in the FDA Orange Book for Sanofi's Lantus \u00aeand Lantus\u00aeSoloStar\u00aeproducts. This suit resulted in a stay during which the FDA cannot approve Merck's NDA. The 30 month stay is expected to expire on the earlier of (i) December 30, 2019 or (ii) a court decision in favor of Merck. Theparties are currently proceeding with discovery and claim construction. Lantus\u00aeMylan Patent Litigation (United States) In June 2017, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed petitions for Inter Partes Review (IPR) for US Patent 7,476,652 and 7,713,930 regarding Lantus\u00aewith the United States Patent Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). In these petitions, Mylan attacks thevalidity of all claims of these patents. On December 13, 2017, the PTAB decided to move forward with Mylan's IPRs for these twopatents. The PTAB's final written decisions concerning the validity of the claims are due on or before December 13, 2018. On October 24 and 26, 2017, several Sanofi entities filed a patent infringement suit against Mylan N.V., Mylan GmbH, Mylan Inc., and Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (collectively, \"Mylan\") in the United States District Courts for the District of New Jersey and Northern District of West Virginia. In its suits, Sanofi allegesinfringement of several patents. The suits were triggered by a notification received from Mylan in mid-September 2017, in whichMylan stated that it had filed an NDA with the FDA for an insulin glargine drug pen and vial products. Mylan also stated that its NDA included a paragraph IV certification challenging all of the Sanofipatents then listed in the FDA Orange Book for Sanofi's Lantus \u00ae and Lantus\u00aeSoloStar\u00aeproducts. These suits resulted in a stay during which the FDA cannot approve Mylan's NDA. The 30 month stay is expected to expire on the earlier of (i) March 18, 2020 or (ii) a court decision in favor of Mylan. On February 21, 2018, theWest Virginia case was dismissed and the parties are now proceeding only with the New Jersey lawsuit. The parties are currently proceeding with discovery and claim construction. Multaq\u00aePatent Litigation (United States) From January 2014 to November 2014, several genericmanufacturers notified Sanofi that they had filed Abbreviated 196 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION New Drug Applications (ANDAs) seeking FDA approval to market generic versions of Multaq\u00ae(dronedarone hydrochloride) in the US. In April 2015, Sanofi received a tenth notice directed to Multaq\u00aefrom Lupin. The notices challenged some, but not all, of the patents listed by Sanofi in the FDA's Orange Book inconnection with Multaq \u00ae. None of the ANDA filers challenged the patent directed to the active ingredient in Multaq\u00ae, US Patent 5,223,510 (the '510 patent). Sanofi brought suit against all of the ANDA filers in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for patent infringement. Depending on the contents of the particular Paragraph IV Certification, Sanofi has brought suit for infringementof at least three and sometimes four of its Orange Book listed patents. Having settled with all but two generic manufacturers, Sanofi went to trial against Sandoz and Watson in early June 2016 alleging infringement of US patents 8,318,800 (formulation) and8,410,167 (method of use). In August 2016, the Court ruled in Sanofi's favor finding the '800 patent infringed and the '167 patentvalid and infringed by both Sandoz and Watson. In September 2016, Sandoz and Watson filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\"CAFC\"). In November 2017, theCAFC affirmed the lower court decision with respect to both patentsfinding that the '800 patent was infringed and that the '167 patent was valid and infringed. The defendants did not file a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. This litigation is now over. On October 13, 2015, Sanofi amended its complaint against Lupin to include US Patent 9,107,900 which was listed in the Orange Book in September 2015. In December 2015, Sanofi filed separatepatent infringement actions against six of the other defendantsbased on this patent. Having settled with all but two generic manufacturers, Sanofi went to trial on the '900 patent in April 2017 against Sandoz and Watson. In October 2017, the District Court ofDelaware ruled in Sanofi's favor and found that Claims 1, 7, 9 and14 of the '900 patent were valid and infringed while it found claims 6 and 8 were not infringed. The defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in December 2017. On January 23, 2018, Sandoz voluntarily dismissed its appeal tothe Federal Circuit. Sanofi and Watson settled their litigation on February 13, 2018. This litigation is over. Genzyme Aubagio\u00aePatent Litigation (United States) Aubagio\u00aeis covered by three Orange Book listed patents: US 6,794,410, US 8,802,735, and US 9,186,346.

As part of this settlement, and as part of the settlement entered into by Sanofi US in December 2012 relating to civil claims arising out of an investigation into samplingof its former product Hyalgan \u00aefor which Sanofi US paid $109 million, the companies entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (\"CIA\") with the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services inSeptember 2015. Also in September 2015, Genzyme entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\"DPA\") with the US Department of Justice and paid in that respect approximately$33 million to resolve the Seprafilm \u00aematter completely.

Sanofi US is defending this action as well as four State AttorneyGeneral actions (Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico and West Virginia) concerning the sale and marketing of Plavix \u00ae. In December 2016 and January 2017, two putative class actionswere filed against Sanofi US and Sanofi GmbH in Federal Court in Massachusetts on behalf of direct-purchasers of Lantus\u00aealleging certain antitrust violations. On January 10, 2018, the District Court of Massachusetts dismissed Plaintiffs' complaint against Sanofi. The dismissal of Plaintiffs' entire case was without prejudice. In January 2017, the Minnesota State Attorney General's office issued a civil investigative demand calling for the production of documents and information relating to pricing and trade practices for Lantus\u00aeand Toujeo\u00ae, from January 1, 2008 through present.

On December 26, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, consolidating these fourseparate actions. A fifth case ( MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC ) was filed on February 15, 2018 in New Jersey Federal Court. This matter will be coordinated (not consolidated) with the case above. In France, in the claim concerning allegations that Sanofi's communication and promotional practices inhibited the entry on the market of generics of clopidogrel (the active ingredient of Plavix\u00ae), the French Antitrust Authority issued its decision on May 14, 2013, imposing on Sanofi a fine of \u20ac40.6 million. In December 2014, the Paris Court of Appeals rejected Sanofi's appeal and confirmed in totality the decision. Sanofi filed a \" pourvoi \" with the French Supreme Court ( Cour de cassation ) in January 2015. As a consequence of the May 2013 ruling, claims were filed by Sandozand by Teva in 2014 before the Commercial Court of Paris forcompensation of their alleged damages: loss of margin and other ancillary damages (legal fees to external counsel, image andreputation). In June and November 2016 respectively, settlement agreements were entered into with Sandoz and Teva. Consequently, they subsequently withdrew their civil claims, jointly and severally. On October 18, 2016, the Supreme Court confirmedthe Court of Appeals' decision. Therefore, the Court of Appeals' decision became definitive. In September 2017, Sanofi and Sanofi Aventis France received a summons before the Paris CommercialCourt from the French Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (French Social Security) claiming \u20ac115.8 million for their alleged damages.

Sanofi has voluntarily provided information to the DOJ and the SEC and proactively cooperated in both agencies' review of the allegations. In February 2018, the DOJ notified Sanofi that it had decided toclose its inquiry into the allegations. Sanofi is still cooperating with the SEC's review of the allegations. B.

There are currently no limits imposed on the amounts of loans or borrowings that the Board ofDirectors may approve. Directors' Age Limits For a description of the provisions of our Articles of Associationrelating to age limits applicable to our Directors, see \"Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees.\" Directors' Share Ownership Requirements Pursuant to the Board Charter, our Directors are required to hold at least 1,000 shares during the term of their appointment. SHARE CAPITAL As of December 31, 2017, our share capital amounted to\u20ac2,508,039,808, divided into 1,254,019,904 outstanding shares with a par value of\u20ac2 per share. All of our outstanding shares are of the same class and are fully paid. Of these shares, we or entitiescontrolled by us held 173,726 shares (or 0.014% of our outstandingshare capital), as treasury shares as of such date. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying amount of such shares was \u20ac9 million. At an extraordinary general meeting held on May 10, 2017, our shareholders authorized our Board of Directors to increase our share capital, through the issuance of shares or other securities giving access to the share capital with or without preemptive rights,by an aggregate maximum nominal amount of \u20ac1.289 billion. See \"- Changes in Share Capital - Increases in Share Capital,\" below. The maximum total number of authorized but unissued shares asof December 31, 2017 was 141 million, reflecting the unused part of the May 4, 2016 and May 10, 2017 shareholder authorizations toissue shares without preemptive rights, outstanding options tosubscribe for shares, and awards of shares. STOCK OPTIONS Types of Stock Options We have two types of stock options outstanding: options tosubscribe for shares (options de souscription d'actions )and options to purchase shares (options d'achat d'actions ).Upon exercise of an option to subscribe for shares, we issue new shares,whereas upon exercise of an option to purchase shares, the option holder receives existing shares. We purchase our shares on the market prior to the vesting of the options to purchase in order toprovide the option holder with shares upon exercise. Because the exercise of options to purchase shares will be satisfied with existing shares repurchased on the market or held in treasury, the exercise of options to purchase shares has no impacton the amount of our share capital. Stock Option Plans Our combined general meeting held on May 4, 2016 authorized ourBoard of Directors for a period of 38 months to grant, on one or more occasions, options to subscribe for shares and options to purchase shares in favor of persons to be chosen by the Board ofDirectors from among the salaried employees and corporate officers of our Company or of companies or groupings of economic interest of the Group in accordance with Article L. 225-180 of theFrench Commercial Code. The aggregate number of options to subscribe for shares and options to purchase shares that may be granted under this authorization may not give entitlement to a total number of shares exceeding 0.5% of the share capital as of the date of the decision by the Board of Directors to grant such options. The Board of Directors sets the exercise price of options to subscribe for shares and options to purchase shares. However, the exercise price never incorporates a discount and must be at leastequal to the average of the quoted market prices on the 20 tradingsessions preceding the date of grant by the Board of Directors. Stock option plans generally provide for a lock-up period of four years and have a duration of ten years. Under such authorization the shareholders expressly waive, in favor of the grantees of options to subscribe for shares, their preemptive rights in respect of shares that are to be issued as andwhen options are exercised. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 203ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The Board of Directors is granted full power to implement this authorization and to set the terms and conditions on which options are granted and the arrangements with respect to the dividend entitlement of the shares.

The existing or new shares allotted under this authorization may not represent more than 1.5% of our share capital as of the date of the decision by the Board of Directors to allot such shares. The authorization provides that allotment of shares to the allottees will become irrevocable at the end of a minimum vesting period of three years. In the case of newly issued shares, the authorization entails the express waiver by the shareholders, in favor of the allottees of restricted shares, of their preemptive rights in respect of sharesthat are to be issued as and when restricted shares vest. The Board of Directors sets the terms on which restricted shares are granted and the arrangements with respect to the dividend entitlement of the shares. See \"Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees - E. Share Ownership\" for a description of our restricted shares plans currently in force. CHANGES IN SHARE CAPITAL IN 2017 See Note D.15.1. to our consolidated financial statements includedat Item 18 of this annual report. VOTING RIGHTS In general, each shareholder is entitled to one vote per share atany shareholders' general meeting. Our Articles of Association do not provide for cumulative voting rights. However, our Articles of Association provide that any fully paid-up shares that have beenheld in registered form under the name of the same shareholder for at least two years acquire double voting rights. The double voting rights cease automatically for any share converted into bearer formor transferred from one owner to another, subject to certain exceptions permitted by law.As of December 31, 2017, there were 146,706,132 shares that were entitled to double voting rights, representing 11.69% of our total share capital, and approximately 20.95% of the voting rights which can be cast at our shareholders' general meeting as of that date. Double voting rights are not taken into account in determining whether a quorum exists. Under the French Commercial Code, treasury shares or shares held by entities controlled by that company are not entitled to voting rights and do not count for quorum purposes. Our Articles of Association allow us to obtain from Euroclear France the name, nationality, address and number of shares held by holders of our securities that have, or may in the future have,voting rights.

When an adjourned meeting is resumed, there is no quorum requirement for meetings cited in the first paragraph of this \"Quorum\" section.

DIVIDENDS We may only distribute dividends out of our \"distributable profits,\" plus any amounts held in our reserves that the shareholders decide to make available for distribution, other than those reserves that are specifically required by law or our Articles of Association.\"Distributable profits\" consist of our unconsolidated net profit in each fiscal year, as increased or reduced by any profit or loss carried forward from prior years, less any contributions to thereserve accounts pursuant to law or our Articles of Association. Legal Reserve The French Commercial Code requires us to allocate 5% of ourunconsolidated net profit for each year to our legal reserve fund before dividends may be paid with respect to that year. Funds must be allocated until the amount in the legal reserve is equal to 10% ofthe aggregate par value of the issued and outstanding share capital. This restriction on the payment of dividends also applies to each of our French subsidiaries on an unconsolidated basis. AtDecember 31, 2017, our legal reserve amounted to\u20ac282,280,863,representing 11.26% of the aggregate par value of our issued and outstanding share capital as of that date. The legal reserve of anycompany subject to this requirement may serve to allocate losses that may not be allocated to other reserves, or may be distributed to shareholders upon liquidation of the company. Approval of Dividends According to the French Commercial Code, our Board of Directors may propose a dividend for approval by shareholders at the annual general shareholders' meeting. If we have earned distributable SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 207ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION profits since the end of the preceding fiscal year, as reflected in an interim income statement certified by our independent auditors, our Board of Directors may distribute interim dividends to the extent of the distributable profits for the period covered by the interimincome statement. Our Board of Directors exercises this authority subject to French law and regulations and may do so without obtaining shareholder approval. Distribution of Dividends Dividends are distributed to shareholders pro rata according to their respective holdings of shares. In the case of interim dividends, distributions are made to shareholders on the date set by our Board of Directors during the meeting in which the distribution ofinterim dividends is approved. The actual dividend payment date isdecided by the shareholders at an ordinary general shareholders' meeting or by our Board of Directors in the absence of such a decision by the shareholders. Shareholders that own shares on theactual payment date are entitled to the dividend. Dividends may be paid in cash or, if the shareholders' meeting so decides, in kind, provided that all shareholders receive a whole number of assets of the same nature paid in lieu of cash. OurArticles of Association provide that, subject to a decision of the shareholders' meeting taken by ordinary resolution, eachshareholder may be given the choice to receive his dividend incash or in shares. Timing of Payment According to the French Commercial Code, we must pay anyexisting dividends within nine months of the end of our fiscal year, unless otherwise authorized by court order. Dividends on shares that are not claimed within five years of the date of declaredpayment revert to the French State. CHANGES IN SHARE CAPITAL Increases in Share Capital As provided for by the French Commercial Code, our share capitalmay be increased only with shareholders' approval at an extraordinary general shareholders' meeting following the recommendation of our Board of Directors.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION capital increases resulting in the issuance of securities to members of employee savings plans are limited to 1% of the share capital as computed on the date of the Board of Directors' decision to issue such securities, and such issuances may bemade at a discount of 20% (or 30%) if certain French law restrictions on resales were to apply, i.e. a lock up period of five years (or 10 years). At its meeting of March 2, 2017, our Board of Directors decided todelegate to the Chief Executive Officer the powers necessary to carry out a capital increase reserved for members of the Group savings program. Every employee subscribing for at least five shares received one additional new share as an employer's top-up contribution, and every employee subscribing for an additional fifteen shares (i.e. twenty shares in total) received four additionalshares as an employer's top-up contribution for the first ten shares. Beyond the first twenty shares there was no entitlement to any further shares by way of employer's top-up contribution. Thesubscription period was open during June 2017. 25,760 employees from approximately 80 countries subscribed for a total of 1,528,982 shares. Of these, 727,943 shares were subscribed via FCPE Actions Sanofi, the dedicated employee share ownership fund for employees of our French subsidiaries; 342,670 shares via FCPE Sanofi Shares, the dedicated employee share ownership fund for employees of our foreign subsidiaries;and 458,369 shares directly by employees who were eligible for the employee share ownership plan but were in countries where local regulations did not allow the use of a dedicated employee shareownership fund. A total of 92,116 shares were issued by way of employer's top-up contribution. Of these, 40,209 were 25,484 to FCPE Sanofi Shares; and 26,423 directly to employees who were eligible for the employee share ownership plan but were in countries where local regulations did not allow the use of a dedicated employee share ownership fund. Voting rights attached to shares held by FCPE Actions Sanofi are exercised individually by the employees who hold units in the fund; fractional rights are exercised by the fund's supervisory board. Voting rights attached to shares held by FCPE Sanofi Shares are also exercised individually by the employees who hold units in the fund; any rights not exercised by them are exercised by the fund'ssupervisory board.

See also \"Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees - E. Share Ownership\". Decreases in Share Capital In accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code,any decrease in our share capital requires approval by the shareholders entitled to vote at an extraordinary general meeting. The share capital may be reduced either by decreasing the parvalue of the outstanding shares or by reducing the number of outstanding shares. The number of outstanding shares may be reduced either by an exchange of shares or by the repurchase andcancellation of shares. Holders of each class of shares must betreated equally unless each affected shareholder agrees otherwise. In addition, specific rules exist to permit the cancellation of treasury shares, by which the shareholders' meeting may authorize the cancellation of up to a maximum of 10% of a company's sharecapital within any 24-month period. On May 10, 2017, our shareholders delegated to our Board of Directors for 26 months theright to reduce our share capital by canceling our own shares. PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS According to the French Commercial Code, if we issue additionalsecurities to be paid in cash, current shareholders will have preemptive rights to these securities on apro ratabasis. These preemptive rights require us to give priority treatment to currentshareholders. The rights entitle the individual or entity that holds them to subscribe to the issuance of any securities that may increase the share capital of our Company by means of a cash payment or aset-off of cash debts. Preemptive rights are transferable during the subscription period relating to a particular offering. These rights may also be listed on Euronext Paris Stock Exchange. Preemptive rights with respect to any particular offering may be waived by the affirmative vote of shareholders holding two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an extraordinary general meeting. OurBoard of Directors and our independent auditors are required byFrench law to present reports that specifically address any proposal to waive preemptive rights. In the event of a waiver, the SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 209ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION issuance of securities must be completed within the period prescribed by law. Shareholders may also notify us that they wish to waive their own preemptive rights with respect to any particular offering if they so choose. The shareholders may decide at extraordinary general meetings to give the existing shareholders a non-transferable priority right to subscribe to the new securities, for a limited period of time. In the event of a capital increase without preemptive rights to existing shareholders, French law requires that the capital increase be made at a price equal to or exceeding the weighted average market prices of the shares for the last three trading days on Euronext Paris Stock Exchange prior to the determination of the subscription price of the capital increase less 5%. FORM, HOLDING AND TRANSFER OF SHARES Form of Shares Our Articles of Association provide that the shares may be held in either bearer form or registered form at the option of the holder. Holding of Shares In accordance with French law relating to the dematerialization ofsecurities, shareholders' ownership rights are represented by book entries instead of share certificates. We maintain a share account with Euroclear France (a French clearing system, which holdssecurities for its participants) for all shares in registered form, which is administered by BNP Paribas Securities Services. In addition, we maintain separate accounts in the name of eachshareholder either directly or, at a shareholder's request, throughthe shareholder's accredited intermediary. Each shareholder account shows the name of the holder and the number of sharesheld. BNP Paribas Securities Services issues confirmations (attestations d'inscription en compte )to each registered shareholder as to shares registered in the shareholder's account, but these confirmations are not documents of title. Shares of a listed company may also be issued in bearer form. Shares held in bearer form are held and registered on the shareholder's behalf in an account maintained by an accredited financial intermediary and are credited to an account at EuroclearFrance maintained by such intermediary. Each accredited financial intermediary maintains a record of shares held through it and provides the account holder with a securities account statement.Transfers of shares held in bearer form may only be made through accredited financial intermediaries and Euroclear France. Shares held by persons who are not domiciled in France may be registered in the name of intermediaries who act on behalf of one or more investors. When shares are so held, we are entitled to request from such intermediaries the names of the investors. Also, we may request any legal entity (personne morale )which holds more than 2.5% of our shares or voting rights to disclose the name of any person who owns, directly or indirectly, more than one-thirdof its share capital or of its voting rights. A person not providing thecomplete requested information in time, or who provides incomplete or false information, will be deprived of its voting rights at shareholders' meetings and will have its payment of dividends withheld until it has provided the requested information in strict compliance with French law. If such person acted willfully, theperson may be deprived by a French court of either its voting rights or its dividends or both for a period of up to five years. Transfer of Shares Our Articles of Association do not contain any restrictions relating to the transfer of shares. Registered shares must be converted into bearer form before being transferred on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange on the shareholders' behalf and, accordingly, must be registered in anaccount maintained by an accredited financial intermediary on the shareholders' behalf. A shareholder may initiate a transfer by giving instructions to the relevant accredited financial intermediary. A fee or commission is payable to the broker involved in the transaction, regardless of whether the transaction occurs within or outside France. Registration duty is currently payable in France if a written deed of sale and purchase (acte) is executed in France or outside France with respect to the shares of the Company. REDEMPTION OF SHARES Under French law, our Board of Directors is entitled to redeem a set number of shares as authorized by the extraordinary shareholders' meeting. In the case of such an authorization, the shares redeemed must be cancelled within one month after theend of the offer to purchase such shares from shareholders. However, shares redeemed on the open market do not need to be cancelled if the company redeeming the shares grants options onor awards those shares to its employees within one year following the acquisition. See also \"- Trading in Our Own Shares\" below. SINKING FUND PROVISIONS Our Articles of Association do not provide for any sinking fund provisions. LIABILITY TO FURTHER CAPITAL CALLS Shareholders are liable for corporate liabilities only up to the parvalue of the shares they hold; they are not liable to further capital calls. LIQUIDATION RIGHTS If we are liquidated, any assets remaining after payment of our debts, liquidation expenses and all of our remaining obligations will first be distributed to repay in full the par value of our shares. Any 210 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION surplus will be distributed pro rata among shareholders in proportion to the par value of their shareholdings. REQUIREMENTS FOR HOLDINGS EXCEEDING CERTAIN PERCENTAGES The French Commercial Code provides that any individual or entity, acting alone or in concert with others, that becomes the owner, directly or indirectly, of more than of the outstanding shares or voting rights of a listed company in France, such as our Company, or that increases or decreases its shareholding or voting rights above or below any of those percentages, must notify thecompany, before the end of the fourth trading day following thedate it crosses the threshold, of the number of shares it holds and their voting rights. The individual or entity must also notify the AMF before the end of the fourth trading day following the date it crossesany such threshold. The AMF makes the notice public. Pursuant to the French Commercial Code and the AMF General Regulation, the participation thresholds shall be calculated on the basis of the shares and voting rights owned, and shall take intoaccount the shares and voting rights which are deemed to be shares and voting rights owned, even if the individual or entity doesnot itself hold shares or voting rights. In accordance with thisdeemed ownership principle, the individual or entity must take into account specific situations where shares and voting rights are deemed to be shares and voting rights owned when calculating thenumber of shares owned to be disclosed in the notifications to the Company and to the AMF. It includes among others situations where an individual or entity is entitled to acquire issued shares atits own initiative, immediately or at the end of a maturity period, under an agreement or a financial instrument, without set-off against the number of shares that this individual or entity is entitledto sell under another agreement or financial instrument. The individual or entity required to make such notification shall also take into account issued shares covered by an agreement or cash-settled financial instrument and having an economic effect for saidindividual or entity that is equivalent to owning such shares. In the cases of deemed ownership described above, the notification shall mention the type of deemed ownership and include a description of the main characteristics of the financial instrument or agreementwith specific details required by the AMF General Regulation. The AMF General Regulation provides that shares and voting rights subject to multiple cases of deemed ownership shall only be counted once. When an individual or entity modifies the allocation between the shares it owns and its financial instruments or agreements deemed to be owned shares, it must disclose that change in a new notification. However, the change must only be disclosed if the acquisition of owned shares due to the settlement of the financialinstruments or agreements causes the investor to cross a threshold.Subject to certain limited exceptions, French law and AMFregulations impose additional reporting requirements on persons who acquire more than 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25% of the outstandingshares or voting rights of a company listed in France. These persons must file a report with the company and the AMF beforethe end of the fifth trading day following the date they cross any such threshold. In the report, the acquirer will have to specify its intentions for the following six months including: whether it acts alone or in concert with others; the means of financing of the acquisition (the notifier shallindicate in particular whether the acquisition is being financed with equity or debt, the main features of that debt, and, where applicable, the main guarantees given or received by the notifier. The notifier shall also indicate what portion of its holding, if any, itobtained through securities loans); whether or not it intends to continue its purchases; whether or not it intends to acquire control of the company in question; the strategy it contemplates vis-\u00e0-vis the issuer; the way it intends to implement its strategy, including: (i) anyplans for a merger, reorganization, liquidation, or partial transfer of a substantial part of the assets of the issuer or of any other entity it controls within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, (ii) any plans to modify the business of the issuer, (iii) any plans to modify articles of association of theissuer, (iv) any plans to delist a category of the issuer's financial instruments, and (v) any plans to issue the issuer's financial instruments; any agreement for the temporary transfer of shares or votingrights of the issuer; the way it intends to settle its agreements or instruments on theshares or voting rights of the issuer mentioned in Article L. 233- 9,4\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 bis of the French Commercial Code; and whether it seeks representation on the Board of Directors. The AMF makes the report public. Upon any change of intention within the six-month period following the filing of the report, it will have to file a new report for the following six-month period. In order to enable shareholders to give the required notice, we must each month publish on our website and send the AMF a written notice setting forth the total number of our shares and voting rights (including treasury shares) whenever they vary from the figures previously published. If any shareholder fails to comply with an applicable legal notification requirement, the shares in excess of the relevant threshold will be deprived of voting rights for all shareholders'meetings until the end of a two-year period following the date on SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 211ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION which the owner complies with the notification requirements. In addition, any shareholder who fails to comply with these requirements may have all or part of its voting rights suspended for up to five years by the Commercial Court at the request of ourChairman, any shareholder or the AMF, and may be subject to criminal fines. Under AMF regulations, and subject to limited exemptions granted by the AMF, any person or entity, acting alone or in concert, that crosses the threshold of 30% of the share capital or voting rights of a French listed company must initiate a public tender offer for thebalance of the shares and securities giving access to the share capital or voting rights of such company. Cash-settled derivative instruments or agreements mentioned in Article L. 233-9, 4\u00b0 bis of the French Commercial Code are not included in the calculation ofthe number of shares related to the mandatory public tender offer. In addition, our Articles of Association provide that any person or entity, acting alone or in concert with others, who becomes the owner of 1%, or any multiple of 1% of our share capital or ourvoting rights, even beyond the minimum declaration limits permitted by the legal and regulatory provisions, must notify us by certified mail, return receipt requested, within five trading days, ofthe total number of shares and securities giving access to our share capital and voting rights that such person then owns. The same provisions of our Articles of Association apply whenever suchowner increases or decreases its ownership of our share capital or our voting rights to such extent that it goes above or below one of the thresholds described in the preceding sentence. Any person orentity that fails to comply with such notification requirement will, upon the request of one or more shareholders holding at least 5%of our share capital or of our voting rights made at the general shareholders' meeting, be deprived of voting rights with respect tothe shares in excess of the relevant threshold for all shareholders' meetings until the end of a two-year period following the date on which such person or entity complies with the notificationrequirements. CHANGE IN CONTROL/ANTI-TAKEOVER There are no provisions in our Articles of Association that wouldhave the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company or that would operate only with respect to a merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring involving ourCompany or any of our subsidiaries. Further, there are no provisions in our Articles of Association that allow the issuance of preferred stock upon the occurrence of a takeover attempt or theaddition of other \"anti-takeover\" measures without a shareholder vote. Our Articles of Association do not include any provisions discriminating against any existing or prospective holder of our securities as a result of such shareholder owning a substantial number of shares.T R A D I N GI NO U RO W NS H A R E S Under French law, Sanofi may not issue shares to itself. However, we may, either directly or through a financial intermediary acting on our behalf, acquire up to 10% of our issued share capital within a maximum period of 18 months, provided our shares are listed on aregulated market. Prior to acquiring our shares, we must publish a description of the share repurchase program (descriptif du programme de rachat d'actions). We may not cancel more than 10% of our issued share capital over any 24-month period. Our repurchase of shares must not result in our Company holding, directly or through a person acting on ourbehalf, more than 10% of our issued share capital. We must holdany shares that we repurchase in registered form. These shares must be fully paid up. Shares repurchased by us continue to be deemed \"issued\" under French law but are not entitled to dividendsor voting rights so long as we hold them directly or indirectly, and we may not exercise the preemptive rights attached to them. The shareholders, at an extraordinary general shareholders meeting, may decide not to take these shares into account in determining the preemptive rights attached to the other shares. However, if the shareholders decide to take them into account, we must either sell the rights attached to the shares we hold on themarket before the end of the subscription period or distribute them to the other shareholders on a pro rata basis. On May 10, 2017, our shareholders approved a resolution authorizing us to repurchase up to 10% of our shares over an 18-month period. Under this authorization, the purchase price for each Sanofi ordinary share may not be greater than\u20ac120.00 and the maximum amount that Sanofi may pay for the repurchases is \u20ac15,504,267,840. This authorization was granted for a period of 18months from May 10, 2017 and cancelled and replaced the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the combinedgeneral meeting held on May 4, 2016. A description of this share repurchase program as adopted by the combined general meeting held on May 10, 2017 (descriptif du programme de rachatd'actions) was published on March 3, 2017. Purposes of Share Repurchase Programs Under the European regulation 596/2014, dated April 16, 2014 onmarket abuse and its delegated regulation 2016/1052 on repurchase programs and stabilization measures, dated March 8, 2016 (which we refer to in this section as the \"Regulation\"), anissuer will benefit from a safe harbor for share transactions that comply with certain conditions relating in particular to the pricing, volume and timing of transactions (see below) and that are made inconnection with a share repurchase program the purpose ofwhich is: to reduce the share capital through the cancellation of treasury shares; 212 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION to meet obligations arising from debt financial instruments that are exchangeable into equity instruments; and/or to meet obligations arising from share option programs or otherallocations of shares to employees or to members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of the issuer or of an associate company. Safe harbor transactions will by definition not be considered market abuses under the Regulation. Transactions that are carried out for other purposes than those mentioned above do not qualify for the safe harbor. However, as permitted by the Regulation, which provides for a presumption of legitimacy for existing market practices that do not constitute market manipulation and that conform with certaincriteria, the AMF has established as a French accepted marketpractice, which therefore benefits from a presumption of legitimacy, the use of liquidity agreements for share purchases that are entered into with a financial services intermediary and that complywith the code of conduct ( charte de d\u00e9ontologie ) approved by the AMF. The AMF confirmed that all transactions directed at maintaining the liquidity of an issuer's shares must be conducted pursuant to a liquidity agreement with a financial services intermediary acting independently. As of July 3, 2016, the purchase of shares that are subsequently used as acquisition currency in a business combination transaction, which the AMF previously permitted as an accepted market practice, is no longer considered as such, although such practice, while not benefiting from the presumption of legitimacy, is not prohibited under the Regulation. Pricing, Volume and Other Restrictions In order to qualify for the safe harbor described above, the issuer must generally comply with the following pricing and volume restrictions: a share purchase must not be made at a price higher than the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venues where the purchase is carried out; and subject to certain exceptions for illiquid securities, the issuer must not purchase on any trading day more than 25% of the average daily volume of the shares on the regulated market on which the purchase is carried out. The average daily volume figure must be based on the average daily volume traded in the month preceding the month of public disclosure of the share repurchase program and fixed on that basis for the authorizedperiod of that program. If the program does not make referenceto this volume, the average daily volume figure must be based on the average daily volume traded in the 20 trading days preceding the date of purchase.In addition, unless the issuer has in place a time-scheduledrepurchase program or the repurchase program is lead-managed by an investment firm or a credit institution which makes its tradingdecisions concerning the timing of the purchase of the issuer'sshares independently of the issuer, the issuer must not, for the duration of the repurchase program, engage in the followingactivities: selling its own shares; effecting any transaction during a closed period imposed by the applicable law of the Member State in which the transaction occurs (i.e .under French law, during the period between the date on which the company has knowledge of insider informationand the date on which such information is made public and during the 30 calendar day period before the announcement ofan interim financial report or a year-end report which the issuer isobliged to make public); or effecting any transaction in securities with respect to which theissuer has decided to delay the public disclosure of inside information, in accordance with applicable rules. Use of Share Repurchase Programs Pursuant to the AMF rules, issuers must immediately allocate therepurchased shares to one of the purposes provided for in the Regulation and must not subsequently use the shares for a different purpose. As an exception to the foregoing, sharesrepurchased with a view to covering stock option plans may, if no longer needed for this purpose, be re-allocated for cancellation or sold in compliance with AMF requirements relating in particular toblackout periods. Shares repurchased in connection with one of themarket practices authorized by the AMF (see above) may also be re-allocated to one of the purposes contemplated by the Regulationor sold in compliance with AMF requirements. Shares repurchased with a view to their cancellation must be cancelled within 24 months following their acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we used the authority delegated by our shareholders to repurchase our shares on the stock market. Pursuant to our share repurchase programs authorized by our shareholders on May 4, 2016 and on May 10, 2017, we repurchased 26,855,536 of our shares for a weighted average price of\u20ac80.04, i.e. a total cost of\u20ac2,149 million (including 20,000 shares purchased with a view to covering restricted share plans).Brokerage fees and financial transaction taxes (net of income taxes) amounted to\u20ac6.2 million. Our Company did not resort to derivatives to repurchase our own shares. On April 27, 2017, the Board of Directors cancelled 36,380,198 treasury shares repurchased between November 2016 and the end of March 2017 pursuant to the share repurchase program of theCompany. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 213ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION On December 14, 2017, the Board of Directors cancelled 10,402,540 treasury shares repurchased between April and September 2017 pursuant to the share repurchase program of the Company. During 2017, pursuant to the liquidity contract, Rothschild & Cie: purchased 1,012,115 of our shares at an average weighted price of\u20ac82.82 for a total amount of \u20ac83,822,744; and sold 962,365 of our shares at an average weighted price of \u20ac 83.13 for a total amount of \u20ac80,000,590. In 2017, of the 136,843 shares allocated to stock purchase option plans outstanding at December 31, 2016, 32,142 shares were transferred to grantees of options. In 2017, of the 20,000 shares allocated to restricted share plans outstanding at December 31, 2016, 725 shares were transferred to beneficiaries of performance shares. As a result, as of December 31, 2017, out of the 173,726 treasury shares, representing 0.014% of our share capital, 123,976 were allocated to outstanding stock purchase option plans and restricted share plans and 49,750 were allocated to the liquidity account. At the same date, none of the shares was allocated to the purpose ofcancellation. As of December 31, 2017, we directly owned 173,726 Sanofi shares with a par value of \u20ac2 representing around 0.014% of our share capital and with an estimated value of \u20ac9 million, based on the share price at the time of purchase. Reporting Obligations Pursuant to the Regulation, the AMF Regulation and the FrenchCommercial Code, issuers trading in their own shares are subject to the following reporting obligations: issuers must report all transactions in their own shares to the competent authority of each trading venue on which the shares are admitted to trading or are traded within seven trading days of the transaction in a prescribed format, unless such transactions are carried out pursuant to a liquidity agreement that complieswith the ethical code approved by the AMF; issuers must declare to the AMF on a monthly basis all transactions completed under the share repurchase program unless they provide the same information on a weekly basis; and post on its website the transactions disclosed and keep thatinformation available to the public for at least a 5-year period from the date of public disclosure. OWNERSHIP OF SHARES BY NON-FRENCH PERSONS The French Commercial Code and our Articles of Association currently do not limit the right of non-residents of France or non-French persons to own or, where applicable, to vote our securities. However, non-residents of France must file anadministrative notice with the French authorities in connection withcertain direct and indirect investments in us, including the acquisition of a controlling interest in our Company. Under existing administrative rulings, ownership of 331/3% or more of our share capital or voting rights is regarded as a controlling interest, but alower percentage might be held to be a controlling interest in certain circumstances depending upon factors such as: the acquiring party's intentions; the acquiring party's ability to elect directors; or financial reliance by the company on the acquiring party. Moreover, certain foreign investments in companies incorporated under French laws are subject to prior authorization from the French Minister of the Economy, where all or part of the target'sbusiness and activity relate to a strategic sector, such as energy, transportation, public health, telecommunications, etc. ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES We are a limited liability company (soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme )organized under the laws of France, and most of our officers and directors reside outside the United States. In addition, a substantial portion of our assets is located in France. As a result, investors may find it difficult or be unable to effect service of process within the United States upon or obtain jurisdiction over our Company or our officers and directors in US courts in actions predicated on the civil liability provisions of US securities law. It may also be difficult to enforce against them, either inside or outside the United States, judgments obtained against them in US courts, or to enforce in US courts, judgmentsobtained against them in courts in jurisdictions outside the United States, in any action based on civil liabilities under US federal securities laws. There is doubt as to the enforceabilityagainst such persons in France, whether in original actions or in actions to enforce judgments of US courts, of liabilities based solely on US federal securities laws. In addition, actions in theUnited States under US federal securities laws could be affectedunder certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968 as amended by French Law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980, which may preclude or restrict the obtaining of evidence in France or from French persons in connection with those actions. Additionally, awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in France. C. Material Contracts THE CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS AGREEMENT In connection with its acquisition of Genzyme Corporation, now awholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi, Sanofi issued one CVR per Genzyme share.

The first three milestones (related, respectively, to (i) manufacturing of Cerezyme\u00aeand Fabrazyme\u00ae (ii) US regulatory approval on or before March 31, 2014 ofLemtrada \u00aefor the treatment of MS (the \"Approval Milestone\") and (iii) Product Sales Milestone #1, pursuant to which a holder of a CVR would have been entitled to receive $2 per CVR if Lemtrada\u00ae sales (as defined in the CVR Agreement) post launch equaled or exceeded a total of $400 million within certain specified periods and territories) were not met. The remaining milestone payments under the CVR Agreement are summarized below: Product Sales Milestone #2 Payment. $3 per CVR upon the first instance in which Lemtrada\u00aesales (as defined in the CVR Agreement) for a four calendar quarter period are equal to or in excess of $1.8 billion. Given that the Approval Milestone was not achieved, an additional $1 per CVR will be paid shouldProduct Sales Milestone #2 be achieved, totaling $4 per CVR. Product Sales Milestone #3 Payment. $4 per CVR upon the first instance in which Lemtrada\u00aesales (as defined in the CVR Agreement) for a four calendar quarter period are equal to or in excess of $2.3 billion (however, no quarter in which Lemtrada\u00ae sales (as defined in the CVR Agreement) were used to determine the achievement of Product Sales Milestone #1 or #2 shall be included in the calculation of sales for determining whether Product Sales Milestone #3 has been achieved).

On February 7, 2018, Sanofi disclosed that, based upon actualsales trends to date, it does not expect that product sales milestones #2 to #4 will be met. The CVR Agreement will terminate on the earlier of (a) December 31, 2020 and (b) the date that Product Sales Milestone #4 is paid (the \"Termination Date\"), provided that if any milestone has been achieved prior to the Termination Date, but the associated CVR payment has not been paid on or prior to the Termination Date, the CVRAgreement shall not terminate until such payment has been paid in full in accordance with the terms of the CVR Agreement. Sanofi has agreed to use diligent efforts (as defined in the CVR Agreement), until the CVR Agreement is terminated, to achieveeach of the remaining milestones. However, we are not required totake all possible actions to achieve these goals. Sanofi has also agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain alisting for trading of the CVRs on the NASDAQ market. For more information on Lemtrada \u00aesee \"Item 4.B Business Overview - Pharmaceutical Products - Multiple Sclerosis\".The CVR Agreement does not prohibit Sanofi or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (as defined in the CVR Agreement) from acquiring the CVRs, whether in open market transactions, privatetransactions or otherwise. Sanofi has certain disclosure obligations in connection with such acquisitions under the CVR Agreement. Sanofi may also, subject to certain terms and conditions as setforth in the CVR Agreement, optionally purchase and cancel all (but not less than all) of the outstanding CVRs at a cash price asset forth in the CVR Agreement if (i) the volume-weighted average price paid per CVR for all CVRs traded over the forty-five trading days prior to such date is less than fifty cents and (ii) Lemtrada \u00ae sales (as defined in the CVR Agreement) in the four calendar quarters ended immediately prior to such date are less than $1 billion in the aggregate. A copy of the form of CVR Agreement is on file with the SEC as Annex B to Amendment No. 2 to the Registration Statement on Form F-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 24, 2011. Reference is made to such exhibit for a more complete description of the terms and conditions of the CVRAgreement, and the foregoing summary of such terms and conditions is qualified in its entirety by such exhibit. D. Exchange Controls French exchange control regulations currently do not limit the amount of payments that we may remit to non-residents of France. Laws and regulations concerning foreign exchange controls do require, however, that all payments or transfers of funds made by aFrench resident to a non-resident be handled by an accredited intermediary. E. Taxation GENERAL The following generally summarizes the material French and US federal income tax consequences to US holders (as defined below) of purchasing, owning and disposing of our ADSs and ordinary shares (collectively the \"Securities\"). This discussion isintended only as a descriptive summary and does not purport to bea complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects of the purchase, ownership or disposition of our Securities. All of the following is subject to change. Such changes could applyretroactively and could affect the consequences described below. This summary does not constitute a legal opinion or tax advice. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 215ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Securities in light of their particular circumstances, including the effect of any US federal, state, local or other national tax laws. A set of tax rules is applicable to French assets that are held by or in foreign trusts. These rules provide inter alia for the inclusion of trust assets in the settlor's net assets for purpose of applying theFrench real estate wealth tax, for the application of French gift anddeath duties to French assets held in trust, for a specific tax oncapital on the French assets of foreign trusts not already subject to the French real estate wealth tax and for a number of French taxreporting and disclosure obligations. The following discussion does not address the French tax consequences applicable to Securities held in trusts.If Securities are held in trust, the grantor, trustee and beneficiary are urged to consult their own tax adviser regarding thespecific tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Securities. The description of the French and US federal income tax consequences set forth below is based on the laws (including, for US federal income tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), final, temporary and proposed US Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder andadministrative and judicial interpretations thereof) in force as of the date of this annual report, the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Governmentof the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital of August 31, 1994 (the \"Treaty\"), which entered intoforce on December 30, 1995 (as amended by any subsequent protocols, including the protocol of January 13, 2009), and the taxregulations issued by the French tax authorities within theBulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Imp\u00f4ts(the \"Regulations\") in forceas of the date of this report.US holders are advised to consult their own tax advisers regarding their eligibility for Treaty benefits, especially with regard to the \"Limitations on Benefits\" provision, inlight of their own particular circumstances. For the purposes of this discussion, a US holder is a beneficial owner of Securities that is (i) an individual who is a US citizen or resident for US federal income tax purposes, (ii) a US domestic corporation or certain other entities created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, includingthe District of Columbia, or (iii) otherwise subject to US federalincome taxation on a net income basis in respect of Securities. A non-US holder is a person other than a US holder. If a partnership holds Securities, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.If a US holder is a partner in apartnership that holds Securities, the holder is urged to consult its own tax adviser regarding the specific tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Securities. This discussion is intended only as a general summary and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Securitiesto any particular investor, and does not discuss tax considerationsthat arise from rules of general application or that are generally assumed to be known by investors. The discussion applies only toinvestors that hold our Securities as capital assets that have theUS dollar as their functional currency, that are entitled to Treaty benefits under the \"Limitation on Benefits\" provision contained in the Treaty, and whose ownership of the Securities is not effectivelyconnected to a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France. Certain holders (including, but not limited to, US expatriates,partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, banks, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, tax-exempt organizations,financial institutions, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons who acquired the Securities pursuant to the exerciseof employee stock options or otherwise as compensation, persons that own (directly, indirectly or by attribution) 5% or more of our voting stock or 5% or more of our outstanding share capital,dealers in securities or currencies, persons that elect to mark their securities to market for US federal income tax purposes, persons that acquire ADSs in \"pre-release\" transactions (i.e. prior to depositof the relevant ordinary shares) and persons holding Securities as a position in a synthetic security, straddle or conversion transaction) may be subject to special rules not discussed below.Holders of Securities are advised to consult their own tax adviserswith regard to the application of French tax law and US federal income tax law to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or otherforeign jurisdiction. French Taxes Estate and Gift Taxes and Transfer Taxes In general, a transfer of Securities by gift or by reason of death of aUS holder that would otherwise be subject to French gift or inheritance tax, respectively, will not be subject to such French tax by reason of the Convention between the Government of theUnited States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Estates, Inheritancesand Gifts, dated November 24, 1978, unless the donor or the transferor is domiciled in France at the time of making the gift or at the time of his or her death, or the Securities were used in, or held for use in, the conduct of a business through a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France. Pursuant to Article 235 ter ZD of the French General Tax Code, purchases of Securities are subject to a 0.3% French tax on financial transactions (the \"FTFF\") provided that Sanofi's market capitalization exceeds 1 billion euros as of December 1 of the year preceding the taxation year. A list of companies whose market capitalization exceeds 1 billion euros as of December 1 of the yearpreceding the taxation year used to be published annually by the French Ministry of Economy. It is now published by the French tax authorities, and could be amended at any time. Pursuant toRegulations BOI-ANNX-000467-20171221 issued on December 21, 216 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 2017, purchases of Sanofi's Securities in 2018 should be subject to the FTFF as the market capitalization of Sanofi exceeded 1 billion euros as of December 1, 2017. In accordance with Article 726-II of the French General Tax Code, purchases which are subject to theFTFF should however not be subject to transfer taxes ( droits d'enregistrement ) in France. Wealth Tax The French wealth tax ( imp\u00f4t de solidarit\u00e9 sur la fortune ) has been replaced with a French real estate wealth tax (imp\u00f4t sur la fortune immobili\u00e8re) with effect from January 1, 2018. French real estate wealth tax applies only to individuals and does not generally applyto the Securities if the holder is a US resident, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, provided that the individual does not own directly or indirectly a shareholding exceeding 10% of thefinancial rights and voting rights. US Taxes Ownership of the Securities Deposits and withdrawals by a US holder of ordinary shares inexchange for ADSs, will not be taxable events for US federal income tax purposes. For US tax purposes, holders of ADSs will be treated as owners of the ordinary shares represented by suchADSs. Accordingly, the discussion that follows regarding the US federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of ordinary shares is equally applicable to ADSs. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax Distributions made to holders and proceeds paid from the sale,exchange, redemption or disposal of Securities may be subject to information reporting to the Internal Revenue Service. Such payments may be subject to backup withholding taxes unless theholder (i) is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) provides a taxpayer identification number and certifies that no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred. Holders that arenot US persons generally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding. However, such a holder may be required to provide a certification of its non-US status in connection with payments received within the United States or through a US-related financial intermediary to establish that it is an exempt recipient. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holder'sUS federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the Internal RevenueService and furnishing any required information. Foreign Asset Reporting In addition, a US holder that is an individual (and, to the extentprovided in future regulations, an entity), may be subject torecently-enacted reporting obligations with respect to ordinaryshares and ADSs if the aggregate value of these and certain other \"specified foreign financial assets\" exceeds $50,000. If required,this disclosure is made by filing Form 8938 with the US Internal Revenue Service. Significant penalties can apply if holders arerequired to make this disclosure and fail to do so. In addition, aUS holder should consider the possible obligation to file online a FinCEN Form 114 - Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Report as a result of holding ordinary shares or ADSs. Holders are encouraged to consult their US tax advisors with respect to theseand other reporting requirements that may apply to their acquisitionof ordinary shares and ADSs. State and Local Taxes In addition to US federal income tax, US holders of Securities maybe subject to US state and local taxes with respect to such Securities.Holders of Securities are advised to consult their own tax advisers with regard to the application of US state and localincome tax law to their particular situation. ADSS-ORDINARY SHARES French Taxes Taxation of Dividends Under French law, dividends paid by a French corporation, such asSanofi, to non-residents of France are generally subject to French withholding tax at a rate of 30% (12.8% for distributions made to individuals, and 15% for distributions made to not-for-profitorganizations with a head office in a Member State of the European Economic Area which would be subject to the tax regime set forth under article 206 paragraph 2 of the French General Tax Code if itshead office were located in France and which meet the criteria setforth in the Regulations BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-30-10-70-20171004, n o130). Dividends paid by a French corporation, such as Sanofi, towards non-cooperative States or territories, as defined inArticle 238-0 A of the French General Tax Code, will generally be subject to French withholding tax at a rate of 75%, irrespective ofthe tax residence of the beneficiary of the dividends if the dividendsare received in such States or territories; however, eligible US holders entitled to Treaty benefits under the \"Limitation on Benefits\" provision contained in the Treaty who are US residents,as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty and who receive dividends in non-cooperative States or territories, will not besubject to this 75% withholding tax rate. Under the Treaty, the rate of French withholding tax on dividends paid to an eligible US holder who is a US resident as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty and whose ownership of the ordinary shares or ADSs is not effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base that such US holder has inFrance, is reduced to 15%, or to 5% if such US holder is a corporation and owns directly or indirectly at least 10% of the share SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 217ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION capital of the issuing company; such US holder may claim a refund from the French tax authorities of the amount withheld in excess of the Treaty rates of 15% or 5%, if any. For US holders that are not individuals but are US residents, as defined pursuant to theprovisions of the Treaty, the requirements for eligibility for Treaty benefits, including the reduced 5% or 15% withholding tax rates contained in the \"Limitation on Benefits\" provision of the Treaty, arecomplicated, and certain technical changes were made to these requirements by the protocol of January 13, 2009. US holders are advised to consult their own tax advisers regarding their eligibility for Treaty benefits in light of their own particular circumstances. Dividends paid to an eligible US holder may immediately be subject to the reduced rates of 5% or 15% provided that such holder establishes before the date of payment that it is a US resident under the Treaty by completing and providing the depositary with a treaty form (Form 5000). Dividends paid to a US holder that has not filed the Form 5000 before the dividend payment date will be subject to Frenchwithholding tax at the rate of 30% and then reduced at a later date to 5% or 15%, provided that such holder duly completes and provides the French tax authorities with the treaty forms Form 5000 andForm 5001 before December 31 of the second calendar yearfollowing the year during which the dividend is paid. Pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are subject to the same general filing requirements as other US holders except that they may have tosupply additional documentation evidencing their entitlement to these benefits. The depositary agrees to use reasonable efforts to follow the procedures established, or that may be established, by the French tax authorities (i) to enable eligible US holders to qualify for the reduced withholding tax rate provided by the Treaty, if available at the time the dividends are paid, or (ii) to recover any excessFrench withholding taxes initially withheld or deducted with respect to dividends and other distributions to which such US holders may be eligible from the French tax authorities and (iii) to recover anyother available tax credits. In particular, associated forms (including Form 5000 and Form 5001, together with their instructions), will be made available by the depositary to all US holders registered withthe depositary, and are also generally available from the US Internal Revenue Service. The withholding tax refund, if any, ordinarily is paid within 12 months of filing the applicable French Treasury Form, but not before January 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the related dividend is paid. Tax on Sale or Other Disposition In general, under the Treaty, a US holder who is a US resident for purposes of the Treaty will not be subject to French tax on any capital gain from the redemption (other than redemption proceeds characterized as dividends under French domestic law), sale orexchange of ordinary shares or ADSs unless the ordinary shares or the ADSs form part of the business property of a permanentestablishment or fixed base that the US holder has in France.Special rules apply to holders who are residents of more than one country. US Taxes Taxation of Dividends For US federal income tax purposes, the gross amount of any distribution paid to US holders (that is, the net distribution received plus any tax withheld therefrom) will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent paid or deemed paid out of thecurrent or accumulated earnings and profits of Sanofi(as determined under US federal income tax principles). Dividends paid by Sanofi will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate US holders. Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the US dollar amount of dividends received by an individual US holder with respect to the ADSs or our ordinary shares is currently subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 20% if the dividends are \"qualified dividends\". Dividends paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as qualified dividends if (i) theissuer is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income taxtreaty with the United States that the Internal Revenue Service has approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules and (ii) the issuer was not, in the year prior to the year in which thedividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (\"PFIC\"). The Treaty has been approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules.Based on our audited financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, we believe Sanofi was not a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2017 taxable year. Inaddition, based on its current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market and shareholder data, we do not anticipate thatSanofi will become a PFIC for its 2018 taxable year.Holders ofordinary shares and ADSs should consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of their own particular circumstances. If you are a US holder, dividend income received by you with respect to ADSs or ordinary shares generally will be treated as foreign source income for foreign tax credit purposes. Thelimitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separatelywith respect to specific classes of income. Distributions out ofearnings and profits with respect to the ADSs or ordinary sharesgenerally will be treated as \"passive category\" income (or, in thecase of certain US holders, \"general category\" income). Subject tocertain limitations, French income tax withheld in connection withany distribution with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares maybe claimed as a credit against the US federal income tax liability ofa US holder if such US holder elects for that year to credit allforeign income taxes. Alternatively, such French withholding taxmay be taken as a deduction against taxable income. Foreign tax 218 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION credits will not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term or hedged positions in Securities and may not be allowed in respect of certain arrangements in which aUS holder's expected economic profit is insubstantial. The US federal income tax rules governing the availability andcomputation of foreign tax credits are complex. US holders shouldconsult their own tax advisers concerning the implications of theserules in light of their particular circumstances. To the extent that an amount received by a US holder exceeds the allocable share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess will be applied first to reduce such US holder'stax basis in its ordinary shares or ADSs and then, to the extent itexceeds the US holder's tax basis, it will constitute capital gainfrom a deemed sale or exchange of such ordinary shares or ADSs(see \"- Tax on Sale or Other Disposition\", below). The amount of any distribution paid in euros will be equal to the US dollar value of the euro amount distributed, calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend isreceived by a US holder of ordinary shares (or by the depositary, inthe case of ADSs) regardless of whether the payment is in factconverted into US dollars on such date.US holders should consulttheir own tax advisers regarding the treatment of foreign currencygain or loss, if any, on any euros received by a US holder that areconverted into US dollars on a date subsequent to receipt. Distributions to holders of additional ordinary shares (or ADSs) with respect to their ordinary shares (or ADSs) that are made as part of apro ratadistribution to all ordinary shareholders generally will notbe subject to US federal income tax. However, if a US holder hasthe option to receive a distribution in shares (or ADSs) or to receivecash in lieu of such shares (or ADSs), the distribution of shares(or ADSs) will be taxable as if the holder had received an amountequal to the fair market value of the distributed shares (or ADSs),and such holder's tax basis in the distributed shares (or ADSs) willbe equal to such amount. Tax on Sale or Other Disposition In general, for US federal income tax purposes, a US holder thatsells, exchanges or otherwise disposes of its ordinary shares orADSs will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to theUS dollar value of the difference between the amount realized forthe ordinary shares or ADSs and the US holder's adjusted taxbasis (determined in US dollars and under US federal income taxrules) in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Such gain or loss generallywill be US-source gain or loss, and will be treated as long-termcapital gain or loss if the US holder's holding period in the ordinaryshares or ADSs exceeds one year at the time of disposition. If the US holder is an individual, any capital gain generally will be subjectto US federal income tax at preferential rates (currently a maximumof 20%) if specified minimum holding periods are met. Thedeductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Medicare Tax Certain US holders who are individuals, estates or trusts arerequired to pay a Medicare tax of 3.8% (in addition to taxes theywould otherwise be subject to) on their \"net investment income\"which would include, among other things, dividends and capitalgains from the ordinary shares and ADSs.

I. Subsidiary Information N/A SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 219ITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk(1) General Policy Liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, as well as related counterparty risks, are managed centrally by our dedicated treasury team within the Group Finance Department. Where it is not possible to manage those risks centrally - inparticular due to regulatory restrictions (such as foreign exchange controls) or local tax restrictions - credit facilities and/or currency lines, guaranteed whenever necessary by the parent company, arecontracted by our subsidiaries locally with banks, under the supervision of the central treasury team. Our financing and investment strategies, and our interest rate and currency hedging strategies, are reviewed monthly by the Group Finance Department. Our policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. Liquidity Risk We operate a centralized treasury platform whereby all surplus cash and financing needs of our subsidiaries are invested with or funded by the parent company (where permitted by local legislation). The central treasury department manages our currentand projected financing, and ensures that Sanofi is able to meet its financial commitments by maintaining sufficient cash and confirmed credit facilities for the size of our operations and thematurity of our debt (see Notes D.17.c and D.17.g to the consolidated financial statements). We diversify our short-term investments with leading counterparties using money-market products with instant access or with a maturity of less than three months. As of December 31, 2017, cash andcash equivalents amounted to\u20ac10,315 million, and our short-term investments predominantly comprised: collective investments in 'short-term money market' and 'money market' euro-denominated funds based on the European classification used by the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers .A l l such funds can be traded on a daily basis and the amount invested in each fund may not exceed 10% of the aggregate amount invested in such funds;amounts invested directly with banks and non-financial institutions in the form of instant access deposits, term deposits, and Negotiable European Commercial Paper with a maturity of no more than three months. As of December 31, 2017, the Group also had \u20ac8 billion of undrawn general corporate purpose confirmed credit facilities, half expiring December 2020 and half December 2021. Those creditfacilities are not subject to financial covenant ratios. Our policy is to diversify our sources of funding through public or private issuances of debt securities, in the United States (shelf registration statement) and Europe (Euro Medium Term Note program). In addition, our A-1+/P-1 short-term rating gives usaccess to commercial paper programs in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in France. The average maturity of our total debt was 4.9 years as of December 31, 2017, compared with 5.1 yearsas of December 31, 2016. During 2017, we did not draw down onour French commercial paper program. Average drawdowns under the US commercial paper program during 2017 were \u20ac1.6 billion (maximum\u20ac3.4 billion); the average maturity of those drawdowns was two months. As of December 31, 2017, neither of those programs was being utilized. In the event of a liquidity crisis, we could be exposed to difficulties in calling up our available cash, a scarcity of sources of funding including the above-mentioned programs, and/or a deterioration in their terms. This situation could damage our capacity to refinance our debt or to issue new debt on reasonable terms. Interest Rate Risk We manage our net debt mainly in two currencies: the euro and theUS dollar (see note D.17 to the consolidated financial statements). The floating-rate portion of this debt exposes Sanofi to rises in interest rates, primarily in the Eonia and Euribor benchmark rates(for the euro) and in the US Libor and Federal Fund Effective rates(for the US dollar). To optimize (or reduce the volatility of) our cost of debt, we use interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and where appropriate interest rate options, that alter the fixed/floatingrate split of our debt. Those derivative instruments are predominantly denominated in euros and in US dollars. (1) The disclosures in this section supplement those provided in Note B.8.8. to the consolidated financial statements as regards the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7, and are covered by the independent registered public accounting firms' opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 220 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The projected full-year sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations of our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents for 2018 is as follows: Change in EUR and USD short-term interest ratesImpact on pre-tax net income (\u20acmillion)Impact on pre-tax income/(expense) recognized directly in equity (\u20acmillion) +100 bp 45 - +25 bp 11 - -25 bp (11) - -100 bp (45) - Foreign Exchange Risk A. Operating Foreign Exchange Risk A substantial portion of our net sales is generated in countries where the euro, which is our reporting currency, is not the functional currency. In 2017, for example, 33.8% of our net sales were generated in the United States, 29.3% in Emerging Markets(including countries that are, or may in future become, subject to exchange controls), and 5.1% in Japan. Although we also incur expenses in those countries, the impact of those expenses is notenough wholly to offset the impact of exchange rates on our netsales. Consequently, our operating income may be materially affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the euro andother currencies. We operate a foreign exchange risk hedging policy to reduce the exposure of our operating income to exchange rate movements.This policy involves regular assessments of our worldwide foreigncurrency exposure, based on foreign-currency transactions carried out by the parent company and its subsidiaries. Those transactions mainly comprise sales, purchases, research costs, co-marketing and co-promotion expenses, and royalties. To reduce the exposure of those transactions to exchange rate movements, we contracthedges using liquid derivative instruments, mainly forward currency purchases and sales, and also currency swaps. The table below shows operating currency hedging instruments in place as of December 31, 2017, with the notional amount translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate (see Note D.20. to the consolidated financial statements for the accounting classification of those instruments as of December 31, 2017).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The above positions mainly hedge future material foreign-currency cash flows arising after the end of the reporting period in relation to transactions carried out during the year ended December 31, 2017 and recognized in the balance sheet at that date. Gains and losseson hedging instruments (forward contracts) have been and will continue to be calculated and recognized in parallel with the recognition of gains and losses on the hedged items. Due to thishedging relationship, the commercial foreign exchange gain or loss on these items (hedging instruments and hedged transactions) will be immaterial in 2018. B. Financial Foreign Exchange Risk The cash pooling arrangements for our foreign subsidiaries outsidethe euro zone, and some of our financing activities, expose certain of our entities to financial foreign exchange risk (i.e. the risk of changes in the value of borrowings and loans denominated in acurrency other than the functional currency of the borrower or lender). That foreign exchange exposure is hedged by the parentcompany using firm financial instruments (usually currency swaps or forward contracts) contracted with banking counterparties. Although we incur more of our costs in euros than in any other currency, the US dollar accounts for a higher proportion of our revenues than any other currency. Consequently, we maintain asignificant portion of our indebtedness in US dollars. The table below shows financial currency hedging instruments in place as of December 31, 2017, with the notional amounts translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate (see also Note D.20 to the consolidated financial statements for the accounting classification of these instruments as ofDecember 31, 2017).

We may also hedge some future foreign-currency investment or divestment cash flows. C. Other Foreign Exchange Risks A significant proportion of our net assets is denominated inUS dollars (see Note D.35. to the consolidated financial statements). As a result, any fluctuation in the exchange rate of the US dollar against the euro automatically impacts the amount of ourequity as expressed in euros. As of December 31, 2017, we had no derivative instruments in place to limit the effect of such fluctuations, but a significant proportion of our debt is stilldenominated in US dollars.In addition, we use the euro as our reporting currency. Consequently, if one or more European Union Member States were to abandon the euro as a currency, the resulting economicupheavals - in particular, fluctuations in exchange rates - could have a significant impact on the terms under which we can obtain financing and on our financial results, the extent and consequences of which are not currently foreseeable. Counterparty Risk Our financing and investing transactions, and our currency andinterest rate hedges, are contracted with leading counterparties. We set limits for investment and derivative transactions with individual financial institutions, depending on the rating of eachinstitution. Compliance with these limits, which are based on notional amounts weighted by the residual maturity and the nature of the commitment, is monitored on a daily basis. 222 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 11.

As of December 31, 2017, we held investments in 'short-term money market' and 'money market' euro-denominated funds based on the European classification used by theAutorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers.Those instruments have low volatility, low sensitivity tointerest rate risk, and a very low probability of loss of principal. The depositary banks of the mutual funds, and of Sanofi itself, have a long-term rating of at least A.Realization of counterparty risk could impact our liquidity in certaincircumstances. Stock Market Risk It is our policy not to trade on the stock market for speculativepurposes. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 223ITEM 12. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OTHER THAN EQUITY SECURITIES Item 12. Description of Securities other than Equity Securities 12.A Debt Securities Not applicable. 12.B Warrants and Rights Not applicable. 12.C Other Securities Not applicable. 12.D American Depositary Shares General JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPMorgan\"), as depositary, issues Sanofi ADSs in certificated form (evidenced by an ADR) or book- entry form. Each ADR is a certificate evidencing a specific number of Sanofi ADSs. Each Sanofi ADS represents one-half of oneSanofi ordinary share (or the right to receive one-half of one Sanofi ordinary share) deposited with the Paris, France office of BNP Paribas, as custodian. Each Sanofi ADS also represents aninterest in any other securities, cash or other property that may beheld by the depositary under the deposit agreement. The depositary's office is located at 4 New York Plaza, 12 thFloor, New York, New York 10004. A holder may hold Sanofi ADSs either directly or indirectly through his or her broker or other financial institution. The following description assumes holders hold their Sanofi ADSs directly, incertificated form evidenced by ADRs. Holders who hold the Sanofi ADSs indirectly must rely on the procedures of their broker or other financial institution to assert the rights of ADR holders described inthis section. Holders should consult with their broker or financial institution to find out what those procedures are. Holders of Sanofi ADSs do not have the same rights as holders of Sanofi shares. French law governs shareholder rights. The rights of holders of Sanofi ADSs are set forth in the deposit agreementbetween Sanofi and JPMorgan and in the ADR. New York lawgoverns the deposit agreement and the ADRs. The following is a summary of certain terms of the deposit agreement, as amended. Our form of second amended and restated deposit agreement was filed as an exhibit to our Post- Effective Amendment No. 1 to Form F-6 filed on February 13, 2015. To the extent any portion of the amendment and restatement would prejudice any substantial existing right of holders of ADSsunder the first amended and restated deposit agreement, such portion shall not become effective as to such holders until 30 days after holders have received notice thereof. For more completeinformation, holders should read the entire second amended andrestated deposit agreement and the ADR itself. Holders may also inspect a copy of the current deposit agreement at the depositary'soffice. Share Dividends and Other Distributions Receipt of dividends and other distributions The depositary has agreed to pay to holders of Sanofi ADSs thecash dividends or other distributions that it or the custodian receives on the deposited Sanofi ordinary shares and other deposited securities after deducting its fees and expenses. Holdersof Sanofi ADSs will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of Sanofi ADSs that they hold. Cash. The depositary will convert any cash dividend or other cash distribution paid on the shares into U.S. dollars if, in its judgment, it can do so on a reasonable basis and can transfer the U.S. dollars to the United States. If the depositary determines that such a conversion and transfer is not possible, or if any approval from the French government is needed and cannot be obtained within a reasonable period, then the depositary may (1) distribute the foreign currency received by it to the holders of Sanofi ADSs or(2) hold the foreign currency distribution (uninvested and without liability for any interest) for the account of holders of Sanofi ADSs. In addition, if any conversion of foreign currency, in whole or in part, cannot be effected to some holders of Sanofi ADSs, the deposit agreement allows the depositary to distribute the dividends only to those ADR holders to whom it is possible to do so. It will hold the foreign currency it cannot convert into U.S. dollars for theaccount of the ADR holders who have not been paid. It will not invest the funds it holds and it will not be liable for any interest. Before making a distribution, any withholding taxes that must be paid under French law will be deducted. The depositary will distribute only whole U.S. dollars and cents and will roundfractional cents down to the nearest whole cent.Exchange ratefluctuations during a period when the depositary cannot convert euros into U.S. dollars may result in holders losingsome or all of the value of a distribution. Shares. The depositary may, and at our request will, distribute new ADRs representing any shares we distribute as a dividend or free distribution, if we furnish it promptly with satisfactory evidence that it is legal to do so. At its option, the depositary may distributefractional Sanofi ADSs. If the depositary does not distributeadditional Sanofi ADSs, the outstanding ADRs will also represent the new shares. The depositary may withhold any tax or other governmental charges, or require the payment of any required feesand expenses, prior to making any distribution of additional Sanofi ADSs. 224 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 12. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OTHER THAN EQUITY SECURITIES Rights to Receive Additional Shares. If we offer holders of Sanofi ordinary shares any rights to subscribe for additional shares or any other rights, the depositary, after consultation with us, will, in its discretion, either (1) make these rights available to holders or(2) dispose of such rights on behalf of holders and make the net proceeds available to holders. The depositary may make rights available to certain holders but not others if it determines it is lawfuland feasible to do so. However, if, under the terms of the offering or for any other reason, the depositary may not make such rights available or dispose of such rights and make the net proceeds available, it will allow the rights to lapse. In that case, holders of Sanofi ADSs will receive no value for them. In circumstances where rights would not otherwise be distributedby the depositary to holders of Sanofi ADSs, a holder of SanofiADSs may nonetheless request, and will receive from the depositary, any instruments or other documents necessary to exercise the rights allocable to that holder if the depositary firstreceives written notice from Sanofi that (1) Sanofi has elected, in its sole discretion, to permit the rights to be exercised and (2) such holder has executed the documents Sanofi has determined, in itssole discretion, are reasonably required under applicable law. If the depositary makes rights available to holders of Sanofi ADSs, upon instruction from such holders, it will exercise the rights and purchase the shares on such holder's behalf. The depositary will then deposit the shares and deliver ADRs to such holders. It will only exercise rights if holders of Sanofi ADSs pay it the exercise price and any other charges the rights require such holders to pay. U.S. securities laws may restrict the sale, deposit, cancellation or transfer of ADRs issued upon exercise of rights. For example, holders of Sanofi ADSs may not be able to trade Sanofi ADSs freely in the United States. In this case, the depositary may deliverSanofi ADSs under a separate restricted deposit agreement that will contain the same provisions as the deposit agreement, except for changes needed to implement the required restrictions. Other Distributions. The depositary will distribute to holders of Sanofi ADSs anything else we may distribute on deposited securities (after deduction or upon payment of fees and expenses or any taxes or other governmental charges) by any means it thinksis legal, equitable and practical. If, for any reason, it cannot make the distribution in that way, the depositary may sell what we distributed and distribute the net proceeds of the sale in the sameway it distributes cash dividends, or it may choose any other method to distribute the property it deems equitable and practicable. The depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make a distribution available to any holders of Sanofi ADSs. We have no obligation to register Sanofi ADSs, shares,rights or other securities under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We also have no obligation to take any other action to permit the distribution of ADRs, shares, rights or anything else to holders of Sanofi ADSs. This means that holders may not receivethe distribution we make on our shares or any value for them if it isillegal or impractical for the depositary to make them available tosuch holders. Elective Distributions. Whenever we intend to distribute a dividend payable at the election of shareholders either in cash or in additional shares, we will give prior notice thereof to the depositary and will indicate whether we wish the elective distribution to be made available to holders of Sanofi ADSs. In that case, we willassist the depositary in determining whether that distribution is lawful and reasonably practicable. The depositary will make theelection available to holders of Sanofi ADSs only if it is reasonably practicable and if we have provided all the documentation contemplated in the deposit agreement. In that case, the depositarywill establish procedures to enable holders of Sanofi ADSs to elect to receive either cash or additional ADSs, in each case asdescribed in the deposit agreement. If the election is not made available to holders of Sanofi ADSs, such holders will receive either cash or additional Sanofi ADSs, depending on what a shareholderin France would receive for failing to make an election, as more fully described in the deposit agreement. Deposit, Withdrawal and Cancellation Delivery of ADRs The depositary will deliver ADRs if the holder or his or her broker deposit shares or evidence of rights to receive shares with the custodian. Upon payment of its fees and expenses and any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, thedepositary will register the appropriate number of Sanofi ADSs in the names the holder requests and will deliver the ADRs to the persons the holder requests at its office. Obtaining Sanofi ordinary shares A holder may turn in his or her ADRs at the depositary's office.Upon payment of its fees and expenses and any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will deliver (1) the underlying shares to an account designated bythe holder and (2) any other deposited securities underlying the ADR at the office of a custodian or, at the holder's request, risk and expense, the depositary will deliver the deposited securities atits office. VOTING RIGHTS A holder may instruct the depositary to vote the Sanofi ordinaryshares underlying his or her Sanofi ADSs at any meeting of Sanofi shareholders, but only if we request that the depositary ask for holder instructions. Otherwise, holders will not be able to exercisetheir right to vote unless they withdraw the underlying ordinaryshares from the ADR program and vote as an ordinary shareholder. However, holders may not know about the meeting sufficiently in advance to timely withdraw the underlying ordinaryshares. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 225ITEM 12. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OTHER THAN EQUITY SECURITIES If we ask for holder instructions in connection with a meeting of Sanofi shareholders, the depositary will provide materials to holders of Sanofi ADSs in the manner described under the heading \"Notices and Reports; Rights of Holders to Inspect Books\" below.For any instructions to be valid, the depositary must receive them on or before the date specified in the materials distributed by the depositary. The depositary will endeavor, in so far as practical,subject to French law and the provisions of ourstatuts, to vote or to have its agents vote the shares or other deposited securities as holders may validly instruct. The depositary will only vote or attempt to vote shares as holders validly instruct. We cannot guarantee holders that they will receive the votingmaterials with sufficient time to enable them to return any voting instructions to the depositary in a timely manner to vote theirshares. As long as they act in good faith, neither the depositary nor its agents will be responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions.This means that holders may not be able to exercise their right to vote and there may be nothing holders can do if their shares are not voted as they requested. Similar to our shares, Sanofi ADSs evidenced by ADRs that are registered in the name of the same owner for at least two (2) years are eligible for double voting rights so long as certain proceduresare followed, as set out in the deposit agreement. For additionalinformation regarding double voting rights, see \"Item 10. Additional Information - B. Memorandum and Articles of Association - Voting Rights\". The deposit agreement allows the depositary and Sanofi to change the voting procedures or require additional voting procedures in addition to the ones described above if necessary or appropriate. For example, holders might be required to arrange to havetheir Sanofi ADSs deposited in a blocked account for a specified period of time prior to a shareholders' meeting in order to be allowed to give voting instructions. Notices and Reports; Rights of Holders to Inspect Books On or before the first date on which we give notice, by publication or otherwise, of any meeting of holders of shares or other deposited securities, or of any adjourned meeting of such holders, or of the taking of any action in respect of any cash or otherdistributions or the offering of any rights, we will transmit to thedepositary a copy of the notice. Upon notice of any meeting of holders of shares or other deposited securities, if requested in writing by Sanofi, the depositary will, as soon as practicable, mail to the holders of Sanofi ADSs a notice, the form of which is in the discretion of the depositary, containing (1) a summary in English of the information contained in the notice of meeting provided by Sanofi to the depositary, (2) a statementthat the holders as of the close of business on a specified record date will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of Frenchlaw and of ourstatuts, to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights, if any, pertaining to the amount of shares or other deposited securities represented by their respective ADSs and (3) a statement as to the manner in which such instructionsmay be given. Notwithstanding the above, the depositary may, tothe extent not prohibited by law or regulations, or by the requirements of the NYSE, in lieu of distribution of the materials provided to the depositary as described above, distribute to theholders a notice that provides holders with, or otherwise publicizes to holders, instructions on how to retrieve such materials or receive such materials upon request (i.e., by reference to a websitecontaining the materials for retrieval or a contact for requesting copies of the materials). The depositary will make available for inspection by ADS holders at the depositary's office any reports and communications, including any proxy soliciting material, received from us that are both (1) received by the depositary as the holder of the deposited securities and (2) made generally available to the holders of suchdeposited securities by us. The depositary will also, upon written request, send to ADS holders copies of such reports when furnished by us pursuant to the deposit agreement. Any such reports and communications, including any such proxy solicitingmaterial, furnished to the depositary by us will be furnished in English to the extent such materials are required to be translatedinto English pursuant to any regulations of the SEC. The depositary will keep books for the registration of ADRs and transfers of ADRs that at all reasonable times will be open for inspection by the holders provided that such inspection is not for the purpose of communicating with holders in the interest of a business or object other than our business or a matter related to the deposit agreement or the ADRs. 226 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 12.

It may apply payments owed to a holder orsell deposited securities underlying a holder's Sanofi ADSs to pay any taxes owed, and the holder will remain liable for any deficiency. If it sells deposited securities, it will, if appropriate, reduce thenumber of Sanofi ADSs to reflect the sale and pay to the holderany proceeds, or send to the holder any property, remaining after it has paid the taxes.

The depositary has also agreed to provide additional amounts to us based on certain performance indicators relating to the ADR facility and fees collected by it. From January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, we received a total amount of SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 227ITEM 12. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OTHER THAN EQUITY SECURITIES $18,317,000 from JPMorgan. In addition to these payments, JPMorgan has agreed to waive servicing fees we may incur in connection with routine corporate actions such as annual general meetings and dividend distributions, as well as for other assistanceJPMorgan may provide to us, such as preparation of tax and regulatory compliance documents for holders and investor relations advisory services. Changes Affecting Deposited Securities If we: change the nominal or par value of our Sanofi ordinary shares; recapitalize, reorganize, merge or consolidate, liquidate, sell assets, or take any similar action; reclassify, split up or consolidate any of the deposited securities;or distribute securities on the deposited securities that are notdistributed to holders; then either: the cash, shares or other securities received by the depositary will become deposited securities and each Sanofi ADS will automatically represent its equal share of the new depositedsecurities; or the depositary may, and will if we ask it to, distribute some or allof the cash, shares or other securities it receives. It may also deliver new ADRs or ask holders to surrender their outstandingADRs in exchange for new ADRs identifying the new depositedsecurities. Disclosure of Interests The obligation of a holder or other person with an interest in ourshares to disclose information under French law and under ourstatutsalso applies to holders and any other persons, other thanthe depositary, who have an interest in the Sanofi ADSs. Theconsequences for failing to comply with these provisions are thesame for holders and any other persons with an interest as aholder of our ordinary shares. For additional information regardingthese obligations, see \"Item 10. Additional Information - B.Memorandum and Articles of Association - Requirements forHoldings Exceeding Certain Percentages\". Amendment and Termination We may agree with the depositary to amend the deposit agreementand the ADRs without the consent of the ADS holders for anyreason. If the amendment adds or increases fees or charges,except for taxes and other governmental charges or registrationfees, cable, telex or facsimile transmission costs, delivery costs orother such expenses, or prejudices a substantial right of holders ofSanofi ADSs, it will only become effective 30 days after thedepositary notifies such holders of the amendment. However, wemay not be able to provide holders of Sanofi ADSs with prior notice of the effectiveness of any modifications or supplements that arerequired to accommodate compliance with applicable provisions oflaw, whether or not those modifications or supplements could beconsidered to be materially prejudicial to the substantial rights ofholders of Sanofi ADSs.At the time an amendment becomeseffective, such holders will be considered, by continuing tohold their ADR, to have agreed to the amendment and to bebound by the ADR and the deposit agreement as amended. The depositary will terminate the agreement if we ask it to do so. The depositary may also terminate the agreement if the depositary has told us that it would like to resign and we have not appointed anew depositary bank within 90 days. In both cases, the depositarymust notify holders of Sanofi ADSs at least 30 days beforetermination. After termination, the depositary and its agents will be required to do only the following under the deposit agreement: (1) collect distributions on the deposited securities, (2) sell rights and otherproperty as provided in the deposit agreement and (3) delivershares and other deposited securities upon cancellation of ADRs.Six months or more after termination, the depositary may sell anyremaining deposited securities by public or private sale.

It will have no liability for interest.Upon termination of the deposit agreement, the depositary's onlyobligations will be to account for the proceeds of the sale and othercash and with respect to indemnification. After termination, our onlyobligation will be with respect to indemnification and to pay certainamounts to the depositary. Limitations on Obligations and Liability to Holders of Sanofi ADSs The deposit agreement expressly limits our obligations and the obligations of the depositary, and it limits our liability and theliability of the depositary. In particular, please note the following: we and the depositary are obligated only to take the actions specifically set forth in the deposit agreement without gross negligence or bad faith; we and the depositary are not liable if either is prevented ordelayed by law or circumstances beyond its control from performing its obligations under the deposit agreement; we and the depositary are not liable if either exercises, or fails to exercise, any discretion permitted under the deposit agreement; we and the depositary have no obligation to become involved ina lawsuit or other proceeding related to the Sanofi ADSs or the deposit agreement on holders' behalf or on behalf of any other party, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense andliability is furnished as often as may be required; 228 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017ITEM 12. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OTHER THAN EQUITY SECURITIES we and the depositary are not liable for the acts or omissions made by, or the insolvency of, any securities depository, clearingagency or settlement system or the custodian, subject to certainexceptions and to the extent the custodian is not a branch oraffiliate of JPMorgan; the depositary is not liable for the price received in connectionwith any sale of securities, the timing thereof or any delays, acts, omissions to act, errors, defaults or negligence on the part of theparty so retained in connection with any such sale or proposedsale; we and the depositary may rely without any liability upon any written notice, request, direction, instruction or other document believed by either of us to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper parties; and we and the depositary are not liable for any action or nonaction taken in reliance upon the advice of or information from legal counsel, accountants, any person presenting ordinary shares for deposit, any ADS holder, or any other person believed in goodfaith to be competent to give such advice or information. In addition, the depositary will not be liable for any acts oromissions made by a successor depositary. Moreover, neither we nor the depositary nor any of our respective agents will be liable toany holder of Sanofi ADSs for any indirect, special, punitive orconsequential damages. Pursuant to the terms of the deposit agreement, we and the depositary have agreed to indemnify each other under certain circumstances. Requirements for Depositary Actions Before the depositary will deliver or register the transfer of SanofiADSs, make a distribution on Sanofi ADSs or process a withdrawalof shares, the depositary may require: payment of stock transfer or other taxes or other governmental charges and transfer or registration fees charged by third parties for the transfer of any shares or other deposited securities; production of satisfactory proof of the identity and genuineness of any signature or other information it deems necessary; and compliance with regulations it may establish, from time to time,consistent with the deposit agreement, including presentation of transfer documents. The depositary may refuse to deliver Sanofi ADSs, register transfers of Sanofi ADSs or permit withdrawals of shares when the transfer books of the depositary or our transfer books are closed, orat any time if the depositary or we think it advisable to do so.Right to Receive the Shares Underlying the Sanofi ADSs Holders have the right to cancel their Sanofi ADSs and withdrawthe underlying Sanofi ordinary shares at any time except: when temporary delays arise when we or the depositary have closed our transfer books or the deposit of shares in connection with voting at a shareholders' meeting, or the payment of dividends; when the holder or other holders of Sanofi ADSs seeking to withdraw shares owe money to pay fees, taxes and similar charges; or when it is necessary to prohibit withdrawals in order to complywith any laws or governmental regulations that apply to Sanofi ADSs or to the withdrawal of shares or other depositedsecurities. This right of withdrawal may not be limited by any other provision ofthe deposit agreement. Pre-Release of Sanofi ADSs Unless we instruct the depositary not to, the deposit agreementpermits the depositary to deliver Sanofi ADSs before deposit of theunderlying shares. This is called a pre-release of the Sanofi ADSs.The depositary may also deliver shares upon cancellation ofpre-released Sanofi ADSs (even if the Sanofi ADSs are cancelled before the pre-release transaction has been closed out). A pre-release is closed out as soon as the underlying shares aredelivered to the depositary. The depositary may receive SanofiADSs instead of shares to close out a pre-release. Unlessotherwise agreed in writing, the depositary may pre-release SanofiADSs only under the following conditions: (1) before or at the timeof the pre-release, the person to whom the pre-release is being made must represent to the depositary in writing that it or its customer (i) owns the shares or Sanofi ADSs to be deposited, (ii) assigns all beneficial rights, title and interest in such shares or ADRs to the depositary in its capacity as depositary and (iii) will not take any action with respect to such shares or ADRs that is inconsistent with the transfer of beneficial ownership, other than insatisfaction of such pre-release; (2) the pre-release must be fullycollateralized with cash, U.S. government securities or othercollateral that the depositary considers appropriate; (3) thedepositary must be able to close out the pre-release on not morethan five business days' notice; and (4) the depositary may requiresuch further indemnities and credit regulations as it deemsappropriate. In addition, the depositary will limit the number of Sanofi ADSs that may be outstanding at any time as a result of pre-release, although the depositary may disregard the limit fromtime to time, if it thinks it is appropriate to do so. The depositarymay retain for its own account any compensation received by it inconnection with the foregoing. Any holder of pre-release ADRsshould consult its tax and other advisors about the implications ofpre-release for its particular situation. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 229ITEM 12.

(b)Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange ActRule 13a-15(f). Management assessed the effectiveness ofinternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017based on the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission(COSO). The Boehringer Ingelheim Consumer Healthcare business combination that was consummated during 2017 has been excluded from the scope of management's assessment of and conclusion on internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. Boehringer Ingelheim ConsumerHealthcare business is included in the 2017 consolidatedfinancial statements of the Company and represented less than 1% of total assets as of December 31, 2017 and less than 5% of revenues for the year then ended. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting waseffective as of December 31, 2017 to provide reasonableassurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, and can only provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to futureperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Ernst & Young et Autres, independent registered public accounting firms, as stated in their report on the Company's internal control over financialreporting as of December 31, 2017, which is included herein. See paragraph (c) of the present Item 15, below. (c)See report of PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Ernst & Young et Autres, independent registered public accounting firms, included under \"Item 18.

SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 231ITEM 16A. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT Item 16A. Audit Committee Financial Expert Our Board of Directors has determined that Robert Castaigne, Fabienne Lecorvaisier and Christian Mulliez, directors serving on the Audit Committee, are independent financial experts within the meaning of paragraph 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Board of Directors deemed Robert Castaigne to be a financial expert based on his education and his experience as Chief Financial Officer of Total, a major corporation, and as member ofthe audit committees of Vinci, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Novatek. The Board of Directors deemed Fabienne Lecorvaisier to be a financial expert taking into account her education and her experience incorporate finance in various international banks and as Chief Financial Officer of Essilor and Air Liquide. She is now Executive Vice President, in charge of Finance, Operations Controland General Secretariat of Air Liquide Group. The Board ofDirectors deemed Christian Mulliez to be a financial expert taking into account his experience as Executive Vice President, ChiefFinancial Officer of L'Or\u00e9al and graduate of the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Sciences Economiques et Commerciales(ESSEC). The Board of Directors has determined that all four directors meetthe independence criteria of US Securities and ExchangeCommission Rule 10A-3, although only Robert Castaigne, Fabienne Lecorvaisier and Carole Piwnica meet the French AFEP- MEDEF Code criteria of independence applied by the Board of Directors for general corporate governance purposes(see Item 16G, below). Item 16B. Code of Ethics We have adopted a financial code of ethics, as defined in Item 16B. of Form 20-F under the Exchange Act.

(b) Millions of euros. This schedule does not include purchases and sales conducted by Rothschild & Cie Banque under a liquidity contract that is still ineffect. For more information see Item 10.BMemorandum andArticles of Association - Use of Share Repurchase Programs. Item 16F. Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant N/A Item 16G. Corporate Governance Sanofi is incorporated under the laws of France, with securitieslisted on regulated public markets in the United States (New York Stock Exchange) and France (Euronext Paris). Consequently, as described further in our annual report, our corporate governanceframework reflects the mandatory provisions of French corporatelaw, the securities laws and regulations of France and the United States and the rules of the aforementioned public markets. In addition, we generally follow the \"AFEP-MEDEF\" corporategovernance recommendations for French listed issuers (hereafter referred to as the \"AFEP-MEDEF Code\"). As a result, our corporategovernance framework is similar in many respects to, and provides investor protections that are comparable to - or in some cases, more stringent than - the corresponding rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Nevertheless, there are important differences tokeep in mind.In line with New York Stock Exchange rules applicable to domesticissuers, Sanofi maintains a board of directors of which at least half of the members are independent. We evaluate the independenceof members of our Board of Directors using the standards of theFrench AFEP-MEDEF Code as the principal reference. We believe that AFEP- MEDEF's overarching criteria for independence - no relationship of any kind whatsoever with the Company, its group orthe management of either that is such as to color a Board member's judgment - are on the whole consistent with the goals of the New York Stock Exchange's rules although the specific tests proposed under the two standards may vary on some points. We have complied with the audit committee independence and other requirements of the Rule 10A-3 under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, adopted pursuant to the Sarbanes-OxleyAct of 2002. Our Compensation Committee includes one SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 233ITEM 16G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE non-independent member, Christian Mulliez, which is permitted under the AFEP-MEDEF Code but would not be compliant with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange for domestic issuers. Under French law, the committees of our Board of Directors are advisory only, and where the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual would vest certain decision-making powers withspecific committees by delegation (e.g. appointment or auditcommittees), under French law our Board of Directors remains theonly competent body to take such decisions, albeit taking into account the recommendation of the relevant committees.Additionally, under French corporate law, it is the Shareholders' General Meeting of Sanofi that is competent to appoint our auditors upon the proposal of our Board of Directors, although our Board Charter provides that the Board of Directors will make its proposalon the basis of the recommendation of our Audit Committee. We believe that this requirement of French law, together with the additional legal requirement that two sets of statutory auditors beappointed, share the New York Stock Exchange's underlying goal of ensuring that the audit of our accounts be conducted by auditors independent from company management. In addition to the oversight role of our Compensation Committee for questions of management compensation including by way of equity, under French law any option or restricted share plans orother share capital increases, whether for the benefit of seniormanagement or employees, may only be adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to and within the limits of a shareholder resolution approving the related capital increase and delegating tothe Board the authority to implement such operations.As described above, a number of issues, which could be resolved directly by a board or its committees in the United States, require the additional protection of direct shareholder consultation in France. Our Audit Committee is entirely composed of independent directors as that term is defined in Rule 10A-3 under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, adoptedpursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The composition of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Strategy Committee includes directors who are also officers of our largestshareholder. As a 'foreign private issuer' under the US securities laws, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer issue the certifications required by \u00a7302 and \u00a7906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 on an annual basis (with the filing of our annual report on U.S. Form 20-F) rather than on a quarterly basis as would be the case of a U.S. corporation filing quarterly reports onU.S. Form 10-Q. French corporate law provides that the Board of Directors must vote to approve a broadly defined range of transactions that could potentially create conflicts of interest between Sanofi on the onehand and its Directors and Chief Executive Officer on the other hand, which are then presented to shareholders for approval at the next annual meeting. This legal safeguard provides shareholderswith an opportunity to approve significant aspects of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation package, and it operates in place of certain provisions of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financialposition of the Company as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) andour report dated March 6, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion onthe Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are public accounting firms registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financialstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit Ernst & Young Ste Young et Autres and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit have respectively served as the Company's auditors since 2012 (Ernst & Young Audit and its predecessor firms served as Company's auditor from 1986 to 2011) and 1999. Neuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La De \u00b4 fense, March 6, 2018 F-2 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sanofi, Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Sanofi and its subsidiaries' (together \"the Company\") internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework)(the \"COSO criteria\"). In our opinion, the Company maintained, inall material respects, effective internal control over financialreporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Boehringer Ingelheim's Consumer Healthcare business, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase businesscombination during 2017. Boehringer Ingelheim's ConsumerHealthcare business is included in the 2017 consolidated financialstatements of the Company and represented less than 1% of totalassets as of December 31, 2017 and less than 5% of revenues forthe year then ended. We have also excluded BoehringerIngelheim's Consumer Healthcare business from our audit ofinternal control over financial reporting of the Company. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as ofDecember 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidatedstatements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equityand cash flows for each of the three years in the period endedDecember 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referredto as the \"consolidated financial statements\"), and our report datedMarch 6, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintainingeffective internal control over financial reporting and for itsassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financialreporting included in the accompanying Report of Management onInternal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company's internal control over financialreporting based on our audit. We are public accounting firmsregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federalsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operatingeffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, andperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary inthe circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonablebasis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliabilityof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements forexternal purposes in accordance with generally acceptedaccounting principles. A company's internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain tothe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accuratelyand fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets ofthe company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactionsare recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonableassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorizedacquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that couldhave a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods aresubject to the risk that controls may become inadequate becauseof changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with thepolicies and procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit Ernst & Ste Young et Autres and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit have respectively served as the Company's auditors since 2012 (Ernst & Young Audit and its predecessor firms served as Company's auditor from 1986 to 2011) and 1999.

SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-11NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTRODUCTION Sanofi, together with its subsidiaries (collectively \"Sanofi\" or \"the Company\"), is a global healthcare leader engaged in the research, development and marketing of therapeutic solutions focused on patient needs. Sanofi is listed in Paris (Euronext: SAN) and New York (NYSE: SNY).The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the notes thereto, were signed off by the Sanofi Board of Directors on February 7, 2018. A/ Basis of preparation A.1. International financial reporting standards (IFRS) The consolidated financial statements cover the twelve-monthperiods ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. In accordance with Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and Council of July 19, 2002 on the application of international accounting standards, Sanofi has presented itsconsolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS since January 1, 2005. The term \"IFRS\" refers collectively to internationalaccounting and financial reporting standards (IASs and IFRSs) and to interpretations of the interpretations committees (SIC and IFRIC) with mandatory application as of December 31, 2017. The consolidated financial statements of Sanofi as of December 31, 2017 have been prepared in compliance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)and with IFRS as endorsed by the European Union as ofDecember 31, 2017. IFRS as endorsed by the European Union as of December 31, 2017 are available under the heading \"IFRS Financial Statements\" via the following web link: https://www.efrag.org/Endorsement . The consolidated financial statements have been prepared inaccordance with the IFRS general principles of fair presentation, going concern, accrual basis of accounting, consistency of presentation, materiality, and aggregation. A.2. New standards, amendments and interpretations A.2.1. New standards, amendments and interpretations applicable in 2017 The new standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations that are mandatorily applicable with effect from the 2017 financialyear have no material impact on the financial statements, or ontheir presentation. In accordance with the amendment to IAS 7 (Statement of CashFlows), with effect from the year ended December 31, 2017 Sanofi discloses changes in debt arising from financing activities, showing cash and non-cash movements separately (see Note D.17.). A.2.2. New pronouncements issued by the IASB and applicable from 2018 or later The note below describes standards, amendments and interpretations issued by the IASB that will have mandatory application in 2018 or subsequent years, and Sanofi's position regarding future application. Sanofi has not early adopted any ofthose standards, amendments or interpretations. A.2.2.1. Standards At the end of May 2014 the IASB issued IFRS 15 (Revenue fromContracts with Customers). IFRS 15 is a converged standard common to both IFRS and US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), and replaces IAS 18 (Revenue) and IAS 11(Construction Contracts) with effect from January 1, 2018. In April 2016 the IASB issued clarifications (amendments to IFRS 15 applicable from January 1, 2018) on how to (i) identify a performance obligation, (ii) determine whether a company is aprincipal or an agent, and (iii) account for the revenue from granting a license. IFRS 15 includes new revenue recognition principles, in particular as regards identifying a performance obligation and allocating the transaction price in the case of contracts with multiple components.It also changes how contracts are analyzed in the case of revenuegenerated by licensing arrangements, and how variable consideration is recognized. The standard also contains new disclosure requirements. To date, the conclusions of our analysis of the impacts of first-time application in 2018 of IFRS 15 are as follows: Revenue recognized within Net sales by Sanofi arises from sales of pharmaceutical products, active ingredients and vaccines, net of sales returns, of customer incentives and discounts, and of certain sales-based payments paid or payable to the healthcare authorities. The concepts of \"transfer of control\"and \"variable consideration\" do not materially affect the way in which Sanofi recognizes revenue. Consequently, Sanofi does not anticipate any significant change in the timing or amount of netsales recognized. F-12 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Other revenues recognized by Sanofi mainly comprise license royalties under collaboration agreements, and VaxServe sales of products sourced from third-party manufacturers. Sanofi does not anticipate any significant change in the timing or amount ofother revenues recognized. Other operating income mainly comprises revenue arising from the sharing of costs and profits on product commercializationoperations carried out in collaboration with partners, generatingrevenue under complex partnership and co-promotion agreements. Sanofi does not anticipate any significant change inthe timing or amount of other operating income recognized. Other operating income also includes realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on operating activities, and gains on disposals of non-financial assets not regarded as major disposals,which are outside the scope of IFRS 15. Share of profits or losses from investments accounted forusing the equity method: Sanofi does not expect IFRS 15 to have a major impact on the determination of the share of profitsor losses from the associates and joint ventures concerned. Sanofi will apply IFRS 15 with effect from January 1, 2018, using thefull retrospective method of adoption: the opening balance of equity atthe start of the first period presented (January 1, 2016) will be adjusted to reflect the cumulative impact of applying IFRS 15, and comparative information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and2017 will be presented in accordance with IFRS 15. Consequently, in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 all periods will be presented as though IFRS 15 had always beenapplied. The adjustments to net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 are regarded as immaterial. In July 2014 the IASB issued IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments). With effect from January 1, 2018, IFRS 9 replaces the currentlyapplicable standards on the presentation, recognition and measurement of financial instruments (IAS 39). To date, the conclusions of our analysis of the impacts of first-time application in 2018 of IFRS 9 are as follows: Classification and measurement of financial assets IFRS 9 alters the main accounting categories used for financial assets. Financial assets held by Sanofi that are classified as\"available-for-sale\" under IAS 39 will be reclassified as of January 1, 2018 into one of two categories: \"financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\" or \"financial assets at fair value through othercomprehensive income\". With effect from January 1, 2018 any gainson equity investments that Sanofi elects to classify as \"financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\" will no longer be recognized in profit or loss when the investment is sold. However, alldividends received from such investments will continue to be recognized in profit or loss. In accordance with paragraph B5.2.3 of IFRS 9, Sanofi will continue to use acquisition cost as an appropriate estimate of thefair value of certain investments in unquoted companies. That method will cease to be used if any of the indicators listed in paragraphs B5.2.4 and B5.2.5 of IFRS 9 become apparent. Classification and measurement of financial liabilities In October 2017, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 9 clarifying the treatment of modifications of financial liabilities. Because Sanofi does not enter into transactions of that type, first-time application of the amendment will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements. Impairment The new credit risk recognition model based on expected losses changes the way in which allowances for impairment of accounts receivable are calculated, in that receivables that are not yet past due must be included in the base used to calculate the allowance.Sanofi sells medicines and vaccines to wholesalers, public authorities, hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and non governmental organizations (NGOs). Given the nature of the accounts receivablerecognized by Sanofi and the associated guarantees entered into, IFRS 9 does not materially alter the amount of allowances for impairment of accounts receivable. Hedge accounting IFRS 9 does not alter the way in which Sanofi currently accounts for hedging transactions. Such transactions are carried out as part of our policies on foreign exchange and interest rate risk hedging. At this stage of our analyses the amount of the adjustment to be recognized within equity is estimated to be immaterial. Sanofi will apply IFRS 9 with effect from January 1, 2018. Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, only financial instruments heldas of January 1, 2018 require retrospective application; presentation of comparatives is optional. Sanofi will decide which option to elect during the first half of 2018. In January 2016 the IASB issued IFRS 16 (Leases), which aligns the accounting treatment of operating leases with that already applied to finance leases (i.e. recognition in the balance sheet of aliability for future lease payments, and of an asset for theassociated rights of use). The first-time application of IFRS 16 will also lead to a change in presentation: In the income statement: the rental expense currently recognized as a component of Operating income will, under IFRS 16, be recognized partly as depreciation expense within Operating income , and partly as interest expense within Financial expenses . In the statement of cash flows: the rental payments currentlypresented within Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities will, under IFRS 16, be presented within Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities to the extent that those payments are allocated to repayment of the lease liability. IFRS 16 is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on orafter January 1, 2019. Most of the leases contracted by Sanofi are SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-13NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) operating leases in which Sanofi is the lessee. The main assets leased are office premises, cars, and computer hardware. An impact assessment is ongoing. For information, Sanofi's obligations under non-cancelable operating leases are disclosed inNote D.21.1. In addition, some supply and service contracts are also being assessed. Sanofi's IFRS 16 project is being led by a team composed of representatives from the various support functions affected (purchasing, real estate, information systems, finance, shared services). The assessment continued throughout 2017, looking at three key topics: identification and analysis of contracts, selectionof IT application, and implementation methods. Sanofi has not elected to early adopt IFRS 16.As regards the method of first-time application, Sanofi has yet to make a decision. IFRS 16 may be applied either as of January 1, 2019 without restatement of comparative periods if the simplifiedtransition option is elected, or as of January 1, 2017 with the 2017and 2018 comparative periods restated under IFRS 16 if the retrospective transition option is elected. A.2.2.2. Amendments, annual improvements and interpretations Sanofi does not expect a material impact from the application of: IFRIC 22 (Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration), issued in December 2016 and applicable from 2018 onwards; and IFRIC 23 (Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments), issued inJune 2017 and applicable from 2019 onwards. The other amendments issued, whether within or outside the 2014-2016 Annual Improvements cycle (IFRS 2 - various clarifications, IAS 28 - long-term interests in associates and joint ventures, etc), will have no impact on Sanofi's financial statements. A.3. Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements requires management to make reasonable estimates and assumptions based on information available at the date of the finalization of the financial statements. Those estimates and assumptions may affect the reported amountsof assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements, and disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities as of the date of the review of the financial statements.Examples of estimates and assumptions include: amounts deducted from sales for projected sales returns, chargeback incentives, rebates and price reductions (see Notes B.13.1. and D.23.); impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets,and investments accounted for using the equity method (see Notes B.6. and D.5.);the valuation of goodwill and the valuation and useful life of acquiredintangible assets (see Notes B.3.2., B.4.3., D.4. and D.5.); the measurement of contingent consideration receivable inconnection with asset divestments (see Notes B.8.6. and D.7.); the amount of post-employment benefit obligations (see NotesB.23. and D.19.1.); the amount of provisions for restructuring, litigation, tax risks and environmental risks (see Notes B.12., B.19., B.20., B.22., D.19. and D.22.); the amount of deferred tax assets resulting from tax lossesavailable for carry-forward and deductible temporary differences (see Notes B.22. and D.14.); the direct and indirect impacts recorded in 2017 of the US tax reform (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017), including the estimated tax charge on deemed repatriation that is attributable to theaccumulated earnings of non-US operations. The estimate of such tax charge will be finalized based on further analysis and, as the case may be, computations taking into account any futureclarifications and supplementary guidance issued by the US Congress, the US Internal Revenue Service, the US Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulators. the measurement of contingent consideration (see Notes B.3.and D.18.); and which exchange rate to use at the end of the reporting period for the translation of accounts denominated in foreign currencies, and of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, in cases where more than one exchange rate exists for a given currency (see Note A.4.). Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management is also required to exercise judgment in assessing whether the criteria specified in IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations) are met, and hence whether a non-current asset or asset group should be classified as \"held for sale or exchange\" and whether a discontinued operation should bereported separately. Such assessments are reviewed at eachreporting date based on the facts and circumstances. A.4. Consolidation and foreign currency translation of the financial statements of Venezuelan subsidiaries Sanofi continues to account for subsidiaries based in Venezuela using the full consolidation method, on the basis that the criteria for control as specified in IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements) are still met. Prior to 2016, the Venezuelan foreign exchange system consisted of three exchange rates: (i) the \"CENCOEX\" rate, set at a fixed rate of 6.3 bolivars per US dollar and restricted to essential goods;(ii) an administered exchange rate (the \"SICAD\" rate), which was13.5 bolivars per US dollar as of December 31, 2015 and applied to certain specific business sectors; and (iii) the \"SIMADI\" rate, of F-14 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) approximately 200 bolivars per US dollar, applied to specified transactions. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiaries were translated into euros using the \"SICAD\" official exchange rate,which was the estimated rate at which the profits generated by the operations of those subsidiaries would be remitted to the parent. In February 2016, the Venezuelan government reformed the foreign exchange system, which from that date had two exchange rates that applied to two categories of goods: a first category for essential goods to which was applied the \"DIPRO\" rate, set at a fixed exchange rate of 10 bolivars per US dollar; a second category to which was applied the \"DICOM\" rate, which was a floating exchange rate against the US dollar that initially stood at 206 bolivars per US dollar and was approximately 3,345bolivars per US dollar as of December 31, 2017. In light of those changes to the foreign exchange system, recenteconomic and political developments and the scarcity of US dollar cash in Venezuela, Sanofi changed the exchange rate used to translate its Venezuelan operations and from 2016 onwards has applied the \"DICOM\" rate. This change led to the recognition of aforeign exchange loss of\u20ac102 million in 2016. The Venezuelan subsidiaries made an immaterial contribution to net sales in 2017 ( \u20ac18 million in 2016, \u20ac455 million in 2015) and had a cash position of\u20ac7 million as of December 31, 2017(\u20ac6 million as of December 31, 2016,\u20ac90 million as of December 31, 2015). The net assets of the Venezuelan subsidiaries were not material as of December 31, 2017. At the end of January 2018 the Venezuelan government made further changes to the foreign exchange system, abolishing the \"DIPRO\" rate of 10 bolivars per US dollar. The \"DICOM\" rate must now be used for all foreign currency transactions. A.5. Change in the operational structure of Sanofi Sanofi acquired the Consumer Healthcare operations of Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) on January 1, 2017, and during 2017gradually integrated those operations into its Consumer HealthcareGlobal Business Unit (GBU). Following completion of theintegration process and with effect from December 31, 2017, Sanofi has identified the Consumer Healthcare business as an operating segment, the financial information for which is reportedseparately to, and reviewed separately by, the Chief ExecutiveOfficer. Until that date, the results of the Consumer Healthcarebusiness were included in the Pharmaceuticals segment. In addition, during 2017 Sanofi finalized a complete realignment of its internal management reporting to match its organizational structure. As a result, the costs of Sanofi's global functions (Medical Affairs, External Affairs, Finance, Human Resources,Legal Affairs, Information Solutions & Technologies, SanofiBusiness Services, etc.) are now managed centrally at group-widelevel and are no longer allocated to operating segments for internalmanagement reporting purposes. For the year endedDecember 31, 2017 and subsequent years, the costs of those functions are presented within the \"Other\" category. That category also includes other reconciling items such as retainedcommitments in respect of divested activities. Sanofi has amended the presentation of its segment information accordingly (see Note D.35.), and now performs impairment testing of goodwill at the level of three Cash Generating Units (CGUs): Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Human Vaccines (seeNote D.5.). B/ Summary of significant accounting policies B.1. Basis of consolidation In accordance with IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements), the consolidated financial statements of Sanofi include the financial statements of entities that Sanofi controls directly or indirectly, regardless of the level of the equity interest in those entities. Anentity is controlled when Sanofi has power over the entity, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and the ability to affect those returns through its power overthe entity. In determining whether control exists, potential voting rights must be taken into account if those rights are substantive, in other words they can be exercised on a timely basis whendecisions about the relevant activities of the entity are to be taken. Entities consolidated by Sanofi are referred to as \"subsidiaries\". Entities that Sanofi controls by means other than voting rights are referred to as \"consolidated structured entities\". In accordance with IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements), Sanofi classifies its joint arrangements (i.e. arrangements in which Sanofi exercises joint control with one or more other parties) either as a joint operation or a joint venture. In the case of a joint operation, Sanofi recognizes the assets and liabilities of the operation in proportionto its rights and obligations relating to those assets and liabilities. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Sanofi exercises joint control over a joint arrangement when decisions relating to the relevant activities of the arrangement require the unanimous consent of Sanofi and the other parties withwhom control is shared. Sanofi exercises significant influence over an entity when it has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of that entity, but does not have the power to exercise control or joint control over those policies. In accordance with IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures), the equity method is used to account for joint ventures (i.e. entities over which Sanofi exercises joint control) and for associates (i.e. entities over which Sanofi exercises significant influence). Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognized at cost, and subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in the net assets of the associate or joint venture. IAS 28 does not specify thetreatment to be adopted on first-time application of the equity SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-15NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) method to an investee following a step acquisition. Consequently, by reference to paragraph 10 of IAS 28, Sanofi has opted to apply the cost method, whereby the carrying amount of the investment represents the sum of the historical cost amounts for each step inthe acquisition. As of the date on which the equity method is first applied, goodwill (which is included in the carrying amount of the investment) is determined for each acquisition step. The sameapplies to subsequent increases in the percentage interest in the equity-accounted investment. When the criteria of IFRS 5 are met, Sanofi recognizes the equity interest within the balance sheet line item Assets held for sale or exchange . The equity method is not applied to equity interests that are classified as held-for-sale assets. Transactions between consolidated companies are eliminated, as are intragroup profits. A list of the principal companies included in the consolidation in2017 is presented in Note F. B.2. Foreign currency translation B.2.1. Accounting for foreign currency transactions in the financial statements of consolidated entities Non-current assets (other than receivables) and inventories acquired in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the acquisition date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are recorded in the income statement. However, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from thetranslation of advances between consolidated subsidiaries for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future are recognized in equity, in the line item Change in currency translation differences. B.2.2. Foreign currency translation of the financial statements of foreign entities Sanofi presents its consolidated financial statements in euros ( \u20ac). In accordance with IAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates), each subsidiary accounts for its transactions in the currency that is most representative of its economicenvironment (the functional currency). All assets and liabilities are translated into euros using the exchange rate of the subsidiary's functional currency prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income statements are translatedusing a weighted average exchange rate for the period, except inthe case of foreign subsidiaries in a hyperinflationary economy. The resulting currency translation difference is recognized as aseparate component of equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and is recognized in the incomestatement only when the subsidiary is sold or is wholly or partially liquidated.B.3. Business combinations and transactions with non-controlling interests B.3.1. Accounting for business combinations, transactions with non-controlling interests and loss of control Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) and IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements). Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under this method, the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria of IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are measured initially at their fair values as at the date of acquisition, except for (i) non-current assets classified as held for sale (which are measured at fair value less costs to sell) and (ii) assets and liabilities that fall within the scope of IAS 12(Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Restructuringliabilities are recognized as a liability of the acquiree only if the acquiree has an obligation as of the acquisition date to carry out the restructuring. The principal accounting rules applicable to business combinations and transactions with non-controlling interests include: Acquisition-related costs are recognized as an expense on theacquisition date, as a component of Operating income . Contingent consideration is recognized in equity if the contingentpayment is settled by delivery of a fixed number of the acquirer's equity instruments; otherwise, it is recognized in Liabilities related to business combinations . Contingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date irrespective of the probability of payment. If the contingent consideration wasoriginally recognized as a financial liability, subsequent adjustments to the liability are recognized in profit or loss in the line item Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration , unless the adjustment is made within the twelve months following the acquisition date and relates to facts and circumstances existingas of that date. Subsequent contingent consideration adjustments in respect of business combinations completed before January 1,2010 continue to be accounted for in accordance with the pre-revision IFRS 3 (i.e. through goodwill). In the case of a step acquisition, the previously-held equityinterest is remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value. The difference between this fair value and the carrying amount is recorded in profit or loss, along with any gains or losses relating to the previously-held interest that were recognized in other comprehensive income and are reclassifiable to profit or loss. Goodwill may be calculated on the basis of either (i) the entirefair value of the acquiree, or (ii) a share of the fair value of the acquiree proportionate to the interest acquired. This option may be elected for each acquisition individually. The effects of (i) a buyout of non-controlling interests in asubsidiary already controlled by Sanofi, and (ii) a disposal of a percentage interest without loss of control, are recognized inequity. F-16 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) In a partial disposal resulting in loss of control, the retained equity interest is remeasured at fair value at the date of loss of control. The gain or loss recognized on the disposal includes the effect of that remeasurement, and items that were initiallyrecognized in equity are reclassified to profit or loss. Adjustments to the values of assets and liabilities initiallydetermined provisionally (pending the results of independent valuations or further analysis) are recognized as a retrospectiveadjustment to goodwill if they are made within twelve months of the acquisition date. Once this twelve-month period has elapsed,the effects of any adjustments are recognized directly in profit or loss, unless they qualify as an error correction. Purchase price allocations are performed under the responsibilityof management, with assistance from an independent valuer in the case of major acquisitions. The revised IFRS 3 does not specify an accounting treatment for contingent consideration arising from a business combination made by an entity prior to the acquisition ofcontrol in that entity and carried as a liability in the acquired entity'sbalance sheet. The accounting treatment applied by Sanofi to such a liability is to measure it at fair value as of the acquisition date and to report it in the line itemLiabilities related to businesscombinations and to non-controlling interests, with subsequent remeasurements recognized in profit or loss. This treatment is consistent with the accounting applied to contingent considerationin the books of the acquirer. B.3.2. Goodwill The excess of the cost of an acquisition over Sanofi's interest inthe fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree is recognized as goodwill at the date of the business combination. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is shown in a separate balance sheet line item, whereas goodwill arising on the acquisition of investments accounted for using the equity method is recorded inInvestments accounted for using the equity method. Goodwill arising on foreign operations is expressed in the functional currency of the country concerned and translated into euros using the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. In accordance with IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets), goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment (see Note B.6.). Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever events orcircumstances indicate that impairment might exist. Such events or circumstances include significant changes more likely than not to have an other-than-temporary impact on the substance of the original investment. B.4. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are initially measured at acquisition cost orproduction cost, including any directly attributable costs ofpreparing the asset for its intended use, or (in the case of assetsacquired in a business combination) at fair value as of the date of the business combination. Intangible assets are amortized on astraight line basis over their useful lives. The useful lives of other intangible assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The effect of any adjustment to useful lives is recognized prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. Amortization of other intangible assets is recognized in the income statement within Amortization of intangible assets except for amortization charged against (i) acquired or internally-developed software and (ii) other rights of an industrial or operational nature, which is recognized in the relevant classification of expense by function. Sanofi does not own any intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, other than goodwill. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment, if any, in accordance with IAS 36 (see Note B.6.). B.4.1. Research and development not acquired in a business combination Internally generated research and development Under IAS 38, research expenses are recognized in profit or loss when incurred. Internally generated development expenses are recognized as an intangible asset if, and only if, all the following six criteria can be demonstrated: (a) the technical feasibility of completing thedevelopment project; (b) Sanofi's intention to complete the project; (c) Sanofi's ability to use the project; (d) the probability that the project will generate future economic benefits; (e) the availability ofadequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the project; and (f) the ability to measure the development expenditurereliably. Due to the risks and uncertainties relating to regulatory approval and to the research and development process, the six criteria for capitalization are usually considered not to have been met until the product has obtained marketing approval from the regulatoryauthorities. Consequently, internally generated development expenses arising before marketing approval has been obtained, mainly the cost of clinical trials, are generally expensed as incurredwithin Research and development expenses . Some industrial development expenses (such as those incurred indeveloping a second-generation synthesis process) are incurred after marketing approval has been obtained, in order to improvethe industrial process for an active ingredient. To the extent that the six IAS 38 criteria are considered as having been met, such expenses are recognized as an asset in the balance sheet withinOther intangible assetsas incurred. Similarly, some clinical trials, SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-17NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) for example those undertaken to obtain a geographical extension for a molecule that has already obtained marketing approval in a major market, may in certain circumstances meet the six capitalization criteria under IAS 38, in which case the relatedexpenses are recognized as an asset in the balance sheet within Other intangible assets. Separately acquired research and development Payments for separately acquired research and development are capitalized withinOther intangible assetsprovided that they meet the definition of an intangible asset: a resource that is (i) controlled by Sanofi, (ii) expected to provide future economic benefits forSanofi, and (iii) identifiable (i.e. it is either separable or arises from contractual or legal rights). Under paragraph 25 of IAS 38, the first condition for capitalization (the probability that the expected futureeconomic benefits from the asset will flow to the entity) isconsidered to be satisfied for separately acquired research and development. Consequently, upfront and milestone payments tothird parties related to pharmaceutical products for which marketing approval has not yet been obtained are recognized as intangible assets, and amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives beginning when marketing approval is obtained. Payments under research and development arrangements relating to access to technology or to databases and payments made to purchase generics dossiers are also capitalized, and amortized over the useful life of the intangible asset. Subcontracting arrangements, payments for research and development services, and continuous payments under research and development collaborations which are unrelated to the outcome of that collaboration, are expensed over the service term. B.4.2. Other intangible assets not acquired in a business combination Licenses other than those related to pharmaceutical products and research projects, in particular software licenses, are capitalized at acquisition cost, including any directly attributable cost of preparing the software for its intended use. Software licenses are amortized on astraight line basis over their useful lives for Sanofi (three to five years). Internally generated costs incurred to develop or upgrade software are capitalized if the IAS 38 recognition criteria are satisfied, and amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the software from the date on which the software is ready for use. B.4.3. Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination which relate to in-process research and development and currently marketed products and are reliably measurable are identified separately from goodwill, measured at fair value and capitalizedwithinOther intangible assetsin accordance with IFRS 3(Business Combinations) and IAS 38 (Intangible Assets). Therelated deferred tax liability is also recognized if a deductible or taxable temporary difference exists. In-process research and development acquired in a business combination is amortized on a straight line basis over its useful life from the date of receipt of marketing approval. Rights to products currently marketed by Sanofi are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives, determined on the basis of cash flow forecasts which take into account the patent protection period of the marketed product. B.5. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is initially measured and recognizedat acquisition cost, including any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use, or (in the case of assets acquired in a business combination) at fair value as of the date ofthe business combination. The component-based approach toaccounting for property, plant and equipment is applied. Under this approach, each component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost which is significant in relation to the totalcost of the item and which has a different useful life from the other components must be depreciated separately. After initial measurement, property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, except for land which is carried at cost less impairment. Subsequent costs are not recognized as assets unless (i) it is probable that future economic benefits associated with those costs will flow to Sanofi and (ii) the costs can be measured reliably. Borrowing costs attributable to the financing of items of property, plant and equipment, and incurred during the construction period, are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost of the item. Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset to which they relate. In accordance with IAS 17 (Leases), items of property, plant andequipment leased by Sanofi as lessee under finance leases are recognized as an asset in the balance sheet, with the related leaseobligation recognized as a liability. A lease qualifies as a financelease if it transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to Sanofi. Assets held under finance leases are carried at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, and are depreciatedover the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. The depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment, net of any residual value, is depreciated on a straight line basis over the useful life of the asset. The useful life of an asset isusually equivalent to its economic life. F-18 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) The customary useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows: Buildings 15 to 40 years Fixtures 10 to 20 years Machinery and equipment 5 to 15 years Other 3 to 15 years Useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipmentare reviewed annually. The effect of any adjustment to useful lives or residual values is recognized prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an expense in the income statement, in the relevant classification of expense by function. B.6. Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and investments accounted for usingthe equity method B.6.1. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets In accordance with IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets), assets that generate separate cash flows and assets included in cash- generating units (CGUs) are assessed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset or CGU maybe impaired. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Under IAS 36, each CGU to which goodwill is allocated must (i) represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and (ii) not belarger than an operating segment determined in accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), before application of the IFRS 8aggregation criteria (see Note B.26.). Quantitative and qualitative indications of impairment (primarily relating to the status of the research and development portfolio, pharmacovigilance, patent litigation, and the launch of competingproducts) are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. If there is any internal or external indication of impairment, Sanofi estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU. Other intangible assets not yet available for use (such as capitalized in-process research and development), and CGUs that include goodwill, are tested for impairment annually whether or notthere is any indication of impairment, and more frequently if anyevent or circumstance indicates that they might be impaired. Such assets are not amortized. When there is an internal or external indication of impairment, Sanofi estimates the recoverable amount of the asset andrecognizes an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the assetexceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use. To determine value in use, Sanofi uses estimates of future cash flows generated by the asset or CGU, prepared using thesame methods as those used in the initial measurement of the asset or CGU on the basis of medium-term strategic plans. In the case of goodwill, estimates of future cash flows are based on a medium-term strategic plan, an extrapolation of the cash flows beyond that plan, and a terminal value. In the case of other intangible assets, the period used is based on the economic life of the asset. Estimated cash flows are discounted at long-term market interest rates that reflect the best estimate by Sanofi of the time value of money, the risks specific to the asset or CGU, and economic conditions in the geographical regions in which the business activity associated with the asset or CGU is located. Certain assets and liabilities that are not directly attributable to a specific CGU are allocated between CGUs on a basis that is reasonable, and consistent with the allocation of the correspondinggoodwill. Impairment losses arising on property, plant and equipment, on software and on certain rights are recognized in the relevant classification of expense by function. Impairment losses arising on other intangible assets are recognized within Impairment of intangible assets in the income statement. B.6.2. Impairment of investments accounted for using the equity method In accordance with IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures), Sanofi applies the criteria specified in IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) to determine whether investments accounted for using the equity method may beimpaired (see Note B.8.2.). If an investment is impaired, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by applying IAS 36 (see Note B.6.1.) and recognized inShare of profit/(loss) frominvestments accounted for using the equity method. B.6.3. Reversals of impairment losses charged against property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, andinvestments accounted for using the equity method At the end of each reporting period, Sanofi assesses whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment loss recognized in a prior period in respect of an asset (other than goodwill) or an investment accounted for using the equity methodcan be reversed. If this is the case, and the recoverable amount as determined based on the revised estimates exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, Sanofi reverses the impairment loss only tothe extent of the carrying amount that would have been determinedhad no impairment loss been recognized for the asset. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-19NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Reversals of impairment losses in respect of other intangible assets are recognized within the income statement line item Impairment of intangible assets, while reversals of impairment losses in respect of investments accounted for using the equitymethod are recognized within the income statement line item Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method. Impairment losses taken against goodwill arenever reversed, unless the goodwill is part of the carrying amount of an investment accounted for using the equity method. B.7. Assets held for sale or exchange and liabilities related to assets held for sale or exchange In accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations), non-current assets and groups of assets are classified as held for sale in the balance sheet if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transactionrather than through continuing use. Within the meaning of IFRS 5, the term \"sale\" also includes exchanges for other assets. Non-current assets or asset groups held for sale must be available for immediate sale in their present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets, and a sale must be highly probable. Criteria used to determine whether a saleis highly probable include: the appropriate level of management must be committed to a plan to sell; an active program to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been initiated; the asset must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; completion of the sale should be foreseeable within the twelve months following the date of reclassification to Assets held for sale or exchange ; and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it isunlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Before initial reclassification of the non-current asset (or assetgroup) toAssets held for sale or exchange , the carrying amounts of the asset (or of all the assets and liabilities in the asset group)must be measured in accordance with the applicable standards. Subsequent to reclassification to Assets held for sale or exchange , the non-current asset (or asset group) is measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, with any write-down recognized by means of an impairment loss. Once a non-current asset has been reclassified as held for sale orexchange, it is no longer depreciated or amortized. In a disposal of an equity interest leading to loss of control, all the assets and liabilities of the entity involved are classified as held-for-sale assets or liabilities within the balance sheet line items Assets held for sale or exchange orLiabilities related to assetsheld for sale or exchange , provided that the disposal satisfies the IFRS 5 classification criteria. The profit or loss generated by a held-for-sale asset group isreported in a separate line item in the income statement for the current period and for the comparative periods presented, providedthat the asset group: represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or, is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separatemajor line of business or geographical area of operations; or, is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. In accordance with IFRS 10, transactions between companies that are held for sale or treated as discontinued operations and other consolidated companies are eliminated. Events or circumstances beyond Sanofi's control may extend the period to complete the sale or exchange beyond one year without precluding classification of the asset (or disposal group) inAssets held for sale or exchangeprovided that there is sufficient evidence that Sanofi remains committed to the planned sale or exchange. Finally, in the event of changes to a plan of sale thatrequire an asset no longer to be classified as held for sale, IFRS 5 specifies the following treatment: The assets and liabilities previously classified as held for sale are reclassified to the appropriate balance sheet line items, with no restatement of comparative periods. Each asset is measured at the lower of (a) its carrying amountbefore the asset was reclassified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation, amortization or revaluation that would havebeen recognized if the asset had not been reclassified as held forsale, or (b) its recoverable amount at the date of reclassification. The backlog of depreciation, amortization and impairment notrecognized while non-current assets were classified as held for sale must be reported in the same income statement line item that was used to report impairment losses arising on initial reclassification of assets as held for sale and gains or lossesarising on the sale of such assets. In the consolidated income statement, those impacts are reported within the line item Other gains and losses, and litigation . The net income of a business previously classified as discontinued or as held for sale or exchange and reported on a separate line in the income statement must be reclassified and included in net income from continuing operations, for all periods presented. In addition, segment information relating to the income statementand the statement of cash flows (acquisitions of non-current assets) must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), and must also be restated for all prior periods presented. F-20 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) B.8. Financial instruments B.8.1. Non-derivative financial assets In accordance with IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement) and IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Presentation), Sanofi has adopted the following classification for non-derivative financial assets, based on the type of asset and on managementintention at the date of initial recognition. The designation and classification of such financial assets are subsequently reassessed at the end of each reporting period. Non-derivative financial assets are recognized on the date when Sanofi becomes party to the contractual terms of the asset. On initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value, plus direct transaction costs in the case of financial assets not classified as fair value through profit or loss. Classification, presentation and subsequent measurement of non-derivative financial assets are as follows: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss These assets are classified in the balance sheet within the line itemsOther non-current assets,Other current assetsandCash and cash equivalents. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss comprise assets held for trading (financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of reselling them in the near term, usually within less than 12 months), and financial instruments designated as fair value through profit and loss on initial recognition in accordance with theconditions for application of the fair value option. Such financial assets are carried at fair value, without any deduction for transaction costs that may be incurred on sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these assets are recognized in the income statement, in Financial income orFinancial expenses . Realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on financial assets in currencies other than functional currencies are recognized in the income statement inFinancial incomeor Financial expenses. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are (i) designated by management as available-for-sale or (ii) not classified as \"Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\", \"Held-to-maturity investments\" or \"Loans and receivables\".This category includes equity interests in quoted or unquoted companies other than investments accounted for using the equity method (associates and joint ventures). Available-for-sale financialassets are classified inOther non-current assets. Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value, without any deduction for transaction costs that may be incurred on sale. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value ofthese assets, including unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, are recognized directly in equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on debt instruments. On derecognition of anavailable-for-sale financial asset, or on recognition of an impairment loss on such an asset, the cumulative gains and losses previously recognized in equity are recognized in the incomestatement for the period withinFinancial incomeorFinancial expenses. Interest income and dividends on equity instruments are recognized in the income statement within Financial income when Sanofi is entitled to receive payment. Available-for-sale financial assets in the form of equity interests in companies not quoted in an active market are measured at cost if their fair value cannot be measured reliably; an impairment loss is recognized when there is objective evidence that such an asset is impaired. Contingent consideration receivable in connection with divestments is recognized as an available-for-sale financial asset at fair value (plus any transaction costs), provided that it represents an unconditional right to receive cash as of the date of the divestment. Fair value is initially measured on the basis of estimated futurecash flows. Subsequent adjustments to fair value arising from revisions to those estimates are recognized immediately in profit or loss. Interest income generated on such assets is calculated using the effective interest method, and recognized in profit or loss on an accruals basis. An impairment loss is taken against contingent consideration arising on divestments where counterparty credit risksuggests its value may have become impaired. Other adjustments to fair value, such as those arising from a change in the discount rate, are recognized in equity within the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which theyoccur. Held-to-maturity investments Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assetswith fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that Sanofi has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Such investments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets withfixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are presented within the line itemsOther current assets,Accounts receivableandCash and cash equivalents.Loans with a maturity of more than 12 months are presented in\"Long-term loans and advances\" withinOther non-current assets. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-21NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Those financial assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. B.8.2. Impairment of non-derivative financial assets Indicators of impairment are reviewed for all non-derivativefinancial assets at the end of each reporting period. Such indicators include default in contractual payments, significant financial difficulties of the issuer or debtor, probability of bankruptcy, or aprolonged or significant decline in quoted market price. An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement if there is objective evidence of impairment resulting from one or more eventsafter the initial recognition of the asset (a \"loss event\") and that lossevent has a reliably measurable impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset (or group of financial assets). The impairment loss on loans and receivables, which are measured at amortized cost, is the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of estimated future cashflows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interestrate. When an impairment loss is identified on an available-for-sale financial asset, the cumulative losses previously recognized directly in equity are recorded in the income statement. The loss recognized in the income statement is the difference between the acquisition cost (net of principal repayments and amortization) and the fair value at the time of impairment, less any impairment losspreviously recognized in the income statement. The impairment loss on investments in companies not quoted in an active market and measured at cost is the difference between the carrying amount of the investment and the present value of itsestimated future cash flows, discounted at the current market interest rate for similar financial assets. Impairment losses in respect of loans are recognized within Financial expenses in the income statement. Impairment losses in respect of trade receivables are recognized within Selling and general expenses in the income statement. Impairment losses on equity instruments classified asavailable-for-sale financial assets cannot be reversed through the income statement. B.8.3. Derivative instruments Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting areinitially and subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement inOther operating incomeor inFinancial incomeorFinancial expenses, depending on the nature of the underlying economic item which is hedged. Derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are measured in accordance with the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 (see Note B.8.4.).IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement) requires counterparty credit risk to be taken into account when measuring the fair value of financial instruments. This risk is estimated on the basis of observable, publicly-available statistical data. Policy on offsetting In order for a financial asset and a financial liability to be presentedas a net amount in the balance sheet under IAS 32, there must be (a) a legally enforceable right to offset and (b) the intention either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liabilitysimultaneously. In addition, IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments: Disclosures) requires the notes to the financial statements to include a schedule showing a list of any offsets recognized under IAS 32 and of transactions for which only criterion (a) is met, i.e. potential offsets such as those specified in close out netting agreements (positions offset only in the event of default, as specified in the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) standard). B.8.4. Hedging Hedging involves the use of derivative financial instruments.Changes in the fair value of such instruments are intended to offset the exposure of the hedged items to changes in fair value. As part of its overall interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk management policy, Sanofi enters into various transactions involving derivative instruments. Derivative instruments used in connection with Sanofi's hedging policy may include forward exchange contracts, currency options, interest rate swaps and interest rate options. Derivative financial instruments qualify as hedging instruments for hedge accounting purposes when (a) at the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and of the risk management strategy and objective;(b) the hedge is expected by management to be highly effective in offsetting the risk; (c) the forecast transaction being hedged is highly probable and presents an exposure to variations in cashflows that could ultimately affect profit or loss; (d) the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured; and (e) the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and the hedge isdetermined actually to have been highly effective throughout the reporting periods for which the hedge was designated. The above criteria are applied when Sanofi uses derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Fair value hedge A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fairvalue of a recognized asset or liability or unrecognized firm commitment that could affect profit or loss. F-22 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the income statement, withinOther operating incomefor hedges related to operating activities, or withinFinancial incomeorFinancial expensesfor hedges related to investing or financing activities. Cash flow hedge A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, which could affect profit or loss. Changes in fair value of the hedging instrument attributable to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized directly in equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Changes infair value attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge arerecognized in the income statement withinOther operating incomefor hedges of operating activities, and withinFinancial incomeorFinancial expensesfor hedges of investing or financing activities. Cumulative changes in fair value of the hedging instrument previously recognized in equity are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. Thesetransferred gains and losses are recorded withinOther operating incomefor hedges related to operating activities, or within Financial incomeorFinancial expensesfor hedges related toinvesting or financing activities. When a forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument previously recognized in equity are included in the initial measurement of that asset or liability. When the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity remains separately recognized in equity and is not reclassified to the income statement until the forecast transaction occurs. However, if Sanofi no longer expects the forecast transaction to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previouslyrecognized in equity is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation In a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument attributable to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized directly in equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Changes in fairvalue attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognized in the income statement withinFinancial incomeor Financial expenses. When the investment in the foreign operationis sold, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrumentpreviously recognized in equity are reclassified to the income statement withinFinancial incomeorFinancial expenses.Discontinuation of hedge accounting Hedge accounting is discontinued when (a) the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or (b) the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, or (c) Sanofi revokes the hedge designation, or (d) management no longerexpects the forecast transaction to occur. B.8.5. Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings and debt Bank borrowings and debt instruments are initially measured at fair value of the consideration received, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. All costs related to the issuance of borrowings or debt instruments, and all differences between the issue proceeds net of transaction costs and the value on redemption, are recognized withinFinancial expensesin theincome statement over the term of the debt using the effective interest method. Liabilities related to business combinations and to non-controlling interests These line items record the fair value of (i) contingent consideration payable in connection with business combinations (see Note B.3.1. for a description of the relevant accounting policy), and (ii) commitments to buy out equity holders of subsidiaries, includingput options granted to non-controlling interests. Adjustments to the fair value of commitments to buy out equity holders of subsidiaries, including put options granted to non-controlling interests, are recognized in equity. Other non-derivative financial liabilities Other non-derivative financial liabilities include trade accounts payable, which are measured at fair value (which in most cases equates to face value) on initial recognition, and subsequently at amortized cost. B.8.6. Fair value of financial instruments The disclosures required under IFRS 13 relating to the fair value ofthe principal financial assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet and in the notes to consolidated financial statements, and to the level of those instruments in thefair value hierarchy, are presented in Note D.12. The disclosures required under IFRS 13 relating to the sensitivity of level 3 fair value measurements are presented in Note D.18. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-23NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) The table below shows the disclosures required under IFRS 7 relating to the measurement principles applied to financial instruments.

(a) These assets are held to fund a deferred compensation plan offered to certain employees. (b) In the case of debt designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedging relationship, the carrying amount in the consolidated balance sheet includes changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk(s). (c) For business combinations completed prior to application of the revised IFRS 3, contingent consideration is recognized when payment becomes probable (see Note B.3.1.). F-24 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) The other financial assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet are: Non-derivative current financial assets and liabilities: because these items have a maturity close to the end of the reporting period, Sanofi regards their carrying amount (i.e. historical cost less any credit risk allowance) as a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Equity interests in companies not quoted in an active market and the fair value of which cannot be measured reliably, which are measured at amortized cost in accordance with IAS 39. B.8.7. Derecognition of financial instruments Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights tocash flows from the asset have ended or have been transferred and when Sanofi has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. If Sanofi has neither transferred norretained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of afinancial asset, it is derecognized if Sanofi does not retain control of the asset. A financial liability is derecognized when Sanofi's contractual obligations in respect of the liability are discharged, cancelled or extinguished. B.8.8. Risks relating to financial instruments Market risks in respect of non-current financial assets, cashequivalents, derivative instruments and debt are described in the discussions of risk factors presented in Item 3.D. and Item 11. Credit risk is the risk that customers may fail to pay their debts. This risk also arises as a result of the concentration of Sanofi's sales with its largest customers, in particular certain wholesalers inthe United States. Customer credit risk is described in \"Item 3.D. - Risk Factors - We are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers\". B.9. Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizablevalue. Cost is calculated using the weighted average cost method or the first-in, first-out method, depending on the nature of the inventory. The cost of finished goods inventories includes costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. During the launch phase of a new product, any inventories of that product are written down to zero pending regulatory approval. The write-down is reversed once it becomes highly probable that marketing approval will be obtained.B.10. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents as shown in the consolidated balancesheet and statement of cash flows comprise cash, plus liquid short- term investments that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value in the eventof movements in interest rates. B.11. Treasury shares In accordance with IAS 32, Sanofi treasury shares are deductedfrom equity, irrespective of the purpose for which they are held. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, impairment or cancellation of treasury shares. B.12. Provisions for risks In accordance with IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities andContingent Assets), Sanofi records a provision when it has a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources embodyingeconomic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the outflow of resources. If the obligation is expected to be settled more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period, or has no definite settlement date, the provision is recorded withinNon-current provisions and other non-current liabilities. Provisions relating to the insurance programs in which Sanofi's captive insurance company participates are based on risk exposure estimates calculated by management, with assistance from independent actuaries, using IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) techniques. Those techniques use past claims experience, withinSanofi and in the market, to estimate future trends in the cost of claims. Contingent liabilities are not recognized, but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is remote. Sanofi estimates provisions on the basis of events and circumstances related to present obligations at the end of the reporting period and of past experience, and to the best of management's knowledge at the date of preparation of the financialstatements. Reimbursements offsetting the probable outflow of resources are recognized as assets only if it is virtually certain that they will be received. Contingent assets are not recognized. Restructuring provisions are recognized if Sanofi has a detailed, formal restructuring plan at the end of the reporting period and has announced its intention to implement this plan to those affected byit. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-25NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) No provisions are recorded for future operating losses. Sanofi records non-current provisions for certain obligations, such as legal or constructive environmental obligations and litigation, where an outflow of resources is probable and the amount of the outflow can be reliably estimated. Where the effect of the timevalue of money is material, those provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation, calculated using a discount rate that reflects anestimate of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. Increases in provisions to reflect the effects of the passage of time are recognized within Financial expenses . B.13. Revenue recognition B.13.1. Net sales Revenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement withinNet sales. Net sales comprise revenue from sales of pharmaceutical products, active ingredients and vaccines, net ofsales returns, of customer incentives and discounts, and of certainsales-based payments paid or payable to the healthcare authorities. Revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions have been met: the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer; Sanofi no longer has effective controlover the goods sold; the amount of revenue and costs associatedwith the transaction can be measured reliably; and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flowto Sanofi, in accordance with IAS 18 (Revenue). In particular, the contracts between Sanofi Pasteur and government agencies specify conditions for the supply and acceptance of batches of vaccine; revenue is recognized when those conditions are met. Sanofi offers various types of price reductions on its products. In particular, products sold in the United States are covered by various governmental programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid)under which products are sold at a discount. Rebates are grantedto healthcare authorities, and under contractual arrangements with certain customers. Some wholesalers are entitled to chargeback incentives based on the selling price to the end customer, underspecific contractual arrangements. Cash discounts may also be granted for prompt payment. Returns, discounts, incentives and rebates, as described above, are recognized in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized as a reduction of gross sales. These amounts are calculated as follows: Provisions for chargeback incentives are estimated on the basis of the relevant subsidiary's standard sales terms and conditions, and in certain cases on the basis of specific contractualarrangements with the customer. They represent management'sbest estimate of the amount of chargeback incentives that willultimately be claimed by the customer.Provisions for rebates based on attainment of sales targets are estimated and accrued as each of the underlying sales transactions is recognized. Provisions for price reductions under Government and State programs, largely in the United States, are estimated on the basis of the specific terms of the relevant regulations or agreements, and accrued as each of the underlying sales transactions is recognized. Provisions for sales returns are calculated on the basis ofmanagement's best estimate of the amount of product that will ultimately be returned by customers. In countries where productreturns are possible, Sanofi operates a returns policy that allowsthe customer to return products within a certain period either side of the expiry date (usually 12 months after the expiry date). The provision is estimated on the basis of past experience of salesreturns. Sanofi also takes into account factors such as levels of inventory in its various distribution channels, product expiry dates, information about potential discontinuation of products, the entry of competing generics into the market, and the launch of over-the-counter medicines. In each case, the provisions are subject to continuous review and adjustment as appropriate based on the most recent data available to management. Sanofi believes that it has the ability to measure each of the above provisions reliably, using the following factors in developing its estimates: the nature and patient profile of the underlying product; the applicable regulations or the specific terms and conditions of contracts with governmental authorities, wholesalers and other customers; historical data relating to similar contracts, in the case ofqualitative and quantitative rebates and chargeback incentives; past experience and sales growth trends for the same or similarproducts; actual inventory levels in distribution channels, monitored by Sanofi using internal sales data and externally provided data; the shelf life of Sanofi products; and market trends including competition, pricing and demand. B.13.2. Other revenues Other revenues mainly comprise royalties under licensing agreements (see Note C.), and VaxServe sales of products sourced from third-party manufacturers. VaxServe is a Vaccines segment entity whose operations include the distribution within the United States of vaccines and other products manufactured by third parties. F-26 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Some sales recorded by VaxServe are presented within the line itemOther revenuesbecause they are not derived from the sale of products manufactured by Sanofi. B.14. Cost of sales Cost of sales consists primarily of the industrial cost of goods sold, payments made under licensing agreements, and distributioncosts. The industrial cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials, depreciation of property, plant and equipment,amortization of software, personnel costs, and other expensesattributable to production. B.15. Research and development Note B.4.1. \"Research and development not acquired in a businesscombination\" and Note B.4.3. \"Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination\" describe the principles applied to the recognition of research and development costs. Contributions or reimbursements received from alliance partners are recorded as a reduction of Research and development expenses. B.16. Other operating income and expenses B.16.1. Other operating income Other operating income includes the share of profits that Sanofi is entitled to receive from alliance partners in respect of productmarketing agreements. It also includes revenues generated under certain complex agreements, which may include partnership andco-promotion arrangements. Upfront payments received are deferred until the service obligation is met. Milestone payments are assessed on a case by case basis, and recognized in the income statement on delivery of the productsand/or upon the service obligation being met. Revenue generated in connection with these services is recognized on the basis of delivery of the goods or provision of the services to the othercontracting party. This line item also includes realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on operating activities (see Note B.8.4.), and operating gains on disposals not regarded as major disposals (see Note B.20.). B.16.2. Other operating expenses Other operating expenses mainly comprise the share of profits that alliance partners are entitled to receive from Sanofi underproduct marketing agreements.B.17. Amortization and impairment of intangible assets B.17.1. Amortization of intangible assets The expenses recorded in this line item comprise amortization of product rights (see Note D.4.), given that the benefit of those rights to Sanofi's commercial, industrial and development functions cannot be separately identified. Amortization of software, and of other rights of an industrial or operational nature, is recognized as an expense in the income statement, in the relevant line items of expense by function. B.17.2. Impairment of intangible assets This line item records impairment losses (other than thoseassociated with restructuring) recognized against intangible assets (including goodwill, but excluding software and other rights of an industrial or operational nature), and any reversals of suchimpairment losses. B.18. Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration that was (i) already carried in the books of an acquired entity, or (ii) granted in connection with a business combination and initially recognized as a liability in accordance with the revised IFRS 3, are reported inprofit or loss in accordance with the principles described in Note B.3.1. Such adjustments are reported separately in the income statement, in the line itemFair value remeasurement ofcontingent consideration. This line item also includes changes in the fair value of contingent consideration recognized in connection with divestments and classified as an available-for-sale financial asset. Finally, it also includes the effect of the unwinding of discount, and of exchange rate movements where the asset or liability is expressed in a currency other than the functional currency of thereporting entity. B.19. Restructuring costs and similar items Restructuring costs are expenses incurred in connection with thetransformation or reorganization of Sanofi's operations or support functions. Such costs include collective redundancy plans, compensation to third parties for early termination of contracts, andcommitments made in connection with transformation or reorganization decisions. They also include accelerated depreciation charges arising from site closures and losses on assetdisposals resulting from such decisions. In addition, this line item includes expenses incurred in connection with programs implemented as part of the transformation strategy announced in November 2015 intended to deliver a global information systems solution, to standardize and consolidate processes, and to transition towards a worldwide services platform. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-27NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) B.20. Other gains and losses, and litigation The line item Other gains and losses, and litigation includes the impact of material transactions of an unusual nature or amount which Sanofi believes it necessary to report separately in the income statement in order to improve the relevance of the financialstatements, such as: gains and losses on major disposals of property, plant and equipment, of intangible assets, of assets (or groups of assets and liabilities) held for sale, or of a business within the meaning of the revised IFRS 3, other than those considered to be restructuring costs; impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses on assets (or groups of assets and liabilities) held for sale, other than those considered to be restructuring costs; gains on bargain purchases; and costs and provisions relating to major litigation; and pre-tax separation costs associated with the process of disinvesting from operations in the event of a major divestment. B.21. Financial expenses and income B.21.1. Financial expenses Financial expenses mainly comprise interest charges on debt financing; negative changes in the fair value of financialinstruments (where changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss); realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses on financingand investing activities; impairment losses on financial instruments; and any reversals of impairment losses on financial instruments. Financial expenses also include expenses arising from the unwinding of discount on long-term liabilities, and the net interest cost related to employee benefits. This line item does not include commercial cash discounts, which are deducted from net sales. B.21.2. Financial income Financial income includes interest and dividend income; positive changes in the fair value of financial instruments (where changes infair value are recognized in profit or loss); realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains on financing and investing activities; andgains or losses on disposals of financial assets. B.22. Income tax expense Income tax expense includes all current and deferred taxes of consolidated companies. Sanofi accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes), using the methods described below: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on taxable anddeductible temporary differences, and on tax loss carry-forwards.Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base. French business taxes include a value added based component: \"CVAE\" (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajout\u00e9e des Entreprises ). Given that CVAE is (i) calculated as the amount by which certainrevenues exceed certain expenses and (ii) borne primarily bycompanies that own intellectual property rights on income derived from those rights (royalties, and margin on sales to third parties and to Sanofi entities), it is regarded as meeting thedefinition of income taxes specified in IAS 12, paragraph 2 (\"taxes which are based on taxable profits\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rate expected to apply in the period when the corresponding temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on taxrates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets are recognized in respect of deductible temporary differences, tax losses available for carry-forward and unused tax credits to the extent that future recovery is regardedas probable. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the profit forecasts contained in Sanofi's medium-term business plan. A deferred tax liability is recognized for temporary differences relating to interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except in cases where Sanofi is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences. This applies in particular when Sanofi is able to control dividend policy and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeablefuture. No deferred tax is recognized on eliminations of intragrouptransfers of interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures. Each tax entity calculates its own net deferred tax position. All net deferred tax asset and liability positions are then aggregated and shown in separate line items on the relevant side of the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets and liabilitiesare offset only if (i) Sanofi has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities, and (ii) the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxeslevied by the same taxation authority. Deferred taxes are not discounted, except implicitly in the case ofdeferred taxes on assets and liabilities which are already impacted by discounting. Withholding taxes on intragroup royalties and dividends, and onroyalties and dividends collected from third parties, are accounted for as current income taxes. In accounting for business combinations, Sanofi complies with therevised IFRS 3 in regards to the recognition of deferred tax assets after the initial accounting period. Consequently, any deferred tax F-28 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) assets recognized by the acquiree after the end of this period in respect of temporary differences or tax loss carry-forwards existing at the acquisition date are recognized in profit or loss. The positions adopted by Sanofi in tax matters are based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Some of those positions may be subject to uncertainty. In such cases, Sanofi assesses theamount of the tax liability on the basis of the following assumptions:that its position will be examined by one or more tax authorities onthe basis of all relevant information; that a technical assessment is carried out with reference to legislation, case law, regulations, andestablished practice; and that each position is assessed individually (or collectively where appropriate), with no offset or aggregation between positions. Those assumptions are assessed on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at the end of the reportingperiod. When an uncertain tax position is considered probable, a tax liability is recognized (or a deferred tax asset is not recognized) measured using Sanofi's best estimate. The amount of the liabilityincludes any penalties and late payment interest. The line item Income tax expenseincludes the effects of tax reassessments and tax disputes, and any penalties and late payment interestarising from such disputes that have the characteristics of incometaxes within the meaning of paragraph 2 of IAS 12 (\"taxes which are based on taxable profits\"). B.23. Employee benefit obligations Sanofi offers retirement benefits to employees and retirees. Such benefits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Benefits are provided in the form of either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the cost is recognized immediately in the period in which it is incurred, and equates to the amount of the contributions paid by Sanofi. For defined benefit plans, Sanofi generally recognizes itsobligations to pay pensions and similar benefits to employees as a liability, based on an actuarial estimate of the rights vested orcurrently vesting in employees and retirees, using the projected unit credit method. Estimates are performed at least once a year, and rely on financial assumptions (such as discount rates) and demographic assumptions (such as life expectancy, retirementage, employee turnover, and the rate of salary increases). Obligations relating to other post-employment benefits (healthcare and life insurance) offered by Sanofi companies to employees are also recognized as a liability based on an actuarial estimate of the rights vested or currently vesting in employees and retirees at the end of the reporting period. Such liabilities are recognized net of the fair value of plan assets.In the case of multi-employer defined benefit plans where plan assets cannot be allocated to each participating employer with sufficient reliability, the plan is accounted for as a definedcontribution plan, in accordance with paragraph 34 of IAS 19.The benefit cost for the period consists primarily of current service cost, past service cost, net interest cost, gains or losses arising from plan settlements not specified in the terms of the plan, and actuarial gains or losses arising from plan curtailments. Net interest cost for the period is determined by applying the discount rate specified in IAS 19 to the net liability (i.e. the amount of theobligation, net of plan assets) recognized in respect of defined benefit plans. Past service cost is recognized immediately in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred, regardless of whether ornot the rights have vested at the time of adoption (in the case of anew plan) or of amendment (in the case of an existing plan). Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans (pensions and other post-employment benefits), also referred to as \"Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset)\", arise as a result of changes in financial and demographic assumptions, experience adjustments, and the difference between the actualreturn and interest cost on plan assets. The impacts of those remeasurements are recognized inOther comprehensiveincome, net of deferred taxes; they are not subsequently reclassifiable to profit or loss. B.24. Share-based payment Share-based payment expense is recognized as a component ofoperating income, in the relevant classification of expense by function. In measuring the expense, the level of attainment of any performance conditions is taken into account. B.24.1. Stock option plans Sanofi has granted a number of equity-settled share-basedpayment plans (stock option plans) to some of its employees. The terms of those plans may make the award contingent on the attainment of performance criteria for some of the grantees. In accordance with IFRS 2 (Share-Based Payment), services received from employees as consideration for stock options are recognized as an expense in the income statement, with theopposite entry recognized in equity. The expense corresponds tothe fair value of the stock option plans, and is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the four-year vesting period of theplan. The fair value of stock option plans is measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, taking into account the expected life of the options. The resulting expense also takes into account the expected cancellation rate of the options. The expenseis adjusted over the vesting period to reflect actual cancellation rates resulting from option-holders ceasing to be employed by Sanofi. B.24.2. Employee share ownership plans Sanofi may offer its employees the opportunity to subscribe toreserved share issues at a discount to the reference market price. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-29NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Shares awarded to employees under such plans fall within the scope of IFRS 2. Consequently, an expense is recognized at the subscription date, based on the value of the discount offered to employees. B.24.3. Restricted share plans Sanofi may award restricted share plans to certain of itsemployees. The terms of those plans may make the award contingent on the attainment of performance criteria for some of the grantees. In accordance with IFRS 2, an expense equivalent to the fair value of such plans is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the plan, with the opposite entry recognized in equity. Depending on the country, the vesting period of such plans is either three or four years. Plans with a two-year or three-year vesting period are subject to a two-year lock-up period. The fair value of stock option plans is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted, representing the fair value of the services received during the vesting period. The fair value of an equity instrument granted under a plan is the market price of theshare at the grant date, adjusted for expected dividends during the vesting period. B.25. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period, adjusted on a time-weighted basis from the acquisition date to reflect the number of own shares held by Sanofi. Diluted earnings per share iscalculated on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares, computed using the treasury stock method. This method assumes that (a) all outstanding dilutive options and warrants are exercised, and (b) Sanofi acquires its own shares at the quoted market price for an amount equivalent to the cashreceived as consideration for the exercise of the options orwarrants, plus the expense arising on unamortized stock options. B.26. Segment information In accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the segmentinformation reported by Sanofi is prepared on the basis of internal management data provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker. The performance of thosesegments is monitored individually using internal reports andcommon indicators. Sanofi acquired the Consumer Healthcare operations of Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) on January 1, 2017, and during 2017 gradually integrated those operations into its Consumer Healthcare Global Business Unit (GBU); see Note A.5. Following completion of the integration process and with effect from December 31, 2017, Sanofi has identified our Consumer Healthcare business as anoperating segment, the financial information for which is reported separately to, and reviewed separately by, the Chief Executive Officer. Until that date the results of the Consumer Healthcare business were included in the Pharmaceuticals segment, as described below. Consequently, as of December 31, 2017 Sanofi has three operating segments: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Human Vaccines (Vaccines). The Pharmaceuticals segment comprises the commercial operations of the following global franchises: Specialty Care (Rare Diseases, Multiple Sclerosis, Oncology, Immunology), Diabetes &Cardiovascular, Established Prescription Products and Generics, together with research, development and production activitiesdedicated to our Pharmaceuticals segment. This segment also includes all associates whose activities are related topharmaceuticals, in particular Regeneron. The Consumer Healthcare segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations for our Consumer Healthcare products, together with research, development and productionactivities dedicated to those products. The Vaccines segment comprises, for all geographical territories (including from January 1, 2017 certain European territories previously included in the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture), the commercial operations of Sanofi Pasteur, together with research, development and production activities dedicated to vaccines. Inter-segment transactions are not material.In addition, during 2017 Sanofi finalized a complete realignment of its internal management reporting to match its organizational structure (see Note A.5.). As a result, the costs of Sanofi's global functions (Medical Affairs, External Affairs, Finance, HumanResources, Legal Affairs, Information Solutions & Technologies, Sanofi Business Services, etc.) are now managed centrally at group-wide level and are no longer allocated to operatingsegments for internal management reporting purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and subsequent years, the costs of those functions are presented within the \"Other\" category. Thatcategory also includes other reconciling items such as retained commitments in respect of divested activities. Operating segment disclosures as required under IFRS 8 are provided in Note D.35. to the consolidated financial statements. B.27. Management of capital In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Sanofi can adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares, or issue securities giving access to its capital. The following objectives are defined under the terms of Sanofi's share repurchase programs: the implementation of any stock option plan giving entitlement topurchase shares in the Sanofi parent company; F-30 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) the allotment or sale of shares to employees under statutory profit sharing schemes and employee savings plans; the consideration-free allotment of shares (i.e. restricted share plans); the cancellation of some or all of the repurchased shares; market-making in the secondary market by an investment services provider under a liquidity contract in compliance with the ethical code recognized by the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (AMF); the delivery of shares on the exercise of rights attached tosecurities giving access to the capital by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means; the delivery of shares (in exchange, as payment, or otherwise) in connection with mergers and acquisitions; the execution by an investment services provider of purchases, sales or transfers by any means, in particular via off-market trading; or any other purpose that is or may in the future be authorizedunder the applicable laws and regulations. Sanofi is not subject to any constraints on equity capital imposedby third parties. Total equity includes Equity attributable to equity holders of Sanofi and Equity attributable to non-controlling interests ,a s shown in the consolidated balance sheet. Sanofi defines \"Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents\" as (i) the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to hedge debt, minus (ii) the sum ofcash and cash equivalents and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to hedge cash and cash equivalents. C/ Principal alliances C.1. Alliance arrangements with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Regeneron) Collaboration agreement on the discovery, development and commercialization of human therapeutic antibodies In November 2007, Sanofi and Regeneron signed new agreements (amended in November 2009) for the discovery, development and commercialization of fully human therapeutic antibodies. Sanofi having decided not to extend the discovery agreement, thatagreement expired on December 31, 2017. Under the 2009 amended agreements Sanofi committed to funding the discovery and pre-clinical development of fully human therapeutic antibodiesby a maximum of $160 million per year through 2017. Sanofi hadan option to develop and commercialize antibodies discovered by Regeneron pursuant to the collaboration. Following the signature inJuly 2015 of the immuno-oncology collaboration agreement described below, $75 million (spread over three years) was reallocated to that new agreement.If the option was exercised, Sanofi co-develops the antibody withRegeneron and is responsible for funding. Sanofi and Regeneron share co-promotion rights and profits on sales of the co-developed antibodies. On receipt of the first positive Phase III trial results for any such antibody, the subsequent Phase III costs for that antibody are split 80% Sanofi, 20% Regeneron. Amounts received fromRegeneron under those arrangements are recognized by Sanofi as a reduction in the line itemResearch and development expenses. Once a product begins to be commercialized, andprovided that the share of quarterly results under the agreement represents a profit, Sanofi is entitled to an additional profit-share(capped at 10% of Regeneron's share of quarterly profits) until Regeneron has paid 50% of the cumulative development costsincurred by the parties in the collaboration. In addition, Sanofi may be required to make milestone payments based on aggregate sales of all antibodies. As of December 31, 2017 the cumulativedevelopment costs incurred by the two parties were\u20ac5.2 billion (comprising\u20ac2.9 billion funded 100% by Sanofi, 80% by Sanofi and 20% by Regeneron, amounts translated into euros at the closing US dollar exchange rate). On the earlier of (i) 24 months before the scheduled launch date or (ii) the first positive Phase III trial results, Sanofi and Regeneron share thecommercial expenses of the antibodies co-developed under thelicense agreement. Sanofi recognizes all the sales of those antibodies. Profits and losses arising from commercial operations in the United States are split 50/50. Outside the United States,Sanofi is entitled to between 55% and 65% of profits depending on sales of the antibodies, and bears 55% of any losses. The share of profits and losses attributable to Regeneron under the agreementis recognized in the line itemsOther operating incomeorOther operating expenses, which are components of operating income.In addition, Regeneron is entitled to receive payments of up to $250 million contingent on the attainment of specified levels ofsales outside the United States. Praluent \u00ae, Dupixent\u00ae, Kevzara\u00ae, and REGN3500 (SAR 440340) will continue to be developed, and commercialized as applicable, with Regeneron under the Antibody License and Collaboration Agreement (LCA) following the expiry of the discovery agreement. Immuno Oncology (IO) Discovery and Development Agreement and IO Licence and Collaboration Agreement (IOLCA) On July 1, 2015, Sanofi and Regeneron entered into a new global collaboration to discover, develop and commercialize new antibody cancer treatments in the emerging field of immuno-oncology. As part of the agreements, the two companies are jointly developing aprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor antibody currently in Phase IIb (for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma) and Phase III (for non-small cell lung cancer), and expect to initiateclinical trials with new therapeutic candidates based on ongoinginnovative preclinical programs. Sanofi made an upfront payment of $640 million to Regeneron. The two companies will then investapproximately $1 billion from discovery through proof of concept SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-31NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) (POC) development (usually a Phase IIa study) of monotherapy and novel combinations of immuno-oncology antibody candidates to be funded 25% by Regeneron ($250 million) and 75% by Sanofi ($750 million). Under the terms of the IO Discovery andDevelopment Agreement, Sanofi is entitled to an additional share of profits of up to 50% of the clinical development costs initially funded by Sanofi. That additional profit-share is capped at 10% ofthe share of Regeneron's quarterly profits arising under the IO LCA. Under the terms of the IO LCA Sanofi and Regeneron also committed to provide additional funding of no more than $650 million on a 50/50 basis ($325 million per company) for thedevelopment of REGN2810, a PD-1 inhibitor antibody. In January 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron announced an agreement to increasethe PD-1 development budget from the previously disclosed $650 million to $1.64 billion, which will continue to be shared 50/50. In addition, Sanofi will make a one-time milestone payment of$375 million to Regeneron in the event that sales of a PD-1 product and any other collaboration antibody sold for use in combination with a PD-1 product were to exceed, in the aggregate, $2 billion inany consecutive 12-month period. Finally, the two companiesagreed to reallocate $75 million (spread over three years) to immuno-oncology antibody research and development from Sanofi's $160 million annual contribution to their existing antibodydiscovery collaboration. Beyond the committed funding, additional funding will be allocated as programs enter post-POC development. Under the terms of the IO Discovery and Development Agreement, Sanofi can exercise its opt-in rights to further development and commercialization under the IO LCA for candidates derived from the discovery program. Once Sanofi has exercised its opt-in rights for a candidate, future development of that candidate will be conducted either by Sanofi or Regeneron. Where development is conducted by Sanofi, the entire cost of developing that candidate will be funded by Sanofi, and Regeneron will reimburse half of those costs, subject to a cap of 10% of Regeneron's quarterly profits. Where development is conducted by Regeneron, the two parties will share the development costs equally. Investor agreement In January 2014, Sanofi and Regeneron amended the investor agreement that has existed between the two companies since 2007 (the \"Amended Investor Agreement\"). Under the terms of the amendment, Sanofi accepted various restrictions. Sanofi is boundby certain \"standstill\" provisions, which contractually prohibit Sanofi from seeking to directly or indirectly exert control of Regeneron or acquiring more than 30% of Regeneron's capital stock (consistingof the outstanding shares of common stock and the shares ofClass A stock). This prohibition will remain in place until the earlier of (i) the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of the Zaltrap\u00ae collaboration agreement with Regeneron (related to the development and commercialization ofZaltrap \u00ae) or the collaboration agreement with Regeneron on monoclonal antibodies (see \"Collaboration agreement on thediscovery, development and commercialization of human therapeutics antibodies\" above), each as amended and (ii) otherspecified events. Sanofi has also agreed to vote as recommended by Regeneron's Board of Directors, except that it may elect to vote proportionally with the votes cast by all of Regeneron's other shareholders with respect to certain change-of-control transactions, and to vote in its sole discretion with respect to liquidation or dissolution, stockissuances equal to or exceeding 20% of the outstanding shares or voting rights of Regeneron's Class A Stock and Common Stock (taken together), and new equity compensation plans or amendments if not materially consistent with Regeneron's historicalequity compensation practices. As soon as it had passed the threshold of 20% ownership of the capital stock, Sanofi exercised its right under the Amended Investor Agreement to designate an independent director, who was appointed to the Board of Directors of Regeneron. The interest held by Sanofi in Regeneron has been consolidated by the equity method since April 2014. On the conditions set out in the Amended Investor Agreement entered into in January 2014, Sanofi's right to designate a Regeneron board member was contingent on Sanofi maintaining its percentage share of Regeneron's outstanding capital stock(measured on a quarterly basis) at a level no lower than the highest percentage level previously achieved, with the maximum requirement capped at 25%. In addition, Sanofi's interest in Regeneron was subject to a lock-up clause. Those limitations havebeen amended by the letter agreement of January 2018 (see Note G/). In November 2015, the Independent Designee (as defined in the Amended Investor Agreement) designated by Sanofi as an independent director resigned from the Regeneron Board of Directors. At Sanofi's request, pursuant to the Amended Investor Agreement,Regeneron appointed N. Anthony \"Tony\" Coles, M.D. to its Board of Directors in January 2017 as a successor Sanofi designee. The Amended Investor Agreement also gives Sanofi the right to receive certain reasonable information as may be agreed upon by the parties and which will facilitate Sanofi's ability to account for its investment in Regeneron using the equity method of accounting under IFRS. These three agreements were amended in January 2018 (seeNote G/). F-32 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) C.2. Alliance arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) Two of Sanofi's leading products were jointly developed with BMS: the September 27, 2012, Sanofi and BMS signed an agreementrelating to their alliance following the loss of exclusivity of Plavix\u00ae and Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00aein many major markets. Under the terms of this agreement, which took effect on January 1,2013, BMS returned to Sanofi its rights to Plavix\u00aeand Avapro\u00ae/ Avalide\u00aein all markets worldwide with the exception of Plavix\u00aein the United States and Puerto Rico, giving Sanofi sole control andfreedom to operate commercially in respect of those products. In exchange, BMS will receive royalty payments on Sanofi's sales ofbranded and unbranded Plavix \u00aeand Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00aeworldwide (except for Plavix\u00aein the United States and Puerto Rico) until 2018, and will also receive a payment of $200 million from Sanofi in December 2018, part of which will be used to buy out the non-controlling interests (see Note D.18.). Rights to Plavix\u00aein the United States and Puerto Rico remain unchanged and continue to be governed by the terms of the original agreement until December 2019. In all of the territories managed by Sanofi (including the United States and Puerto Rico for Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00ae) as defined in the new agreement, Sanofi recognizes in its consolidated financialstatements the revenue and expenses generated by its own operations. The share of profits reverting to BMS subsidiaries ispresented within Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the income statement. In the territory managed by BMS (United States and Puerto Ricofor Plavix\u00ae), Sanofi recognizes its share of profits and losses within the line item Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method. D/ Presentation of the financial statements D.1. Exchange of the Animal Health business Further to the exclusivity agreement of December 2015 on a futureexchange of Sanofi's Animal Health business (Merial) andBoehringer Ingelheim's Consumer Healthcare (CHC) business, the two groups announced on June 27, 2016 that they had successfully concluded the negotiations ongoing since the end of 2015 by signing contracts to secure the deal. Consequently, and as required by IFRS 5 (see Note B.7.), all assets of the Animal Health business included in the exchange and all liabilities directly related to those assets were classified in theline itemsAssets held for sale or exchangeandLiabilities related to assets held for sale or exchange, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. In addition, because the Animal Health business qualifies as adiscontinued operation under IFRS 5 (see Note B.7.), the netincome or loss from that business was presented separately in the consolidated income statement within the line itemNet income/ (loss) of the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business. This presentation in a separate line item in the incomestatement applied to operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the comparative periods presented. Following the finalization of the exchange deal with Boehringer Ingelheim onJanuary 1, 2017, the Animal Health business no longer qualified asan operating segment in 2016 and the comparatives for 2015 were amended accordingly. For detailed information about the contribution of the Animal Health business to the consolidated financial statements refer to Note D.36., \"Exchanged/Held-for-Exchange Animal Health business\". Finalization of the exchange of Sanofi's Animal Health business for Boehringer Ingelheim's CHC business On January 1, 2017, Sanofi finalized the exchange of its Animal Health business for Boehringer Ingelheim's CHC business. After final enterprise value adjustments, the exchange values of the two businesses effectively transferred during 2017 were determined at \u20ac10,557 million for Sanofi's Animal Health business and\u20ac6,239 million for Boehringer Ingelheim's CHC business. Divestment of the Animal Health business Sanofi has recognized a pre-tax gain of \u20ac6,343 million within the line itemNet income of the exchanged/held-for-exchange Animal Health business, and an after-tax gain of\u20ac4,643 million.

SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-41NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) D.5. Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Goodwill The recoverable amount of cash generating units (CGUs) is determined by reference to the value in use of each CGU, based on discounted estimates of the future cash flows from the CGU, in accordance with the policies described in Note B.6.1. In light of changes to the operational structure of Sanofi during 2017, the goodwill previously allocated in full to the old Pharmaceuticals CGU was reallocated between the new Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Healthcare CGUs as of January 1,2017, in accordance with the principles of IAS 36.The reallocated goodwill was subject to impairment testing, whichdid not indicate any requirement to recognize impairment losses. Impairment testing was also carried out on the basis of theprevious CGU structure, and this did not indicate any requirement to recognize impairment losses either. The goodwill arising from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim's Consumer Healthcare business (see note D.1.) was allocated in full to the Consumer Healthcare CGU. Goodwill is monitored internally at the level of each of the three current CGUs (Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Vaccines). Each of those CGUs reflects on a global scale all the key organizational components involved in commercial, R&D and industrial decision-making for that CGU. Sanofi believes thosedecisions have a significant influence on the generation of cash flows for each CGU. The allocation of goodwill as of December 31, 2017 is shown below: (\u20acmillion) 32,437 40,264 The value in use of each CGU was determined by applying an after-tax discount rate to estimated future after-tax cash flows. A separate discount rate is used for each CGU to reflect thespecific economic conditions of the CGU. The rates used for impairment testing in 2017 were 7.25% for the Pharmaceuticals CGU, 7.50% for the Consumer Healthcare CGU, and 7.25% for the Vaccines CGU; an identical value in use for Sanofi as a whole would be obtained by applying a uniform 7.3% rate to all three CGUs. The pre-tax discount rates applied to estimated pre-tax cash flows are calculated by iteration from the previously-determined value in use. Those pre-tax discount rates were 10.5% for the Pharmaceuticals CGU, 10.1% for the Consumer Healthcare CGU and 10.8% for the Vaccines CGU, and equate to a uniform rate of10.5% for Sanofi as a whole. The assumptions used in testing goodwill for impairment are reviewed annually. Apart from the discount rate, the principal assumptions used in 2017 were as follows: the perpetual growth rates applied to future cash flows were zero for the Pharmaceuticals CGU, 2% for the Consumer Healthcare CGU, and 0.5% for the Vaccines CGU; Sanofi also applies assumptions on the probability of success ofcurrent research and development projects, and more generally on its ability to renew the product portfolio in the longer term. Value in use (determined as described above) is compared with the carrying amount, and this comparison is then subjected tosensitivity analyses by reference to the principal parameters,including: changes in the discount rate; changes in the perpetual growth rate; and fluctuations in operating margin. No impairment of goodwill would need to be recognized in the event of a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in 2017. A value in use calculation for each of the CGUs would not result in an impairment loss using: a discount rate up to 1.3 percentage points above the ratesactually used; or a perpetual growth rate up to 2.7 percentage points below therates actually used; or an operating margin up to 3.8 percentage points below the rates actually used. No impairment losses were recognized against goodwill in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015. Other intangible assets When there is evidence that an asset may have become impaired, the asset's recoverable amount is calculated by applying an after-tax discount rate to the estimated future after-tax cash flows from that asset. This reflects the fact that in most instances, thereare no market data that would enable fair value less costs to sell to F-42 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) bedetermined other than by means of a similar estimate based on future cash flows. For the purposes of impairment testing, the tax cash flows relating to the asset are determined using a notional tax rate incorporating the notional tax benefit that would result fromamortizing the asset if its value in use were regarded as its depreciable amount for tax purposes. Applying after-tax discount rates to after-tax cash flows gives the same values in use as wouldbe obtained by applying pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows. The after-tax discount rates used in 2017 for impairment testing of other intangible assets in the Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare CGUs were obtained by adjusting Sanofi'sweighted average cost of capital to reflect specific country and business risks, giving after-tax rates in a range from 7.0% to12.1%. In 2017, impairment testing of other intangible assets (excluding software) resulted in the recognition of a \u20ac310 million net impairment loss (of which \u20ac17 million in Cost of sales ), relating mainly to marketed products in the Vaccines segment ( \u20ac190 million) and the Pharmaceuticals segment ( \u20ac23 million), and to research and development projects in both those segments ( \u20ac79 million). The impairment loss recognized for the Vaccines segment relates to intangible assets associated with the Dengue vaccine and arises from revisions to sales forecasts following results oflong-term clinical trials and the resulting requirement to update the product label. In 2016, impairment testing of other intangible assets (excluding software) resulted in the recognition of a \u20ac192 million netimpairment loss, comprising\u20ac58 million on research and development projects in the Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines segments and\u20ac134 million on rights for a number of marketedproducts in the Pharmaceuticals segment. In 2015, impairment testing of other intangible assets (excluding software) resulted in the recognition of a \u20ac767 million net impairment loss, comprising: \u20ac340 million on research and development projects in the Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines segments, in particular (i) Synvisc-One\u00aein osteoarthritis of the hip and (ii) the rotavirus vaccine project (Shantha); and \u20ac427 million on rights for a number of marketed products in the Pharmaceuticals segment, in particular (i) Afrezza\u00aein the United States following termination of the license and collaboration agreement with MannKind Corporation and (ii) Auvi-Q\u00ae/Allerject\u00ae in the United States and Canada following the voluntary recall of the product.

The carrying amount of those investments was\u20ac123 million as of December 31, 2017, \u20ac112 million as of December 31, 2016 and\u20ac102 million as ofDecember 31, 2015. Other available-for-sale financial assets As of December 31, 2017, Sanofi held \u20ac199 million of listed senior bonds (versus\u20ac100 million as of December 31, 2016). In connection with the dissolution of the Sanofi Pasteur MSD (SPMSD) joint venture, Sanofi recognized an available-for-sale financial asset for contingent consideration receivable by Sanofibased on a percentage of MSD's future sales during the 2017-2024 period of specified products previously distributed by SPMSD (see Notes B.1., D.2.3. and D.12.). The fair value of the MSD contingentconsideration was determined by applying the royalty percentage stipulated in the contract to discounted sales projections. Areduction of one percentage point in the discount rate would increase the fair value of the MSD contingent consideration by approximately 3%. Changes in the fair value of this contingent consideration are recognized in the income statement in the line item Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration (See Note B.18.). As of December 31, 2017, the contingent consideration assetamounted to \u20ac 342 million (including a non-current portion of \u20ac292 million), versus \u20ac458 million as of December 31, 2016. The movement during 2017 is due primarily to an adjustment of \u20ac145 million to the fair value of the assets to reflect revisions of sales forecasts.

(b) In some countries, Sanofi is liable for withholding taxes and other tax charges when dividends are distributed. Consequently, Sanofi recognizes a deferred tax liability on the reserves of French and foreign subsidiaries (approximately \u20ac51.0 billion) which it regards as likely to be distributed in the foreseeable future. In determining the amount of the deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, Sanofi took into account changes in the ownership structure of certain subsidiaries, and the effects of changes in the taxation of dividends in France following the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Steriacase and the resulting amendments to the 2015 Finance Act. (c) Includes deferred tax assets related to restructuring provisions, amounting to \u20ac212 million as of December 31, 2017, \u20ac334 million as of December 31, 2016, and \u20ac394 million as of December 31, 2015. F-50 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) The reserves of Sanofi subsidiaries that would be taxable if distributed but for which no distribution is planned, and for which no deferred tax liability has therefore been recognized, totaled \u20ac16.8 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared with\u20ac25.2 billion as of December 31, 2016 and\u20ac23.9 billion as of December 31, 2015. Most of Sanofi's tax loss carry-forwards are available indefinitely. For a description of policies on the recognition of deferred tax assets, refer to Note B.22. The recognition of deferred tax assets is determined on the basis of profit forecasts for each tax consolidation, and of the tax consequences of the strategicopportunities available to Sanofi. Those forecasts are consistent with Sanofi's medium-term strategic plan, and are based on timehorizons that take account of the period of availability of tax loss carry-forwards and the specific circumstances of each tax group. Deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carry-forwards as of December 31, 2017 amounted to \u20ac1,346 million, of which \u20ac287 million were not recognized. This compares with \u20ac1,502 million as of December 31, 2016 (of which \u20ac431 million were not recognized) and \u20ac1,721 million as of December 31, 2015 (of which \u20ac559 million were not recognized). The table below shows when tax losses available for carry-forwardare due to expire: (\u20acmillion)Tax losses available for carry-forward(a) 2018 33 2019 6 2020 24 2021 55 2022 43 2023 and later 5,003 Total as of December 31, 2017 5,164 Total as of December 31, 2016 5,176 Total as of December 31, 2015 5,209 (a) Excluding tax loss carry-forwards on asset disposals. Such carry- forwards amounted to\u20ac7 million as of December 31, 2017,\u20ac13 million as of December 31, 2016 and zero as of December 31, 2015.Use of tax loss carry-forwards is limited to the entity in which they arose. In jurisdictions where tax consolidations are in place, tax losses can be netted against taxable income generated by entities in the same tax consolidation. Deferred tax assets not recognized because their future recovery was not regarded as probable given the expected results of the entities in question amounted to\u20ac302 million in 2017,\u20ac561 million in 2016 and\u20ac666 million in 2015. D.15. Consolidated shareholders' equity D.15.1. Share capital As of December 31, 2017, the share capital was \u20ac2,508,039,808, consisting of 1,254,019,904 shares with a par value of \u20ac2.

The vesting period is four years and the plan expires on June 24, 2025. Measurement of stock option plans The fair value of the stock subscription option plan awarded in2017 is\u20ac5 million. That amount is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, with the other side of the entry recognized directly in equity. On that basis, an expense of\u20ac0.7 million wasrecognized in the year ended December 31, 2017. The fair value of the stock subscription option plan awarded in 2016 is\u20ac3 million.Sanofi used the following assumptions in determining the fair value of the plans: dividend yield: 3.56% (2017 plan), 4.51% on a (2015 plan); and plan maturity: 7 years (2017, 2016 and 2015 plans). The planmaturity is the average expected remaining life of the options, based on observations of historical employee behavior. Fair values per option awarded are \u20ac12.21, \u20ac6.60 and \u20ac16.12 for the 2017, 2016 and 2015 plans, respectively. The expense recognized for stock option plans (and the corresponding amounts recognized in equity) are \u20ac4 million for 2017, and \u20ac6 million for 2016 and 2015. As of December 31, 2017, the total unrecognized cost of unvestedstock options was \u20ac8 million (versus \u20ac9 million as of December 31, 2016 and \u20ac12 million as of December 31, 2015), to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years.

(e) Two potential payments of \u20ac42 million each relating to the acquisition of Protein Sciences, which are contingent on the attainment of specified performance criteria subsequent to the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2017, Liabilities related to business combinations and to non-controlling interests mainly comprised: The Bayer contingent consideration liability arising from the acquisition of Genzyme in 2011. As of December 31, 2017, Bayerwas still entitled to receive the following potential payments: a percentage of sales of alemtuzumab up to a maximum of $1,250 million or over a maximum period of ten years, whichever is achieved first; and milestone payments based on specified levels of worldwide sales of alemtuzumab beginning in 2021, unless Genzyme exercisesits right to buy out those milestone payments by making aone-time payment not exceeding $900 million. The fair value of this liability was measured at \u20ac701 million as of December 31, 2017, compared with \u20ac1,013 million as of December 31, 2016. The fair value of the Bayer liability isdetermined by applying the above contractual terms to salesprojections which have been weighted to reflect the probability of success, and discounted. If the discount rate were to fall by 1percentage point, the fair value of the Bayer liability would increase by approximately 3%. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-67NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) The MSD contingent consideration liability arising from the 2016 acquisition of the Sanofi Pasteur activities carried on within the former Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture, which amounted to \u20ac420 million as of December 31, 2017 (see Notes D.2.3. andD.12.). The fair value of the contingent consideration wasdetermined by applying the royalty percentage stipulated in the contract to discounted sales projections. The table below sets forth the maximum amount of contingent consideration payable and firm commitments to buy out non-controlling interests: December 31, 2017 Payments due by period (\u20acmillion) TotalLess than 1 yearFrom 1 to 3 yearsFrom 3 to 5 yearsMore than 5 years Commitments relating to contingent consideration in connection with business combinations(a)and buyouts of non-controlling interests(b) 4,293 354 2,630 1,069 240 (a) Includes \u20ac1.4 billion for the Bayer contingent consideration (versus \u20ac1.8 billion as of December 31, 2016 and \u20ac1.9 billion as of December 31, 2015) and \u20ac2.2 billion for the CVRs issued in connection with the acquisition of Genzyme (versus \u20ac2.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 and \u20ac2.6 billion as of December 31, 2015). (b) This line does not include put options granted to non-controlling interests. Total commitments relating to contingent consideration in connection with business combinations and buyouts of non-controlling interests were \u20ac4,832 million as of December 31, 2016 and \u20ac5,073 million as of December 31, 2015. The reduction in those commitments during 2017 was mainly attributable tocommitments related to the Genzyme acquisition (i.e. annual payments of the Bayer contingent consideration) and in particularto currency translation effects on such commitments recognized in US dollars.

SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-69NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Other current liabilities are described in Note D.19.5. D.19.1. Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits Sanofi offers its employees pension plans and other post- employment benefit plans. The specific features of the plans (benefit formulas, fund investment policy and fund assets held) vary depending on the applicable laws and regulations in eachcountry where the employees work. These employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with the revised IAS 19 (see Note B.23.). Sanofi's pension obligations in four major countries represented nearly 90% of the total value of the defined-benefit obligation and nearly 89% of the total value of plan assets as of December 31, 2017. The features of the principal defined-benefit plans in each of those four countries are described below. France Lump-sum retirement benefit plans All employees working for Sanofi in France are entitled on retirement to a lump-sum payment, the amount of which depends both on their length of service and on the rights guaranteed by collective and internal agreements. The employee's final salary isused in calculating the amount of these lump-sum retirement benefits. These plans represent approximately 34% of the Group's total obligation in France. Defined-benefit pension plans These plans provide benefits from the date of retirement.Employees must fulfil a number of criteria to be eligible for these benefits. All but one of the plans are closed to new entrants. These plans represent approximately 66% of the Group's total obligationsin France. Germany Top-up defined-benefit pension plan The benefits offered under this pension plan are wholly funded by the employer (there are no employee contributions) via a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA), under which benefits are estimated on the basis of an average career salary. Employees areentitled to receive an annuity under this plan if their salary exceeds the social security ceiling. The amount of the pension is calculated by reference to a range of vesting rates corresponding to salarybands. The plan also includes disability and death benefits. Thisplan represents approximately 69% of Sanofi's total obligation in Germany.Sanofi-Aventis plus (SAV plus) Starting April 2015, a new top-up pension plan (SAV plus) replaced the previous top-up defined-benefit plan. New entrants joining the plan after April 1, 2015 contribute to a defined-contribution plan that is partially funded via the company's CTA. All employees whose salary exceeds the social security ceiling are automatically covered by the plan. The employer's contribution is 15% of the amount by which the employee's salary exceeds the social security ceiling. Multi-employer plan ( Pensionskasse ) This is a defined-benefit plan that is treated as a defined-contribution plan, in accordance with the accounting policies described in Note B.23. Currently, contributions cover the level of annuities. Only the portion relating to the future revaluation of theannuities is included in the defined-benefit pension obligation. The obligation relating to this revaluation amounted to\u20ac699 million as of December 31, 2017, versus\u20ac663 million as of December 31,2016 and\u20ac670 million as of December 31, 2015. This planrepresents approximately 19% of Sanofi's total defined-benefit obligation in Germany. United States Defined-benefit pension plans In the United States, there are two types of defined-benefit plan: \"Qualified\" plans within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which provide guaranteed benefits to eligible employees during retirement, and in the event of death or disability. Employees can elect to receive a reducedannuity, in exchange for an annuity to be paid in the event of their death to a person designated by them. An annuity is also granted under the plan if the employee dies before retirementage. Eligible employees do not pay any contributions. These plans are closed to new entrants, and the vesting of rights forfuture service periods is partially frozen. They represent around 65% of Sanofi's total obligation in the United States. \"Non-qualified\" plans within the meaning of ERISA providetop-up retirement benefits to some eligible employees depending on the employee's level of responsibility and subject to a salarycap. These plans represent approximately 9% of Sanofi's total obligation in the United States. Healthcare cover and life insurance Sanofi companies provide some eligible employees with healthcare cover and life insurance during the retirement period (the F-70 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) company's contributions are capped at a specified level). This plan represents approximately 26% of Sanofi's total obligation in the United States. United Kingdom Defined-benefit pension plans Sanofi operates a number of pension plans in the United Kingdom that reflect past acquisitions. The two most significant arrangements are the Sanofi plan and the Genzyme Limited plan; both are defined-benefit plans, and both have been closed sinceOctober 1, 2015. With effect from that date, employees can no longer pay into these plans. The Genzyme Limited plan was merged with the Sanofi plan effective January 1, 2017. Under these defined-benefit plans, an annuity is paid from the retirement date. This annuity is calculated on the basis of the employee's length of service as of September 30, 2015, and of the employee's final salary (or salary on the date he or she leaves Sanofi). The rates used for the vesting of rights vary from member to member. For most members, rights vest at the rate of 1.25% or1.50% of final salary for each qualifying year of service givingentitlement. The notional retirement age varies according to the category to which the member belongs, but in most cases retirement is at age 65. Members may choose to retire before orafter the notional retirement age (60 years), in which case the amount of the annual pension is adjusted to reflect the revised estimate of the length of the retirement phase. Pensions areusually indexed to the Retail Price Index (RPI). Members paid a fixed-percentage contribution into their pension plan (the percentage varied according to the employee category), and theemployer topped up the contribution to the required amount. Theseplans represent approximately 99% of Sanofi's total obligation in the United Kingdom. For service periods subsequent to October 1, 2015, employees belong to a new defined-contribution plan. Actuarial assumptions used to measure Sanofi's obligations Actuarial valuations of Sanofi's benefit obligations were computedby management with assistance from external actuaries as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Those calculations were based on the following financial and demographic assumptions: 2017 2016 2015 France Germany USA UK France Germany USA UK France Germany USA UK Discount rate(a)/(b)0.75% or 1.25%0.75% to 67 6255 to 70 6062 to 67 6255 to 70 60 Mortality tableTGH/ 2005 GRP2014 G. Scale MP2015SAPS S2 (a) The discount rates used were based on market rates for high quality corporate bonds with a duration close to that of the expected benefit payments under the plans. The benchmarks used to determine discount rates were the same in 2017, 2016 and 2015. (b) The rate depends on the duration of the plan (7 to 10 years and more than 10 years, respectively). (c) Inflation for the euro zone is determined using the average break-even inflation rate of French and German government bonds, by reference to the duration of the principal plans. (d) No post-employment healthcare benefits are provided in Germany.

Tothis end, Sanofi uses an asset-liability management strategy,matching plan assets to its pension obligations. This policy aims to ensure the best fit between the assets held on the one hand, and the associated liabilities and expected future payments to planmembers on the other. To meet this aim, Sanofi operates a risk monitoring and management strategy (mainly focused on interest rate risk and inflation risk), while investing a growing proportion ofassets in high-quality bonds with comparable maturities to those ofthe underlying obligations.

Provisions for environmental risks and remediation mainly relate to contingencies arising from business divestitures. Identified environmental risks are covered by provisions estimatedon the basis of the costs Sanofi believes it will be obliged to meet over a period not exceeding (other than in exceptional cases) 30 years. Sanofi expects that\u20ac139 million of those provisions will be utilized in 2018, and\u20ac333 million over the period from 2019through 2022. \"Product liability risks, litigation and other\" mainly comprises provisions for risks relating to product liability (including IBNR provisions as described in Note B.12.), government investigations, regulatory or antitrust law claims, or contingencies arising from business divestitures (other than environmental risks).The main pending legal and arbitral proceedings and government investigations are described in Note D.22. A full risk and litigation assessment is performed with the assistance of Sanofi's legal advisers, and provisions are recorded as required by circumstances in accordance with the principles described in Note B.12. D.19.4. Other non-current liabilities Other non-current liabilities amounted to \u20ac1,050 million as of December 31, 2017 (versus \u20ac216 million as of December 31, 2016 and\u20ac275 million as of December 31, 2015). As of December 31, 2017, a liability of \u20ac1,069 million was recognized, representing the estimated tax charge on deemed repatriation attributable to the accumulated earnings of non-US operations payable over 8 years.

On occasion, Sanofi uses equityderivatives in connection with the management of its portfolio of equity investments. Sanofi performs periodic reviews of its transactions and contractual agreements in order to identify any embedded derivatives, which are accounted for separately from the host contract in accordance with IAS 39. Sanofi had no material embedded derivatives as of December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.Counterparty risk As of December 31, 2017, all currency and interest rate hedgeswere contracted with leading banks, and no single counterparty accounted for more than 16% of the notional amount of Sanofi's overall currency and interest rate positions. a) Currency derivatives used to manage operating risk exposures Sanofi operates a foreign exchange risk hedging policy to reduce the exposure of operating income to exchange rate movements. This policy involves regular assessments of Sanofi's worldwide foreign currency exposure, based on foreign currency transactionscarried out by the parent company and its subsidiaries. Thosetransactions mainly comprise sales, purchases, research costs, F-80 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) co-marketing and co-promotion expenses, and royalties. To reduce the exposure of those transactions to exchange rate movements,Sanofi contracts hedges using liquid derivative instruments, mainly forward currency purchases and sales, and also currency swaps.

That foreign exchange exposure is hedged by Sanofi using firm financial instruments (currency swaps or forward contracts).

Sanofi may also hedge some future foreign-currency investment or divestment cash flows.Sanofi manages its net debt in two currencies: the euro and theUS dollar (see Note D.17.). The floating-rate portion of this debt exposes Sanofi to rises in interest rates, primarily in the Eonia and Euribor benchmark rates (for the euro) and in the US Libor and Federal Fund Effective rates (for the US dollar). To optimize the cost of debt or reduce the volatility of debt, Sanofi uses interest rateswaps, cross currency swaps and interest rate options to alter the fixed/floating rate split of debt. Such derivative instruments are predominantly denominated in euros and US dollars.

Potential milestone payments as of December 31, 2016 amounted to \u20ac2,072 million (excluding the Animal Health business). (f) See Note C.2. F-86 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Operating leases Sanofi leases some of the property and equipment used in the ordinary course of business under operating leases. The majority of future operating lease rental commitments relate to real estate assets; the remainder relate to vehicles and other leased assets.Future minimum lease payments due under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2017 were\u20ac1,452 million (versus\u20ac1,507 million as of December 31, 2016 and\u20ac1,567 million as of December 31, 2015). Total rental expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2017 was\u20ac291 million (versus \u20ac309 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 and \u20ac340 million in the year ended December 31, 2015). Research and development license agreements In pursuance of its strategy, Sanofi may acquire technologies and rights to products. Such acquisitions may be made in various contractual forms: acquisitions of shares, loans, license agreements, joint development, and co-marketing. Thesearrangements generally involve upfront payments on signature of the agreement, development milestone payments, and royalties. Some of these complex agreements include undertakings to fundresearch programs in future years and payments contingent upon achieving specified development milestones, the granting of approvals or licenses, or the attainment of sales targets once a product is commercialized. The \"Research and development license agreements\" line comprises future service commitments to fund research and development or technology, and potential milestone paymentsregarded as reasonably possible (i.e. all potential milestonepayments relating to projects in the development phase, for which the future financial consequences are known and considered as probable and for which there is a sufficiently reliable estimate). Itexcludes commitments relating to projects in the research phase (\u20ac7.2 billion in 2017,\u20ac6.2 billion in 2016,\u20ac4.7 billion in 2015), and payments contingent upon the attainment of sales targets once a product is commercialized (\u20ac10.1 billion in 2017,\u20ac8.2 billion in2016,\u20ac8.0 billion in 2015). Major agreements entered into during 2017 were as follows:On January 9, 2017, Sanofi and Immunext announced an agreement to develop a novel antibody to treat auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and lupus.

Sanofi and Warp Drive have decided to end the collaborationinitiated in January 2016 relating to two key programs (ABC and non ABC) to develop novel anti-cancer and antibiotic agentsderived from proprietary platforms. Other agreements Sanofi has entered into two agreements, with Royalty Pharma(December 2014) and NovaQuest (December 2015), which have similar characteristics in that the partners jointly bear a portion of the remaining development cost of the project on a quarterly basisin return for a share of future sales. These transactions are co-investments, whereby the partner acquires an interest in the jointly-developed product by providing funding towards thedevelopment program. Consequently, the amounts received by Sanofi will be recorded as a reduction in development costs, to theextent that the development costs incurred by Sanofi are recognized in profit or loss in accordance with the policiesdescribed in Note B.4.1. The commitments under these two agreements were altered by the following events that occurred in 2017: The products being developed under the December 2014 agreement with Royalty Pharma were launched in the United States and Europe, marking the end of the joint developmentprograms. Sanofi announced the discontinuation of development on the Clostridium Difficile program on December 1, 2017, thereby cancelling any future commitments under the December 2015 joint development agreement with NovaQuest. On February 27, 2017, Sanofi and Lonza announced a strategic partnership in the form of a joint venture to build and operate a large-scale mammalian cell culture facility for monoclonal antibody production in Visp, Switzerland. An initial investment of F-88 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) approximately \u20ac0.3 billion to finance construction of the facility will be made 50/50 by the two partners. In addition, Sanofi could pay Lonza in the region of\u20ac0.8 billion over the next fifteen years partly as its share of operating expenses and the cost of producing futurebatches, and partly to reserve capacity in the new facility. In February 2014, pursuant to the \"Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework for the sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits\" (still effective as ofDecember 31, 2017), Sanofi Pasteur and the World Health Organization (WHO) signed a bilateral \"Standard Material TransferAgreement\" (SMTA 2). This agreement stipulates that Sanofi Pasteur will, during declared pandemic periods, (i) donate 7.5% of its real-time production of pandemic vaccines against any strainwith potential to cause a pandemic, and (ii) reserve a further 7.5%of such production on affordable terms. The agreement cancels and replaces all preceding commitments to donate pandemic vaccines to the WHO. D.21.2. Off balance sheet commitments relating to financing activities Credit facilities Undrawn credit facilities are as follows: December 31, 2017 Expiry (\u20acmillion) TotalLess than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 yearsMore than 5 years General-purpose credit facilities 8,010 7 8,003 - - As of December 31, 2017, total credit facilities amounted to \u20ac8,010 million (versus \u20ac8,000 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, excluding the Animal Health business). Guarantees The table below shows the amount of guarantees given and received: (\u20acmillion) 2017 2016 2015 Guarantees given: 2,986 3,946 3,972 Guarantees provided to banks in connection with credit facilities 1,318 2,189 2,260 Other guarantees given 1,668 1,757 1,712 Guarantees received (181) (211) (187) D.21.3. Off balance sheet commitments relating to Sanofi entities and business combinations Funding commitments to associates and joint ventures are disclosed in Note D.6. The maximum amount of contingent consideration relating to business combinations is disclosed in Note D.18. D.22. Legal and arbitral proceedings Sanofi and its affiliates are involved in litigation, arbitration andother legal proceedings. These proceedings typically are related to product liability claims, intellectual property rights (particularly claims against generic companies seeking to limit the patentprotection of Sanofi products), competition law and trade practices,commercial claims, employment and wrongful discharge claims, tax assessment claims, waste disposal and pollution claims, andclaims under warranties or indemnification arrangements relating to business divestitures. Provisions related to legal and arbitral proceedings are recorded in accordance with the principles described in Note B.12. Most of the issues raised by these claims are highly complex and subject to substantial uncertainties; therefore, the probability of loss and an estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain. Contingent liabilities are cases for which either we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceeding, or a cash outflow is notprobable. In either case, a brief description of the nature of thecontingent liability is disclosed and, where practicable, an estimate of its financial effect, an indication of the uncertainties relating to the amount and timing of any outflow, and the possibility of anyreimbursement are provided in application of paragraph 86 of IAS 37. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-89NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) In the cases that have been settled or adjudicated, or where quantifiable fines and penalties have been assessed, we have indicated our losses or the amount of provision accrued that is the estimate of the probable loss. In a limited number of ongoing cases, while we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the expected loss or range of the possible loss and have accrued a provision for such loss, we believe thatpublication of this information on a case-by-case basis or by classwould seriously prejudice the Company's position in the ongoing legal proceedings or in any related settlement discussions.Accordingly, in those cases, we have disclosed information with respect to the nature of the contingency but have not disclosed our estimate of the range of potential loss, in accordance with paragraph 92 of IAS 37. These assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management.We believe that the aggregate provisions recorded for the above matters are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent uncertainties related to these casesand involved in estimating contingent liabilities, we could in the future incur judgments that could have a material adverse effect on our net income in any particular period. Long term provisions are disclosed in Note D.19. They include:Provisions for product liability risks, litigation and other amount to \u20ac 1,164 million in 2017. These provisions are mainly related to product liabilities, government investigations, competition law,regulatory claims, warranties in connection with certaincontingent liabilities arising from business divestitures other than environmental matters and other claims. Provisions for environmental risks and remediation amount to \u20ac 686 million in 2017, the majority of which are related to contingencies that have arisen from business divestitures. a) Products Sanofi Pasteur Hepatitis B Vaccine Product Litigation Since 1996, more than 180 lawsuits have been filed in various French civil courts against Sanofi Pasteur and/or Sanofi Pasteur MSD S.N.C., the former a French subsidiary of Sanofi, and thelatter a joint venture company with Merck & Co., Inc. nowterminated, for which past ongoing litigation is now managed by the originating party. In such lawsuits, the plaintiffs allege that they suffer from a variety of neurological disorders and autoimmunediseases, including multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome as a result of receiving the hepatitis B vaccine. To date, only oneclaim decided against the Company has been upheld by the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation ). In January 2008, both the legal entity Sanofi Pasteur MSD S.N.C., and a corporate officer of this company, as well as, a formercorporate officer of Sanofi Pasteur, were placed under investigation in an ongoing criminal inquiry in France relating to alleged side effects caused by the hepatitis B vaccine. In March 2012, Sanofi Pasteur and the former pharmacist in charge, deputy Chief Executive Officer of Sanofi Pasteur were placed under an \"advised witness\" status. In October 2017, the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation ) dismissed two appeals filed by the plaintiffs against two decisions of the Appeal Court of Paris (Cour d'appel ). Plavix\u00aeProduct Litigation in the US As of December 31, 2017, around 759 lawsuits, involvingapproximately 1,395 claimants (but 1,134 ingesting plaintiffs) have been filed against affiliates of Sanofi and Bristol-Myers Squibb seeking recovery under US state law for personal injuries allegedlysustained in connection with the use of Plavix \u00ae. The actions are held in several jurisdictions, including the federal and/or state courts of New Jersey, New York, California, and Delaware. It is not possible, at this stage, to assess reliably the outcome of theselawsuits or the potential financial impact on the Company. Taxotere\u00aeProduct Litigation in the US As of December 31, 2017, around 7,123 lawsuits, involvingapproximately 8,208 claimants (but 7,580 ingesting plaintiffs and 629 loss of consortium plaintiffs) have been filed against affiliates of Sanofi under US state law for personal injuries allegedlysustained in connection with the use of Taxotere \u00ae. The actions are held in several jurisdictions, including the federal and/or state courts of Louisiana, New Jersey, California, Delaware and Illinois. It is not possible, at this stage, to assess reliably theoutcome of these lawsuits or the potential financial impact on the Company. Depakine\u00aeProduct Litigation in France As of December 31, 2017, 56 individual claims, involving approximately 90 claimants, and a class action based on 14 claims have been filed against a French affiliate of Sanofi seeking indemnification under French law for personal injuries allegedlysustained by children in connection with the use of Depakine \u00ae,a sodium valproate antiepileptic treatment, by the mothers during pregnancy. These actions are held in several jurisdictions in France. An investigation is ongoing in relation to a criminalcomplaint against person unknown filed in May 2015. In November 2017, court decisions were rendered in relation to certain individual cases and the class action: (i) the Court of Appeals of Orl\u00e9ans confirmed the Tours Court decision which ordered the French affiliate to pay approximately \u20ac2 million to the plaintiff and \u20ac1 million to the CPAM (Caisse Primaire d'Assurance Maladie). The French affiliate has filed a motion to the French Supreme Court; (ii) the Paris Court denied an individual plaintiff's F-90 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) motion for interim measures and plaintiff has lodged an appeal, and (iii) in the class action lawsuit filed by the APESAC ( Association des Parents d'Enfants souffrant du Syndrome de l'Anti- Convulsivant) , the judge also rejected claimant's motion on interim measures. APESAC has lodged an appeal. The French government has, through the 2017 Finance law adopted on December 29, 2016, set up a public fund which is meant to compensate loss or injury actually suffered in relation to the prescription of sodium valproate and its derivatives. The fund entered into force on June 1, 2017. The French affiliate has raisedissue of conflict of interest of certain appointed experts and it has seized the Administrative Court on the unresolved conflict situationof one expert. It is not possible, at this stage, to assess reliably the outcome of these cases or the potential financial impact on the Company. b) Patents Ramipril Canada Patent Litigation Sanofi has been involved in a number of legal proceedings involving companies which market generic Altace\u00ae(ramipril) in Canada. Notwithstanding proceedings initiated by Sanofi, eight manufacturers obtained marketing authorizations from the Canadian Minister of Health for generic versions of ramipril inCanada. Following the marketing of these products, Sanofi filed patent infringement actions against all those companies. In a patent infringement action, the Federal Court of Canada ruled onJune 29, 2009 that the patent asserted by Sanofi was invalid. Sanofi's leave to appeal the judgment was denied in 2012. Each of Teva, Apotex and Riva initiated Section 8 damages claims against Sanofi, seeking compensation for their alleged inability to market a generic ramipril during the time taken to resolve the proceedings against the Canadian Ministry of Health. Sanofi and Teva reached an agreement in June 2012 on a confidential amount to satisfyTeva's claim and in November 2012, Apotex was awarded CAD221 million. Sanofi appealed both rulings. In March 2014, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Sanofi's appeal with respect to Teva and issued a decision in the appeal with respect to Apotex increasing Apotex's damages award, and costs of all appeals (not including costs associated with underlying trial). In May 2014, Sanofi and Apotexexecuted a settlement agreement in satisfaction of the FederalCourt of Appeal's increased damages judgment. On April 20, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed Sanofi's appeal of the Court of Appeal decision with respect to Apotex, thereby affirmingthe decision of the Court of Appeal. The Riva Section 8 case, which had been stayed pending resolution of the Supreme Court Appeal, was settled following court-sponsored mediation in September2015. In June 2011, while the Section 8 damages action was proceeding in Federal Court, Apotex commenced an action in the OntarioSuperior Court of Justice asserting damages pursuant to, inter alia,the Ontario Statute of Monopolies, the UK Statute of Monopolies, and the Trade-marks Act (the \"Ontario Action\"). The Ontario Action was stayed pending exhaustion of appeals in the Section 8 damages action and, despite having received full compensation in the Section 8 action, was reinitiated by Apotex after the conclusionof the appeals. Praluent\u00ae(alirocumab)-related Amgen Patent Litigation in the US Amgen filed four separate complaints against Sanofi in the USasserting patent infringement on October 17, October 28, November 11, and November 18, 2014 based on Sanofi and Regeneron plans to submit a US Biologic License Application foralirocumab. Together these complaints allege that Sanofi's alirocumab product infringes seven patents and seek injunctive relief and unspecified damages. These cases were consolidatedinto one case in December 2014. Sanofi and Regeneron asserted, among other defenses, invalidity and non-infringement defenses. InJanuary 2016, Sanofi and Regeneron informed the District Court that they stipulated to infringement. In March 2016, the DistrictCourt granted Judgment as a Matter of Law (JMOL) of obviousness in favor of Amgen and JMOL on an aspect of willful infringement in favor of Sanofi and Regeneron, and those issues are presently notin the case. In addition, in March 2016, a jury verdict upheld the validity of Amgen's asserted claims of two patents for antibodies targeting PCSK9. Further, in March 2016, Sanofi, Regeneron andAmgen resolved part of the proceedings related to certain past damages that is contingent on the outcome of our appeal. In January 2017, the District Court denied Sanofi's and Regeneron'smotion for a new trial and their motion for JMOL and granted aninjunction preventing the marketing, selling or manufacturing of Praluent \u00aein the US during the term of the two Amgen patents starting from February 21, 2017. In February 2017, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\"Federal Circuit\") stayed (suspended) the permanent injunction for Praluent\u00aeinjection during Sanofi's and Regeneron's appeal of the validity judgment and injunction ruling in the Federal Circuit. InOctober 2017, the Federal Circuit granted a new trial on certain issues, vacated (lifted) the lower court's judgment and found thatthe trial court improperly granted a permanent injunction. Amgen filed a petition for rehearing by the full Federal Circuit in December 2017. Praluent\u00ae(alirocumab)-related Amgen Patent Litigation in Europe Amgen has filed three separate patent infringement lawsuitsagainst Sanofi and Regeneron in Europe based on Amgen's European patent EP2215124. On July 25, 2016, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the UK High Court of Justice, Chancery Division PatentsCourt against five Sanofi entities and Regeneron alleging thatalirocumab infringes its '124 (UK) patent, seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages; Sanofi has counterclaimed invalidity. In February 2017, the UK action was stayed (suspended) on termsagreed by the parties. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-91NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Also on July 25, 2016, Amgen filed a lawsuit in Germany in the Regional Court, Dusseldorf against three Sanofi entities and Regeneron alleging that alirocumab infringes its '124 (DE) patent, seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages. On September 26, 2016, Amgen filed a lawsuit in France in the Tribunal de Grande Instanceof Paris against two Sanofi entities and Regeneron alleging that alirocumab infringes its '124 (FR)patent, seeking injunctive relief and unspecified damages. In April2017, in France, Sanofi and Regeneron filed a response to the complaint and a separate nullity action, which is now consolidatedinto the infringement action. A hearing date has been set for June 2018. Praluent\u00ae(alirocumab)-related EPO Patent Oppositions The European Patent Office (EPO) granted Amgen's EuropeanPatent EP2215124 on February 24, 2016. Also on February 24, 2016, Sanofi filed an opposition with the EPO requesting the revocation of Amgen's '124 patent in its entirety for all contractingstates on the grounds that the subject-matter of the opposed patent is not patentable. On November 24, 2016, Sanofi filed a second opposition (in the name of three Sanofi affiliates named asdefendants in the German infringement action - see above), andRegeneron filed a separate opposition, requesting revocation of Amgen's '124 patent. The parties have filed several sets of furthersubmissions. The EPO has set a hearing date for November 2018. Praluent\u00ae(alirocumab)-related Amgen Opposition and Patent Litigation in Japan In May 2017, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the Tokyo District Court, against Sanofi K.K. for patent infringement of two of its Japanese Patents, JP5705288 and JP5906333. Amgen seeks injunctive relief to prevent the infringing manufacture, use and sale of alirocumab,as well as destruction of Praluent and alirocumab, and attorneys' fees; Sanofi has counterclaimed invalidity. The validity of these two Japanese patents was challenged by Sanofi in the JapanesePatent Office (JPO) by filing invalidation actions in 2016. The JPOissued a Trial Decision in March 2017, indicating their intent to maintain some claims of each patent, and invalidate others. Amgenfiled corrected claims in the JPO in May 2017, canceling the claims the JPO indicated were invalid. In August 2017, the JPO issued their decision to maintain the amended claims valid. In December 2017, Sanofi filed an appeal to the Intellectual Property High Courtdemanding revocation of the JPO decision. Dupixent\u00ae(dupilumab)-related Amgen Patent Opposition and Revocation in Europe Immunex Corporation, an Amgen affiliate, is the registeredproprietor of European Patent EP2292665. The claims of this patent relate to, among other things, human monoclonal antibodies that are capable of inhibiting IL-4 induced biological activity andwhich compete with one of four reference antibodies for binding toa cell that expresses human IL-4R. In April 2016, Sanofi and Regeneron each filed an opposition in the European Patent Office (EPO) against EP2292665, seeking its revocation on the basis that, inter alia, the claims are overly broad. In September 2016, Sanofi also filed a civil action in the UK High Court (Chancery Division/Patents Court) seeking revocation of the UK designation ofEP2292665 on similar grounds. In January 2017, at the joint request of Sanofi and Immunex, the UK High Court ordered that the revocation action be stayed pending the final determination ofthe pending EPO opposition proceedings. The EPO rendered its decision in November 2017 and revoked the patent in its entirety. The decision revoking the patent was issued in January 2018. Immunex is entitled to appeal the decision of the EPO, and the deadline to file the formal appeal is March 14, 2018. Dupixent\u00ae(dupilumab)-related Amgen Inter Partes Review Petition and Patent Litigation in the US In March and July 2017, Sanofi and Regeneron filed collectivelythree petitions forInter PartesReview (IPR) for US patent 8,679,487 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In these petitions, Sanofi and Regeneron collectivelyattack the validity of all the claims of this patent. The USPTO declined to institute an IPR on the first petition. In April 2017, Immunex filed a complaint in the US District Court for the Central District of California against Sanofi and Regeneron for patent infringement and declaratory judgment of patent infringement of US patent 8,679,487 with respect to Dupixent\u00ae.I n response, among other challenges, Sanofi and Regeneronasserted non-infringement, invalidity, and enforceability challenges. Plavix\u00aeLitigation (Commonwealth) in Australia In August 2007, GenRX (a subsidiary of Apotex) obtained registration of a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. At the same time, GenRX filed a patent invalidation action with the Federal Court ofAustralia, seeking revocation of Sanofi's Australian enantiomer patent claiming clopidogrel salts (a \"nullity action\"). In September 2007, Sanofi obtained a preliminary injunction from the FederalCourt preventing commercial launch of this generic clopidogrelbisulfate product until judgment on the substantive issues of patent validity and infringement. In February 2008, Spirit PharmaceuticalsPty. Ltd. also filed a nullity action against Sanofi's Australian enantiomer patent. The Spirit proceeding was consolidated with the Apotex proceeding. In August 2008, the Australian Federal Court confirmed that the claim in Sanofi's Australian enantiomer patent directed to clopidogrel bisulfate (the salt form in Plavix\u00ae) was valid and the patent infringed. On appeal, the Full Federal Court of Australia held in September 2009 that all claims in the patent are invalid. Sanofi's F-92 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) appeal to the Australia High Court was denied in March 2010. The security bond posted by Sanofi in connection with the preliminary injunction obtained in 2007 was subsequently increased from AUD40 million to AUD204 million ( \u20ac26 million to \u20ac133 million as of December 31, 2017). Apotex sought damages in the range of AUD20 million to AUD236 million ( \u20ac13 million to \u20ac154 million as of December 31, 2017), plus interest for having been subject to an injunction. On April 8, 2013, the Australian Department of Health and Ageing filed an application before the Federal Court of Australia seeking payment of damages from Sanofi related to the Apotex preliminary injunction of up to AUD449 million (\u20ac293 million as of December 31, 2017), plus interest. Sanofi and BMS settled the patent litigation with Apotex in November 2014. In light of the Apotex settlement, the Commonwealth has requested that the Court consider a set oflegal issues separate from trial that could simplify the trial. InDecember 2015, the Court held that the relevant statute does notpreclude the Commonwealth from seeking damages in cases such as this. Sanofi and BMS have applied for special leave to appeal against this decision. Sanofi's special appeal to the High Court on the issue of the invalidity of the patent was denied in November 2015. In May 2016, Sanofi's and BMS's application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia was denied. Consequently, the substantive claim on damages sought by the Commonwealth has continued to trial. A decision is expected in late 2018. c) Other litigation and arbitration CVR Trustee Claim In November 2015, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC (\"AST\"), the Trustee of the CVR Agreement between AST and Sanofi-Aventis, dated March 30, 2011, filed a complaint against Sanofi in the US District Court for the Southern District of NewYork, alleging that Sanofi breached the CVR Agreement and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, including by allegedly failing to use \"Diligent Efforts,\" as defined in the CVRAgreement, with respect to the regulatory approval and sale of Lemtrada \u00ae. On January 29, 2016, Sanofi moved to dismiss Counts II (breach ofcontract relating to the Product Sales Milestones) and III (breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing) of the complaint. In May 2016, AST submitted a notice of resignation as Trustee. Before the resignation became effective, AST filed a Supplemental Complaint seeking the entry of a declaratoryjudgment that it is entitled to, among other things, reimbursementfor legal fees and expenses incurred by its outside counsel for the investigation and prosecution of the claims in the case under theCVR Agreement. In June 2016, a new Trustee, UMB Bank, N.A. (\"UMB\") was appointed. In July 2016, UMB moved for partialsummary judgment on its declaratory judgment claim seeking,among other things, the reimbursement of legal fees and expenses incurred by its outside counsel for the investigation and prosecution of the claims in the case. In September 2016, the Court issued an order denying (in part) Sanofi's motion to dismiss Count II of thecomplaint, granting Sanofi's motion to dismiss Count III of the complaint in its entirety, and denying UMB's motion for partial summary judgment relating to its request for the payment of thefees and expenses incurred by its outside counsel. In October 2016, UMB appealed the portion of the order denying its motion for partial summary judgment to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In December 2016, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted Sanofi's motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. In February 2017, the Trustee amended the complaint to assert breach of contract claims with respect to its requests for books and records, as well as its request for an audit. On March 24, 2017, theTrustee sought leave to amend its complaint for a second time toassert a breach of contract claim with respect to the Production Milestone, which request was granted on August 23, 2017. Discovery is ongoing with respect to the claims relating to the FDAapproval milestone, Product Sales Milestone #1 and the ProductionMilestone. On October 6, 2017, the Trustee filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to its request for an audit pursuant to Section 7.6(a) of the CVR Agreement. d) Contingencies arising from certain Business Divestitures Sanofi and its subsidiaries, Hoechst and Aventis Agriculture,divested a variety of mostly chemical, including agro-chemical, businesses as well as certain health product businesses in previous years. As a result of these divestitures, the Company issubject to a number of ongoing contractual and legal obligations regarding the state of the sold businesses, their assets, and their liabilities. Aventis Behring Retained Liabilities The divestment of Aventis Behring and related protein therapiesassets became effective on March 31, 2004. The purchase agreement contained customary representations and warranties running from Sanofi as seller to CSL Limited as purchaser. Sanofihas indemnification obligations that generally expired on March 31, 2006 (the second anniversary of the closing date). However, some indemnification obligations, having a longer duration, remain ineffect. For example, indemnification obligations relating to the due organization, capital stock and ownership of Aventis Behring Companies ran through March 31, 2014, and product liability indemnification runs through March 31, 2019, subject to an extension for claims related to certain types of product liability notified before such date. Furthermore, for tax-related issues, the indemnification obligation of Sanofi covers all taxable periods thatend on or before the closing date and expires thirty days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. In addition, the SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-93NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) indemnification obligations relating to certain specified liabilities, including HIV liability, survive indefinitely. Under the indemnification agreement, Sanofi is generally obligated to indemnify CSL Limited, only to the extent indemnifiable, losses exceeding $10 million and up to a maximum aggregate amount of $300 million. For environmental claims, the indemnification due by Sanofi equals 90% of the indemnifiable losses. Product liabilityclaims are generally treated separately, and the aggregateindemnification is capped at $500 million. Certain indemnification obligations, including those related to HIV liability, as well as taxclaims, are not capped in amount. Aventis CropScience Retained Liabilities The sale by Aventis Agriculture S.A. and Hoechst GmbH (both legacy companies of Sanofi) of their aggregate 76% participation in Aventis CropScience Holding (ACS) to Bayer and Bayer CropScience AG (BCS), the wholly owned subsidiary of Bayerwhich holds the ACS shares, was effective on June 3, 2002. The Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) dated October 2, 2001, contained customary representations and warranties with respectto the sold business, as well as a number of indemnifications, inparticular with respect to: environmental liabilities (the representations and warranties and the indemnification are subjectto a cap of\u20ac836 million, except for certain legal representations and warranties and specific environmental liabilities); taxes; certain legal proceedings; claims related to StarLink \u00aecorn; and certain pre-closing liabilities, in particular, product liability cases (which aresubject to a cap of\u20ac418 million within the above global cap of \u20ac836 million). There are various periods of limitation dependingupon the nature or subject of the indemnification claim. Further, Bayer and BCS are subject to a number of obligations regarding mitigation and cooperation. Since December 2005, Aventis Agriculture and Hoechst GmbH have concluded several settlement agreements to resolve a substantial number of disputes with Bayer and BCS, including the termination of arbitration proceedings initiated in August 2003 for an alleged breach of a financial statement-related representation contained in the SPA, and numerous other warranty and indemnification claims, including certain environmental and product liabilities claims. A number of otheroutstanding claims remain unresolved. LLRICE601 and LLRICE604 - Arbitration On December 19, 2014, BCS initiated a claim for arbitration againstAventis Agriculture S.A. and Hoechst GmbH seeking indemnification under various provisions of the SPA, with a demand for\u20ac787.5 million. Bayer is seeking indemnification fordamages allegedly suffered in several hundred individual complaints and lawsuits by rice growers, millers and distributors arising in US state and federal courts against a number ofCropScience companies, formerly part of ACS before itsdivestiture, following the detection in 2006 of trace amounts ofgenetically-modified rice (the Liberty Link \u00aeRice 601 and 604) in samples of commercial long grain rice. Bayer alleges that it has incurred losses in excess of $1.2 billion in judgments, settlements and litigation costs. The claimed amount corresponds to theresidual portion of the indemnification available under the SPA. Sanofi does not consider that these claims constitute indemnifiable losses under the SPA and is currently opposing Bayer's request to indemnification in the ongoing arbitration proceeding before DIS(German Arbitral Tribunal). The hearings are scheduled to take place in May 2018. Aventis Animal Nutrition Retained Liabilities Aventis Animal Nutrition S.A. and Aventis (both legacy companies of Sanofi) signed an agreement for the sale to Drakkar Holdings S.A. of the Aventis Animal Nutrition business effective in April 2002. The sale agreement contained customary representationsand warranties. Sanofi's indemnification obligations ran through April 2004, except for environmental indemnification obligations (which ran through April 2012), tax indemnification obligations(which run through the expiration of the applicable statutorylimitation period), and antitrust indemnification obligations (which extend indefinitely). The indemnification undertakings are subject toan overall cap of\u20ac223 million, with a lower cap for certain environmental claims. Indemnification obligations for antitrust and tax claims are not capped. Celanese AG Retained Liabilities The demerger of the specialty chemicals business from Hoechst to Celanese AG (now trading as \"Celanese GmbH\") became effective on October 22, 1999. Under the demerger agreement between Hoechst and Celanese, Hoechst expressly excluded anyrepresentations and warranties regarding the shares and assets demerged to Celanese. Celanese subsequently contributed rights and obligations relating to environmental liabilities resulting fromthe demerger agreement to a subsidiary CCC EnvironmentalManagement and Solutions GmbH & Co. KG (\"CCC\"). The following obligations of Hoechst are ongoing: While all obligations of Hoechst (i) resulting from public law or (ii) pursuant to current or future environmental laws or (iii) vis-\u00e0-vis third parties pursuant to private or public law relatedto contamination (as defined) were transferred to Celanese underthe demerger agreement in full, after the subsequent contribution CCC can request indemnification from Hoechst for two thirds of any such cost incurred under these obligations. To the extent Hoechst is liable to purchasers of certain of itsdivested businesses (as listed in the demerger agreement), CCC is liable to indemnify Hoechst, as far as environmental damagesare concerned, for aggregate liabilities up to \u20ac250 million, liabilities exceeding such amount will be borne by Hoechst alone up to\u20ac750 million, and amounts exceeding \u20ac750 million will be borne 2/3by Hoechst and1/3by CCC without any further caps. F-94 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) Subsequent to the contribution of rights and obligations relating to environmental liabilities by Celanese, Celanese was jointly liable with CCC until November 2016. Thereafter, Celanese remains liable for known environmental claims specified in 2013. Rhodia Shareholder Litigation In January 2004, two minority shareholders of Rhodia and theirrespective investment vehicles filed two claims before the Commercial Court of Paris (Tribunal de Commerce de Paris) against Aventis, to which Sanofi is successor in interest, togetherwith other defendants including former directors and statutory auditors of Rhodia from the time of the alleged events. The claimants seek a judgment holding the defendants collectivelyliable for alleged management errors and for alleged publication of misstatements between 1999 and 2002, and inter alia regarding Rhodia's acquisition of the companies Albright & Wilson andChiRex. These shareholders seek a finding of joint and severalliability for damages to be awarded to Rhodia in an amount of \u20ac925 million for alleged harm to it (a derivative action), as well aspersonal claims of\u20ac4.3 million and\u20ac125.4 million for their own alleged individual losses. Sanofi contests both the substance and the admissibility of these claims. Sanofi is also aware of three criminal complaints filed in France by the same plaintiffs and of a criminal investigation order issued by the Paris public prosecutor following the submission of the reportissued by the AMF regarding Rhodia's financial communications. In2006, the Commercial Court of Paris accepted Sanofi's and the other defendants' motion to stay the civil litigation pending the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. In December 2016, the Court of Appeals of Paris dismissed the appeal lodged by the same plaintiffs against the order of the investigating judge dated October 2015, dismissing all criminalcharges in this case. The plaintiffs appealed the December 2016decision before the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation). Following this decision, the plaintiffs may also petition the Commercial Court of Paris and seek the reopening of thecommercial cases mentioned above on the basis that the criminal proceedings have now concluded. Clariant Retained Liabilities - Specialty Chemicals Business Hoechst conveyed its specialty chemicals business to Clariant AG (Clariant) pursuant to a 1997 agreement. Clariant has undertaken to indemnify Hoechst for all costs incurred for environmental matters relating to purchased sites. However, certainindemnification obligations of Hoechst for environmental matters in favor of Clariant remain with Hoechst. Hoechst must indemnify Clariant indefinitely (i) with respect to sites taken over by Clariant, for costs which relate to environmental pollutions attributable to certain activities of Hoechst or of thirdparties, (ii) for costs attributable to four defined waste deposit sitesin Germany which are located outside the sites taken over by Clariant (to the extent exceeding an indexed amount of approximately\u20ac20.5 million), (iii) for costs from certain locally concentrated pollutions in the sites taken over by Clariant but not caused by specialty chemicals activities in the past, and (iv) for 75% of the costs relating to a specific waste deposit site in Frankfurt, Germany. Infraserv H\u00f6chst Retained Liabilities By the Asset Contribution Agreement dated December 19/20,1996, as amended in 1997, Hoechst contributed all lands, buildings, and related assets of the Hoechst site at Frankfurt H\u00f6chst to Infraserv GmbH & Co. H\u00f6chst KG. Infraserv H\u00f6chstundertook to indemnify Hoechst against environmental liabilities at the H\u00f6chst site and with respect to certain landfills. As consideration for the indemnification undertaking, Hoechsttransferred to Infraserv H\u00f6chst approximately\u20ac57 million to fundreserves. In 1997, Hoechst also agreed it would reimburse current and future Infraserv H\u00f6chst environmental expenses up to\u20ac143 million. As a former owner of the land and as a former user of the landfills, Hoechst may ultimately be liable for costs of remedial action in excess of this amount.

D.25. Other operating income Other operating income totaled \u20ac237 million in 2017, versus \u20ac355 million in 2016 and \u20ac254 million in 2015. This line item includes income arising under alliance agreements in the Pharmaceuticals segment ( \u20ac7 million in 2017, versus \u20ac191 million in 2016 and \u20ac59 million in 2015). In particular, it includes amounts arising under the agreement with Regeneron,which represented a loss of\u20ac12 million in 2017 versus a gain of\u20ac141 million in 2016. This reflects Regeneron's share of profits/losses from the commercialization of antibodies, amounting to \u20ac385 million in 2017 (\u20ac419 million in 2016), net of the commercialization-related expenses incurred by Regeneron of\u20ac397 million in 2017 (\u20ac278 million in 2016).

No costs of a comparable nature were recognized in 2015. The restructuring costs recognized in 2016 related mainly to the implementation of an organizational transformation program in France and in the rest of the world as part of the 2020 strategic roadmap. In 2015, restructuring costs related mainly to (i) employee-related expenses arising from headcount adjustment plans in the United States, Japan, and the rest of the world and (ii) the reorganizationof R&D activities, especially in France following signature of the agreement with Evotec. Expenses related to property, plant andequipment mainly reflect impairment losses taken against industrialassets in Europe. D.28. Other gains and losses, and litigation In 2017, the line item Other gains and losses, and litigation showed a net expense of \u20ac215 million, including an additional charge to provisions for vendor's liability guarantees on pastdivestments and a negative price adjustment of\u20ac31 million on the2016 divestment of Sanofi's interest in the Sanofi Pasteur joint venture. On December 30, 2016 Sanofi divested its interest in the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture to MSD, generating a pre-tax gain of \u20ac211 million (see Note D.1.2. to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016). There were no other material transactions of this nature in 2015, and no costs incurred as a result of major litigation. F-98 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) D.29. Financial expenses and income An analysis of financial expenses and income is set forth below: (\u20acmillion) 2017(a) 2016(a) 2015(a) Cost of debt(b) (277) (274) (331) Interest income 56 56 57 Cost of debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (221) (218) (274) Non-operating foreign exchange gains/(losses) (21) (21) - Unwinding of discounting of provisions(c) (33) (33) (44) Net interest cost related to employee benefits (92) (114) (114) Gains/(losses) on disposals of financial assets 96 36 46 Impairment losses on financial assets, net of reversals (7) (487)(d) (50) Other 5 (19) 55 Net financial income/(expenses) (273) (856) (381) comprising: Financial expenses (420) (924) (559) Financial income 147 68 178 (a) The results of the Animal Health business are presented separately in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations); see Notes D.1. and D.36. (b) Includes net gain on interest rate derivatives used to hedge debt: \u20ac69 million in 2017, \u20ac86 million in 2016 and \u20ac85 million in 2015. (c) Primarily on provisions for environmental risks, restructuring provisions, and provisions for product-related risks (see Note D.19.). (d) On October 5, 2016, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that it was terminating its revusiran development program, as a result of which its share price fell by 48% on October 6, 2016. Consequently, Sanofi recognized an impairment loss reflecting the difference between the historical acquisition cost of its shares in Alnylam and their market value. That impairment loss, which amounted to\u20ac457 million as of December 31, 2016, is included within the line \"Impairment losses on financial assets, net of reversals\". In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the impact of the ineffective portion of hedging relationships was not material. D.30. Income tax expense Sanofi has elected for tax consolidations in a number of countries, principally France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. The table below shows the allocation of income tax expense between current and deferred taxes: (\u20acmillion) 2017(a) 2016(a) 2015(a) 1,269 Total (1,722) (1,326) (709) Income before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method 5,530 5,678 5,243 (a) The results of the Animal Health business, and the gain on the divestment of that business, are presented separately in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations); see Notes D.1. and D.36. SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-99NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) The difference between the effective tax rate and the standard corporate income tax rate applicable in France is explained as follows: (as a percentage) 2017(a) 2016(a) 2015(a) Standard tax rate applicable in France 34.4 34.4 34.4 Difference between the standard French tax rate and the rates applicable to Sanofi(b) (19.2) (10.1) (17.7) Tax rate differential on intragroup margin in inventory(c) (0.0) (0.6) 1.7 Tax effects of the share of profits reverting to BMS (see Note D.32.) (0.5) (0.5) (0.6) Contribution on distributed income (3%) and associated changes(d) (8.2) 2.0 2.1 CVAE tax in France(e) 1.3 1.1 1.3 Revisions to tax exposures and settlements of tax disputes 2.2 (4.8) 0.3 Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration 1.1 0.4 (1.1) Impact of US tax reform(f) 21.6 - - Other items(g) (1.6) 1.5 (6.9) Effective tax rate 31.1 23.4 13.5 (a) The results of the Animal Health business, and the gain on the divestment of that business, are presented separately in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations); see Notes D.1. and D.36. (b) The difference between the French tax rate and tax rates applicable to foreign subsidiaries reflects the fact that Sanofi has operations in many countries, most of which have lower tax rates than France. (c) When internal margin included in inventory is eliminated, a deferred tax asset is recognized on the basis of the tax rate applicable to the subsidiary that holds the inventory, which may differ from the tax rate of the subsidiary that generated the eliminated intragroup margin. (d) In 2017, this line includes the consequences of the French Constitutional Council ruling of October 6, 2017 on the additional 3% contribution on dividends paid out in cash. In 2016 and 2015, entities liable to corporate income tax in France were liable to pay an additional tax contribution in respect of amounts distributed by the entity. (e) Net impact on the effective tax rate (current taxes, impact of the tax deduction, and deferred taxes). (f) For 2017, this line includes an expense of \u20ac1,193 million for the consequences of US tax reform, comprising the estimated tax charge on deemed repatriation attributable to the accumulated earnings of non-US operations payable over 8 years ( \u20ac1,084 million) and a further expense of \u20ac109 million representing (i) the remeasurement of deferred taxes following the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and (ii) an adjustment to deferred taxes on the fair value of the reserves of Sanofi subsidiaries. (g) For 2017, the \"Other items\" line includes the impact of changes to tax rates in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. For 2016, it includes the effect so f changes in tax rates in various countries, particularly in France, Hungary, Italy, Japan and the United States. For 2015, it includes the impact ( \u20ac161 million) of changes in the taxation of dividends in France following the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Steria case and the resultingamendments to the 2015 Finance Act. This line also includes the net tax effect of taxable temporary differences associated with holdings in Sanofi subsidiaries.In determining the amount of the deferred tax liability for 2017, 2016 and 2015, Sanofi took into account changes in the ownership structure of certainsubsidiaries. For the periods presented, the amount of deferred tax assets recognized in profit or loss that were initially subject to impairment losses on a business combination is immaterial. The contribution on distributed income, for which the triggering event is the decision by the Annual General Meeting to approve the distribution, is not taken into account in the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities. D.31. Share of profit/loss from investments accounted for using the equity method With effect from the beginning of April 2014, this line item includes Sanofi's share of the profits and losses of Regeneron, which represented a net profit of\u20ac101 million in 2017 (compared with a net profit of\u20ac126 million in 2016 and a net loss of\u20ac54 million in2015). That amount includes the impact of amortization charged on the fair value remeasurement of Sanofi's share of the acquired intangible assets and inventories of Regeneron. This line item also includes the share of co-promotion profits attributable to Sanofi for territories covered by entities majorityowned by BMS (see Note C.2.). The impact of the BMS alliance in2017 was \u20ac20 million, before deducting the tax effect of \u20ac7 million (compared with\u20ac25 million in 2016 with a tax effect of\u20ac9 million, and\u20ac57 million in 2015 with a tax effect of\u20ac21 million). The Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture ceased to be accounted for by the equity method on March 8, 2016, the date on which it wasannounced that the joint venture was to be dissolved (see Notes B.1. and D.2.3.). Finally, this line item also includes the share of profits or losses from other investments accounted for by the equity method, the amount of which was immaterial in 2017, 2016 and 2015. D.32. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests This line item includes the share of co-promotion profits attributableto BMS for territories covered by entities majority owned by Sanofi (see Note C.2.). The amounts involved were\u20ac84 million in 2017, \u20ac86 million in 2016 and\u20ac94 million in 2015. There is no tax effecton these amounts because BMS receives its share before tax. F-100 SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) This line item also includes the share of net income attributable to other non-controlling interests:\u20ac37 million in 2017,\u20ac5 million in 2016 and\u20ac7 million in 2015. D.33. Related party transactions The principal related parties are companies over which Sanofi has control or significant influence; joint ventures; key management personnel; and principal shareholders. Sanofi has not entered into any material transactions with any key management personnel or any of their close family members. Any transactions with such individuals are routine transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business. Financial relations with Sanofi's principal shareholders fall within the ordinary course ofbusiness and were immaterial in the years ended December 31,2017, 2016 and 2015.A list of the principal companies controlled by Sanofi is presentedin Note F.1. Those companies are fully consolidated as described in Note B.1. Transactions between those companies, and betweenthe parent company and its subsidiaries, are eliminated whenpreparing the consolidated financial statements. Transactions with companies over which Sanofi has significant influence, and with joint ventures, are presented in Note D.6. Key management personnel include corporate officers (includingone director holding office for four months in 2016 and two directors holding office during 2015 who were covered by top-uppension plans: see \"Item 6.B. - Compensation\") and the membersof the Executive Committee (an average of 13 members in 2017 and 2016, and 11 members in 2015). The table below shows, by type, the compensation paid to key management personnel: (\u20acmillion) 2017 2016 2015 Short-term benefits(a) 31 32 32 Post-employment benefits(b) 89 Share-based payment 15 22 14 Total recognized in profit or loss 54 63 6620 (a) Compensation, employer's social security contributions, directors' attendance fees, and any termination benefits (net of reversals of termination benefit obligations). (b) In 2015, includes the expense arising from the award of a deemed ten years of service to Olivier Brandicourt. The aggregate top-up pension obligation in favor of certain corporate officers and of members of the Executive Committee was \u20ac68 million as of December 31, 2017, versus\u20ac72 million as of December 31, 2016 and\u20ac128 million as of December 31, 2015.The reduction in the obligation to corporate officers as of December 31, 2016 was mainly due to directors ceasing to hold office, rather than to a general reduction in the obligation. The aggregate amount of termination benefits and lump-sum retirement benefits payable to key management personnel was \u20ac9 million as of December 31, 2017, compared with\u20ac8 million asof December 31, 2016 and\u20ac6 million as of December 31, 2015. D.34. Disclosures about major customers and credit risk Credit risk is the risk that customers (wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics or government agencies) may fail to pay their debts. Sanofi manages credit risk by vetting customers in order to set credit limits and risk levels and asking for guaranteesor insurance where necessary, performing controls, and monitoring qualitative and quantitative indicators of accounts receivable balances such as the period of credit taken and overdue payments. Customer credit risk also arises as a result of the concentration of Sanofi's sales with its largest customers, in particular certain wholesalers in the United States. Sanofi's three largest customersrespectively accounted for approximately 9%, 5% and of 2016; 10%,6% and 5% 2015). D.35. Segment information As of December 31, 2017, and as described in Notes A.5. andB.26., Sanofi has three operating segments: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Human Vaccines (Vaccines). The Pharmaceuticals segment comprises the commercial operations of the following global franchises: Specialty Care (Rare Diseases, Multiple Sclerosis, Oncology, Immunology), Diabetes & Cardiovascular, Established Prescription Products and Generics, together with research, development and production activitiesdedicated to our Pharmaceuticals segment. This segment also includes all associates whose activities are related topharmaceuticals, in particular our share of Regeneron. The Consumer Healthcare segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations for our Consumer Healthcare products, together with research, development and productionactivities dedicated to those products. The Vaccines segment comprises, for all geographical territories (including from January 1, 2017 certain European territories previously included in the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture), the SANOFI / FORM 20-F 2017 F-101NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) commercial operations of Sanofi Pasteur, together with research, development and production activities dedicated to vaccines. Inter-segment transactions are not material. D.35.1. Segment results Sanofi reports segment results on the basis of \"Business operating income\". This indicator is used internally by Sanofi's chief operating decision maker to measure the performance of each operating segment and to allocate resources. Business operating income is derived from Operating income, adjusted as follows: the amounts reported in the line items Restructuring costs and similar items ,Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration and Other gains and losses, and litigation are eliminated;amortization and impairment losses charged against intangible assets (other than software and other rights of an industrial or operational nature) are eliminated; the share of profits/losses from investments accounted for using the equity method is added; net income attributable to non-controlling interests is deducted; other acquisition-related effects (primarily the workdown ofacquired inventories remeasured at fair value at the acquisition date, and the impact of acquisitions on investments accounted for using the equity method) are eliminated; restructuring costs relating to investments accounted for using the equity method are eliminated.
