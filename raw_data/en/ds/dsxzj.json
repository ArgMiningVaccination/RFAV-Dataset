A powerful yet gentle healer and cleanser, Amber draws out and transmutes negative energy of all kinds on all levels. Amber aids in physical self-healing, emotional healing of depression, and environmental clearing. Amber opens and cleanses all of the Chakras. Highly protective, Amber also aids in the manifestation of ideas to reality.

Physically, Amber helps with the organs of elimination, including the liver, kidneys, bladder, and stomach. Also a stone of the Throat Chakra, Amber can help with laryngitis and goiter. In very simple terms, in order to qualify a piece of resin as true Amber, a couple of things need to have happened. First, the molecules must have formed a polymer (a compound where two or more molecules have joined together) and secondly, the specimen must be at least 100,000 years old. Copal or Copalite is the term given to organic resins that are not old enough (i.e. younger than 100,000 years) to have fossilized and hardened sufficiently to become Amber. Amber is often imitated by plastics, colored glasses and some modern tree resins. True Ambers have a low specific gravity (amber can float on salt water) and inclusions can distinguish it from plastics and glasses. In Africa, Copal is found in the coastal countries of East and West Africa, but especially on Madagascar. This so-called Madagascar Amber is solidified resin of the Amber Pine but is only 1,000 - 10,000 years old. Most Amber from Columbia is less than 250 years old and in fact is not Amber at all, but the softer, younger version called Copal. In summary, here are a few facts about Amber and Copal: Amber is defined by geologists as fossilized tree resin (not tree sap). Sap is the fluid that circulates through a plant's vascular system. Sap to a tree, is like blood flowing through the veins of you or me. Resin, on the other hand, is a semi-solid amorphous (no crystal structure) organic substance that is secreted in pockets and canals through epithelial cells of the plant. It's the really sticky stuff that after time will fossilize and harden. Hardened tree resin that is less than 100,000 years old is called Copal. Copal becomes Amber when it has finished fossilizing. Copal can \"craze\" or crack on the surface as the volatile oils (or turpenes) evaporate. Copal will dissolve in acetone, but Amber will not. Copal from Madagascar and Columbia are 250 to 10,000 years old Amber from the Baltics and the Dominican Republic are 25 to 40 million years old. Amber Calcite, also called Honey Calcite, gently amplifies energy and psychic abilities via the Third-Eye and Crown Chakras.

Amethyst Cacoxenite (what we refer to as \"Sacred Seven\") was first described around 1825, is said to be a combination of seven different mineral varieties: Amethyst, Clear Quartz, Smokey Quartz, Rutile, Goethite, Lepidocrocite, Cacoxenite. Sometimes there are inclusions of Hematite as well. It is only found from Espirito Santo, Brazil and isn't found in points. (\"Super Seven\" as trademarked by Melody who discovered this stone, is also called \"Sacred Seven\" or \"Melody's Stone\". We respect Melody's trademark and that is why we refer to this stone as Amethyst Cacoxenite. To be technically correct, Amethyst Cacoxenite is a light to dark purple crystal with golden brown thread-like markings of Cacoxenite throughout.) Amethyst protects and soothes; Smokey Quartz is grounding; Clear Quartz and Rutile amplify energy; Goethite aids in communication as well as clairaudience; Lepidocrocite clears thought processes to allow for knowledge input; Cacoxenite generates new ideas while allowing you to see the positive. The potent combination of all of these stones adds up to a more powerful vibration as a whole that will lend itself to heal body, mind and spirit.

It will also assist in removing blockages from all bodies (physical, mental, spiritual, etc.). \"Ammolites\" are Ammonite fossils predominately found in Madagascar and Alberta (Canada) that display iridescence by compression and mineralization of the Ammonite fossil. These iridescent Ammonites are often of gem quality when polished. In no case would this iridescence have been visible during the animal's life; additional shell layers covered it. The spiral shape of these fossilized creatures symbolizes continual change and evolution. The Ammonite draws off all negative energies. Think of the Ammonite spirals as a filter, drawing in these dense energies which are no longer needed, moving them through the spirals and releasing them as fresh, positive, loving life force energies. The Ammonite is a very powerful earth healing fossil. Ammonites have absorbed cosmic energy over eons of time and help to stimulate the life force (Chi) within. Ammonites are often used for activating Kundalini and life path energies. It is often recommended to keep an Ammonite in your home to attract health, prosperity and success.

A Phantom (read more about Phantoms here) is a crystal or mineral deposit within a crystal. Phantoms are formed when the growth of a crystal has been interrupted and then begins to grow again. While the color of Phantoms will vary from crystal to crystal, depending upon the type of mineral of which they are made, Amphibole Phantoms often contain inclusions of (yellow) Limonite, (red) Hematite, (white) Kaolinite, or (pink) Lithium. Often, the original mineral gets washed away, leaving only the Quartz to grow afterwards. The addition of the Angel Phantom Quartz inclusions offer added benefits - the grounding of Hematite, the protection against psychic attack of Limonite, and the intuition-building of Kaolinite - combining to form a crystal that is a must in order to be a step closer to Universal love. Angel Phantom Quartz is an excellent crystal to use with the Third Eye and Crown Chakras, as it enables you to gain a stronger connection to the Angelic realm as well as communication with your own Guardian Angel. This protective, high vibration stone increases our awareness of the spiritual realm, past-life recall and lucid dreaming. A bringer of intense love, beauty and joy, Angel Phantom Quartz is invaluable in the home, especially when you surround it with other Angelic crystals such as Seraphinite, Angelite and Celestite.

There is some disagreement about Anhydrite versus Angelite in the metaphysical crystal community. Some see them as the same stone, while others see one as being related to the other. It is most commonly believed that Angelite is a form of Anhydrite that is only found in Peru and thus has deeper blue color to it. It is important to note that both Anhydrite and Angelite are made up of Calcium Sulfate so they are essentially the same mineral. It is a very soothing, peaceful, and uplifting stone, quite helpful during times of transition. Angelite (Anhydrite) is one of a group of higher vibrational crystals that can assist in smoothing the way for vibrational shifts, awareness and ascension. Others the clear the Throat, Third Eye, and Crown Chakras, and sends energy to the Soul Star chakra that lies 6 inches above the head. The higher vibrations sent to these Chakras allows for greater spiritual growth, enhanced intuition, and clearer communication. Angelite's ability to unblock the upper chakras clears the area to allow for the influx of higher vibrational information coming into the auric field, to be processed by the lower chakras. Angelite (Anhydrite) can be used during meditation to enhance the meditative state, and to clarify issues in one's current situations as they arise. By depositing inspiration from guides, guardians and/or angels into the chakras, Angelite allows them to be integrated into the whole, even after one is done working with the stone.

Apache Tears are a type of Obsidian, which appear rough and opaque at first glance, but are often translucent when held up to a light source (try it! It's pretty cool!) Apache Tears are created when hot lava is forced directly into the air and quickly solidifies before hitting the ground. Apache Tears received their name because it is said that grieving Apache women, who lost their loved ones in a raid, cried for a month and their tears fell to the ground, becoming a form of Black Obsidian.

Please Note: Although Citrine may not need clearing/cleansing as often as most crystals, we suggest clearing your Citrine as often as is needed, based on: The amount of use it gets (how hard your crystal is working for you) and The amount of energy that your crystal has been exposed to over a period of time. When clearing your crystals, always make sure that your intent is clearly stated, so the crystal knows that it is being given some time off and needs to recharge itself. For more information see this article: How to Clear/Clean Any of Your Crystals. Extremely popular metaphysically, Clear Quartz is the most versatile healing stone among all crystals.

As gifts from our Mother Earth, Clear Quartz comes to us with information for the higher self to assimilate in the process of one's spiritual growth. Clear Quartz is often used to cleanse, open, activate, and align all of the chakras. Since Clear Quartz absorbs energies very easily, it is important to clear these stones on a regular basis. In natural form, Clear Quartz Points radiate their energies outward, into the surrounding environment. Clear Quartz can be programmed with intention and kept in a central place to emit its helpful energies. Quartz Points naturally form in a 6-sided (hexagon) shape. The Sacred Geometry of a 6-sided Clear Quartz Point contributes to its ability to magnify energetic vibrations.

In very simple terms, in order to qualify a piece of resin as true Amber, a couple of things need to have happened. First, the molecules must have formed a polymer (a compound where two or more molecules have joined together) and secondly, the specimen must be at least 100,000 years old. Copal or Copalite is the term given to organic resins that are not old enough (i.e. younger than 100,000 years) to have fossilized and hardened sufficiently to become Amber. In Africa, Copal is found in the coastal countries of East and West Africa, but especially on Madagascar. This so-called Madagascar Amber is solidified resin of the Amber Pine but is only 1,000 - 10,000 years old. Most Amber from Columbia is less than 250 years old and in fact is not Amber at all, but the softer, younger version called Copal. In summary, here are a few facts about Amber and Copal: Amber is defined by geologists as fossilized tree resin (not tree sap). Sap is the fluid that circulates through a plant's vascular system. Sap to a tree, is like blood flowing through the veins of you or me. Resin, on the other hand, is a semi-solid amorphous (no crystal structure) organic substance that is secreted in pockets and canals through epithelial cells of the plant. It's the really sticky stuff that after time will fossilize and harden. Hardened tree resin that is less than 100,000 years old is called Copal. Copal becomes Amber when it has finished fossilizing. Copal can \"craze\" or crack on the surface as the volatile oils (or turpenes) evaporate. Copal will dissolve in acetone, but Amber will not. Copal from Madagascar and Columbia are 250 to 10,000 years old Amber from the Baltics and the Dominican Republic are 25 to 40 million years old.

Revelations discovered by Masaru Emoto in his work with the crystallization of water during the freezing process can be a good basis of study when working with the Enhydro Crystal. It is by the same notion that water is affected by energy, that crystals are and thus the Enhydro can double the amplification provided by the Quartz alone. This, combined with the information in the previous paragraph, makes the Enhydro an ideal crystal for manifestation work.

Metaphysical Legend states that there was once an advanced ancient civilization called Lemuria, similar to Atlantis but more spiritually developed and peaceful. As the end of their time on Earth was coming to an end, the Lemurians programmed these crystals to teach their messages of oneness and healing - messages that would be revealed when the energy on Earth was ready to receive them. The Lemurians then planted (or \"seeded\") the Lemurian Crystals, encoded with their ancient knowledge and wisdom, to be found centuries later by us. The legend continues to state that Lemurian Seed Crystals are planted in a grid pattern over the surface of the Earth and beyond, to other stars and dimensions. When you connect to a Lemurian Crystal and the energy it contains, you are also connecting to this grid of associated energies from the Earth, the stars, and beyond. Lemurian Crystals have a distinct appearance. Look carefully at a Lemurian Crystal and you will see horizontal striations or grooves, like \"bar codes,\" on one or more sides. Commonly, the sides of a Lemurian Crystal will have alternating striated and smooth faces. Lemurian Quartz Crystals are often found in the shape of a Laser wand, where the faces at the tip of a Lemurian Crystal are small and gently taper in size from base to tip. As opposed to Quartz that you program, Lemurian Quartz Crystals are a type of Quartz that you activate. As you meditate, rub your finger along the \"bar codes\" on the side of a Lemurian Quartz Crystal to activate and download Lemurian knowledge and connect to the Lemurian energy grid. NOTE: Natural Pink Lemurians were discovered in one pocket of the same mine in Minas Gerais, Brazil where the Lemurian Star Seed crystals were originally found. The pale pink coloring is due to a dusting of Hematite during the growth process. This coloring is within the layers of crystal growth. The \"New\" Pink Lemurians that are currently available also have a pink to orange pink coating of oxidized Hematite. However, these are more similar to Tangerine Quartz.
