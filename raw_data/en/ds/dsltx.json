Maglione, M.P.P. No. 14-E002- EF July 2014 Addendum T his evidence report summarizes scientific data on the safety of vaccines currently recommended in the United States. High strength of evidence was found for an association of measles-mumps- rubella (MMR) vaccine with febrile seizures in children under age 5 (Key Question 2c). On May 19, 2014 (w hile this evidence report was in press), an important study investigating the timing of MMR and MMRV (measles -mumps-rubella- varicella) vaccine and risk of febrile seizures 1 was published. We felt this information warranted inclusion in this review of the evidence. R esearchers conducted a self -controlled case series analysis using records from over 300,000 U.S. children from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). They found timing was unrelated to risk of post-vaccination seizure in infants, but found tha t delaying measles containing vaccines past 15 months results in a higher risk of seizures. A ccording to the study's authors, these adverse events are very rare, and occurred at the rate of about 1 per 100,000 person-days at seven months of age, compared to a high of five per 100,000 person-days at 17 months of age.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, National Vaccine Program , requested and provided funding for this report. The reports and assessments provide organizations with comprehensive, science- based information on common, costly medical conditions and new healt h care technologies and strategies. The EPCs systematically review the relevant scientific literature on topics assigned to them by AHRQ and conduct additional analyses when appropriate prior to developing their reports and assessments. To bring the broadest range of experts into the development of evidence reports and health technology assessments, AHRQ encourages the EPCs to form partnerships and enter into collaborations with other medical and research organizations. The EPCs work with these partner organizations to ensure that the evidence reports and technology assessments they produce will become building blocks for health care quality improvement projects throughout the Nation. The reports undergo peer review and public comment prior to their release as a final report. AHRQ expects that the EPC evidence reports and technology assessments will inform individual health plans, providers, and purchasers as well as the health care system as a whole by providing important information to help improve health c are quality.

Massachusetts General Hospital Boston, M A vi Safety of Vaccines Used for Routine Immunization in the United States Structured Abstra ct O bjectives . To conduct a systematic review of the literature on the safety of vaccines recommended for routine immunization of children, adolescents, and adults in the United States as of 2011. D ata s ources . We included placebo -controlled clinical trials and cohort studies comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We also included the following types of post- licensure analyses: case-control studies, self- controlled case series, and multivariate risk factor analyses. We conducted an electronic search of PubMed from inception through August 2013, and reviewed Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices statements, vaccine package inserts, and previously published reviews to identify studies. Scientific Information Packets were requested from vacc ine manufacturers. R eview m ethods . We reviewed the methodology of the 2011 I nstitute of Medicine (I OM) consensus report \" Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality \" and accepted their findings. We augmented their work with new studies and additional vaccines . For studies not included in the IOM report, we abstracted data on the presence or absence of adverse health outcomes, characteristics of patients, study design, and vaccine description, including brand, potency, dosage, timing, and formulation, where available. We excluded f ormulations not used in the U nited States . The McHarm instrument was used to evaluate the quality of adverse events collection and reporting in each study. We were unable to pool results; we rated the overall strength of ev idence (SOE) as high, m oderate, low, or insufficient by using guidance suggested by the A gency for Healthcare Research and Quality for its Effective Health Care Progra m. R esults . A total of 20,478 titles were identified; after title, abstract, and full-text review, 166 studies were accepted for abstraction. The vast majority of studies either did not investigate or could not identify risk factors for adverse events (AEs) associated with vaccination. Similarly, the severity of AEs was inconsistently reported, as was information that would make independent severity determination possible. SOE was high for the following associations in nonpregnant adults: seasonal influenza vaccine and arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, pain at injection site; 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine and Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS); and a lack of association between influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and cardiovascular events in the elderly. Risk of GBS wa s estimated at 1.6 excess cases per million persons vaccinated. S OE was high for the following associations in children and adolescents: m easles , mumps, r ubella (MMR) vaccine and febrile seizures in children under age 5; lack of association between MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders; and varicella vaccine and disseminated Oka strain varicella zoster virus with associated complications (i.e. , meningitis, encephalitis) in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies . There is moderate SOE that vaccines against rotavirus are associated with intussusception in children; risk was estimated as 1 to 5 cases per 100,000 vaccine doses, depending on brand. Moderate -strength evidence exists regarding human p apillomavirus vaccine vii and a lack of association with onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and GBS. Moderate- strength evidence shows no association between inactivated influenza vaccine and serious AEs in pregnant women. Evidence was insufficient to make conclusions regarding whether several routinely recommended vaccines are associated with serious conditions such as m ultiple s clerosis, transverse myelitis, and a cute disseminated e ncephalomyelitis . C onclusions . There is evidence that some vaccines are associated with serious adverse events; however, these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. Careful consideration should be given to the investigation of research gaps, including patient risk factors that may be associated with AEs ; however, important factors must be taken into account when determining whether studies are warranted, including the severity and frequency of the AE being studied and the challenges of conducting sufficiently powered studies when investigating rare events . viii Contents Executive Summary ................................................................................................................

Excluded Studies and Background Papers xi Executive Summary Background Vaccines are considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century for their role in eradicating smallpox and controlling polio, measles, rubella, and other infectious diseases in the United States.1 Despite their effectiveness in preventing and eradicating disease, substantial gaps in vaccine uptake persist. Vaccination rates for young children are high;2 however, vaccination rates remain well below established Healthy People 2020 targets for many vaccines recommended for adolescents, 3 adults,4 and pregnant women.5 In the United States, vacc ine guidelines are set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP). The number of routine immunizations recommended for children and adolescents, adults, and pregnant women has expanded considerably over the past 10 years. For example, since 2005, the routine adolescent vaccination schedule has grown to include the following vaccines at ages 11 or 12 years: meningococcal conjugate vaccine; tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap); (HPV); and influenza (one dose annually). T ables A-C display ACIP recommendations as of October 2011. These recommendations were in effect when this review began. Table A.

As the number of recommended immunizations has expanded across the population, so too have concerns about the safety of vaccines. Perhaps the most highly publicized safety concern of the last two decades was the proposed link between autism and the m easles, mumps, and r ubella (MMR) vaccine, first reported in 1998 in The Lancet by Dr. Andrew Wakefield.6 In 2010, The Lancet fully retracted the 1998 report,7 noting that elements of the research had been deliberately falsified. Although multiple large studies have confirmed the lack of association between MMR and autism, parental worries about the safety of vaccines persist. Other parental concerns about childhood vaccines include potential links to multiple sclerosis, sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, and diabetes. 8 Thus, vaccine safety is high on the Nation's public health agenda. Objectives The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reques ted an evidence report on the safety of vaccines recommended for routine immunization of adults (including pregnant women), children, and adolescents as of October 2011. This report, which represents the results of a comprehensive and systematic review of scientific evidence, describes potential associations between vaccines and adverse events (AEs) and will be used by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) to identify the gaps in evidence. The report was guided by the following K ey Q uestio ns (KQs): ES-2 KQ 1. What is the evidence that vaccines included in the 2011 immunization schedule recommended for U.S. adults9 are safe in the short term (within 30 to 42 days following immunization) or long term (>42 days after immunization)? a. What adverse events are collected in clinical studies (Phases I -IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? b.What AEs are reported in clinical studies (Phases I -IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? c.

Methods In 2011, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a consensus report titled \" Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality .\"12 That report evaluated the scientific evidence for event - vaccine relationships and covered the following vaccines on the 2011 recommended immunization schedules: varicella, influenza, h epatitis A, hepatitis B, HPV, MMR, meningococcal, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. We report the IOM findings and update them by identifying and evaluating studies published after the IOM searches. We also searched for studies of pneumococcal, rotavirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated poliovirus, and zoster vaccines; these were not included in the IOM report. We searched electronic d atabases such as Medline\u00ae for relevant studies; co mplete search terms are provided in Appendix A of the full report. Databases were searched from inception through August 2013 for the vaccines not covered by the IOM report; for the other vaccines, the searches dated fr om a year before the IOM search. We also reviewed ACIP statements, package inserts, and Scientific Information Packets requested fro m vaccine manufacturers by an AHRQ-funded Sc ientific Resource Center . Finally, we scanned review articles for relevan t references. The following study designs were included: Controlled c linical trial . Human subjects are assigned prospectively, usually through randomization, to receive an intervention (in this case, a vaccine) or an alternat ive intervention (another v accine) or pl acebo. Clinical t rials ar e used t o determine safety and efficacy.13 a Level of certainty was operationalized as the 95 -percent confidence interval surrounding the risk or odds estimate \u2014i.e., the statistical significan ce. ES-4 Cohort study . Cohort studies follow two or more similar groups that differ with respect to whether they r eceived a vaccine (the \"exposure\") to determine how/whether the vaccination affects rates of one or more AEs (the \"outcome\").13,14 Ca se-control study . Case-control studies compare people who have a disease or adverse event ( \"cases \") with people who do not have the disease or event (\" controls\") and look back retrospectively to compare exposure to vaccine in each group to determine the relationship between the vaccine and the disease/event.13,14 S elf-controlled case series (SCCS) . Only cases (individuals who experienced the AE) are included in the analysis. Each individual serves as his or her own control. Theanalysis inherently controls for covariates that remain stable within a person during thestudy period\u2014 for example, race and sex . SCCS s compare outcome event rates during times when a person is exposed (postvaccination) with those during times when the sameperson is unexposed (prevaccination) to calculate the relative incidence of AEs. 13,15 O ther designs . We included all active surveillance studies th at used regression to control for confounders and test multiple relationships simultaneously. We refer to these asmultivariate risk factor analyses. Data sources may include medical records, healthinsurance claims, and government registries. 13 S tudies t hat use passive surveillance, such as the U .S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,16 are crucial in identifying signals regarding AEs postlicensure. However, because by definition they do not consider the rate of such events in nonvaccinated populations, they are not designed to assess a statistical association between a vaccine and an adverse event, so such studies were excluded from this project. We also excluded studies of vaccine formulations never used or no longer available in the U nited States . Examples include whole- cell pertussis vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and PCV7 pneumococcal vaccine. The recent IOM report \"The Childhood Immunization Schedule and Safety: Stakeholder Concerns, Scientific Evidence, and Future Studies\" 17 makes recommendations f or future research on childhood vaccination schedules and cumulative effect, so this report focuses on assessing the association between AEs and specific vaccines rather than the cumulative effect of vaccines. Two researchers independently reviewed the tit les and abstracts identified. The union of their selections was retrieved. Two researchers also independently reviewed the full text of study reports and met to reach consensus regarding exclusion/inclusion. Disputes were settled by the lead investigators and team physician experts. Patient and study characteristics were abstracted by single researchers and confirmed by the principal investigator. If a study reported severity or if adequate information was provided for our investigators to categorize sever ity, we used the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events classification system 18 to characterize AEs. The definition of \"serious\" differs by AE type; each category of AE ( e.g., fever, headache) is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very mild and 5 being death due to the event. The McHarm instrument19 was used to evaluate the quality of the studies with regard to assessment of adverse events. Studies that reported timing and severity and that defined AEs using standard precise definitions were rated higher than those that did not. (Many studies provided data on a list of AEs but did not address severity.) Epidemiological studies that used medical records to ascertain vaccination and health outcomes were rated higher than those that relied on patient or parent report. We assessed the overall strength of evidence using guidance suggested by AHRQ for its Effective Health Care Program. 20 This method is based on one developed by the GRADE ES-5 (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Working Group21 and classifies the evidence according to the following criteria: High. High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate. Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low. Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Insufficient. Evidence either is unavailable or does not permit a conclusion. The evidence grade is based on four primary (required) domains and four optional domains. The requ ired domains are risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision, as described in the Methods section of the full report. The additional domains are dose response, plausible confounders that would decrease the observed effect, strength of association, and publication bias. It is important to note that the 2011 IOM report used different terminology; evidence was classified as either \"convincingly supports,\" \"favors acceptance,\" \"inadequate to accept or reject ,\" or \"favors rejection\" of a causal association. The IOM included mechanistic studies and individual case reports to assess the biological plausibility of AE s and considered this information in addition to any statistical association. For each vaccine discussed in the IOM report, we started with th e IOM findings and modified them, if needed, based on any additional evidence identified. If the IOM found that evidence \"convincingly supports \" an association, we rated the strength of evidence as \"high\" unless additional evidence was identified. Simila rly, if the IOM found evidence \"favors acceptance\" we started with by rating as \"moderate\" strength of evidence and evidence rated as \"inadequate to accept or reject\" was considered \"insufficient\" in our grading system. If new evidence was identified for vaccines evaluated by the IOM, ratings could be adjusted up or down ac cording to our assessment of the new studies. If the IOM found that evidence \"favors rejection\" of a causal relationship we choose between moderate and high based on our review of the IOM evidence plus any studies published after their search. Results As presented in Figure A, a total of 20,478 titles were identified through electronic literature searches; review of product inserts; review of F ood and Drug Administration, ACIP, and other Web sites; reference mining; and requests for Scientific Information Packets from drug manufacturers . Of those, 17,270 were excluded upon review of abstract or title, mostly due to lack of data on safety of vaccines. Other reasons for exclusion included use of vaccines not within the scope of this project ( e.g., not formulations available in the United States , recommended only for travel), publication in languages other than English, and study not conducted on humans. Five reports could not be obtained; based on their titles, we do not think this affected the project. Based on abstract screening, 3,210 articles were selected for full-text review. Of those, 392 were identified as relevant background/theoretical materials and set aside as potential references. A total of 2,650 other articles were excluded. The most common reason for exclusion was lack of suitable study design (1,549): individual case reports, nonsystematic reviews, and studies using passive surveillance were excluded. Many publications (458) discussed vaccines on the recommended schedule but did not report or assess AEs. ES-6 Studies using formulations never available or discontinued in the U nited States were excluded at full -text review (e.g. , H5N1 vaccine, vaccines with the squalene adjuvant AS O3, and BCG vaccine against tuberculosis ). Determining whether the potency or formulation was the one approved for clinical use in the U nited States was often difficult; the process involved comparing the potency, dosage, and ingredients listed on product materials and in F ood and Drug Administration filings with th e information reported in the study. Based on full -text screening, 16 6 studies were accepted for abstraction. These include 86 controlled trials or cohort studies directly comparing a group that received a vaccine with an unvaccinated group. ( Five of the 86 studies also reported a multivariate analysis .) We also abstracted 80 case-control studies, SCCSs , or multivariate risk factor analyses that met our inclusion criteria. These studies are in ad dition to those included in the 2011 IOM consensus report \" Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality ,\" which were not abstracted. ES-7 Figure A. Study/ literature flow diagram IOM = Institute of Medicine aFive studies also contributed multivariate risk factor analyses . ES-8 Table D displays a summary of our results. The second column displays the strength of evidence regarding statistical association of vaccines with AEs. Where we identified no additional studies on a vaccine, our conclusions are based entirely upon the 2011 IOM report. It is important to recognize that the strength of evidence refers t o the chances the vaccine is truly associated with a particular AE , rather than the rate of that AE or severity . Strength of evidence may be high for an AE that is extremely rare, very mild , or without long- term consequences. Further details on the scientific evidence behind the findings are available in the full report and its appendices. Importantly, the vast majority of studies did not report potential risk factors for AEs that were statistically associated with vaccination. Similarly, the severity of AEs was inconsistently reported, as was information that would make independent severity determination possible. ES-9 Table D.

We identified 2 additional trial s in adults. No AEs were associated with vaccine. Hepatitis A Vaccine Insufficient : Acute disse minated encephalomyelitis, transverse palsy, anaphylaxis, and autoimmune hepatitis Evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" any causal relationships with AEs the committee was tasked with investigating: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Bells' palsy, anaphylaxis, and autoimmune hepatitis. We identified 1 additional postlicensure study; there was no association of the vaccine with any AEs or onset of medical conditions. Hepatitis B Vaccine Insufficient : Optic neuritis, first demyelinating event, G BS, SLE, onset or exacerbation of vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and onset or exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis M oderate : No association with MS onset or exacerbation M oderate : Anaphylaxis in patients allergic to yeast Although no epidemiological studies were identified on anaphylaxis, mechanistic evidence \"favors acceptance\" of a causal relationship between the vaccine and anaphylaxis in yeast -sensitive individuals. E pidemiological studies of the following AEs in adults had evidence \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship: optic neuritis, first demyelinating event, G BS, SLE, on set or exacerbation of vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and onset or exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis. A 2002 IOM review on Hep B vaccine and demyelinating neurological disorders concluded that the evidence \"favors rejection \" of a causal relationship with incident MS or MS relapse. No additional studies met our inclusion criteria. ES-10 Table D.

However, in recent years, manufacturers have reduced the egg protein content. Many clinical trials reported that influenza vaccines are associated with arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, and pain in the short term in adults. These AEs were not considered serious; severity was graded mild to moderate. Odds of experiencing these events were 1.5 to 2 times higher in vaccinated patients than in unvaccinated people. Risk factors were not discussed in the t rials. A high- quality meta -analysis found an association between 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine and GBS in the 42 days postvaccination; results translate to about 1.6 excess cases per million vaccinated. P ostlicensure studies have found inconsistent evidence associating influenza vaccines with onset or exacerbation of MS in adults. P ostlicensure studies have found influenza vaccines are NOT associated with increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events in the elderly. Postlicensure studies have shown that influenza vaccines are NOT associated with increased risk of serious AEs in renal patients. ES-11 Table D.

MMR was NOT associated with onset of type 1 diabetes in adults in 1 large high-quality epidemiological study Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine High : No association with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events in the elderly Not covered . We found no placebo -controlled trials of the current formulation that reported AE data. (We found trials of the current formulation that reported pneumonia or mortality; these were considered efficacy outcomes .) Postlicensure studies of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine found vaccination was not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in older adults. Zoster Vaccine Moderate : Injection site reactions, allergic reactions , cellulitis possibly related to allergy Recommended for U .S. adults 60 years and older ; AEs specific to this age group were not covered. In some reports of clinical trials, AEs were reported only in categories such as \"injection-related adverse events,\" \"systematic adverse events,\" or \"serious adverse events .\" Vaccination was associated with injection site reactions. In postlicensure studies, vaccination was associated with cellulitis possibly related to allergy and allergic reactions such as redness and swelling 1 to 7 days postvaccination. These mild AEs occurred in less than 1% of patients and were more likely in the younger (aged 50 -59) vaccinees. ES-12 Table D.

We found no additional studies that met our inclusion criteria. Hepatitis B Vaccine Insufficien t: Food allergy Moderate : No association with MS Although no epidemiological studies were identified by the IOM, mechanistic evidence \" favored acceptance\" of a causal relationship between the vaccine and anaphylaxis in yeast -sensitive individuals. The IOM found evidence \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship with any other AEs. A 2002 IOM report \"favors rejection\" of a causal relationship with MS onset or exacerbation. Hep B vaccine in the first 6 months of life was associated with elevated total IgE in a postlicensure study of children with a family history of food allergy, but not with clinical allergy . Hib Vaccine Moderate : No association with serious A Es in short term Not covered . No serious AEs were associated in 3 high-quality clinical trials. ES-13 Table D.

E vidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject \" causal relationships between HPV vaccines and the following: ADEM, hypercoagulable states. A large postlicensure study found HPV vaccine was not associated with onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or type 1 diabetes. This study reported an IRR of 1.29 (95% CI , 1.08 to 1.56) of onset of Has himoto's disease. However, investigation of a temporal relationship and biological plausibility revealed no consistent evidence of a safety signal. A large postlicensure study found HPV vaccine was NOT associated with G BS, seizures, stroke, syncope, or ve nous thromboembolism. Several clinical trials found HPV vaccination associated with short -term severe pain at injection site. Trials also found vaccine associated with fever, headache, nausea, and stomach ache. A secondary analysis including only Black women who became pregnant within 3 to 4 years of receiving HPV vaccine in 2 trials reported a higher rate of spontaneous abortion in vaccinated subjects. Inactivated Polio Vaccine Insufficient : Food allergy Not covered . One postlicensure study reported a ssociation between polio vaccine in newborns and sensitivity to food allergens. ES-14 Table D.

The influenza vaccine is administered in 2 forms: a live attenuated form, administered intranasally, and an inactivated form, administered intramuscularly. E vidence was \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship in the pediatric population between seasonal influenza vaccines and the following: seizures , ADEM, and transverse myelitis. E vidence was to accept or reject\" a causal relationship between LAIV and asthma exacerbation or reactive airway disease episodes. In postlicensure studies, s easonal influenza vaccines were NOT associated with any serious adverse events in the short term in children with malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, or urea cycle disorders , or children who had received organ transplant s. B oth seasonal influenza vaccines and monovalent H1N1 vaccine were associated with mild gastrointestinal disorders, such as vomiting and diarrhea, in children in the short term in several large postlicensure studies. One large study found that younger vaccinated children (aged 5 to 8 years) were more likely to experience these symptoms than older vaccinated children (aged 9 to 17 years). (Children under 5 years of age were not included in that study). B oth live and inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines were associated with influenza -like symptoms in children in the short term in multiple studies, while not associated in others. A large U .S. postlicensure study of children under age 5 years found TIV associated with febrile seizures. Risk was increased if PCV13 was administered concomitantly . ES-15 Table D.

Vaccination was associated with thrombocytopenic purpura in the short term. MMR vaccination was associated with increased emergency department visits within 2 weeks; this is ind irect support of the IOM's findings that MMR vaccine is associated with febrile seizures. Meningococcal Vaccines (MCV4, MPSV) Moderate : Anaphylaxis Encephalitis, encephalopathy, \"convincingly supports\" a causal relationship with anaphylaxis in children who may be allergic to ingredients. Evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" causal relationships between meningococcal and the encephalopathy, ADEM, transverse myelitis, MS, G BS, headache. Two new trials of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines found no association with any AEs assessed. ES-16 Table D. Summary: safety of vaccines used for routine immunization of adults ( including pregnant women) and children (continued) Vaccine EPC Conclusions and Strength o f Evidence IOM Findings Additional Findings From EPC Miscellaneous and Combination Vaccines Moderate : DTaP -IPV-Hib vaccination with febrile seizures Hi gh: No association of childhood leukemia with MMR, DTaP, Td, Hib, Hep B, and polio vaccines M oderate : Hepatitis A, MMR, and varicella vaccine with purpura Not covered . Association of DTa P-IPV-Hib vaccination with febrile seizures in children was found in a very large high-quality postlicensure study. Rate for first dose was estimated as 5.5 cases per 100,000 person/days. Rate for second dose was estimated as 5.7 cases per 100,000 person/days. M ultiple large epidemiological studies have assessed MMR, DTaP, Td, Hib, Hep B, and polio vaccine and have found no association with childhood leukemia. In a large postlicensure study of over 1.8 million vaccine recipients, purpura was associated w ith vaccination against h epatitis A in children aged 7 to 17 years, vaccination against varicella in children aged 11 to 17, and MMR in children from 12 to 19 months of age. These results were based on 1 or 2 cases per vaccine type/age group. According to the authors most cases were mild and acute. Pneumococcal Conjugate (PCV13) Moderate : Febrile seizures Not covered. A recent study using the U .S. Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) found an association with febrile seizures. Estimated rate for 16 -month- old patients is 13.7 cases per 100,000 doses for PCV13 without concomitant TIV and 44.9 per 100,000 doses for concomitant TIV and PCV13 . ES-17 Table D. Summary: safety of vaccines used for routine immunization of adults ( including pregnant women) and children (continued) Vaccine EPC Conclusions and Strength o f Evidence IOM Findings Additional Findings From EPC Rotavirus Vaccines: RotaTeq and Rotarix Moderate : Intussusception Not covered. In clinical trials, there was no association between either of the 2 currently available vaccines (RotaTeq and Rotarix) and any serious AEs, including intussusception, in the long or short term. A high- quality epidemiological study in Australia found RotaTeq was associated with intussusception 1 to 21 days following the first of 3 required doses in infants 1 to 3 months of age. Two case- control studies conducted in Latin America found an association of Rotarix with intussusception in children following the first of 2 required doses. Although 1 U.S. epidemiological study found no association, a recent analysis of the U .S. Post-Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) program found both RotaTeq and Rotarix associated with intussusception in the short term. Estimated rate was 1.1 to 1.5 c ases per 100,000 doses of RotaTeq and 5.1 cases per 100,000 doses of Rotarix. Varicella Vaccine High : Anaphylaxis ; disseminated Oka VZV without other organ involvement ; disseminated Oka VZV with subsequent infection resulting in pneumonia, meningitis, or hepatitis in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies ; vaccine strain viral reactivation without other organ involvement ; vaccine strain viral reactivation with subsequent infection resulting in meningitis or encephalitis Evidence \"convincingly sup ports\" causal relationships between varicella virus vaccine and the following: disseminated Oka VZV without other organ involvement ; disseminated Oka VZV with subsequent infection resulting in pneumonia, meningitis, or hepatitis in individuals with demonst rated immunodeficiencies ; vaccine strain viral reactivation without other organ involvement ; vaccine strain viral reactivation with subsequent infection resulting in meningitis or encephalitis ; and anaphylaxis. T he evidence is \"inadequate to accept or rej ect\" a causal relationship between the vaccine and seizures, ADEM, transverse myelitis, G BS, small fiber neuropathy, onset or exacerbation of arthropathy, and thrombocytopenia. We identified 1 small trial in children with SLE; the trial reported no association with AEs. ES-18 Table D.

Both monovalent H1N1 vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccine (inactivated) containing H1N1 strains were not associated with serious adverse events in pregnant women or their offspring in multiple trials and postlicensure studies.

We conducted an extensive literature search for clinical trials and observational studies with strong study designs and analysis methods: cohort studies comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, case -control studies, self -controlled case series, and designs u sing multivariate risk factor analyses. Our results support most findings of the IOM report, add conclusions on some adverse events for which new evidence was identified, and include findings on additional vaccines. Our findings may allay some patient, caregiver, and health care provider concerns. Strength of evidence is high that vaccines against pneumonia and influenza are not associated with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events in the elderly; many studies reported a decreased risk for vaccinated patients. Strength of evidence is high that MMR vaccine is not associated with the onset of autism in children; this conclusion supports findings of all previous reviews on the topic. There is moderate- stren gth evidence that HPV vaccine is not associated with appendicitis, stroke, seizures, syncope, venous thromboembolism, onset of juvenile arthritis, or onset of t ype 1 diabetes and high- strength evidence that MMR, DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis), Td (tetanus -diphtheria) , Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type B) , and hepatitis B vaccines are not associated with childhood leukemia. Evidence of association with vaccines was found for several serious AEs ; however, these events were extremely rare. Absolute risk is extremely rare. Strength of evidence is high that 2009 monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine was associated with Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), but results translate to about 1.6 additional cases per million persons vaccinated. Since 2010, U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines have contained an H1N1 strain. No association with GBS has been found for inactivated seasonal vaccine (TIV). Strength of evidence is moderate for association of vaccines against rotavirus with intussusception. Although one U.S. epidemi ological study found no association, a recent analysis of the U.S. Post-Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) program 22 found both RotaTeq and Rotarix associated with intuss usception in the short term. Estimated rate was 1.1 to 1.5 cases per 100,000 doses of RotaTeq and 5.1 cases per 100,000 doses of Rotarix. Evidence is insufficient to make conclusions regarding whether several routinely recommended vaccines are associated with serious conditions much as m ultiple s clerosis (MS), transverse myelitis, and a cute disseminated e ncephalomyelitis (ADEM). This leaves an important research gap. We identified a recent secondary analysis of data on Black women who participated in two placebo -controlled trials of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil) con ducted in several countries. In women who became pregnant in the 4 years following the trial, there was a significantly higher rate of spontaneous abortion for women who were vaccinated.23 The authors state that the rate of \"fetal loss\" was statistically similar for vaccinees and nonvaccinees; however, \"fetal loss\" included planned abortion. In the vaccine group, 19 of 307 pregnancies resulted in spontaneous abortion, compared with 7 of 393 pregnancies in the control group. Databases such as the Vaccine Safety Datalink ( VSD) could be used to further investigate this signal in a much larger population. Conclusions must be viewed in light of the important caveats below. ES-20 Literature search procedures were extensive; however, some unpublished trial results may not have been identified. An independent Scientific Resource Center under contract with AHRQ requested Scientific Information Packets from vaccine manufacturers . (The research team was prohibited from contacting manufacturers directly.) Only two companies responded. We included trials of the formulations currently on the market in the U nited States . We tried to exclude Phase II studies that used dosages that were never licensed and/or formulations available only in foreign countries. Some studies reported the potency or formulation of the vaccines in a different manner or unit than reported in the product materials. L arge epidemiological studies sometimes included any available formulation of vaccines against a particular disease and did not stratify results by dosage or formulation. For example, the relationship between the \"seasonal influenza vaccine\" and an AE could be studied over several years of data without addressing the changes in formulation over the seasons. Our findings are based on only the most rigorous study designs to assess potential statistical associations; however, these designs have limitations that must be considered. Controlled trials often have insufficient sample size to identify very rare AEs and do not have extended followup to ident ify long -term sequelae. In addition, trials may purposely exclude subjects such as the elderly, pregnant women, and people with medical conditions who could be more susceptible to AEs. For this reason, any comprehensive review of vaccine safety also includes postlicensure studies, but these are not without limitations. Pe ople who avoid vaccinations (whether purposely or not) may differ from those who receive vaccinations in terms of race, sex , age, socioeconomic status , and preexisting medical conditions, a nd these differences may be associated with health outcomes. Observational studies attempt to control for such potential confounders by using matched cohorts or multivariate regression analysis; still, some factors such as environmental exposures may be unmeasured or challenging to adequately control for. The self- controlled case series was developed specifically to assess the safety of vaccines; this method eliminates confounding by all time-independent variables by using cases as their own controls and predefined \"time windows\" before and after vaccination. This design has been used to study purpura, febrile seizures, intussusception, and autism in children. The SCCS assumption of no temporal shifts is difficult to justify in very young children, as any patient characteristics that change with time will not be adequately controlled for. There may be important AE signals not identified in this report that warrant future research. Passive surveillance systems such as the U .S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting S ystem 16 are crucial in identifying signals regarding AEs postlicensure, but they are not designed to assess a statistical association so were excluded from this project. The research gaps below are based on the study designs that met our inclusion criteria . Research Gaps Adults There was insufficient evidence to determine whether influenza vaccines are associated with onset or exacerbation of MS. The unknown association regarding MS and GBS and vaccines for MMR and hepatitis A also presents a research gap; the IOM found evidence inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship. As these medical conditions are extremely rare, \"insufficient\" evidence determination may be unavoidable despite additional research. ES-21 A recent meta-analysis on 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine provided high- strength evidence of association with G BS in adults. As the vaccine is associated with only 1.6 excess cases per million vaccinated, it will be very difficult to assess risk factors. Some published vaccine trials were not specific in reporting AEs. Broad categories such as \"injection -related adverse events,\" \"systemic adverse events,\" \"one or more adverse events ,\" or \"serious adverse events\" were reported rather than specific AE s. In addition, many studies reported on a list of pre defined AEs but did not rate the severity or provide enough information for our investigators to determine severity. Future studies of vaccines should report results with more granularity. Children and Adolescents There is insufficient evidence to determin e any potential association between trivalent inactivated vaccine and asthma exacerbation, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and transverse myelitis. Febrile seizures were associated with MMR, influenza, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Younger age was associated with increased risk in several studies. Large- scale epidemiological studies could determine other patient risk factors. A large U.S. postlicensure study found associations between both Rotarix and RotaTeq and intussusception in the short term following vaccination; patient risk factors were not reported. Strong evidence for a lack of association of HPV vaccines with several serious medical conditions (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, GBS) has been found in large postlicensure studies. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding other serious conditions such as MS, c hronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and pancreatitis. Importantly, a recent analysis of long-term followup data from Black women enrolled in two trials of Gardasil showed a possible increased risk of miscarriage of pregnancies within 4 years of vaccination. Large datasets from U.S. m anaged c are organizations include medical records on both immunization and pregnancy, so they could be used to investigate any potential association. There is insufficient evidence to determine the possible association, if any, between vaccines such as DTaP, meningococcal vaccine, and varicella vaccine and the onset of nervous system conditions such as ADEM, transverse myelitis, MS, and GBS. Large- scale epidemiological studies could provide additional data; however, as these medical conditions are extremely rare, it may not be possible to reach a level of evidence beyond \"insufficient.\" Pregnant Women There is moderate strength of evidence that inactivated influenza vaccine is not associated with serious adverse events in pregnant women or their offspring. Given the 2013 recommendation to administer the Tdap vaccine during every pregnancy, passive surveillance systems should be monitored regularly for AEs in this population. A reliable system of tracking when in pregnancy the vaccine was given is extremely important. In addition, in any study of vaccines and pregnancy, followup of newborns should be sufficiently long, as not all adverse effects may be apparent immediately after birth. The need for large numbers of pregnant exposures is particularly important given the relative ly low frequency of some birth defects and the need to defin e which are associated with vaccine. In addition, little is known about the patient factors that may influence the effect of the vaccine. Another unknown is how vaccination in pregnancy may affect the newborn's immune system/reaction to newborn ES-22 vaccinations. The Vaccines and Medications in Pregnancy Surveillance System (VAMPSS) has components to monitor safety of maternally administered vaccines and their effect on recipients and their offspring. VAMPSS is a collaboration of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology; the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS) Research Center at the University of California San Diego ; and the Slone Epidemiology Center (SEC) at Boston University. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contracted VAMPSS to perform safety monitoring of H1N1 influenza vaccine administered during the 2009 pandemic. As this report was being finalized, a VAMPSS study on the safety of H1N1 was released; 24,25 the au thors found no meaningful evidence of increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or low birth weight for gestational age. E xisting F ederal systems such as the VSD and/or PRISM could potentially be used as well. General Methodological Observations Advanced health information technology systems that contain both vaccination and health outcome records can be used to conduct high-quality epidemiological studies. In the United States , the VSD contains data obtained through such systems at nine very larg e managed care organizations. The FDA's Mini- Sentinel program PRISM system also conducts active surveillance using electronic health care databases from managed care organizations. Nations with single -payer health care systems often have electronic registries that allow very large epidemiological studies of entire populations. Studies using these databases have greater validity than studies that rely on surveys that use patient/parent recall for ascertainment of vaccination or health outcome. Not only are such surveys subject to recall bias, but there may be no way of determining the formulation or brand of vaccination. Observational studies should be powered adequately to determine risk factors such as demographic and health characteristics of patients. An alysis should be stratified by formulation and brand of vaccine, if possible. This is especially true for influenza vaccine, which differs from season to season. Independent abstraction and systematic reassessment of the studies included in the I OM consens us report \" Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality \" may be a useful future endeavor. Odds ratios could be calculated for each event reported in each trial and postlicensure study and, where appropriate, meta- analysis conducted to calculate over all odds ratios for each AE and each vaccine type. If the additional studies were abstracted, the totality of data abstracted could be statistically analyzed to explore additional hypotheses and issues beyond the scope of the current report.

PMID: 24016809. ES-25 Introduction Background Vaccines are considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century for their role in eradicating smallpox and controlling polio, measles, rubella, and other infectious diseases in the United States.1 Despite their effectiveness in preventing and eradicating disease, substantial g aps in vaccine uptake exist. Vaccination rates for young children are high;2 however, vaccination rates remain well below established Healthy People 2020 targets for many vaccines recommended for adolescents, 3 adults,4 and pregnant women.5 Increasing vaccination rates remains critically important, as vaccine -preventable diseases such as influenza, pertussis, and human papillomavirus (HPV)- associated cervical cancer continue to take a heavy toll despite the widespread availability of effective vaccines. The health and productivity costs of influenza infection alone in adults are have been estimated to be as high as $87 billion per year. 6 The recent pertussis outbreaks in California, Washington, Minnesota, and Wisconsin highlight the importance of protecting vulnerable infants by vaccinating their pregnant mothers, caregivers, and other contacts. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection. HPV-16 and HPV-18\u2014 two strains included in the HPV vaccine \u2014are thought to be responsible for approximately 70 percent of incident cervical cancer. Nationally, in 2005, there were nearly 12,000 new cases of cervical cancer reported, with 4,000 cervical cancer -related deaths. 7 Despite the availability of an HPV vaccine that could prevent a substantial proportion of these cases of cervical cancer, completion of the three-dose series was only 34.8 percent among adolescent females in 2011. 3 The shortfall in vaccination coverage rates occurs in the context of a rapidly changing immunization schedule. Routine immunizatio ns recommended as of October, 2011 for children (Table 1), adolescents (Table 1), adults (Table 2), and pregnant women (Table 3) are presented below. Since 2005, the routine adolescent vaccination schedule has grown to include these vaccines at ages 11 or 12 years: meningococcal conjugate vaccine; tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap); HPV; and influenza (one dose annually). In 2013, pregnant women were advised to receive Tdap during every pregnancy to protect their newborns from pertussis regardless of prior history of receiving Tdap. 8 1 Table 1.

Vaccin e development and commercialization are complex processes, and the regulatory review process is overseen by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research of the FDA. 9 Vaccines are unique when compared with many other medications because they are adminis tered to a large population of mostly young healthy people to prevent rather than treat disease. Vaccines must meet stringent criteria for safety, efficacy, and potency. Preclinical studies are conducted in the early stages of vaccine development and are m eant to be sufficient to rule out overt toxicity and identify potential toxic effects that might occur during the clinical trial. Once a vaccine is ready for clinical evaluation, an Investigational New Drug application must be submitted so the FDA can moni tor the safety of clinical trial subjects and ensure that the study design is appropriate to assess the vaccine's effectiveness and safety. The clinical evaluation of a vaccine typically consists of three phases.9 Phase I studies \u2014 which typically enroll 20 to 80 subjects \u2014are designed to evaluate vaccine safety and tolerability and to generate preliminary immunogenicity data. Phase II studies evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine and provide preliminary estimates on the rates of common adverse events, typically enrolling several hundred subjects. Phase III trials provide the information on a vaccine's safety and efficacy that is required to support licensure. After a vaccine is licensed and in use, multiple systems are in place to ensure ongoing assessmen ts of safety, 10 including post licensure safety surveillance conducted by sponsors a s postmarketing commitments or requirements to the FDA ,11 the FDA's Post -Licensure Rapid Immunization Monitoring (PRISM) system ,12-14 FDA surveillance using databases of Federal Partners such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ,15 the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) co-administered by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ,16 CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink ,17 and CDC's Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment project .18 Despite the stringent regulation and evaluation of vaccines, public concerns about vaccine safety continue to persist. Perhaps the most highly publicized safety concern of the last two decades has been the alleged link between autism and the MMR vaccine, first reported in The Lancet by Dr. Andrew Wakefield. 19 Vaccination rates for measles, mumps, and rubella plummeted in the United Kingdom leading to measles outbreaks20 and concern about vaccines and a utism spread globally. In 2010, The Lancet fully retracted the 1998 publication,21 noting that elements of the manuscript had been deliberately falsified. Subsequently, Dr. Wakefield was barred from practicing medicine in the United Kingdom. Although multiple large studies have confirmed the lack of association between MMR and autism, parental worries about the safety of the vaccine persist. In addition to autism, other parental concerns about childhood vaccines include possible links to multiple sclerosis, sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, and diabetes. 22 Though no systematic data exist on the safety concerns of pregnant women, this is likely to be an active focus given the relatively recent introduction of the recommendation to administer the Tdap vacc ine during pregnancy. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) requested an evidence report on the safety of vaccines used for routine immunization of adults (including pregnant women), children, and adolescents that will, based on a comprehe nsive and systematic review of the scientific literature, describe associations between vaccines and adverse events (AEs) and help to outline the gaps in evidence. This report focuses on the adverse events (AEs) potentially 3 associated with vaccines as opposed to the benefits, as all of these vaccines are already recommended. Our work expands upon the consensus report \" Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality, \" published by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in late 2011. That report evaluated the scientific evidence for event -vaccine relationships and covered many vaccines included in the 2011 U.S. recommended immunization schedules (varicella, influenza, H epatitis A, Hepatitis B, HPV, MMR, meningococcal, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis). Our work builds upon the IOM report in a number of important ways. In addition to vaccines covered by the IOM report, our systematic review covers pneumococcal, rotavirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated poliovirus, and zoster vaccines. We report the 2011 IOM conclusions, update the literature with more recent studies, and conduct original searches for the recommended vaccines that were not included; we provide an assessment of AEs reported. 4 Methods Original Proposed Key Questions AHRQ provided following original K ey Questions (KQs) . Not all questions were answerable through a systematic review of the published research; we discuss important research gaps later in this report. KQ 1.

Technical Expert Panel For each Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) systematic review, a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) is assembled to provide clinical expertise and context. A distinguished group of scientists and cli nicians were invited to participate in the TEP for this report. Potential members submitted conflict of interest disclosure forms; any current or prior relationship with a vaccine manufacturer was grounds for disqualification per AHRQ. A list of members is included in the front matter. TEP conference calls were held on June 18, June 19, and July 19, 2012; t hey were attended by project staff and Task Order Officers (TOO) from AHRQ and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health ( OASH ). The TEP informed staff of recent developments in the field, gave input on which AEs and issues were most important, and emphasized we should only include studies which use the same dosage and formulation as currently used in the U.S . Vaccines with adjuvants not currently used in the U.S. (for example, ASO3) or strengths that were never licensed in the U.S. (for example, those used in Phase II studies that did not advance to Phase III) a Level of certainty was operationalized as the 95 -percent confidence interval surrounding the risk or odds estimate \u2014i.e., the statistical significance. 6 should be excluded. They also advised that, given resource limitations, minor AEs such a s crying and injection site redness need not be discussed in the report. Panel members were invited to review the draft version of this report and provide feedback. Analytic Framework The analytic framework for the project is displayed in F igure 1. Vaccinations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are listed in the l arge oval. Various subsets are administered annually to children, adolescents, and adults, including pregnant women (next circle), according to a schedule develop ed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Both patient factors (i.e., age, pre-existing conditions) and vaccine factors (i.e., formulation, dosage, and timing) may be risk factors for potential AEs. Figure 1. Analytic framework Hep A = hepatitis A; Hep B = hepatitis B; MMR = m easles, mumps, rubella Literature Search The following databases were searched to identify relevant studies: DARE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBAS E, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and TOXFILE. The Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) report, ACIP statements, and vaccine package inserts were reviewed. Review articles were mined for references. Our search strategy built upon the recent IOM report for the eight vaccines contained therein. Using the IOM keyword search strategy, we updated their sea rches on varicella, influenza, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B , HPV, MMR, meningococcal, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccines to identify more recently published studies. The following structure was used in the IOM keyword search strategy: \"vaccine term\" AND \"health term,\" where vaccine terms include the technical vaccine name, general descriptions of the vaccine of interest (e.g., rotavirus AND 7 vaccine), or manufacturer names ; health terms include a list of AEs potentially associated with the vaccine. We also added more general AE keywords to the list of health terms such as \"safe\" or \"safety,\" \"side effect\" or \"harm.\" We searched from a year before the publication of the IOM report through August, 2013. Using this approach, we developed new search strategies for the vaccines not originally included in the IOM report: pneumococcal, rotavirus, H. influenzae type b, inactivated poliovirus, and zoster. We searched each of the databas es mentioned above from their inception to August, 2013. Searches were based on AEs reported in systems such as the V accine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the FDA's Mini- Sentinel P rogram. The Technical E xpert Panel (TEP) reviewed the draft list of AEs and suggested additional AEs of interest. Appendix A contains t he detailed search strategy and a list of AEs included in the searches. Article Review Two researchers independently reviewed the titles and abstracts identified . The union of their selections was retrieved. Two r esearchers also independently reviewed the full text of study reports, entered data into an electronic form, and me t to reach consensus on any conflicts regarding exclusion/inclusion. Disputes were settled by the lead investigators and team physician experts. Data were entered directly by researchers into Distiller SR software (Evidence Partners Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada),26 which is designed specifically for systematic reviews and meta - analys es, and exported to SAS ( SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) for analysis. Study Inclusion We include d the fo llowing study designs: Controlled clinical trial\u2014A study where human subjects are assigned prospectively, usually through randomization, to rec eive an intervention (in this case a vaccine) or an alternate intervention (another vaccine) or placebo. Clinical trials are used to determine safety and efficacy.27 C ohort study \u2014Follows two or more groups who differ with respect to whether they received a vaccine (the \"exposure\") , over time to determine how/whether the vaccination affects rates of one or more adverse events (the \"outcome\").27,28 Ca se-control study \u2014A study that compares persons who have a disease or adverse event (AE) (cases) with persons w ho do not have the disease or AE (the \"outcome\") , and looks back retrospectively to compare exposure to vaccine in each group to determine therelationship between the vaccine and the disease / AE. 27,28 S elf-controlled case series (SCCS) \u2014Only cases (individuals who experienced the AEs ) are included in the analysis. With SCCS, each individual serves as their own control. Theanalysis inherently controls for covariates that remain stable within a person during the study period; for example, race and gender. S CCS compares outcome event rates during times when a person is exposed (post-vaccination) with those during times wh en the same person is unexposed (pre- vaccination) to calculate the relative incidence of AEs. 27,29 O ther designs \u2014We included all active surveillance studies that used regression to control for confounders and test multiple relationships simultaneously . We refer to these 8 as multivariate risk factor analyses. Data sources may include medical records, health insurance claims, and government regis tries.27 Studies using passive surveillance such as the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)16 are crucial in identifying signals regarding adverse events post -licensure. However, because by definition they do not consider the rate of such events in non-vaccinated populations, they are not designed to assess a statistical association between a vaccine and an adverse event, so they were excluded from this project. We also excluded s tudies of vaccines not on the current U.S. recommended schedules . These include brands and f ormulations never available in the United S tates and or no longer used. Examples include whole cell pertussis vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and PCV7 pneumococcal vaccine. The following publication types/studies were excluded : Letters Editorials Individual case reports Animal studies Mechanistic/in vitro studies Conference abstracts Vaccine efficacy studies that did not report the presence or absence of AEs Observational studies which use passive surveillance for AEs Non-Englis h-language studies. ( Given the focus of this review and the corresponding literature base, we concluded the risk of language bias to be low and that it was therebyacceptable to limit the inclusion criteria to English studies only .) Studies of vaccines not on the U.S.-recommended schedules, includingbrands/formulations never available in the United S tates, or no longer used. Data Abstraction and Synthesis of Results Based on our experience conducting systematic review s of the evidence on other health care interventions, we developed a structured approach to assessing AEs instead of relying on a random post hoc grouping. We used a tested and standardized form to extract AEs. If a study reported severity, or if adequate information was provided for our inves tigators to categorize severity, we used the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) classification system 30 to characterize AEs. Serious adverse events (SAE) were defined and coded. The definition of \"serious\" differs by AE type; each category of AE (i.e. fever, headache) is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very mild and 5 being death due to the event. Clinical trials and cohort comparisons were abstracted using an electronic form which contained items for sample size, population description (age, gender, race/ethnicity, country, any co-morbidities), items on study quality (described below), vaccine description (name, manufacturer, dosage, formulation, adjuvants, preservatives, timing, mode of administration), and AEs (exact descript ion, severity, timing, number) for each group. Odds ratios of AEs for vaccination and comparison arms were computed for each study, along with the 95% confidence interval. Studies were included for analysis if the total number of people in each group and the number of people with events in each group were reported. Occasionally, this information was missing, or the number of AEs and number of doses (rather than number of persons) was provided. Since AEs are generally rare, conditional p ooling using exact methods provided a fixed effects estimate of the odds ratio. Analyses were conducted with StatXact Procs for 9 SAS.31 Subgroup analyses are narrative in order to be able to make comparisons between study designs and other variables in the heterogeneous datase t. The case-control, self- controlled case series, and multivariate risk factor analyses were abstracted onto a different electronic form containing similar items; however, the statistical findings were abstracted directly. These types of studies generally do not include enough information for researchers to re -calculate the statistics independently, as they are not simple comparisons of a vaccinated group with an unvaccinated group. To assess the reliability and validity of the findings, we abstracted how vaccination status and health outcomes were ascertained (self -report, national registry, parent interview, medical record, etc.); potential sources of bias due to selection, participation, attrition, and non-response of subjects; amount of missing data; fu nding source; and how potential confounders were handled. The abstraction forms are presented in Appendix B. We created detailed evidence tables displaying critical data for each included study. Multiple publications of the same study are noted and counted ( extracted, assessed for quality, and analyzed) as one study to ensure that the same participants do not enter the analyses multiple times. Multiple publications were defined by the investigated patients. Assessment of Methodological Quality For controlled trials and cohort comparisons, we used a quality- rating instrument Santaguida and colleagues (2008)32 developed for evaluating studies reporting adverse events. Called McHarm, the tool was developed from quality rating items generated by a review of the literature on harms and from previous quality assessment instruments. Scores range from 0 to 15; a copy of the instrument and scoring instructions are included in Appendix B. McHarm was tested for reliability and face, construct, and criterion validity and includes important factors such as: Were AEs predefined using standard, precise definitions? Was the mode of harms collection active (participants are asked about the occurrence of specific AEs ) or passive (participants are not specifically asked about or tested for the occurrence of AEs; patient reports of AEs are made on their own initiative)? Did the study specify who collected the AE data? Did the study specify the timing of AE s? Was the number of participants who withdrew or were lost to follow up reported? Grading the Evidence for Each Key Question We assess the overall strength of evidence by using guidance suggested by AHRQ for its Effective Health Care Program.33 This method is based on one developed by the GRADE Working Group34 and classifies the grade of evidence according to the following criteria: High. High confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate. Moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low. Low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect. Further research is likely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Insufficient. Evidence either is unavailable or does not permit a conclusion. 10 The evidence grade is based on four primary (required) domains and four optional domains. The required domains are risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision, as described in Table 4 below. The additional domains are dose-response, plausible confounders that would decrease the observed effect, strength of as sociation, and publication bias. It is important to note that the 2011 IOM report used different terminology; evidence was classified as either \"convincingly supports,\" \"favors acceptance,\" inadequate to accept or reject\" or \"favors rejection\" of a causal association. They included mechanistic studies and individual case reports to assess th e biological plausibility of AE and considered this in addition to any statistical association . For each vaccine discussed in the IOM report, we started with the IOM findings and modified them, if needed, based on any additional evide nce identified. For example, if the IOM found that evidence \"convincingly supports\" an association, we rated the strength of evidence as \"high\" unless additional evidence was identified. Similarly, if the IOM found evidence \"favors acceptance\" we started with by rating as \"moderate\" strength of evidence and evidence rated as \"inadequate to accept or reject\" was considered \"insufficient\" in our grading system. If new evidence was identified for vaccines evaluated by the IOM, ratings could be adjusted up or down according to our assessment of the new studies. If the IOM found that evidence \"favors rejection\" of a causal relationship we choose between moderate and high based on our review of the IOM evidence plus any studies published after their search. T able 4. Grading the strength of a body of evidence: required domains and their definitions Domain Definition and Elements Score and Application Risk of Bias Risk of bias is the degree to which the included studies for a given outcome or comparison have a high likelihood of adequate protection against bias (i.e., good internal validity), assessed through two main elements: S tudy design (e.g., RCTs or observational studies) Aggregate quality of the studies under consideration Information for this determination comes from the rating of quality (good/fair/poor) done for individual studies . Use one of three levels of aggregate risk of bias: Low risk of biasMedium risk of bias High risk of bias 11 Table 4. Grading the strength of a body of e vidence: required domains and their definitions (continued) Domain Definition and Elements Score and Application Consistency The principal definition of consistency is the degree to which reported effect sizes from included studies appear to have the same direction of effect. This can be assessed through two main elements: Effect sizes have the same sign (that is, are on the s ame side of \"no effect\") . The range of effect sizes is narrow.Use one of three levels of consistency: C onsistent (i.e., no inconsistency) Inconsistent Unknown or not applicable (e.g., single study) As noted in the text, single- study evidence bases (even mega-trials) cannot be judged with respect to consistency. In that instance, use \"Consistency unknown (single st udy).\" Directness The rating of directness relates to whether the evidence links the interventions directly to health outcomes. For a comparison of two treatments, directness implies that head-to -head trials measure the most important health or ultimate outcomes. Two types of directness, which can coexist , may be of concern: Evidence is indirect if: It uses intermediate or surrogate outcomes instead of health outcomes. In this case, one body of evidence links the intervention to intermediate outcomes and another body of evidence links the intermediate to most important (health or ultimate) outcomes. It uses two or more bodies of evidence to compare i nterventions A and B \u2014e.g., studies of A vs. placebo and B vs. placebo, or studies of A vs. C and B vs. C but not A vs. B. I ndirectness always implies that more than one body of evidence is required to link interventions to the most important health outcomes. Directness may be contingent on the outcomes of interest. EPC authors are expected to make clear the outcomes involved when assessing this domain. Score dichotomously as one of two levels directness Di rect Indirect If indirect, specify which of the two types of indirectness account for the rating (or both, if that is the case) \u2014 namely, use of intermediate/ surrogate outcomes rather than health outcomes, and use of indirect comparisons. Comment on the potential weaknesses caused by, or inherent in, the indirect analysis. The EPC should note if both direct and indirect evidence was available, particularly when indirect evidence supports a small body of direct evidence. Precision Precision is the degree of certainty surrounding an effect estimate with respect to a given outcome (i.e., for each outcome separately) . If a meta -analysis was performed, this will be the confidence interval around the summary effect size. Score dichotomously as one of two levels of precision: Pre ciseImprecise A precise estimate is an estimate that would allow a clinically useful conclusion. An imprecise est imate is one for which the confidence interval is wide enough to include clinically distinct conclusions. For example, results may be statistically compatible with both clinically important superiority and inferiority (i.e., the direction of effect is unknown), a circumstance that will preclude a valid conclusion. 12 Peer Review and Public Commentary A draft of this report was submitted in May , 2013. The AHRQ Effective Healthcare Program Scientific Resource Center (SRC) located at Portland VA Research Found ation coordinated peer review by experts and stakeholders. The report w as posted on AHRQ's web site for a month for public comment. Resulting comments were considered by the authors in preparation of the final report . Synthesis of the scientific literature presented here does not necessarily represent the views of individual reviewers, and service as a peer reviewer or member of the Technical E xpert P anel cannot be construed as endorsement of the report's findings. 13 Results A total of 20,478 titles were identified through electronic literature searches ; suggestions from TEP members ; review of product inserts; review of FDA, ACIP, and other web sites ; reference mining; and finally, Scientific Information Packets (SIPs) requested from vaccine manufacturers by the AHRQ -funded Scientific Resource Center (SRC). Of those, 17,270 were excluded upon review of abstract (where available) or title, mostly due to lack of data on safety of vaccines (see Figure 2) . Other reasons for exclusion included use of vaccines not within the scope of this project (i.e. not routinely recommended in the United S tates, recommended only for travel, no longer used in the United S tates), publication in languages other than English, and study not conducted on humans. Five could not be obtained; based on their titles, we do not think this affected the project. A list of excluded studies and corresponding reasons for exclusion is provided as Appendix D. Based on title/abstract screenings, 3, 210 articles were selected for full text review. Of those, 392 were identified as relevant background/theoretical materials and set aside as potential references. A total of 2,650 other articles were excluded. The most common reason for exclusion was lack of suitable study design (1,549): Individual case reports, non- systematic reviews, and studies using passive surveillance (for example, reports from VAERS) were not included. Many publications (458) discussed vaccines on the recommended schedule, but did not assess adverse events . One hundred and ninety-t hree s tudies using formulations not currently or routinely recommended in the United States were excluded at full text review . For example, studies of H5N1 vaccine, BCG vaccine, and vaccines using the adjuvant ASO3, or BCG vaccine were excluded . Identifyin g strength / formulation was often difficult; this process involved comparing product materials and /or FDA filings with formulations reported in the studies . Based on full text screening, 1 66 studies were accepted for abstraction, including 86 controlled trials or cohort studies directly comparing a group who received a vaccine with an unvaccinated group. Five of these 86 studies also conducted a multivaria te analysis. We also included 80 case -control studies, self- controlled case series, or multivariate risk factor analyses that met our inclusion criteria. These studies are in addition to the studies included in the 2011 IOM consensus report \" Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality \"; we summarize their conclusions for each population and vaccine, we did not abstract those studies. The results are presented by population: adults, children and adolescents, and pregnant women. 14 Figure 2. Study/ literature flow diagram IOM = Institute of Medicine aFive studies also contributed multivariate risk factor analyses . 15 Key Question 1: What is the evidence that vaccines included in the 2011 immunization schedule recommended for U.S. adults23 are safe in the short term (within 30-42 days following immunization) or long term (>42 days after immunization)? a.What adverse events (AEs) are collected in clinical studies (phases I - IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparisongroup? b.What AEs are reported in clinical studies (phases I-IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? Table 5 lists all AEs collected or reported in placebo-controlled trials and vaccinated/ unvaccinated cohort comparisons of adults, abstracted verbatim . We interpreted \"collected\" to mean those specified a priori by investigators, while \"report ed\" were any AEs reported by participants. The list does not imply an association with vaccination; it displays reported AEs regardless of whether they were reported in vaccinated or unvaccinated study participants, and whether or not the number reported w as zero. (In the latter case, a study could \"collect\" data on a specific serious AE, but \"report\" zero cases.) Later in this report, we describe the studies and assess association. Table 5.

Table 6 lists all AEs and medical conditions assessed in the post-licensure studies of adults. The majority of these studies were designed to assess the association of a specific AE with vaccination. Again, appearance on the list does not imply an association. Table 6.

O ur primary focus is the statistical association of AEs with vaccination. The severity of AEs was inconsistently reported. Where reported, or where possible for our researchers to categorize, severity is displayed in the summary tables in this section. Some clinical trials reported severity; most simply provided a list of AEs along with the number of patients in each group reporting them. Postmarketing studies tended to combine all cases of a particular AE, as severity details were often unavailable or inadequate. Results are organized by vaccine type. For each vaccine, we first describe the findings of the 2011 Instit ute of Medicine (IOM) report \"Adverse Events of Vaccine: Evidence and Causality,\" where available. (Not all recommended vaccines are covered in that report.) We then describe the findings from studies published after the IOM report that met our inclusion c riteria: clinical trials and cohort studies that included an unvaccinated group, followed by the results of postmarketing studies. The results for all reported AEs, including those not statistically associated with vaccination, are displayed in the right-hand column of tables in this section. The 95% confidence intervals reflect the level of certainty. We summarize and critique the evidence, taking into consideration the number and size of studies, study methodology and quality, and applicability. Influenza Vaccines The seasonal influenza vaccine is administered in two forms: a live attenuated form, administered intranasally or \"swine flu\" vaccine was administered widely during the winter of 2009-2010; we were encouraged by our expert panel to include it, as seasonal vaccines developed after 2009 include an H1N1 strain. a Level of certainty was operationalized as the 95 -percent confidence interval surrounding the risk or odds estimate \u2014i.e., the statistical significance . 20 The IOM committee studied the two forms of seasonal influenza vaccines. They found that evidence35 \"con vincingly supports\" a causal relationship between influenza vaccine and anaphylaxis. The committee found that evidence36-39 \"favors acceptance\" of a causal relationship between two particular influenza vaccines used in Canada and oculorespiratory syndrome. The IOM committee found the evidence40-45 \"favors rejection\" of a causal relationship between TIV and asthma exacerbation or reactive airway disease episodes in adults. Finally, despite finding some studies of influenza vaccine and the following AEs, the IOM found evidence was \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship: encephalitis, encephalopathy, optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis (MS) onset or relapse, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), chronic inflammatory d emyelinating polyneuropa thy, Bell's Palsy, onset of exacerbation of (SLE), or infarction, and all -cause mortality. One comparative cohort stu dy and eight trials of influenza vaccine in adults were published after the IOM search dates. All trials administered inactivated vaccine. One trial studied monovalent H1N1 vaccine; all other trials studied seasonal vaccine. All but one study of seasonal v accine included an H1N1 strain. The results are summarized in Table 7. A trial in Canada 46 included 1,348 adults (54.2% female) who received inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine at study start and 14 days later. Odds ratios were not calculated because t he study reported AEs per dose rather than per patient. A controlled clinical trial in the United States47 included 7,250 adults aged 18 to 49 who received one dose of inactivated influenza vaccine. Compared to the control group, vaccinated individuals wer e more likely to experience arthralgia (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.67- 2.66), chills (OR 2.24, CI 1.77 -2.84), fatigue (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.80), headache (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.23- 1.59), hyperhidrosis (OR 1.68, 95% CI 2.16), malaise 2.02, CI myalgia 2.50), and pyrexia (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.54 -3.36). A controlled clinical trial in the United States , Finland, and Poland 48 included 11,404 adults (55% female) separated into two vaccine groups that receive one dose inactivated influenza vaccine and one placebo group. Group 1 received Agrippal and Group 2 received Optaflu. Compared to the control group, Group 1 was more likely to experience mild to moderate fever (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.16- 3.49), mild to moderate malaise (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.06- 1.52), and mild to moderate myalgia (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.11 -1.55). A trial in Italy 49 included 104 adults (45.1% female) who received inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluad) at study start and 42 days l ater. No statistically significant differences in AEs between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were reported. A trial in the United States 50 included 7,611 adults (60% female, 0.7% pregnant) who received one dose of inactivated influenza vaccine (Flulaval). Compared to the unvaccinated group, vaccinated individuals were more likely to experience fever (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.28 -2.50) and myalgia/arthralgia (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.73 -2.26). A controlled clinical trial in the United States 51 included 4,648 adults (59% female, 0.8% pregnant) who received one dose of inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (Flublok). Compared to the unvaccinated group, vaccinated individuals were more likely to experience any pain (OR 6.69, 95% CI 5.62 -7.95) and muscle pain (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.28 -1.96). Regarding monovalent H1N1, a trial in the United States 52 included 1,313 adults (57.1% female) who were divided into two groups receiving different doses (7.5 mg [Group 1] or 15 mg [Group 2]) of at study baseline and 21 days later. The onl y statistically significant finding was fewer systemic AEs in Group 2 (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32- 0.99). 21 A controlled clinical trial in South Africa53 included 189 HIV+ adults (84% female) who received inactivated influenza vaccine (Mutagrip). No statistically s ignificant differences in AEs between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were reported. This vaccine did not include an H1N1 strain. The cohort study54 compared vaccinated vs. unvaccinated patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who were undergoing di alysis. The study was conducted in Taiwan; vaccine was inactivated. Vaccinees were older and more likely to have conditions such as cardiac disease and COPD. T he elderly in the vaccine cohort had a lower hospitalization rate (adjusted HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64 -0.82). The time -dependent Cox model revealed an overall adjusted H azard Ratio for mortality of 0.30 (95% CI 0.26-0.35) after counting vaccination for multi -years. 22 Table 7.

The vast majority assessed the relationship between vaccination and one adverse event or medical condition of particular interest. A few assessed whether the vaccine was associated with fewer cardiovascular events in the elderly. Finally, some studied the effect of vaccine in adults with pre -existing conditions such as MS, renal disease or COPD. Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) and Other Autoimmune Disorders Several studies evaluated whether H1N1 vaccine was associated with an increased risk of developing Guillain- Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. Baxter55 studied 415 cases of GBS among managed care enrollees in California. Odds of TIV vaccination in both 6 and 10 week intervals before GBS onset were not significant. (Inactivated polio vaccine, PPV, Tdap, Td, and vaccinations against hepatitis A and B were not associated statistically with GBS onset.) Greene et al. 201256 performed separate self-controlled risk interval and case -centered analyses among members of eight managed care organizations (MCOs) in the United States who received 1.48 million doses of monovalent inactivated pandemic H1N1 vaccine (MIV) and 1.72 million doses of TIV. Altogether thirteen confirmed cases of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome were identified after receipt of MIV and 16 aft er receipt of TIV. Statistically signicant increases in GBS risk following receipt of MIV were suggested by the self -controlled risk interval analysis ( RR = 4.4 95% CI: 1.3, 14.2 risk difference = 5.0 per million MIV doses ( 95% CI: 0.5 per million , 9.5 per million ). The cas e-centered analysis found that the OR for having illness onset inside of the 42- day risk period versus outside of that period was 2.0 (95% CI: 0.5, 8.1), but this was not statistically significant. The risk difference was 3.4 per million MIV doses (95% CI: -6.4 per million , 7.6 per million ). No increased risk for developing GBS was associated with receipt of seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (RR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.5, 3.8), so case -centered analysis was not conducted . A meta -analysis of data from six U .S. surveillance systems established or enhanced during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic57 found an association with GBS (IRR 2.35, 95% CI 1.42.4.01), equivalent to about 1.6 excess cases per million monovalent H1N1 vaccines administered. In contrast, in a prospective case -control study of 1 ,225 subjects in France, Grimaldi- Bensouda et al. 2011 58 were unable to demonstrate any statistically significant association between receipt of monovalent H1N1 and/or seasonal influenza vaccine and the development of GBS in eight separate analyses (see Table 8 for statistics) . As formulation and brand of vaccines were not reported, it is possible that AS03 adjuvant (not used in the United States ) was contained in some vaccines. In Australia, Crawford59 conducted a self -contr olled case series to assess the potential relationship between monovalent H1N1 vaccine (Panvax) and GBS. No statistically significant association was found, after multiple sensitivity analyses for time period and use of season influenza vaccine. Lee 60 conducted a study of over 4.5 million doses of monovalent H1N1, TIV, and LAIV administered to enrollees in 8 U .S. MCOs. In a self -controlled case series analysis, a statistical association for monovalent H1N1 vaccine and Bell's palsy was found. However, a subs equent case -centered logistic regression controlling for seasonality found the association not statistically significant (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.97 -1.63). No signifi cant associations were noted during sequential analyses for Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome, most other neurological outcomes, and allergic and cardiac events . In Europe, Isai and colleagues 61 compared the rate of autoimmune disorders reported to the EUdraVigilance database after vaccination with adjuvanted vs. unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine. They used MedDRA c lassifications; autoimmune disorders included GBS, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, onset and exacerbation of MS, and over a dozen other conditions. The rate difference 27 between adjuvanted and non- adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines was not statistically signifi cant. Using the estimated number of vaccinees as the denominator, they calculated the reporting rate as 9.98 (6.81 - 13.16) cases per million vaccinees for non -adjuvanted vaccines and 6.87 (6.06- 7.68) cases per million vaccinees for adjuvanted vaccines. Neurological sequelae following MIV vaccination were evaluated in two other studies. Using a self-controlled case series method, Farez et al. 201262 assessed whether receipt of MIV was associated with relapses of M S. No significant relationship was found in this study of 137 patients (98% of whom were receiving interferon- beta and 25% glatiramer acetate) with previously diagnosed M S (for 30 -day risk period, OR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.20, 3.62) . Tanner et al. 201263 performed a case -control study of 150 patients with sp asmodic dysphonia (cases) and 136 patients with other structural, neurological, and functional voice disorders (controls) . There was no difference in post - vaccine incidence of spasmodic dysphonia among persons who did or did not self -report receipt of swin e influenza vaccine (OR 2.1, 95% CI 0.9, 5.0) , whereas persons who did not know whether they had received swine influenza vaccine were more likely to have spasmodic dysphonia than were persons who reported not receiving the vaccine. Cardiovascular The relationship between receipt of influenza vaccination and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comp lications was assessed in three studies. In a matched case- control study of 16,012 persons with myocardial infarction and 62,964 controls , Siriwardena et al. 201064 found that receipt of influenza vaccine within the previous year was significantly associated with lower odds of acute myocardial infarction (OR 0.83, 95% CI study including 40 countries65 follow ing 31,546 subjects, aged 55 an d above, with a history of vascular disease or diabetes with documented end- organ damage between 2004 and 2007 concluded that although initial analyses suggested that influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk of major adverse vascular events d uring influenza seasons when the influenza vaccine matched the circulating virus, sensitivity analyses revealed that risk of bias remained. The primary outcomes were a composite of death resulting from cardiovascular causes, and a composite of death from other causes during these four influenza seasons. D ata were modeled using logistic regression and adjusted using propensity scores for influenza vaccination ( demographics, body mass index, vitamin use, smoking history, alcohol use, history of pneumococcal vaccination, and use of a variety of medications). Hedlund et al. 200366 compared one -year outcomes among 100,242 persons vaccinated with influenza and/or 23- valent pneumococcal vaccine versus 159,385 unvaccinated individuals ; all subjects were aged 65 years o r older. Among the vaccinated subjects , 76,177 had both vaccines, 23,224 received only the influenza vaccine, and 841 received only the pneumococcal vaccine. The incidence of hospital admissions for influenza, pneumonia, and invasive pneumococcal disea se during one year after vaccination was significantly lower in the vaccinated than in the unvaccinated cohort. T he vaccinated cohort had significantly lower rates of in- hospital mortality for pneumonia, COPD, and cardiac failure. The benefits of vaccinati on were greater during influenza season (December - May) than at other times of the year (June - November). No harms from vaccination were noted among the reported outcomes. Finally, in a self -controlled case series analysis, Gwini et al. 201167 found that the incidence of post vaccination myocardial infarction was reduced at time intervals extending up to 59 days after receipt of vaccine. 28 Hematological Two studies addressed the relationship between receipt of influenza vaccine and the development of hemato logic diseases. In a self -controlled case series conducted by Garbe et al. 2012,68 two different statistical models revealed a significant association between prior influenza vaccination and new onset immune thrombocytopenia (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.5, 9.6) in a model adjusted for age, sex, and multiple medications) . In a self -controlled case series , Hambidge et al. 201169 found no relationship between receipt of influenza vaccine by adults with sickle cell disease and subsequent hospitalization for complications of sickle cell disease (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66, 1.28). Regarding vaccination of dialysis patients, Gilbertson et al. (2011)70 studied 118,533 adult U .S. Medicare patients who initiated hemodialysis before August 1, 2003 and were alive through October 31, 2005. Subjects were followed between 2005 and 2006 for data on health outcomes. The analysis adjusted for patient demographics, primary cause of end stage renal disease, duration of dialysis, existing comorbidities, and influenza vaccination. Results indicate that vaccination with influenza (RR 0. 77, 95% CI 0.73, 0.81) or pneumococcal (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90, 0.98) vaccines wa s associated with lower mortality. In a retrospective cohort analysis of 51,730 adult Medicare patients with renal transplants, Hurst et al. 2011 71 found that influenza vaccination in the first year after transplant was associated with lower risk of both subsequent allograft loss (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.77, 95% CI 0.69, 0.85) 95% CI 0.76, 0.89) . Other In a single retrospective matched cohort study of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), Ting; 201172 found no change in the frequency of COPD exacerbations during the 14 days following vaccination. General One study of the safety of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV ) was identified (Baxter et al. 2012).73 In this retrospective cohort study of 21,340, 18,316, and 21,340 adults aged 18 to 49 years who received LAIV, TIV , or no vaccine, respectively , the rate of hospitalization or death due to any condition within 180 days of vaccination with LAIV was significantly lower than with TIV or no vaccine. The incidence rate for any serious adverse event within 21 days and 42 days of vaccination with LAIV was lower than for no vaccinat ion. The pattern of medically attended events did not suggest any safety signal associated with LAIV. Summary Based on the entire body of available evidence, including the IOM report, clinical trials, and post-licensure studies that met our inclusion criteria, we make the following conclusions regarding key adverse events. There is high strength of evidence that influenza vaccines currently used in the United States are associated with arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, and pain in the short -term in adu lts; these associations were consistently reported in randomized, placebo- controlled clinical trials conducted in the U .S. and abroad . These AEs are not considered serious; thus, they are rarely investigated in post - marketing epidemiological studies. R isk factors are not discussed in the trials. Clinical trials have found no association between influenza vaccines currently used in the United States and serious adverse events (SAEs). There is high strength evidence of an association between 2009 monovalent H1N1 and Guillain - Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). This conclusion is based on a meta -analysis of data from six large U .S. 29 surveillance systems established or enhanced during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic57. However, this adverse event is extremely rare; the authors estimat e about 1.6 excess cases per million doses of monovalent H1N1 vaccine administered. Based on our review of the IOM report and its conclusion that evidence \"convincingly supports\" a causal relationship between influenza vaccines and anaphylaxis in persons who may be allergic to egg, we rated the streng th of evidence high for this AE . Anaphylactic reactions can be severe if not treated immediately. Manufacturers have decreased the amount of egg protein significantly in recent years. The IOM conclusion favor ing acceptance of a causal relationship between influenza vaccines and oculorespiratory syndrome was based on a specific vaccine used in Canada from 2001 to 2003; there is no basis for current concern in the United States Post-licensure studies with strong study designs have found inconsistent evidence associating influenza vaccines with onset or exacerbation of MS in adults. Strength of evidence is insufficient to determine an association. Strength of evidence is high that influenza vaccines do not lead to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in the elderly; several high quality post -licensure studies have shown a decreased risk among vaccinees. Two large post-licensure studies with strong study designs have shown that influenza vaccines are not associ ated with increased risk of SAEs in renal patients. Strength of evidence is moderate. 30 Table 8.

We found no placebo controlled trials of the currently available pneumococcal poly saccharide vaccine (PVC23) that reported adverse events data. ( If a study did not explicitly state that no adverse events took place, it was excluded. ) We found several trials of PPV23 that reported community -acquired pneumonia and associated mortality; ho wever, these were considered efficacy outcomes . We also found trials of PVC 23 versus old versions (i.e. PCV13, PCV7); however those studies were excluded because they had no unvaccinated comparison group. Five postmarketing studies in adults were identif ied; all studied the relationship between pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and occurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Results are displayed in Table 9. No other case -control study, self -controlled case series, or multivariate analysis focused on pneumococcal vaccine alone. Cardiovascular and C erebrovascular In a prospective cohort study of 84,170 men aged 45 to 69 years , Tseng et al. 201074 found that administration of pneumococcal vaccine (unspecified) was not associated with reduced risk adjusted for propensity score of stroke (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00, 1.31) and of myocardial infarction (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.98, 1.21) . In contrast, in a prospective cohort of 6,171 subjects, Eurich et al. 201275 showed that administration of pneumococcal pol ysaccharide vaccine was associated with a decreased rate o f acute coronary syndrome -related hospitalization . Other studies did not show a lower risk of myocardial infarction (Siriwardena et al. 2010; Vila 2012; 64,76,77 Hedlund et al. 200366 compared one -year outcomes among 100,242 persons vaccinated with i nfluenza and/or 23- valent pneumococcal vaccine versus 159,385 unvaccinated individuals ; all subjects were aged 65 years o r older. (Study details are displayed in Table 8 in the influenza se ction.) Among the vaccinated subjects , 76,177 had both vaccines, 23,224 received only the influenza vaccine, and 841 received only the pneumococcal vaccine. No harms from vaccination were noted among the reported outcomes. Administration polysaccharide pne umococcal vaccination was not associated with any subsequent change in the age-adjusted rates of first and recurrent myocardial infarction or stroke . Summary Pneumococcal vaccines were not covered by the IOM report. We found no placebo- controlled trials of PCV23 which assessed adverse events. Post -licensure studies focused on association of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in older adults. As r esults of four high quality post -licensure studies conducted in the US, UK, Canada, and Spain consistently found vaccination was not associated with increased risk of these events in persons age 65 and older , the strength of evidence is rated as high . The studies have low risk of bias, as the analyses adjusted for subj ect characteristics that would make them more at risk for these adverse events, such as pre -existing medical conditions, demographics, and behavioral risks. The US and UK studies had high statistical power, with about 80,000 subjects each. Results were inconsistent as to whether these vaccines decrease risk of these events. 42 Table 9.

One trial conducted in Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, and the Philippines78 studied the vaccine in varicella -zoster virus sero -negative or low sero -positive adults. This trial included only 21 persons: 18 received the vaccine, while three received placebo. There were no AEs reported in the placebo group; thus, odds ratios could not be calculated. There were no serious AEs in the vaccine group. Some publications reported only broad categories of AEs. A controlled clinical trial in North America and Europe79 included 22,439 adults (62% female) who received one dose of the zoster (Zost avax) vaccine at baseline. Compared to the control group, vaccinated individuals were more likely to experience one or more injection- site AEs (OR 10.38, 95% CI 9.72- 11.08), vaccine - related AEs (OR 8.39, 95% CI 7.88 -8.92), and one or more systemic adverse even ts (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 -1.15). A smaller trial in the United States and Netherlands80 included 210 older adults (63% female) who received two doses of Zostavax, one at baseline (Dose 1) and another 42 days later (Dose 2). Compared to the control group, vaccinated individuals were more likely to experience one or more adverse events post dose 1 (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.73 -5.41), systemic adverse events post dose 1 (OR 14.70, 95% CI 1.89- 114.53), vaccine -related adverse events post dose 1 (OR 8.53, 95% CI 4.18- 17.39), one or more adverse events post dose 2 (OR 4.06, 95% CI 2.28- 7.24), and vaccine - related adverse events post dose 2 (OR 11.17, 95% CI 5.46 -22.87). A crossover trial in the United States 81 randomized 101 adults (59% female) to Zostavax or placebo at study start. The groups were switched at 28 days; those who received placebo on Day 1 were given Zostavax and vice- versa. The study reported overall results and also results according to different subgroups. The only AE associated with vaccination in the overall study population was injection- site AE (OR 19.84, 95% CI 6.77- 58.12). The vaccine was associated with \"one or more adverse event\" in patients over 60 years old (OR 5.37, 95% CI 2.61 -11.05). A controlled clinical trial in the United States included 38,546 older adults (41% female) who received one dose of zoster vaccine. No statistically significant differences in serious adverse events between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were reported. An Adverse Events Monitoring Substudy of this trial 82 reported on over 6,600 of the subjects. Compared to the control group, vaccinated individuals were more likely to experience one or more adverse events at the injection site (OR 4.67, 95% CI 4.16 -5.24) and one or more vaccine -related systemic adverse events (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05 -1.60). There were no significant differences in cardiovascular, endocrine, digestive, metabolic, musculoskeletal, or nervous system AEs. Lastly, a controlled clinical trial conducted in the United States , Canada, Spain, Germany, and the UK 83 included almost 12,000 older adults (59% female) who received one dose of Zostavax. This study reported on cardiac, GI, psychiatric, and other categories of serious adverse events. No statistically significant differences in adverse events between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were reported. 47 Table 10.

They are displayed in Table 11. Zhang et al. 201284 evaluated the efficacy and safety of zoster vaccine among Medicare beneficiaries 60 years and older who had inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis. Receipt of zoster vaccine was not associated with increased cases of varicella or herpes zoster within 42 days in the cohort as a whole and specifically in individuals who were receiving biologic immunodulatory agents (principally agents targeted against Tumor Necrosis Factor). The authors also evaluated the relationship between vaccination and hospitalization for meningitis or encephalitis; no such cases were identified. With a median follow -up of two years, receipt of the zoster vaccine was associated with a decreased rate of incident cases of zoster. Lower rates were associated wi th vaccination in all patient subgroup s Using both a case -centered approach and a self -controlled case series analysis, Tseng et al 2012, 85 examined the relationship between receipt of zoster vaccine and various adverse events among a cohort of adults age 50 and above receiving care from eight U.S. managed -care organizations. Five specific groupings of events were examined: cerebrovascular events (Group 1); acute myocardial infarction, palsy (Group 4); and medically attended events, including cellulitis, pain and allergic reactions (Group 5). No increased risk was found for Groups 1 - 4 as a wh ole or for the any of the individual entities within these groups. An increased rate of cellulitis on days 1 - 7 was found using only the case -centered method (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.18, 1.44) and an increase in allergic reactions was found by both the case cen tered analysis (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.87, 2.40) and the self -controlled case series method (RR 2.32 95% CI 1.85, 2.91) . No cases of anaphylaxis occurred with vaccine administration. The authors state the increased rate of cellulitis may be due to patient aller gy or inflammatory reactions. Baxter 86 compared rates of medical even ts resulting in emergency room visits or hospitalization in a 42- day t ime period following vaccination with rates in the same cohort in a subsequent comparison time period. Of the 386 co mparisons performed, four conditions (systemic lupus erythematous, angioplasty, coronary atherosclerosis, and other heart disease) had a statistically significant increased relative risk. However, a fter medical records review, the timing of these condition s was found to often be prior to vaccination, and no clear increase in health events was observed in the risk period following vaccination compared to later. Summary Zostavax is recommended for U.S. adults over age 60; adverse events specific to this popul ation were not covered by the IOM report. In the clinical trials we identified, potency varied from 18,700 to 89,000 PFU (plaque -forming units) per dose. (Two of the six trials did not report potency.) The formulation currently licensed in the United State s contains a minimum of 19,400 PFU per 0.65 ml dose. Adverse events were sometimes reported using broad categories such as \"injection -related adverse events,\" \"systematic adverse events,\" or \"one or more adverse events ;\" the quality of adverse events repo rting in these trials was thus considered poor. Two trials reported events using more specific categories such as \"psychi atric\" or \"respiratory/thoracic;\" in these two trials, the vaccine was not associated with any adverse events other than injection sit e reaction. Strength of evidence is moderate for this non- serious adverse event based on high quality of these trials . We found three post -licensure studies; the only adverse events associated with Zoster 51 vaccine were allergic reactions and cellulitis poss ibly due to inflammatory or allergic reactions. No cases of anaphylaxis were reported ; the events are non -serious. T he strength of evidence is moderate; studies used appropriate designs, had low risk of bias, and high statistical power due to sample size. 52 Table 11.

The IOM committee found the evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship between HPV hypercoagulable states. In the United States , HPV vaccine is generally administered to patients between the ages of 9 and 26. Thus, the post -licensure studies are discussed in the section on children and adolescents. We identified two double blind randomized trials of HPV vaccine in women aged 18 to 35. Both were administered Cervarix at baseline, one month, and six months. The results are summarized in Table 13. A controlled trial in Hong Kong 88 included 300 women; compared to the control group, women who were vaccinated were more likely to experience the non -serious AEs, fatigue (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.05 -2.72) and myalgia (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.03- 2.82). A controlled trial in India89 included 337 adult women; compared to the placebo group, women who were vaccinated were more likely to experience Grade 3 (severe) pain (OR 6.19, 95% CI 2.63- 14.54). Grade 3 pain was defined as that which limited typical daily activity; 20.5% of the HPV group and 4.0% of the placebo group reported this level of pain. We do not consider this a SAE. We summarize the totality of the evidence on HPV in the section on children and adolescents. 60 Table 13.

Note: Additional study details presented in A ppendix C evidence tables . 61 Diphtheria Toxoid, Tetanus Toxoid, and Acellular Pertussis The IOM studied diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acel lular pertussis -containing vaccines alone and in combination; they are administered to both children and adults. Except where noted below, studies did not report specific AEs by age. The IOM committee found the evidence \"convincingly supports\" a causal rel ationship in the adult population between the tetanus toxoid vaccine and anaphylaxis . We identified only one trial of adults published after the IOM search dates. A trial in Korea90 include d only 20 individuals, all male, who received one dose of SK Td va ccine. No statistically significant differences in AEs between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were reported. Data are displayed in Table 14. We identified no post -license studies of vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis in adults published after the IOM searches. Thus, we rate the strength of evidence as high for association of tetanus toxoid with anaphylaxis among persons allergic to ingredients, per the IOM findings. 62 Table 14.

In a case- control study of 159 cases of psoriatic arthritis and 159 persons with psoriasis alone, Eder et al. 201191 found vaccination against any of the following diseases was not associated with onset of psoriatic arthritis: Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B , influenza, and pneumonia . In a multivariate analysis of records from the Defense Medical Surveillance System, Duderstadt and colleagues92 found that mili tary personnel vaccinated for MMR were less likely to have new onset of Type 1 diabetes (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61, 0.83) than those who were not vaccinated. The same was true for military personnel who had received Hep B vaccine (RR. 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.83). In a case control study of 355 Graves' disease cases, 418 Hashimoto's thyroiditis cases , and 1,102 controls , Yu et al. 200793 found that vaccination against Hepatitis B , influenza, MMR, Hepatitis A, or polio was not associated with an increase rate of Grav es' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The IOM report made the following conclusions regarding other vaccines in adults. MMR Vaccin e The evidence94-97 \"favors acceptance\" of a causal relationship with transient arth ralgia in women. The IOM committee found the evidence \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship in the adult population between MMR vaccine and MS onset, Guillain- Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, chronic arthralgia in women, and chronic arthritis and arthropathy in men. Hepatitis A No epidemiologic al studies of the following AEs in adults were found: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, MS, inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Bells' Palsy, anaphylaxis, and autoimmune hepatitis. The IOM thus states that the evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship with these AEs. We found no additional trials of MMR, vaccine in adults published after the IOM searches. We concur with the IOM findings and rate the strength of evidenc e as insufficient for association of vaccination against Hepatitis A with these potential sequelae. Hepatitis B Although no epidemiological studies were identified, mechanistic evidence \" favored acceptance\" of a causal relationship between the vaccine and anaphylaxis in yeast -sensitive individuals. Epidemiological studies of the following AEs in adults had evidence \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship: optic neuritis, first demyelinating event, Guillain or bation vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and onset or exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis. A 2002 IOM review on Hep B vaccine and demyelinating neurological disorders concluded that the evidence \" favors rejection \" of a causal relationship with incident MS or MS relapse. 98 No epidemiological studies of the following AEs arthritis, onset or exacerbation of reactive arthritis, and fibromyalgia. The IOM thus states that the evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship with these AEs. We found no controlled trials of Hepatitis B vaccine in adults published after the IOM searches. The only post -licensure study that met our inclusion criteria investigated several vaccines and is described above. Summary MMR. Upon our review of the IOM report, we concur and rate the st rength of evidence as moderate for association of MMR and transient arthralgia in women, and insufficient for association with the other investigated adverse events. Strength of evidence is moderate that MMR is not associated with onset of type 1 diabetes in adults, per results of a very large recent high quality epidemiological study. Hepatitis A . There is insufficient evidence regarding association of this vaccine with any adverse events or onset of medical conditions, per evidence presented in the IOM report and recent post -licensure studies. Hepatitis B . Per evidence presented in the IOM report and recent post -licensure studies, there is insufficient evidence regarding association of this vaccine with any short -term adverse events other than anaphylax is in yeast -sensitive individuals. This event is considered serious. Hepatitis B vaccine is not associated with onset of type 1 diabetes in adults; strength of evidence is moderate, per results of a very large recent high quality epidemiological study. The re is insufficient evidence regarding the association of Hepatitis B vaccine and onset of any other medical conditions. 65 Table 15.

Note: Additional study details presented in A ppendix C evidence tables . 66 Key Question 2: What is the evidence that vaccines included in the immunization schedules recommended for U.S. children and adolescents in 2011 24 are safe in the short term (withi n 30-42 days following immunization) or long term (>42 days after immunization)? a. What AEs are collected in clinical studies (phases I -IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? b. What AEs are reported in clinical studies (phases I -IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group? Table 1 6 lists all AEs collected or reported in trials of vaccines on the U.S. routi ne recommended schedule for children and adolescents. We interpreted \"collected\" to mean those specified a priori by investigators, while \"reported\" were any AEs reported by participants. The list does not imply an association with vaccination, as it contains AEs regardless of whether they were reported in vaccinated or unvaccinated study participants . Also, a study could \"collect\" data on a specific serious AE, but \"report\" zero cases. Later in this report, we describe the studies further an d assess association. 67 Table 16.

For each AE associated with a particular vaccine, what are the risk factors for the AE (including age, sex, race/ethnicity, genotype, underlying medical condition, whether a vaccine is administered individually or in a combination vaccine product, sch edule of vaccine administration, adjuvants, and medications administered concomitantly)? Influenza Vaccines The IOM committee studied seasonal influenza vaccines in children and adolescents . Such vaccines are administered in two forms: a live attenuated fo rm, administered intranasally, and an inactivated form, administered intramuscularly. The IOM committee did not find evidence that \"convincingly supports\" causal relationships in the pediatric population for any conditions. They found the evidence is \"inad equate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship between influenza vaccine and the following: seizures, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and transverse myelitis. The IOM committee also found evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship between live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and asthma exacerbation or reactive airway disease (RAD) episodes in children younger than 5 year s of age and 5 year s of age or older. 99-104 We identified five trials105-109 of children publi shed after the IOM search and one cohort study.110 These are displayed in Table 18. Four studies looked at special populations : children with cancer ,106 transplant patients,110 children with HIV108 and children with egg allergy.109 The studies were set in the United States , South Africa and Japan. In four trials and the cohort study, a Level of certainty was operationalized as the 9 5-percent confidence interval surrounding the risk or odds estimate \u2014i.e., the statistical significance . 71 participants r eceived 1 -2 doses of either live106 or inactiv ated105,108-110 seasonal influenza vaccines which included an H1N1 strain. The fifth trial studied monovalent H1N1 v accine. In the studies of healthy patients, both inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (including a strain of H1N1)105 and 2009 monovalent H1N1107 were associated with no AEs. Similarly, in the studies of children with cancer106 and transplant patients,110 inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (including a strain of H1N1) was associated with no AEs. The study of HIV positive children reported no serious adverse events.108 Finally, Fluzone109 was not associated with urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, throat itch or swelling in children with egg allergy. 72 Table 18.

Convulsions Stowe et al. (2011)111 studied 2,366 cases of convulsions in children (age <10 years) between May 2000 and April 2010 using the UK's General Practice Research Database (GPRD). The monovalent H1N1 vaccine (MIV) was studied during the 2009/10 influenza season and the TIV vaccine was studied during other seasons. Both vaccination status and health outcomes were ascertained by a review of medical records. The children were followed up for an average of 5.1 years each (range 0.3 -10.0 years). The analysis adjusted for age, period, and season. For both the monovalent H1N1 and TIV vaccines, the onset of a convulsion episode was not significantly associated with vaccine at any time point. In contrast, Tse112 analyzed data on over 200,000 U.S. children under age 5 who received TIV in autumn of 2010 and found a signal for febrile seizures was found. In a self -controlled case series including febrile seizures con firmed through medical record, incidence rate ratio was significant for first dose (IRR 4.0; 95% CI 2.1 - 6.2). Vaccine against pneumonia (PCV13) was also associated with febrile seizures; importantly, administration of both vaccines at the same visit was associated with increased risk. For example, for 16 month old children, estimated rate was 12.5 per 100,000 doses for TIV without concomitant PCV13, 13.7 per 100,000 doses for PCV13 without concomitant TIV, and 44.9 per 100,000 doses for concomitant TIV and PCV13. Risk difference estimates varied by age due to the varying baseline risk for seizur es in young children. Influenza -Like Illness A case -control analysis studied 683 children and adolescents ( age 1 month - 18 years) who were hospitalized through the emergency departments of eight hospitals in Italy between November 2009 and August 2010. 113 Vaccination for H1N1 was ascertained via parental report , and health outcomes were collected through active surveillance of both clinically defined and laboratory confirmed hospitalizations for Influenza -Like Illness (ILI) events. AEs were confirmed using parental reports. Data were modeled using logistic regression that adjusted for age, chronic conditions, and other seas onal influenza vaccines. Results indicate that children vaccin ated with any influenza vaccine (OR 2.7, 95% C I 1.6, 4.7) or seasonal vaccine (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1, 4.1) were significantly more likely to show symptoms of ILI, while those vaccinated for H1N1 we re not (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.6, 3.1). Gastrointestinal Baxter et al. (2012)114 examined 43,702 LAIV recipients, 43,702 TIV recipients, and 53,366 matched unvaccinated controls, 5- 17 years of age between October 2003 and March 2008. Immunization status and hea lth outcomes were confirmed by a review of Kaiser Permanente's electronic medical records. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model , and relative risks (RR) were calculated as the ratio of the incidence rates without adjustment for any covar iate. Hazard ratios (HR) were also calculated adjusting for matching factors and seasonal changes in background rates. Results were significant in children aged 5 to 8 years vaccinated with LAI V \u2014 for acute GI event within 21 days (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05, 1.76) and 42 days (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.08, 1.78) and for acute respiratory tract event in 21 days (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00, 1.25) and 42 days (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06, 1.24) compared to the unvaccinated same age cohort. The incidence 76 rates of SAEs overall and by spec ific diagnosis were not significantly higher or lower in the LAIV recipients relative to control groups in any comparison. In another self -controlled case series, Glanz et al. (2011)115 studied 66,283 children aged 24- 59 months who received TIV vaccine be tween 2002 and 2006 in the United States . Immunization status and health outcomes were ascertained by a review of medical records. Data were modeled using conditional Poisson regression adjusted for calendar month (indicating influenza season) and age. The results showed that influenza vaccination w as significantly associated with medically confirmed GI tract disorders (RR 7.70, 95% CI 1.11, 53.52), fever (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.64, 1.80), and GI tract symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10, 1.25) in the risk windows of 0- 2, 1-14, and 1- 42 days after vaccination. Benchim et al 116 analyzed data from an Ontario, Canada, registry of over 25,000 pediatric patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Data were collected from 1999 to 2010. Patients with IBD were matched with controls according to gender, region, and age. The researchers studied receipt of any seasonal influenza vaccine; results were not stratified by type or season. Receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with health s ervices utilization (hospitalizations, ED visits, outpatient visits). A self -controlled case series analysis of patients with IBD -related health services utilization also found no association with influenza vaccination at any time period within six of mont hs of receipt. Urea Cycle Disorders In a self -controlled case series, Morgan et al. (2011)117 studied whether h yperammonemic episodes (HAE) were associated with vaccination in 169 U.S. children with urea cycle disorders .. The study included numerous vacci nes but reported only results for the influenza vaccines. Vaccination status and health outcomes were ascertained from clinical records. Data were analyzed used conditional Poisson regression that was adjusted for age. Results indicate that the influenza vaccination was not associated with HAE at any post vaccination risk period. Sickle Cell Disease In a matched case- control study, Ha mbidge et al. (2011)69 studied 1,294 (269 cases, 1,025 controls) children and adolescents (age 6 m onths to 17 years) in the United States using data from the 1999- 2006 Vaccine Safety Datalink program. This study also included a self -controlled case series analysis. Cases were identified as children who had received the TIV and had been hospitalized due to sickle cell crisis. M edical records were reviewed to confirm vaccination and hospitalization. Data were modeled using a conditional logistic regression and cases and controls were matched on age, gender, location, and influenza season. Results from both the case -control study a nd the self -controlled case series indicated that TIV is not associated with hospitalizations due to sickle cell crises. The authors note d that children classified as not receiving vaccine may have received vaccine from an outside provider. Summary Season al influenza vaccines were not associated with SAEs in the short term in children with cancer or who have received organ transplants. Due to small number and size of trials, the strength of evidence is low. Seasonal influenza vaccines were not associated w ith events requiring medical attention in IBD patients; strength of evidence is moderate due to a high quality epidemiological study including all children with IBD in a Canadian province. 77 In clinical trials of healthy children, seasonal influenza vaccines were not associated with SAEs in the short term. However, a recent study using the U .S. Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) found an association with febrile seizures, which increases with concom itant administration of PCV13. In the highest risk age group (16 months) estimated rate was 12.5 per 100,000 doses for TIV without concomitant PCV13, 13.7 per 100,000 doses for PCV13 without concomitant TIV, and 44.9 per 100,000 doses for concomitant TIV and PCV13. Strength of evidence is moderate for this AE, given the large number of subjects / statistical power of the study and the low risk of bias given that all vaccination and AE data was obtained through medical records. Our review of the IOM findings that evidence is \" inadequate to accept or reject \" an associatio n between influenza vaccines and ADEM, transverse myelitis, asthma exacerbation, or RAD in children, due to the dearth of studies on these issues , leads us to rate the evidence as insufficient to determine an association between influenza vaccines and thes e potential sequelae. In large, high quality post -licensure studies, both LAIV and TIV were associated with mild gastrointestinal disorders, such as vomiting and diarrhea in children in the short -term. Strength of evidence is moderate for these AEs . One la rge study found that younger vaccinated children (aged 5 to 8 years) were more likely to experience these symptoms than older vaccinated children (aged 9 to 17 years). (Children under 5 years of age were not included in that study). Seasonal influenza vaccines were associated with influenza- like symptoms in children in the short term, but strength of evidence is low, given the inconsistency of results. 78 Table 19.

Details are presented in Table 20. Results of the U .S. trial (N = 5,190) indicate d that vaccination agents Hib was associated with redness (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.57, 4.67) and swelling (OR 9.44, 95% CI 4.90, 18.19) , but not associated with hospitalizations. Vaccination was not associated with high fever in either the U .S. trial or a trial in the Philippines. A trial in Vietnam118 found the vaccine was not associated with any serious adverse events, including convulsion, diarrhea, fungal infection or GERD. No other AEs were associate d with vaccination. In sum, strength of evidence is moderate that no serious AEs are associated with Hib vaccine in the short term. Regarding long term, we identified no post -licensure studies that met our inclusion criteria. 86 Table 20.

The IOM committee found the evidence \"favors acceptance\" of a causal relationship between MMR and transient arthralgia in the pediatric population.129-135 They found the evidence \"favors rejection\" of a causal relationships between MMR and autism in the pediatric population.136-140 Finally, the IOM committee found the evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal r elationship in the pediatric population between and the c arthropathy . In addition, a causal relationship between the Urabe Strain of mumps and as eptic meningitis has been shown; there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn TM strain , commonly used in the United States , to this adverse event. We identified no additi onal trials and four postmarketing studies of MMR in children published after the IOM searches. Study designs included self -controlled case series and case- control . The studies were conducted in England, Denmark, Italy, Canada, and the United States . Data are displayed in Table 21. Purpura Andrews et al. (2012)141 studied 343 cases of thrombocytopenic purpura (TP) in children aged 12 to 23 months between 1990 and 2007. Vaccination status was ascertained using review of the immunization registry and health o utcomes from hospital discharge data. This study presented data from both a case -control design and a self -controlled case series. The self -controlled case series was adjusted for age only. The results indicate that the relative risk of TP was significant 14- 27 days (England: RR 3.13, 95% 1.44, 6.79; Denmark: RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.61, 4.69) after immunization and 0- 42 days after immunization in both England (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.02, 3.59) and Denmark (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.34, 2.99). The data from Denmark w ere used in a model adjusting for age (1 -month intervals), calendar period ( one year intervals), gender, place of birth, ethnicity of mother (Danish or not), and maternal age at birth. Similar results were obtained with a significant relative risk of TP at 14 -27 days (RR 2.54, CI 95% 1.47, 4.37) and 0- 42 days (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.23, 2.78) after immunization with MMR. Bertuola et al. (2010) 142 studied 2,311 children from four pediatric hospitals in Italy between November 1999 and December 2007. The sample included 387 cases (mean age: 4.9 years) of idiopathic thrombocytic purpura (ITP) and 1,924 controls (mean age: 5.7 years) who had gastroduodenal lesions or neurological disorders. Vaccination with MMR was confirmed using physician self -report , and health outcomes were ascertained using emergency department and hospital records. Analysis adjusted for age and use of NSAIDs, acetaminophen, antibacterials, mucolytics, and corticosteroids. There was a statistically significant association between vaccination with MMR and ITP (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2, 4.7) . Results were also significant for use of each medication except corticosteroids. The VSD was used to study the association between several vaccines and ITP. 143 (Details are displayed in Table 29 on studies of multiple vacci nes.) MMR was associated with ITP in infants 12 to 19 months old (OR 5.48, 95% CI 1.61, 18.64). 89 Hospitalization or ER visits In a self -controlled case series study, Wilson et al. (2011)144 studied 413,957 Canadian children who were vaccinated against MMR at 12- 18 months of age between 2006 and 2009. Vaccination status was ascertained by a review of records from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan database. Health outcomes were verified using national databases like the Discharge Abstract Database and the Nat ional Ambulatory Care Registration System. Data were analyzed using a fixed effects Poisson regression model. The results show that the relative risk of hospitalization/ED use was significant on days 4 -12 (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.29-1.38) following the 12 -month vaccination, and during days 10 to 12 after the 18- month vaccination. Autism In a case- control study of 189 young adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder and 224 controls , Uno et al. 2012145 found that childhood receipt of mumps -measles -rubella (MMR) vaccine was not associated with an increased rate of new onset autism (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.64, 1.90) . Summary The IOM found that evidence \"convincingly supports\" a causal relationship between MMR and anaphylaxis in children allergic to ingredients , and an associati on of MMR vaccine with febrile seizures. We reviewed and agree with th ese determinations; thus , we rate the strength of evidence as high . MMR vaccination was associated with thrombocytopenic purpura in children in the short term after vaccination. Streng th of evidence is moderate, as findings have been consistent and odds ratios similar in three European countries, Canada and the United States . A large post -licensure study found that MMR vaccination is associated with increased emergency department visits within two weeks. This is consistent with the IOM's findings that MMR vaccine is associated with febrile seizures. The IOM found that the evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship in the pediatric population between MMR the following: MS onset, and chronic arthropathy. We reviewed the IOM evidence and ag ree that evidence is insufficient to determine an association. The IOM findings favor rejection of a causal relationship between MMR vaccination and autism.

We identified 3 5 eligible trials of rotavirus vaccine.146-177 We excluded several trials because the dosage was not comparable to that of the current product. We also excluded studies of Rotashield, which was withdrawn from the market in 1999 because of conce rns regarding risk of intussusception. Participants in the accepted studies received 2 -3 oral admini stered doses of Rotarix (18 studies) or RotaTeq (15 studies). Most participants were between 4 and 20 months of age. Studies were conducted in North Americ a, South America, Europe, and Asia. The number of participants ranged from 100 to over 60,000. In general, neither Rotarix nor RotaTeq was associated with increased risk of AEs other than cough, runny nose or irritability. The only exception was an associa tion of RotaTeq with respiratory and thoracic disorders in a trial of children with HIV in Sub -Saharan Africa. 157 Data from the studies are displayed in Table 22. 95 Table 22.

Al l studied intussusception, as an earlier brand of rotavirus vaccine (Rotashield) was withdrawn from the market in 1999 due to concerns about this AE. Studies are displayed in Table 23. Intussusc eption Buttery et al. (2011)181 studied children under the age of 24 months who received either RotaTeq (N=296,023) or Rotarix ( N=302,455) between July 2007 and December 2008. Vaccination sta tus was ascertained through a national vaccination registry. Health outcomes were collected using active surveillance: the Aust ralian Pediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU), the Pediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS), and from the active surveillance of four major tertiary pediatric hospitals. Relative risk ratios were estimated to compare observed and expected cases o f intussusception by age. For the RotaTeq vaccine, in the 1- 7 days post vaccination period, the risk of intussusception was significant after the first dose (RR 5.26, 95% CI 1.09, 15.4) but insignificant after the second and third dose s. The overall relati ve risk of intussusception was insignificant (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.37, 2.68) during this period. There was a similar decreasing trend in the risk of intussusception with each dose in the 21- day period after vaccination; only dose one had a significant associa tion (RR 3.51, 95% CI 1.29, 7.64). In with Rotarix, risk of intussusception was insigni ficant for all doses; the overall relative risk was 1.58 (95% CI 0.51, 3.69) for the 7 -day post vaccination period and 1.37 (95% CI 0.73, 2.34) for t he 21- day period. In a self -controlled case series, Velazquez et al. (2012) 182 studied 698 infants (age< 1 year) with intussusception between January 2008 and October 2010 in Mexico. Use of the Rotarix vaccine was confirmed using immunization cards or a r eview of all available medical records. In the absence of medical records , vaccination status was ascertained using parent/guardian reported data. Active surveillance identified cases of intussusception through reviews of admission and discharge logs from hospitals, emergency departments, pediatric, surgery and radiology wards. Episodes of intussusception were confirmed using radiography, surgery , or post mortem examination. Data were modeled using a conditional Poisson regression and adjusted for age as a potential confounder. The relative incidence of intussusception was significant after dose 1 during the 0 -6 days (RR 6.49, 95% CI 4.17, 10.09), 0 (RR 3.24, 95% CU 2.15, 4.87), and 0- 30 days (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.24, 2.48) post vaccination periods. The risk of intussusception after dose 2 was not significant for all three post vaccination periods studied. Patel et al. (2011) 183 studied 2,665 infants (615 cases of intussusception, 2,050 controls), 45- 245 days of age from 53 hospitals in seven states in Brazil and from 16 hospitals in 10 states in Mexico. This study reports two sets of results, one as a case -control study and the other as a self -controlled case series. Vaccination with Rotarix was ascertained by a review of medical records , and cases of intussusception were verified by a review of clinical records. Data were analyzed using a conditional logistic regression model that was matched by date of birth, and also controlled for age and sex. For the children studied in Mexico, the likelihood of int ussusception in the case -control analysis was significant (OR 5.8, 95% CI 2.6, 13.0) at 1- 7 days but not at 8- 14 days or 15- 21 days after vaccination. After the second dose, the likelihood of intussusception was significant 8- 14 days (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2, 4.4) days after vaccination but not in the other periods. The case -control analysis of data from the children in Brazil showed no significant relationship between vaccine and 106 intussusception at any time period after dose 1, but showed a significant associat ion (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1, 3.4) within 1- 7 days after dose 2. The results of Patel's self-controlled case seri es analyses183 showed a significant association of Rotarix with intussusception in 1- 7 days after the first dose (OR 5.3, 95% CI 3.0, 9.3) and 8- 14 days (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2, 4.2) and 15- 21 days (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2, 4.0) after the second dose in children in Mexico. In Brazil, the association with intussusception after the first dose of Rotarix was insign ificant at each time period, but significant (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3, 5.2) 1- 7 days after the second dose. Two post -licensure studies were recently conducted in the U.S. Shui, 2012184 analyzed VSD data on 786,725 doses of RotaTeq and found no association with intussusception at any time after vaccination. However, a recent analysis of data from the U .S. Post -Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) program185 found that RotaTeq was associated with intussusception after Dose 1 and Rotarix associated with this AE after Dose 2. The RotaTeq analys is had higher statistical power, as that vaccine was administered to orders of magnitude more children than Rotarix. Estimated rate of intussusception was 1.1 to 1.5 cases per 100,000 dose s of RotaTeq and 5.1 cases per 100,000 doses of Rotarix. Summary Vaccines against rotavirus were not included in the 2011 IOM report. Both RotaTeq and Rotarix were associated with cough, runny nose and irritability in children. There is moderate strength evidence from several RCTs for these mild, short -term adverse events . In clinical trials, there was no association between either of the two currently available vaccines (RotaTeq and Rotarix) and any serious adverse events, including intussusception. A high quality epidemiological study (N = 296,023) conducted in Australi a found RotaTeq associated with intussusception in children 1 to 21 days following the first of three required doses. While a study of the U .S. VSD found no association, a large high quality U .S. study also found RotaTeq associated with intussusception aft er the first dose. Estimated rate of intussusception was 1.1 to 1.5 cases per 100,000 doses. Two case -control studies conducted in Latin America found an association with intussusception in children following the first of two required doses of Rotarix. One study estimated Rotarix increases risk by 3.7 (95% CI 1.2, 7.3) additional cases per 100,000 person/years in Mexico. The other Latin American study estimated risk as one case per 51,000 vaccines in Mexico and one case per 68,000 vaccines in Brazil. A lar ge high quality study in the United States found Rotarix associated with intussusception after Dose 2; rate was 5.1 cases per 100,000 doses. Given the totality of scientific findings, the strength of evidence is moderate for an association of intussuscept ion with both Rotateq and Rotarix. Although no cases were reported in over 30 well - designed clinical trials conducted around the world, such trials are not powered to detected adverse events that occur so infrequently. The most recent post -licensure study used the strongest design yet and included all cases from eight large U.S. HMOs. This study supports findings from the 2011 epidemiological study of over 500,000 children in Australia and two small studies conducted in Latin America . 107 Table 23.

The IOM found insufficient evidence to accept or reject a causal relationship with any other AEs. A 2002 IOM review on Hep atitis B vaccine and demyelinating neurological disorders concluded that the evidence \" favors rejection \" of a causal relationship with incident MS or MS relapse. 98 We found no trial s and one postmarketing study of Hepatitis B vaccine in children or adolescents. Data from this study are displayed i n Table 24. Autism Gallagher and Goodman (2010)186 conducted a secondary analysis of 7,074 boys, age 3 to 17 years, born prior to 1999, usi ng the National Health Interview Survey through 2002. Vaccination status and health outcomes were reported by parents in an interview with trained interviewers who asked them to gather vaccination records in advance. Data were analyzed using a logistic regression adjusted for race/ethnicity, two- parent household, and maternal education. Result was significant for the risk of autism in children who received their rst dose of Hepatitis B vaccine during the rst month of life (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.11, 8.13), com pared with those who received the vaccination after the first month of life or not at all. Significant protective factors included non-Hispanic white ethnicity (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15, 0.88), and belonging to a household with two parents (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12, 0.75). It is unclear why the authors selected \"first month of life\" as the only vaccination time period studied, without presenting analyses for other time periods or comparing \"ever vaccinated\" with \"never vaccinated.\" The IOM found \"insufficient\" evi dence of association of Hepatitis B vaccine with any short or long term adverse events in children. Our findings support that conclusion. Based on the newly identified study discussed above, there is insufficient evidence of an association of the Hepatitis B with autism in children. 114 Table 24.

Except where noted below, studies did not report specific AEs by age. The IOM committee found the evidence \"favors acceptance\" of a causal relationship between the HPV vaccine and anaphylaxis. The IOM committee found the evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" causal relationships between the and transverse vents , and hypercoagulable s tates. We found thirteen additional reports of trials of the HPV vaccine in children and adolescents; eleven187-193 were or iginal trials, and two194,195 were longitudinal follow ups of clinical trials . Data from these studies are displayed in Table 25. Participants were between 7 and 27 years of age and received either placebo or three doses of vaccine (either Cervarix or Gard asil). The trials were conducted in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, Australia, and Africa. Most participants were female; one trial 187 with a later follow -up193 was conducted in males. That trial found a significant association between vaccinat ion with Gardasil and respiratory and thoracic disorders in the 15 days post -vaccination (OR 20.78, 95% CI 7.09, 60.89). One study of Gardasil190 included only children with HIV; that trial found no AEs associated with vaccination. A trial of 208 females in Korea191 found an association between Cervarix and medically significant adverse conditions (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.23, 3.07). Cervarix was associated with the following Grade 3 (severe) adverse events: arthralgias (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.29, 5.59), fatigue (OR 1 .96, 95% CI 1.39, 2.77), GI symptoms (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.39, 4.19), and rash (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.23, 5.80). (In this study, Grade 3 events were defined as severe enough to prevent normal daily activity.) A Cervarix trial conducted in Taiwan, Germany, Hondura s, Panama, and Columbia 196 followed girls aged 10 to 14 for 48 months post -vaccination. The vaccine was not associated with serious adverse events in the short or long term. However, only girls who had received the vaccine were followed long term; therefore, there is no control group for the follow -up phase of the study, and long -term safety could not be evaluated versus control . A trial conducted in West Africa197 did not find an association between Cervarix and onset of chronic disease (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29 -1.23). A small trial (N = 67) in Bangladesh 198 found Cervarix associated with \"any adverse event\" in the five days after each of the three doses. Adverse events included fever, headache, GI symptoms, and injection site issues. The most common AE was pa in at the injection site; this was reported by 50% of vaccinees after Dose 1 and 72% after Dose 2. A strong association between Gardasil and \"vaccine related adverse events\" was found in a Korean trial.199 during seven months follow -up. There was no diffe rence in rate of serious AEs between vaccine and placebo group. Again, the most common AE was pain at injection site, reported by 72.6% of vaccinees. We identified a secondary analysis200 of data on young black women enrolled in two double - blind placebo- controll ed trials of Gardasil (N = 706) in North America, South America , and Europe. This report presented results separately for women who became pregnant within the follow -up period that ranged from three to four years; they comprised one quarter of the st udy participants. Receipt of vaccine was associated with spontaneous abortion (miscarriage): in the vaccine group 19 of 307 pregnancies resulted in spontaneous abortion, compared to seven of 393 pregnancies in the placebo groups. Of note, HPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant 116 women. Study participants were required to be on birth control and were tested for pregnancy before each of the three required vaccinations. Anyone testing positive was excused from the study. 117 Table 25.

Note: Additional study details presented in A ppendix C evidence tables . 124 We found three postmarketing studies of HPV in adolescents / young adults published after the IOM report and one long -term follow -up of trial participants. Data from the studies are presented in Table 26. Various Illnesses Between A ugust 2006 and March 2008, Chao et al. (2012)201 followed 189,629 females, aged 9 to 26 years, who had received the HPV vaccine from two MCOs. Immunization with HPV vaccine was ascertained by a review of health records and health outcomes were identified through electronic health records followed by in- depth case review by a panel of experts. Data were analyzed to generate incidence rate ratio (IRR) estimates of onset of select autoimmune conditions in the vaccinated group compared to unvaccinated female populations of similar age . Vaccinated patients had a significantly lower incidence of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (IRR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14, 0.71) and Type 1 diabetes (IRR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45, 0.70), they had a higher incidence of Hashimoto's disease (IRR 2.02, 95% CI 1.65, 2.60); the authors report that an investigation of a temporal relationship and biological plausibility revealed no consistent evidence of a safety signal. Gee et al. (2011) 202 studied the administration of 600,558 doses of HPV4 in females age 9 to 26 years in seven large MCOs between August 2006 and October 2009. Vaccination status and health outcomes were confirmed using weekly standardized data les from participating MCOs. Case ascertainment was limited to the rst episode in a particular time period. Data were analyzed using Poisson based maximized sequential probability ratio test ( MaxSPRT) and a logistic regression model (appendicitis only). The logistic regression was adjusted for s ex, age, and seasonality. No statistically significant increased risk for any of the pre-specified adverse events (appendic itis, Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, seizures, stroke, syncope, v enous thromboembolism) was detected after vaccination. Klein and colleagues 203 analyzed data from enrollees in a California MCO who had received either Gardasil or Cervarix. Over 44,000 females received all three recommended doses. Fifty medical categories had significantly elevated ORs during at least one risk interval. Patient chart review found that most diagnoses existed before vaccination or that diagnostic workups were initiated at vaccine visit. Experts judged that only skin infections within two weeks of vaccine (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3 -2.4) and syncope on day of vaccination (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 3.9 -9.2) were likely associated with the vaccine. Summary Short term adverse events including fever, headache, GI symptoms, and injection site issues were associated with HPV vaccine consistently in double -blind placebo- controlled trials . The most common adverse event was pain at the injection site; strength of evidence is high for this association due to the overwhelming consistency of results . Strength of evidence is moderate for the others listed. A large high quality post -licensure s tudy conducted in the U .S. found that HPV vaccine was associated with skin infection within two weeks and syncope on day of vaccination. SOE is moderate due to low risk of bias and strong study design. The IOM found evidence \"favors acceptance\" of a causal relationship between the HPV vaccine and anaphylaxis in children and adolescents who may be allergic to ingredients. Our review of the IOM supports this finding ; thus, strength of evidence is rated moderate . 125 We found moderate strength evidence that HPV vaccine is not associated with onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or Type 1 diabetes. Although w e identified only one post -licensure study on these disease s, the study included hundreds of thousands of doses and used computerized medical records to co nfirm vaccination and outcomes. We found insufficient evidence that HPV vaccine may be associated with onset of Hashimoto's disease, as the one study that investigated a temporal relationship and biological plausibility revealed no consistent evidence of a safety signal. Strength of evidence is moderate that HPV vaccine is not associated with appendicitis, Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, seizures, stroke, or venous thromboembolism , based on a well - designed study of over 600,000 doses administered to patients in US HMOs. A secondary analysis of long -term follow -up data on young black women who participated in two controlled trials of HPV vaccine reported an association with spontaneous abortion of pregnancies within three to four years of vaccination. There is insuf ficient evidence to conclude causality; however, this signal should be investigated in other data sets. The IOM found that the evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" causal relationships between HPV the following: events, and hypercoagulable states. We reviewed their findings and agree wi th their conclusions. Thus, strength of evidence is rated insufficient to determine association of these sequelae with vaccination. 126 Table 26.

We found one new study in children (Table 27). Barbosa, 2012206 randomized 54 Brazilia n children with systemic lu pus erythematosus (SLE) to placebo or vaccine, and also vaccinated 28 health y children who were matched controls. The authors reported no difference in AEs between placebo and control groups. Data on specific AEs was not provided. Summary Based on our revi ew of the IOM findings, t here is high strength evidence that vaccination of immunocompromised children against varicella is associated with disseminated Oka VZV with or without subsequent infection resulting in pneumonia,204 meningitis, or hepatitis. There is insufficient evidence regarding association of varicella virus vaccine and seizures, ADEM, transverse myelitis, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, small fiber neuropathy, onset or exacerbation of arthropathy, and thrombocytopenia. Based on one small controlled trial of vaccine in Brazilian children, t here is insufficient evidence to determine whether varicella vaccine is safe in children with SLE. 131 Table 27.

The IOM committee did not find evidence that \"favors acceptance\" of causal relationships for any conditions. They found the evidence \"favors rejection\" of a causal relationship between ty pe 1 diabetes and vaccines containing diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis antigens. 207-211 The IOM committee found the evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" causal relationships between diphtheria toxoid- , tetanus toxoid- or and SIDS. We found no additional studies in children published afte r the IOM search date; our review of their findings leads to a rating of moderate strength of evidence for each of the associations they investigated . Meningococcal Vaccine The IOM found the evidence \"convincingly supports\" a causal relationship with anaphylaxis in children who may be allergic to ingredients. The committee found the evidence \"inadequate to accept or reject\" causal relationships between CIDP, and chronic headache. The IOM conclusion does not differentiate between meningoccal conjugate or meningococcal polysacchar ide vaccine. We found two studies of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine in children (Table 28) 212,213 published after the IOM report. A trial in Saudi Arabia found no statistical association with Grade 2 or 3 fever, malaise, myalgia or headache in the short term. A trial in the United States and South America 213 found vaccina tion was not associated with severe change in eating habits, severe irritability, severe persistent crying, severe sleepiness or urticaria in the year following vaccination. Per the findings of the IOM, s trength of evidence is moderate that meningococcal v accine may cause anaphylaxis in children who are allergic to ingredients. Strength of evidence is insufficient to determine an association between meningococcal vaccine and the serious adverse events encephalitis, encephalopathy, ADEM, transverse myelitis, MS, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, CIDP, and chronic headache. Strength of evidence is insufficient to determine association with less serious events such as headache, irritability, and urticaria. 133 Table 28.

These, along with all studies of multiple vaccines in children, are displayed in Table 29. A study in the Netherlands using parent questionnaires to ascertain vaccination status and health outcomes found no association between rece ipt of a combined DTP -IPV vaccine and asthma, hay fever, eczema, food allergy or atopic disorders (Bernsen, 2006).214 A case- control study of over 2,000 children with atopic dermatitis and a family history of allergy in twelve Western countries (Gruber, 2008)215 found newborns immunized against polio had higher odds (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.08, 6.25) of sensitivity to food allergens. This relationship did not hold for those immunized against polio later in life. The study also found that a significant relationshi p between Hepatitis B vaccine in the first 6 months of life with elevated total IgE (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.03, 2.13). Varicella vaccine seemed to have a protective effect against elevated total IgE. A German study (Mommers, 2004) 216 found no relationship betwe en vaccination against pertussis, measles, rubella, or Hib and atopic disease. A self-controlled case series of premature infants born in the United States (Mullooly, 2007)217 found no increased risk of wheezing and lower respiratory syndrome associated wi th DTaP, inactivated polio virus (IPV), Hib, varicella, PCV7, MMR, or TIV vaccination. In fact, some of the vaccines had a protective effect in the week after vaccination. Finally, Thomson 218 found no association of MMR vaccine with asthma in an Australian cohort. (Two diphtheria -tetanus vaccines not currently used in the United States were also studied; no association with asthma was found.) Seizures Sun, 2012219 examined national registry data on over 378,000 children who received a combined DTaP -IPV-Hib vaccine in Denmark from 2003- 2009. They assessed the association of vaccination with febrile seizures, controlling for birth circumstances, demographics, and family history of epilepsy. In both a cohort analysis and self -controlled case series (SCCS), risk of febrile seizures on the day of vaccination was significant (cohort - first vaccination, HR 6.02, 95% CI 2.86, 12.65; cohort - second vaccination, HR 3.94, 95% CI 2.18, 7.10; SCCS - first vaccination, 95% CI SCCS - second vaccinati on, HR 3.97, 95% CI 2.20, 7.16). An American study (Chen, 1997) 220 investigated the relationship between DTP and MMR vaccines and seizures in children from four HMOs in the United States . For DTP, the relative risk for seizures was elevated on the day of v accination (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.50, 3.40). For MMR, the risk was elevated on days 4 to 7 (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.20, 2.70) and 8 to 14 (RR 2.50, 95% CI 2.20, 3.30) after vaccination. The authors also investigated the relationship between Td vaccination and emergency department visit or hospitalization. They found that risk of emergency department visit was elevated within 14 days of vaccination. Gold, 2010 221 also studied the relationship between DTP and MMR vaccines and seizures. They used Australian registry da ta and medical records to ascertain vaccination status and health outcomes. For MMR, the risk for seizures was elevated between days 6 to 11 after exposure (IRR 2.11 95% CI 1.43, 3.10). For DTP, the risk was not elevated during any time period studied. 135 Bell's Palsy A small self -controlled case series of 233 Bell's Palsy cases in Northern California (Rowhani, 2012)222 found no association with vaccination with TIV or Hepatitis B vaccine. Guillain -Barre Syndrome (GBS) Velentgas and colleagues223 were tasked with investigating the association between meningococcal conjugate vaccine and GBS in children and adolescents enrolled in five MCOs in the United States . Between March 2005 and August 2008, there were no reported cases of GBS within 42 days following vacc ination with MCV4. The same was true for Tdap, Td, and Tetanus vaccination. There was one case each for MPSV4 and HPV; there were two cases reported for TIV and Hepatitis B vaccine. The authors calculated the attributable risks per one million vaccinations as displayed in Table 29 below. Leukemia Groves and colleagues224 included 439 children in nine Midw est and Mid -Atlantic states with lymphoblastic leukemia in a case -control analysis to investigate any possible relationship with oral or injected polio va ccine, diphtheria -tetanus pertussis vaccine, MMR, Hib, or Hepatitis B vaccine. Controls were selected using random -digit dialing, which resulted in controls of higher SES then the 439 cases. Analysis controlled for age at censoring, year of birth, sex, rac e, family income, parental education and attendance at daycare and/or preschool. Data collection forms were completed by mothers using vaccination records. None of the vaccines were associated with leukemia. The relationship between vaccination and leuke mia was also assessed in a case- control study of children enrolled in a large HMO in Northern California. (Ma, 2005) 225 Cases were matched on date of birth, sex, and race / ethnicity. Analysis also controlled for maternal education and family income. Vacci nation and diagnosis were ascertained through medical records. None of the vaccines investigated (DPT, polio vaccine, MMR, Hib, Hepatitis B vaccine) were associated with increased risk of leukemia. The Cross -Canada Childhood Leukemia Study (MacArthur, 2008) 226 was a case control study which found no association between vaccines against mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, or Hepatitis B and leukemia. Vaccinations were administered from 1990 to 1994. Data was acquired through population registries. Analysis adjusted for maternal education, annual household income, ethnicity, maternal age at birth, and number of residences since birth. Multivariate models relied on strata formed by the following matching factors: province, gender, and age. Finally, a case- control study of over 14,000 children born in Texas (Pagaoa, 2011) 227 found no associ ation between DTaP, IPV, MMR, Hib, Hepatitis B , and Varicella vaccines and acute lymphoblastic leukemia using data from cancer registry and medical records. Analysis adjusted for sex, child's birth year, child's ethnicity, child's birth weight, mother's age at child's birth. Diabetes Hummel228 conducted a secondary analysis of data from the BABYDIAB study in Germany to investigate the possible association of many factors (breast feeding, vaccinations, environmental, infections) and development of islet antibodies before the age of two. They included vaccines for Hib, measles, mumps, and rubella (separately) in their analyses; no association with the vaccines was found. 136 Purpura A recent analysis investigated possible relationships between Hib, PCV, MMR, DTaP, TIV, Hepatitis immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in enrolled in five U .S. HMOs. (O'Lea ry, 2012)143 In children from 12 to 19 months of age, MMR vaccine was associated with purpura (IRR 5.48, 95% CI 1.61, 18.64). None of the vaccines were associated with purpura in children aged two to six years. Purpura was associated with vaccination against Hepatitis A in children aged 7 to 17 years (IRR 23.14, 95% CI 3.59, 149.30) and a vaccination against varicella in children aged 11 to 17 years (IRR 12.14, 95% CI 1.10, 133.96). Encephalitis Pahud, 2012 investigated whether various factors were associa ted with encephalitis in California children and adolescents.229 Of 1,434 cases, immunization records were requested for over 800 and received for only 246. Of these, 136 were excluded due to incomplete records or no vaccinations in the one -year observatio n period. In the 110 encephalitis cases included, there was no association with either measles virus -containing vaccines or pertussis antigen -containing vaccines. Summary Strength of evidence is insufficient to determine an association between polio vacci ne in newborns and sensitivity to food allergens. Strength of evidence is also insufficient to determine an association between Hepatitis B vaccine in the first 6 months of life and elevated total IgE. Strength of evidence is based on associations reported in one medium size study (N = 2,173) of children with a family history of food allergy living in 12 countries in multiple continents. Strength of evidence of association of DTaP -IPV-Hib vaccination with febrile seizures in children in the short -term is moderate, based on a very large, high quality study. There is high strength evidence that MMR, DTaP, Td, Hib, Hepatitis B, and polio vaccine vaccinations are not associated with childhood leukemia.. This rating is based on four high quality case- control st udies that consistently found no association . All studies had low risk of bias and adjust ed for important confounders in their analyses. In the short -term, purpura was associated with vaccination against Hepatitis A in children aged 7 to 17 years, vaccina tion against varicella in children aged 11 to 17, and MMR in children from 12 to 19 months of age. Strength of evidence is moderate. Cases were rare (one or two per age group), and the majority were mild. 137 Table 29.

Influenza Vaccines We identified four studies comparing va ccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women; the results are displayed in Table 31. A cohort study by Lin et al in Taiwan230 compared 396 pregnant women who receiv ed AdimFlu -S influenz a A (monovalent H1N1) between October 2009 and February 2010 with unvaccina ted pregnant women; no difference in SAEs was a Level of certainty was operationalized as the 95 -percent confidence interval surrounding the risk or odds estimate \u2014i.e., the statistical significance . 152 reported . A comparison of the medical records of the age -matched groups showed that significantly fewer women in the vaccinated group experienced at least one adverse event during the study period compared to unvaccinated women (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22, 0.68). O ne statistically significant adverse event difference in the infants was observed: h yperbilirubinemia was much less common in the vaccinated group (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03, 0.2). A Canadian cohort study231 by Fell and colleagues included 55,570 pregnant women who delivered a single baby during the 2009/2010 influenza season. Women vaccinated during pregnancy with monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccines were statistically less likely to experience a fetal death (OR 0 .60, 95% CI 0.44 -0.81) , preterm birth defined as below ( OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85, 0.98) , infants age (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66, 0.83), or delivering infants before 0.72, 95% CI receipt of monovalent H1N1 by pregnant women. Receipt of vaccination was associated with lower risk of low birth weight and premature infants. Nordin233 used the VSD to assess the safety of TIV in pregnant women. No cases of GBS, transverse myelitis, optic neuritis, or Bell's Palsy were reported in the 42 days post -vaccination in this cohort of over 200,000 women. No association between the vaccine and serious adverse events was found. Infant outcomes were not studied. 153 Table 31.

One study (Omer, 2011)235 on TIV included 4,168 pregnant women and their newborns followed during the 2004/05 and 2005/06 flu seasons in the United States . Vaccination status and health outcomes were ascertained using self -reported data. The a nalysis adjusted for potential confounders including various types of influenza activity periods, maternal health , and demographic variables. Results showe d that infants born during the influenza vaccine season to women who were vaccinated were less likel y to be premature compared to infants born in the same period to unvaccinated mothers (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38, 0.94) . This relationship increased (adjusted OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26, 0.73) during periods of local influenza activity, and was at its greate st during periods of widespread influenza activity . Results also indicate that during widespread influenza activity periods , newborns of vaccinated mothers had 69% lower odds of being small for gestationa l age (adjusted OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13, 0.75) compared with newborns of unvaccinated mothers. Irving236 used VSD to conduct a case -control study of miscarriage; no association with TIV was found. Regarding monovalent H1N1, (Xu, 2012)237 studied data obtained from 198 pregnant women who enrolled before 20 weeks of gestation in the U .S. Vaccine and Medication in Pregnancy Surveillance System study. The aim of this study was not to assess the effect of H1N1 on childbirth outcomes, but to illustrate the use of survival analysis methods. Data were analyzed using ti me-independent (naive) and time -dependent covariate Cox models to account for left - truncation (due to possible enrollment later than conception). The model was adjusted for time of vaccine exposure (1 st, 2nd trimester), previous spontaneous abortion events , maternal smoking habits, age, and the presence of asthma. Vaccination was not statistically associated with spontaneous abortions during any trimester. Summary We found moderate strength evidence that neither monovalent H1N1 vaccine nor trivalent inactiv ated vaccine (TIV) is associated with serious adverse events in pregnant women or their offspring. Several studies report that these vaccines decrease the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. 156 Table 32.

Prematurity was defined as birth < 37 weeks gestation; SGA was defined as birth weight <10th percentile for gestational age. Infants born during the putative vaccine season to women who were vaccinated were less likely to be premature compared to infants born in the same period to unvaccinated mothers (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94) During the period of local influenza activity, this relationship increased (adjusted OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.73)) During the widespread influenza activ ity period, this relationship was greatest: adjusted OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.11. to 0.74) Also during the widespread influenza activity period, compared with newborns of unvaccinated mothers, newborns of vaccinated mothers had 69% lower odds of being SGA (adjust ed OR 0.31, 0.13 to 0.75).

We conducted an extensive literature search for clinical trials and observational studies meeting our inclusion criteria: cohort studies comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, case - control studies, self -controlled case series , and multivariate risk factor analyses. In this chapter, we describe the limitations of our review and present our conclusions. We also include a section on Research Gaps. Limitations Our literature search procedures were extensive; however, some unpublis hed trial results may not have been identified. An independent Scientific Resource Center (SRC) under contract with AHRQ requested Scientific Information Packets (SIPs) from the manufacturers of all vaccines routinely recommended in the United States . (The research team was prohibited from contacting manufacturers directly.) Only two companies responded; both manufacture vaccines against seasonal influenza. We excluded non- English language studies. Although we were considering only vaccines approved for use in the United States , it is possible relevant epidemiological studies have been published in non- English journals. An important limitation common to systematic reviews is the quality of the original studies included. We used a quality -rating instrument 32 developed by another Evidence -based Practice Center specifically to evaluate studies reporting harms. The scores are presented in the results tables and taken into consideration when rating the strength of the evidence. Studies that reported timing and sev erity, and defined AEs using standard, precise definitions were rated higher than those that did not. Epidemiological studies that used medical records to ascertain vaccination and health outcomes were also rated higher than those that relied on patient or parent report. Strengths and weaknesses of studies vary according to their design. Cohort studies of vaccines may use multivariate analyses to control for confounding factors, but they cannot capture potential differences between those who get vaccinated and those who do no. Self -controlled case series control for patient characteristics that do not change over time (gender, race- ethnicity, genetics) but cannot capture factors that are time- related. This is especially important when studying vaccinations of infants and toddlers. Studies using passive surveillance such as the U .S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), 16 are crucial in identifying signals regarding adverse events post -licensure. However, because by definition they do not consider the rate of such events in non- vaccinated populations, they are not designed to assess a statistical association between a vaccine and an adverse event, so they were excluded from this project. Thus, there may be important adverse event signals not identifie d in this report that warrant future research. We included controlled trials that used formulations currently approved in the United States . We tried to exclude Phase II studies that used dosages that were never licensed and/ or formulations available only in other countries. Some studies reported the potency of the vaccines under study in a different manner or unit than that reported in other studies or the product materials. We assessed these findings to the best of our capabilities. We point out discrepa ncies in our results text. 159 Except where explicitly stated in the text, controlled trials of vaccines are conducted in healthy patients. Thus, persons who may be more susceptible to AEs may be excluded from trials, yet eligible to receive a vaccine after it is licensed. In addition, trials are generally underpowered to detect very rare events. For example, a trial of 1,000 patients may not detect an AE with an expected incidence of one in 5,000. Trials may also be underpowered to assess risk factors for the AEs they do detect. Post-licensure epidemiological studies are conducted to investigate possible associations between vaccines and AEs reported in passive surveillance or multiple case reports. Such studies often do not limit their investigation to a particular brand or formulation. They may lump vaccines against a specific disease together. For example, a study might investigate the effect of \"seasonal influenza vaccines\" in general. Formulations of seasonal influenza vaccines change each season, the vaccine comes in inactivated or live form, and a particular batch may or may not contain a strain of H1N1. It is difficult to assess the applicability of studies that do not report specific details about vaccines. In many studies, the severity of AEs was not r eported. Our researchers coded the severity according to CATAE classification when possible. Severity is listed in our tables where available. Most studies did not investigate potential risk factors for AEs that were found to be associated with vaccination . Some post -licensure surveys use patient or parent recall for ascertainment of vaccination or health outcomes, rather than medical records. Subjects may not have copies of their vaccination or medical records, introducing recall bias. Advanced health inf ormation technology (HIT) systems that contain vaccination and medical records can make surveys unnecessary, leading to higher quality studies. In the United States , the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) uses data obtained through such systems at nine la rge health care organizations, enabling very high quality studies. Nations with single payer healthcare often have electronic registries, which allow epidemiological studies of entire populations. Conclusions Table 33 summarize s our conclusions, given the caveats described in the Limitations section. The second column displays the strength of evidence (SOE) regarding statistical association of each vaccine type with key AEs. 160 Table 33.

Evidence \"convincingly supports\" a causal relationship between influenza vaccines and anaphylaxis in persons allergic to egg or gelatin. However, in recent years, manufacturers have reduced the egg protein content. Many clinical trials reported that influe nza vaccines are associated with arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, and pain in the short -term in adults. These adverse events ( AEs) were not considered serious; severity was graded mild to moderate. Odds of experiencing these events were 1.5 to 2 times higher in vaccinated patients than in unvaccinated. R isk factors were not discussed in the trials . A high quality meta-analysis found an association between 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine and Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) in the 42 days post vaccination; re sults translate to about 1.6 excess cases per million vaccinated. Post-licensure studies have found inconsistent evidence associating influenza vaccines with onset or exacerbation of MS in adults. Post-licensure studies have found influenza vaccines are NOT associated with increased risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events in the elderly. Post-licensure studies have shown that influenza vaccines are NOT associated with increased risk of serious AEs ( SAEs ) in renal patients. MMR Vaccine Modera te - No association with Type 1 diabetes Moderate - transient arthralgia in women Insufficient - MS onset, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, chronic arthralgia in women, and chronic arthritis and arthropathy in men.

However, investigation of a temporal relationship and biological plausibility revealed no consistent evidence of a safety signal. A large post -licensure study found HPV vaccine was NOT associated with Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, seizures, stroke, syncope, or venous thromboembolism . Several clinical trials found HPV vaccination associated with short -term severe pain at injection site. Trials also found vaccine associated with fever, headache, nausea and stomach ache. A secondary analysis including only black women who became pregnant within 3 to 4 years of receiving HPV vaccine in two trials reported a higher rate of spontaneous abortion in vaccinated subjects. 165 Table 33.

Influenza Vaccines Moderate - mild gastrointestinal disorders, febrile seizures Low - No association with other Serious Adverse Events in the short term in children with cancer or who have received organ transplants Low - influenza-like symptoms Insufficient - asthma exacerbation (with live vaccine), ADEM, transverse myelitis The IOM committee studied seasonal influenza vaccines. The influenza vaccine is administered in two forms: a live attenuated form, administered intranasally, and an inactivated form, administered intramuscularly. Evidence was \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship in the pediatric population between seasonal influenza vaccines and the following: seizures, (ADEM), and transverse myelitis. Evidence was \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship between live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and asthma exacerbation or reactive airway disease (RAD) episodes. Seasonal influenza vaccines were NOT associated with any serious adverse events in the short term in children with malignancy, IBD, urea cycle disorders or children who had received organ transplant in post - licensure studies. Both seasona l influenza vaccines and monovalent H1N1 vaccine were associated with mild gastrointestinal disorders , such as vomiting and diarrhea in children in the short -term in several large post-licensure studies . One large study114114114115 found that younger vacci nated children (aged 5 to 8 years) were more likely to experience these symptoms than older vaccinated children (aged 9 to 17 years). (Children under 5 years of age were not included in that study). Both live and inactivated s easonal influenza vaccines were associated with influenza -like symptoms in children in the short term in multiple studies, while not associated in others. A large U.S. post-licensure study of children under age 5 years found TIV associated with febrile seizures. Risk was increased if PCV13 was administered concomitantly 166 Table 33.

Summary: safety of vaccines used for routine immunization of adults ( including pregnant women) and children (continued) Vaccine EPC Conclusions and Strength of Evidence IOM Findings Additional Findings From EPC Miscellaneous & Combination Vaccines Moderate - DTaP -IPV-Hib vaccination with febrile seizures High - no association of childhood leukemia with MMR, DTaP, Td, Hib, Hep B, and polio vaccines Moderate - Hepatitis A, MMR, and varicella vaccine with purpura Not covered Association of DTaP -IPV-Hib vaccination with febrile seizures in children was found in a very large, high quality post -licensure stud y. Rate for first dose was estimated as 5.5 cases per 100,000 person/days. Rate for second dose was estimated as 5.7 cases per 100,000 person/days. Multiple large epidemiological studies have assessed MMR, DTaP, Td, Hib, Hep B, and polio vaccine and have found no association with childhood leukemia. In a large post -licensure study of over 1.8 million vaccines recipients, purpura w as associated with vaccination against Hepatitis A in children aged 7 to 17 years, vaccination against varicella in children aged 11 to 17, and MMR in children from 12 to 19 months of age. These results were based on one or two cases per vaccine type/age group. According to the authors most cases were mild and acute. Pneumococcal Conjugate (PCV13) Moderate - Febrile seizures Not covered. A recent study using the U.S. Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) found an association with febrile seizures. Estimated rate for 16 -month old patients is 13.7 cases per 100,000 doses for PCV13 without concomitant TIV, and 44.9 per 100,000 doses for concomitant TIV and PCV13 . 168 Table 33. Summary: safety of vaccines used for routine immunization of adults ( including pregnant women) and children (continued) Vaccine EPC Conclusions and Strength of Evidence IOM Findings Additional Findings From EPC Rotavirus Vaccines: RotaTeq and Rotarix Moderate - intussusception Not covered. In clinical trials, there was no association between either of the two currently available vaccines (RotaTeq and Rotarix) and any serious adverse events, including intussusception, in the long or short - term. A high quality epidemiological stud y in Australia found RotaTeq was associated with intussusception 1 to 21 days following the first of three required doses in infants 1 to 3 months of age. Two case -control studies conducted in Latin America found an association of Rota rix with intussusception in children following the first of two required doses . Although one U.S. epidemiological study found no association, a recent analysis of the U.S. Post-Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring (PRISM) program found both RotaTeq and Rotarix associated with intussusception in the short term. Estimated rate was 1.1 to 1.5 cases per 100,000 doses of RotaTeq and 5.1 cases per 100,000 doses of Rotarix. Varicella Vaccine High - anaphylaxis, disseminated Oka VZV without other organ involvement , disseminated Oka VZV with subsequent infection resulting in pneumonia, meningitis, or hepatitis in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies, vaccine strain vira l reactivation without other organ involvement, vaccine strain viral reactivation with subsequent infection resulting i n meningitis or encephalitis Evidence \"convincingly supports\" causal relationships between varicella virus vaccine and the following: disseminated Oka VZV without other organ involvement disseminated Oka VZV with subsequent infection resulting in pneumonia, meningitis, or hepatitis in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies, vaccine strain viral reactivation without other organ involvement, vaccine strain viral reactivation with subsequent infection resulting in meningitis or encephalitis , and anaphylaxis. The evidence is \"inadequate to accept or reject\" a causal relationship between the vaccine and seizures, ADEM, transverse myelitis, Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, small fiber neuropathy, onset or exacerbation of arthropathy, and t hrombocytopenia. We identifying one small trial in children with lupus (SLE); the trial reported no association with AEs. 169 Table 33.

Pregnant Women Influenza Vaccines Moderate - No association with serious adverse events Results not specific to pregnant women Both monovalent H1N1 vaccine and seasonal influenza vaccine (inactivated) containing H1N1 strains were not associated with serious adverse events in pregnant women or their offspring in multiple trials and post -licensure studies . Studies report an associatio n with lower risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. ADEM = a cute disseminated encephalomyelitis; AEs = adverse events; CIDP = c hronic inflammatory Practice Center; = Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome; Hep B = h epatitis B ; Hib = Haemophilus i nfluenzae type B ; HPV = h uman papillomavirus; IOM = Institute of Medicine; LAIV = disease; SIDS death syndrome; lupus influenza vaccine; VZV = v aricella-z oster virus 170 Research Gaps Adults There was insufficient evidence to determine whether influenza vaccines are associated with onset or exacerbation of MS. A recent meta- analysis on 2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine provided high strength evidence of association with Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome in adults. As the vaccine is associate d with only 1.6 excess cases per million vaccinated, it will be very difficult to assess risk factors. The unknown association regarding MS and GBS and vaccines against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and MMR presents a research gap; the IOM found evidence inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship. Some p ublished vaccine trials were not specific in reporting AEs. Broad categories such as \"injection -related adverse events, \" \"systemic adverse events,\" \"one or more adverse events\" or \"serious adverse even ts\" were reported rather than specif ic AE. In addition, many studies reported on a list of pre -defined adverse events but did not rate the severity or provide enough information for our investigators to determine severity. Future trials of vaccines should report results with more granularity . Children and Adolescents There is insufficient evidence to determine any potential association between trivalent inactivated vaccine and asthma exacerbation, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis myelitis. , influenza, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Younger age was associated with increased risk in several studies. Large scale epidemiological studies could determine other patient risk factors. A lar ge post -licensure study found associations between both Rotarix and RotaTeq and intussusception in the short term following vaccination in U.S. children; patient risk factors were not reported. Strong evidence for a lack of association of HPV vaccines wit h several serious medical conditions (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, GBS) has been found in large post - licensure studies. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding other serious conditions such as MS, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and pancreatitis. Importantly, a recent analysis of long term follow -up data from two trials of Gardasil showed a possible increased risk of miscarriage of pregnancies within four years of vaccination amo ng Black women . Large datasets from U.S. Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) include both immunizations and pregnancy records needed to investigate the potential relationship. There is insufficient evidence to determine the possible association, if any, betw een vaccines such as DTaP, meningococcal vaccine, and varicella vaccine and the onset of nervous system conditions such as ADEM, transverse myelitis, MS, and GBS. Large scale epidemiological studie s could provide additional data; however, as these medical conditions are extremely rare, it may be difficult to reach a level of evidence beyond \"insufficient\". 171 Preg nant Women There is moderate strength of evidence that inactivated influenza vaccine is not associated with serious adverse events in pregnant women or their offspring. Given the 2013 recommendation to administer the Tdap vaccine during every pregnancy, passive surveillance systems should be monitored regularly for AEs in this population. This is a particular concern for women with multiple pregnancie s over a period of a few years. A reliable system of tracking when in pregnancy the vaccine was given is extremely important . In addition, in any study of vaccines and pregnancy, follow -up of newborns should be sufficiently long, as not all adverse effects may be apparent immediately after birth. The need for large numbers of pregnant exposures is particularly important given the relative low frequency of some birth defects and defining which are causal to vaccine. In addition, little is known about the patient factors which may influence the effect of the vaccine. Another unknown is how vaccination in pregnancy may affect the newborn's immune system/re action to newborn vaccinations. The Vaccines and Medications in Pregnancy Surveillance System (VAMPSS) has components to monitor safety of maternally -administered vaccines and their effect on recipients and their offspring. VAMPSS is a collaboration of the American Academy of Asthma Allergy and Immunology, the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS) Research Center at the University of California San Diego and the Slone Epidemiology Center (SEC) at Boston University. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contracted VAMPSS to perf orm safety monitoring of pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine administered during the 2009 pandemic. As this report was being finalized, a VAMPSS study on the safety of H1N1 was released; 238,239 the authors found no meaningful evidence of increase risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or low birth weight for gestational age. Further, existing federal systems such as the VSD and/or PRISM could be potentially be used, as well. General Methodological Observations Advanced health information technology (HIT) sy stems that contain both vaccination and health outcome records can be used to conduct high quality epidemiological studies. In the United States , the VSD contains data obtained through such systems at nine very large MCOs. The FDA's Mini -Sentinel program a lso conducts active surveillance using electronic healthcare databases from MCOs. Nations with single payer healthcare systems often have electronic registries which allow very large epidemiological studies of entire populations. Studies using these databases have greater validity than studies that rely on surveys that use patient / parent recall for ascertainment of vaccination or health outcome. Not only are such surveys subject to recall bias, but there may be no way of determining the formulation or bra nd of vaccination. Observational studies should be powered adequately to determine risk factors such as demographic and health character istics of patients. Analysis should be stratified by formulation and brand of vaccine, if possible. This is especially tr ue for influenza vaccine, which differs from season to season. Independent abstraction and systematic reassessment of the studies included in the Institute of Medicine consensus report \" Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality \" may be a usefu l future endeavor. Odds ratios could be calculated for each event reported in each trial and post-licensure study, and, where appropriate, meta -analysis conducted to calculate overall odds ratios for each AE and each vaccine type. If the se studies were abs tracted, the totality of data 172 could be statistically analyzed to explore additional hypotheses and issues beyond the scope of the current report. 173 References 1.

Literature Search Strategy Summary of Search Strategy - Vaccine Safety Databases: MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane SR, DARE, a nd CENTRAL to cover the existing clinical literature. General approach : We combine search terms for the vaccine with general adverse event terms and specific adverse events. We use generic vaccine terms as well as specific available vaccines. The list of specific adverse events for Influenza, Hib, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Varicella, Human Papillomavirus, Measles -Mumps -Rubella, Meningococcal, Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis B was based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2011 report, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Mini -Sentinel data. The list of specific adverse events for Polio, Rotavirus, Zoster, and Pneumococcal (vaccines not covered by the IOM report) was based on VAERS, Mini -Sentinel, and HR SA information. General adverse event terms were used as a safeguard against missing new harms that have not yet been identified in existing summary reports. We chose the search date of January, 2010 for the vaccines covered by the IOM report based on the IOM search date (August, 2010). For the remaining vaccines we searched without date restriction. Our search went through August 2013. Animal studies and editorials were excluded where possible. We combined Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) with free text terms in order to capture new publications not yet assigned controlled language in the electronic databases.

Study notes, \"Inherent in our case-control study is the possibility of selection or recall bias, as well as exposure misclassication , since information was not always corroborated with the index child's vaccination or medical records.\" Initial contact with potential controls was by letter, followed by telephone contact. In total, 449 cases and 675 controls wer e identied as possible subjects. Of these, 445 cases and 526 controls eligible for inclusion in the study were successfully contacted. A total of 399 case-control pairs agreed to participate, resulting in contact participation rates of 90 percent for eligible cases and 76 percent for eligible controls Study notes, \"Because controls were of a higher socioecono mic status than cases, it is possible that control participatio n bias may have influenced these results.\" Standardized, personal interviews conducted i n the home with the child's parents or guardians. Immunization data were recorded from the child's vaccination record if available at the time of interview. Otherwise, parents were asked to recall their child's immunization history Participants meeting these criteria were ascertained through pediatric oncology treatment centers in each of the ve provinces. Population -based cancer registries were also used for case ascertainment in all provinces except Quebec.

Parents of 3,871 children (76.6%) returned the completed questionnaire on respiratory symptom s and diagnosis. A second survey was conducted in 1997; 218 children (5.6%) were lost to follow - up because they had moved out of the study area or were unlocatable.

In the Netherlands, vaccination status was registered during routine checkups of children. In Germany, vaccination status was registered during the checkup of school beginners at age 5 -6 years. Parental questionnaires were sent for self - completion. In the presence of one or both parents, completeness of the questionnaire was checked by an assistant of the Municipal Health Service, and blood sam ples were taken for immunological analysis.

Authors note, \"Any misclassificatio n of febrile seizures or epilepsy is likely to be non - differential and cause a bias of the HR toward the null hypothesis, but we expect this bias to be small.\" Study had almost complete follow -up of all children born in Denmark during a 6 -year period due to nationwide registries Study indicated there should be little difference Information on vaccinations was obtained from reports submitted from general practitioners (GPs) to the Danish Health Insurance Registry Information on febrile seizures and epilepsy was obtained from the Danish National Hospital Register. Cohort study: Cox proportional hazard SCCS: conditional Poisson regression Cohort: child's sex, multiple births, calendar year of birth, season, gestational age, birth weight, parity of the mother, parental history of epilepsy, maternal education, and family income at the time of birth.
