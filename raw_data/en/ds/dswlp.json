Types of Medication Orders Four types of medication orders - routine orders, PRN orders, one time ord ers, and STAT orders It should be clear on the MAR what type of order the Medication Aide is being asked to follow The most common orders in adult care homes are routine orders and PRN orders. Medication Aide is allowed to accept verbal orders or orders over the telephone but obtaining a written order from the prescribing practitioner is the best and safest practice to obtain an order. With fax machines and other electronic technology, a written order should be able to be obtained. The medication orders are transferre d to the MAR from the document( s) with the written orders when the orders are received. It is import ant the order is transferred to the MAR when the order is received . Do not wait until that medication is received. Medication Labels Information requir ed on medication labels of medications dispensed by the pharmacy : o Medication name o Medication strengt h o Quantity dispensed o Dispensing date o Directions for use o Pharmacy that dispensed the medication o Prescription number o Expiration date o Equivalency statement (when the brand or medication name dispensed is different than the brand or medication name prescrib ed) Labeling requirements for over- the-counter (OTC) medications include o In the original manufacturer's bottle with the resident's name, OR o Labeled by the pharmacy Refer to HANDOUT D-2: Medication Label Section D - Stude nt Manual Medica tion Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Tr aining Course for Adult Care Homes D-6 Section D: Overview of Medication Administration Common Abbreviations Abbreviation - a shortened f orm of a word or phrases Abbreviations are being used less often for medication administration but you still may see abbreviations Medication Aides ne ed to learn abbreviations for terms common to medication administration On the MAR , abbreviations s houl d be spelled out Be aware that abbreviations can lead to mistakes if they are not legible Always check with the supervisor if you have questions about abbreviations Refer to HANDOUT D-4: SIX RIGHTS of Medication Administration SIX RIGHTS of Administ ering Medications Importance Safety and accuracy are important to welfare of the resident During a normal workday, Medication Aide may give many med ications to large number of residents Chance of making a mistake each time a medic ation is given Anyon e giving medications needs to stay focused, be organized, and careful Follow each and every time when administering medications; never skip them or bec ome careless during administration To safeguard the resident always ask self thes e six questions w hen administering medications, which are often called S IX Rights of medication administration Questions to Ask Self Am I giving the medication to the right resident ? Section D - Stude nt Manual Medica tion Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Tr aining Course for Adult Care Homes D-7 Section D: Overview of Medication Administration Am I giving the right medication ? Am I giving the right dose ? Is thi s the right route (method of administration)? Is this the right time ? Have I done the right documentation? Right RESIDENT? Each time Medication Aide gives medications, t he resident must be identified Giving medications to the wrong resident can cause serious harm Identify the resident who is to receive the medication by using methods outlined by facility; some facilities require identifying resident two to three differe nt ways While Medication Aide may know the resident, this part of routine allows for completion of thre e checks in a careful manner, so do not skip it This habit will prevent carelessness and possibility of making a mistake now and later Most adult care homes have the Medication Aide perform identifying steps o A photo of the resident o n the MAR to dete rmin e the right resident is about to take the right medicine by matching the picture with the resident o Require that the resident states first and last name o Do not ask the resident, \"Are you James Jackson?\" because it is too easy for the re sident to say \"ye s\" w hen he may not be James Jackson; particularly if the resident is confused or hard of hearing o Some residents are not able to state their names because th ey cannot talk, they may be confused or having speech impairments due to illness . In those situations, i ndividual responses may not be realistic or accurate Even when Medication Aide administers medications to the same resident every day , safety measures for identifying the residents have to be in place If the facility has residents who are receiving m edications with similar names , be certain to have an alert on the MAR; date of birth could be a better identifier, such as Leigh Chan and Lee Chang Do not use room numbers as an identifier because Section D - Stude nt Manual Medica tion Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Tr aining Course for Adult Care Homes D-8 Section D: Overview of Medication Administration o There may be more than one resident in t he room o A confuse d resident could have wandered into the wrong room and crawled in bed o Administration may have moved resident into a different room o Resident could have been discharged and Medication Aide not aware prior to administering medications Some people may answer yes to another resident's name trying to get additional medications or trying to jump ahead of other people; particularly true if residents do not understa nd that medications can be different for different people or if the residents are confused If Medic ation Aide prepares medications away from the resident taking them, it is important to keep the MAR with the medications until the medications are taken, so that the wrong medicines are not accidentally given to wrong resident Important t hat Medication Ai de k eeps identifying information with the medications from the point of preparation to the point of giving medication to the resident Right MEDICATION ? Medication Aide must always refer to MAR when giving medications; never give medicati ons from memory Thre e medication checks should always be done when giving medications to make sure Medication Aide has the right medication During the three medication che cks, Medication Aide will not only make sure a particular medication is labeled fo r a particular resident, but during the process Medication Aide also makes sure that medication name, dose, time, and route on the medication label matches information on the MAR o Check the medication name, d ose, time and rou te on the package against the MAR when container is re moved from shelf, drawer, or other storage place o Check medication name, dose, time, and route on the actual drug package or unit dose label against the MAR as medication is poured , pack age is open ed, or before the medication is placed in the medicine cup o Check the medication name, dose, time, and route on package when medication container is returned to the shelf, drawer or storage place , or before it is opened and place in the medicine cup, just prior t o giving the medication to the resident Remember if in doub t, ASK May feel like you are overdoing the checking, but it is this careful practice that will prevent medication errors Section D - Stude nt Manual Medica tion Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Tr aining Course for Adult Care Homes D-9 Section D: Overview of Medication Administration Do not be lulled into po or and unsafe practices because m edication adminis tration is done day in and day out Many adult care homes use medication packaging that helps to reduce errors such as unit dose, punch cards of medications, etc. Be alert for similar sounding names for m edications while making right med ication choices Neve r give a medication that you cannot identify by a written medication label or that is found at the resident's beside Best and safe practice is to never give a medication prepared by someone else Righ t DOSE ? Medication Aide must mak e sure th e right dose is about to be administered by comparing medication label to the MAR; MAR will state exactly how much medication is to be given o For example, if digoxin 0.25 mg is to be given and the supply is digoxin 0.125 mg., two tablets must be gi ven to equal the right dose o It is best for the MAR to state to give two tablets of digoxin 0.125 mg (0.125 mg + 0.125 mg = 0.25mg) o If instructions are not clear, ask for them to be made as clear and complete as possible t o help prevent medication errors To help prevent medi cation dosing errors, a zero (0) should always precede a decimal but should not follow a decimal o For example, if the 0 is not present in the example above, the decimal might be missed and instead of giv ing 0.125 mg. of digoxin it might incorrectly be r ead as 125 mg of digoxin which would be deadly o If the dose of medication ordere d is 1 mg and the order is written on the MAR as giving 1.0 mg, the decimal might again be overlooked and the MAR might read to give 10 mg of the medication, which would mean th at the resident would be getting 10 times the dose ordered Another common righ t dose error is for people to mix up the abbreviations of ml (or mL) for milliliter and the abbreviation of mg for milligram o For example, a 1 ml dose does not e qual 1 mg o Mixing up those abbreviations can result in dosage error Refer to HANDOUT D -5 Decima l Point and Zeros Refer to HANDOUT S: D-6 Common Routes of Medication Administration , D-7 Common Dosage Forms Section D - Stude nt Manual Medica tion Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Tr aining Course for Adult Care Homes D-10 Section D: Overview of Medication Administration Right ROUTE ? Right method of administration, suc h as whether a me dication is given by mouth, in the ear, or eye, or if it is to be applied to th e skin The route of medication administration will be noted on the MAR; if it is not, stop and ask supervisor Do not make ass umptions about how to give a medi cation Oral Rout es o Referred to as oral or PO - meaning by mouth o Medication is placed in mouth a nd swallowed o Certain people cannot take oral medications; people who cannot swallow well, such as, residents who do not have a gag reflex and choke easily, are confused, refuse to t ake medications by mouth, or are not to have anything b y mouth o NPO - meanin g nothing by mouth Sublingual o Placed under the tongue and allowed to dissolve and be absorbed under the tongue o Dissolves quick ly and gets into blood stream qui ckly o Resident not to swallow tablet, nor to smoke, drink or eat while this tablet is under tong ue Topical R oute o Delivers medication directly to the area needing treatment or may allow medication to be absorbed to affect the entire body o These medications can be a variety of p reparations including drops or ointment into the eye, drops into the ear, s prays in the nose or throat, suppositories in the rectum or vagina, and creams or ointment on the skin o Areas for topical medications are skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, vagina, and rectum o Some topical medications affect the entire body, such as patches applied to the skin Inhalation Route o Delivers medication to lungs through an inhaler or aerosol o One way this medication is taken in is with an inhaler and a tube that is called a \"spa cer\" or a disc device that allows the pow der form of the medication to be p ushed toward the back of the mouth and inhaled o Many different types of devices for inhalants o Become familiar with device before assisting someone with their inhaled medications Subcutaneous o Delivers medication to the subcutaneous (fat) layer of the body using a syringe and needle Section D - Stude nt Manual Medica tion Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Tr aining Course for Adult Care Homes D-11 Section D: Overview of Medication Administration Right TIME ? Make sure you give the medication at the Right TIME The time to give a medication is stated o n the MAR Individual adult care homes will have set standard times for administration of medications o If a medication is to be given BID, meaning twice a day, then the facility may set those times to be 10 am and 10 pm o When a medication is ordered before (a.c.) or after (p.c.) me als, it should be given 30 min. before or after meals Medications that are given once a day sho uld be given at the same time each day to keep the right amount of medicine in the resident's system Set times within a facility helps to prevent missed or doubled doses, which can be harmful to the resident receiving the medications The Medication Aide should not give the medication too early because it could be too much medication in the resident's system at one time Medicati on needs to be given within a set amount of time t o provide the resident with the correct dose of medication at the right time that allows the medication to work as it should o For example, if a medication is fighting an infection and doses are given at time spans between doses too far apar t, the infection may get worse , making it harder to treat The window of time for the medicatio n to be given is one hour before or one hour after the time stated on the MAR; medications should be administered within this d esignated time frame If Medicati on Aide is unsure about giving the medication because it is outside the designated time frame, i.e., a medication was missed, a medication just arrived from pharmacy or a resident has returned to the facility after medicati ons were administered, always check with superviso r, nurse, pharmacist or the resident's physician to determine if the medication should be administered or not administered; never omit a medication without contacting your supervisor, nurse, pharmacist or r esident's physician because a res ident was out of the facility when medications were administered Section D - Stude nt Manual Medica tion Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Tr aining Course for Adult Care Homes D-12 Section D: Overview of Medication Administration Timing of medications in re lation to meals o Before meals - medication administered about 30 minutes prior to the resident eating meals o With meals - medicat ion administered while the reside nt is eating meals o After meals - medication administered directly after the resident has finishe d eating meals up to 3 0 minutes afterwards Always check the time the last dose of a PRN medication was given before giving th e new dose; if ordered time has p assed since the l ast dose, the medication can be given Right DOCUMENTATION ?

Crushing Medications Medication may need to be crushed if no liquid form of a medication is available and resident cannot s wallow an oral solid medication MAR should state if a medication is to be crushed; Medication Aide will not make the decision whether to crush a tablet or not If it is not clear on the MAR, ask supervisor to provide clear instructions Several methods to crush a pill o Mortar and pestle or a pill- crushing device o Crushed in its package if only one pill is in the package o Placed between two clean small paper medication souffl\u00e9 cups and crushed with a pestle or other crushing device Section I - Student Manual Medication Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Training Course for Adult Care Homes I-4 Section I - Administering Medications After crushing medication, c lean tools that come in contact with the medication with alcohol or soap and water, being sure to dry them before returning them to storage When a medication is crushed it will taste bitter and is common to mix medication with small amount of food to help the resident tolerate the taste as they take the now bitter medication o Example, applesauce or pudding o Mix the crushed medication with as little applesauce or pudding as possible because if too much applesauce or pudding is used, the resident may not be a ble to eat it all or refuse to eat it all and thus not get all the medication o Never leave medication in food unattended, because another resident may come by and eat the food, accidentally taking the medication, which will be a medication error and can be very dangerous Offer resident sufficient fluids following the administration of oral medications even if the medication is administered in a food substance Observe the resident taking the medication to assure the medication is swallowed before documenting the administration of the medications Not all medications can be cut or crushed; do not ever cut or crush a pill that has an enteric (hard shell) coating, a capsule, or a pill that is sustained release or time released o Enteric -coated pill has a protectiv e hard shell coating that allows it to pass through the stomach, without dissolving, to be absorbed in the small intestines o Enteric -coated medications designed to be swallowed whole and if cut or crushed, could burn a hole in the esophagus, stain the teet h, or not be absorbed because the stomach destroys the medication before it begins working o Capsules and sustained release medications are made to be absorbed over time and if cut open, lose that feature. o Cutting or crushing time -released medications can re sult in the resident getting an overdose of the medication because it is absorbed all at once instead of being released over a longer period of time o There is an extensive list of medications that cannot be crushed; however, Medication Aides are not to have to make a decision about cutting or crushing a medication because instructions should be clear on the MAR Administering Liquid Medications Overview and Concepts A common way to administer medications Come in many forms - solutions, suspensions, syr ups and elixirs Section I - Student Manual Medication Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Training Course for Adult Care Homes I-5 Section I - Administering Medications Need to be aware extra care needs to be taken when measuring liquids and that Medication Aide should plan on taking more time Liquids may have administration requirements such as Shake Well or Requires Dilution prior to administration o Examples of these liquids are Dilantin Suspension, which must be shaken thoroughly because the medication settles and gives inconsistent dosing; liquid Potassium and bulk laxatives must be mixed with sufficient fluids to decrease side effects Types of Liqu id Medications Solution - a liquid containing dissolved medication Suspension - a liquid holding un -dissolved particles of medication and must be shaken before measuring and administering to resident Syrup - a liquid medication dissolved in a sugar water to disguise its taste Elixir - a sweet alcohol based solution in which medications are dissolved Refer to HANDOUT S I-1: Review of Measuring Devices ; I-2 Always and Never; I-3 Measuring Tips Administering Liquid Medication Using a Medication Cup Do not mix liquid medications together Never approximate the amount of medication to be administered, such as liquids o Always use the correct measuring device when measuring liquid medications o Never use household measurements or spoons such as a teaspoon or tablespoon to measure medication doses because of inaccuracy o To administer liquid medications, use a small, clear, graduated medicine cup with measurements on the side o Use a calibrated syringe for measuring liquids in amounts less than 5 mL and unequal amo unts Measure liquid medications on a flat, level surface at eye level to make sure that amount is correct When pouring liquid medications, hold the label under the hand so that the medication flows from the side opposite the label preventing the liquid from running down the container and stain or obscure label Liquids are prepared in separate cups from pills and tablets Section I - Student Manual Medication Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Training Course for Adult Care Homes I-6 Section I - Administering Medications To prevent contaminating the remaining medication, never pour excess medication back into the bottle Dispose of the excess medication per facility policy Ensure resident is sitting upright before administering liquid medication to a resident Administering Liquid Medication Using a Medication Dropper Some medications come packaged with a medication dropper with measurements on the side If a medication comes with a special dropper, use that dropper only when giving that medication Keep dropper with the medication Some manufacturers have you replace the cap with the dropper/cap so that it is always ready for use to prepare the correct dose of medication. Liquid medications may have a oral dropper/syringe specifically for measurement of dose; the name of the medication and the strength of the medication will be printed on the dropper / syringe and should be used to only measure the medication identified on the dropper/syringe Be careful and note measurements on dropper are in mg or ml and prepare resident's dose appropriately Increase chances of making a dosing error if a different measuring device is used When using a special droppe r to administer liquid medicine o Draw up the accurate dose of medication and put it into a medication cup to deliver it to the resident o Do not use the dropper to give the resident the oral medication because that will contaminate the dropper and in turn con taminate the remaining liquid medication Section I - Student Manual Medication Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Training Course for Adult Care Homes I-7 Section I - Administering Medications Sublingual Medications Place the medication under the resident's tongue Instruct resident not to chew or swallow the medication Do not follow with liquid, which might cause the tablet to be swallowed Oral Inhalers Spacing and proper sequence of the different inhalers is important for maximal drug effectiveness The prescribing practitioner may specifically order the sequence of administration if multiple inhalers are prescribed or the pharmacy may prov ide instruction on the medication label or MAR Shake all met er dose inhalers or inhaler canisters before use and shake between puffs Wait at least one minute between puffs for multiple inhalations Refer to HANDOUT I-4: Oral Inhalers Eye Drops and O intments Wash hands prior to and after administration of eye drops and ointments Follow standard precautions Wear gloves as indicated Always wear gloves when there is redness, drainage or possibility of infection Wait a 3 - to 5- minute period between medication when two or more different eye drops must be administered at the same time Do not touch eyes with dropper or medication container Nose Drops and Nasal Sprays/Inhalers Section I - Student Manual Medication Administration - March 2021 10/15 -Hour Training Course for Adult Care Homes I-8 Section I - Administering Medications Wash hands before and after Gloves are to be worn as indicated For d rops o Resident should lie down on his/her back with head tilted o Request the resident to r emain in the position for about 2 minutes to allow sufficient contact of medication with nasal tissue For Sprays o Hold head erect and spray quickly and forcefully while resident \"sniffs\" quickly o Have the resident tilt head back to aid penetration of the m edication into the nasal cavity, if necessary Wipe dropper or sprayer with a tissue before replacing the cap Transdermal Products/Patches Rotate application sites for transdermal patches to prevent irritation Document application sites on the MAR If the patch is ordered to be worn for less than 24 hours, document on the medication administration record that the patch was removed and the time it was removed Wear g loves and wash hands after patch is applied or removed When a patch is removed, clean the area to remove residual medication on the skin Topical Medications Wear gloves and use tongue blade, gauze or cotton tipped applicator to apply medication Use a new applicator each time medication is removed from container to prevent contamination Provide privacy.

The insulin pen user manual provides information a bout proper use and storage of the device. Two type s of insulin pens: Disposable pen s which come pre -filled with insulin and the pen is discarded when the insulin is used. Reusable pens which are loaded with a new insulin cartridge when the old cartridge is used. This pen is ONLY used for the specific resident it is ordered for. Never share an insulin pen. Basic steps that are common to most models and types of pens are listed below. Remove the pen cap. Check the insulin (type, amount and appearance) . Attach the pen needle and remove caps. Follow the pen manufacturer's directions to prepare or prime your particular pen. Dial the dose and inject. Remove the needle f rom the pen and dispose of properly. Replace the pen cover .

Unless the medication storage area is under the direct supervision of staff lock the medication area including carts Store external and internal medications in separate designated areas Store refrigerated medicat ions in the medication refrigerator or locked container if stored in refrigerator accessible to other staff Store medications requiring refrigeration at 36 degrees F to 46 degrees F (2 degrees C to 8 degrees C) Controlled Substances Controlled substa nces or controlled medications are medications that are kept locked most often in a special location or drawer in the medication cart or medication room o Medication Aide must make sure the number or amount of medication listed on the controlled substance lo g or form is correct before removing any medications for the resident.

Perform the SIX Rights each and every time you give medications for each medication, for each resident. Sometimes it is tempting to think the SIX Rights are so basic and simple that you do not need to follow them anymore. Do NOT skip these important checks; they help you to avoid medication errors. Be sure to question unusual orders, for example, if more than 3 tablets or capsules are needed for one dose of a medication, there is a good chance that you are preparing to give too much medication. A \"red flag\" should be raised in your mind if the resident says they do not normally take this medication, such as a \"blue tablet\" Don't give the medication until you have re - checked to be sure you have the: Right RESIDENT Right MEDICATION Right DOSE Right ROUTE and the Right TIME! It is possible you have the correct medication and the pharmacy supplier has changed. However i t is more likely that there is a medication error getting ready to happen. So you need to carefully recheck the MAR prior to giving the medications. If you continue to have doubts, contact your supervisor for clarification prior to giving the medication. Remember if in DOUBT - DON'T! Be Careful to Develop G ood Medication Administration Practice H abits! Medication Administration - September 2013 10/15 -Hour Training Course for Adult Care Homes L-3 HANDOUT C-3 A. When the resident refuses medication: 1. The resident always has the right to refuse medications. 2. Residents refuse to take medications for many reasons. Some of the reasons are: a. The effects and/or side effects are unpleasa nt or unwanted. b. The medication tastes bad. c. The resident has difficulty swallowing. d. Religious, cultural, or ethnic beliefs. e. Depression or loss of will to live. f. Delusional belief that staff is intending to harm (\"poison\") him/her. B. Types of refusal 1. Actual refusal is when a person directly refuses to take the medication. 2. Passive refusal is less direct and requires closer observation. Examples are: The resident takes the medication but later spits the medication out; he/she may or may not attempt to hide the medication. C. Questions to ask to try to determine the reason for refusal: 1. Does the resident experience any unpleasant effect from the medication? 2. Does the resident have difficulty swallowing? 3. Is the reside nt afraid for some reason? 4. Is the resident refusing other medical treatment? (continued next page) Resident 's Refusal to Take Medications Medication Administration - September 2013 10/15 -Hour Training Course for Adult Care Homes L-4 HANDOUT C-3 D. Examples of Strategies for dealing with resident's refusal: 1. If the resident refuses and gives no reason, wait a few minutes and then offer the medication again. If the resident refuses again, try again in another few minutes before considering a final refusal. This is particularly important with residents who have a diagnosis of dementia. NOTE For residents with cognitive impairment such as dementia, it is important to know when the resident designee, such as responsible party or guardian, wants to be notified if the resident refuses medication. The resident designee may be able to encourage the resident to take the medication. 2. Notify the prescribing practitioner or supervisor when a resident refuses medication. 3. Document refusal. 4. Observe the res ident and report any effect which may result from refusal. 5. If there is swallowing difficulty, report to your supervisor and/or resident's physician. 6. Consider changing the time of administration if taking the drug interferes with an activity or with sleep. (Example: diuretics may limit a resident's ability to participate in an outing because of the need to go to the bathroom frequently.) 7. If there is a suspicion of passive refusal such as \"cheeking\" medication or vomiting after administratio n, follow the recommendations for action on the resident's Individualized Care Plan. 8. If the refusals continue, explore other options with the resident's physician. NOTE: Passive refusal is not uncommon in residents with diagnoses of mental illness. It is important that the resident or resident designee, facility staff, nurse, pharmacist and physician collaborate to develop and follow a plan to assist the resident with adherence to his/her drug regimen.

HANDOUT G -4 Medication Administration - September 2013 10/15 -Hour Training Course for Adult Care L- 24 Diabetes and Viral Hepatitis: Important Information on Safe Diabetes Care Blood glucose testing and insulin administration can expose people to bloodborne viruses (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV) when supplies are shared between people. Outbreaks of hepatitis B virus infection associated with unsafe diabetes care have been identified with increasing regularity particularly in long -term care settings such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities where residents often require assistanc e with monitoring of blood glucose levels or insulin administration. In order to prevent infections, the North Carolina Division of Public Health urges all health care providers to follow these simple rules for safe diabetes care: Three Simple Rules for Assisted Blood Glucose Monitoring and Insulin Administration 1. FINGERSTICK DEVICES SHOULD NEVER BE USED FOR MORE THAN ON E PERSON Restrict use of fingerstick devices to a single person. They should never be used for more than one person. Select single -use lancets that permanently retract upon puncture. This adds an extra layer of safety for the patient and the provider. Dispose of used lancets at the point of use in an approved sharps container. Never reuse lancets. 2. BLOOD GLUCOSE METERS SHOULD BE ASSIGNE D TO ONLY ONE PERSON AND NOT SHARED Whenever possible, assign blood glucose meters to a single person. If blood glucose meters must be shared, they should be cleaned and disinfected after every use, per manufacturer's instructions, to prevent carry -over of blood and infectious agents. If the manufacturer does not specify how the device should be cleaned and disinfected then it should not be shared. 3. INJECTION EQUIPMENT SHOULD NEVER BE USED FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON Insulin pens should be assign ed to only one person and labeled appropriately. They should never be used for more than one person. Multiple -dose vials of insulin should be dedicated to a single person whenever possible. Medication vials should always be entered with a new needle and new syringe. Never reuse needles or syringes. For information and materials about safe insulin pen use, visit www.ONEandONLY campaign.org Always practice proper hand hygiene and change gloves between each person.

HANDOUT I-4 10/15 -Hour T raining Course for Adult Care Homes - September 2013 L-28 All Meter Dose Inhalers must be shaken! Ask the resident to tilt the head back slightly and breathe out. Position the inhaler in one of the following ways: Open mouth with inhaler one to two inches away. Use spacer with inhaler; place spacer in mouth (Spacers are particularly beneficial for older adults). Position inhaler in mouth, close lips around inhaler. Press down on inhaler to release medication as the resident starts to breathe in slowly. Encourage the resident to breathe in slowly (over 3 to 5 seconds). Ask the resident to hold breath for 10 seconds to allow medication to reach deeply into the lungs. If a resident is prescribed multiple inhalers, the physician may order a certain sequence to administer the inhalers or special instructi ons may be on the MAR. Proper spacing of puffs and different inhalers is important for the maximal effectiveness of the medication. o Wait one minute between \"puffs\" for multiple inhalations of the same medication. o Wait a few minutes between administeri ng another type of inhaler. If a medication aide provides the resident with the inhalers to administer, the m edication aide is responsible for instructing the resident of the proper technique and dose ordered. TECHNIQUE AND USE OF METER DOSE INHALERS HANDOUT - Additional Resources Medication Administration 10/15 -Hour Training Course for Adult Care Homes L-29 10 Tips for Administering Medication to the Cognitively Impaired Resident INTRODUCTION: Accurate, safe medication administration means giving the right drug to the right resident in the right dose by the right route and at the right time , and documenting correctly. Achieving these goals can be a challenge with the cognitively impaired resident. Because they have difficulty with thinking, reasoning and remembering, these residents may, at times, be resistant, suspicious, or even aggressive. These problems may be compounded if the resident has difficulty chewing or swallowing. Caregivers must fine -tune skills to meet these unique challenges. The following will help caregivers to achieve medication administration: 1. Respect A diagnosis of cognitive impairmen t is no different than any other dia gnosis when it comes to respect. Knock before entering the resident's room. A cheery \"good morning\" and a pleasant \"please\" and \"thank you\" may be the deciding factors as to whether the resident chooses to take the medic ation or not. Regardless of the resident's response, show respect in every aspect of your behavior. 2. Explain But keep it simple. Remember that the resident has the right to be informed and to be involved in his/her treatment. Some residents may understa nd single words only. Mirroring is a good technique to use to indicate what you want the resident to do. The simple action of placing an empty medication cup in your lips might be sufficient to get the resident to do the same. 3. Encourage Compliance Residents frequently refuse to take medications. Encourage, but be gentle. A non -confrontational approach and a gentle manner go a long way when it comes to persuasion. Be persistent. Residents who refuse medications one minute will often accept the next. Reme mber, the resident ultimately has the right to refuse. Force is never acceptable . 4. Make Eye C ontact We speak volumes with our eyes. Cognitively impaired residents often have difficulty with verbal communication. Making eye contact when speaking helps the resident understand what you are saying. Teach your eyes to say, \"I want you to take this medication because I care about you\". 5, Adequate Fluids Offer fluids before giving the medication. A drink of juice or some pleasant -tasting beverage not only moi stens the mouth, but evokes positive feelings as well. This will aid swallowing and help to prevent the medication from sticking inside the cheek or to the tongue. Don't forget to give plenty of fluids after the medication has been swallowed. The general r ule is 8 oz unless fluid restriction is ordered. (continued) HANDOUT - Additional Resources Medication Administration 10/15 -Hour Training Course for Adult Care Homes L-30 6. Crush Medications Crushing medications may be done in accordance with facility's policy and procedures. A physician 's order is needed to crush medications . There are s ome medic ations that should not be crushed, e.g., enteric coated and delay release, and if there is no alternative for the medication, there has to be a physician's order specifically for the medication to be crushed. When in doubt on whether a medication can be crushed , con tact your supervisor and/or pharmacist. 7. Be Patient Rushing not only agitates. Rushing may also cause choking and errors. 8. Observe & Report Be aware of any changes with a resident. The length of time that a resident takes a drug may alter the effectiveness of the drug, or have unwanted effects. Psychoactive drugs, those that affect the brain have long -term negative effect s in the elderly. Report your observations promptly to the health care provider. 9. Document Record the date and time o f every medication that you administer, if a drug is not given, record the reason why. Record the reason for administering, and effectiveness of all PRN (as needed) drugs. 10. Communicate Opening communication with resident s, family and health care provid ers is a must. Frequent reviews of the resident's drug regiment should be done to reduce dosages or eliminate unnecessary drugs. Good medication administration pro cedures combined with individualized care -giving strategy equals mission accomplished!

If you are responsible to transcribe an order to the MAR, the following are basic guidelines to follow: o Transcribe the information from the order onto the MAR only if you are able to read all the information on the order. o Transcribe the information on the MAR only if the order is complete for administering the medication. o Transcribe all the information onto the MAR as it is written on the order. Other guidelines for transcription on to M ARs: Do not use abbreviations Record each medication ordered from the order form to include: o Name and strength of the medication o Dose, Route and Time(s) the medication is to be given o Date the medication is to be started o Date the medication is to be stoppe d (if provided) o The date and name of person who transcribed the order should be documented Mark out days the medication is not to be given IF the medication is not prescribed every day. (continued) General Guidelines for Transcribing Orders onto the MAR Medication Administration 10/15 -Hour Training Course for Adult Care Homes L-32 For new orders, include the date and indicate the time to start. Count number of dosages to be administered instead of number of days when calcula ting stop dates for medication orders that have been prescribed for a specific time period, such as antibiotics Do not schedule PRN orders for administration at specific times; are administered when resident \"needs\" the medication for a certain circumstanc e If a medication order is discontinued (stopped or changed) by the prescriber, Discontinue or D/C (abbreviation for discontinued) should be noted for the medication. The date discontinued and your initials should be included. If the medication is not dis continued BUT the dose is reduced or changed, this should be transcribed as a NEW medication order. The old order would be discontinued on the MAR. The new order with the revised dosage would be transcribed onto the MAR exactly as a new order would be. NOTE: It is important to follow the facility policy regarding how a discontinued medication is indicated on the MAR as procedures may vary. When a new medication is ordered, changed or discontinued, be sure to notify the resident of changes.
