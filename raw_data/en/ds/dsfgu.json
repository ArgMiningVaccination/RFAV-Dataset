This assessment include s input from the community and experts in public health, clinical care, and others. The purpose of this community health needs assessment (CHNA) is to identify and prioritize significant health needs of the community served by Dignity Health Dominican Hospital. The priorities identified in this report help to guide the hospital's community health improvement programs and community benefit activities, as well as its collaborative efforts with other organizations that share a mission to improve health. The CHNA report meets the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requirements, as well as the requirements for California Senate Bill 697, and serves as the basis for implementation strategies that are filed with th e Internal Revenue Service . Brief Description of Community Served Santa Cruz County has a population of approximately 271,804 and covers 445 square miles. The two major cities are Santa Cruz, located on the northern side of the Monterey Bay, and Watsonville, situated in the southern part of the county. The city of Santa Cruz, which is the county seat, had an estimated population of 63,789 as of January 2015. As of January 2015, the City of Watsonville had an estimated population of 52,087. The county is 58% White and 33% Latino with the remainder of the population comprised of Asian, African American and other ethnic backgrounds. The county has a relatively mature population with 52% of the residents' ages 35 or older. Median family income w as $80,788 in Santa Cruz County in 2014, higher than in California ($71,015) and the nation overall ($65,910). The unemployment rate was 8.7% for the county during 2014, higher than the state overall (7.5%). The City of Watsonville had the highest unemployment rate at 11.2% for 2014. Process & Methods Dignity Health Dominican Hospital, together with its Community Advisors, Applied Survey Research (ASR) , a not-for-profit social research firm, and other community partners , completed a Community Health Needs Assessment process in 2016 . The goal was to collectively gather community feedback, understand existing data and trends about health status, and prioritize local health needs. DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 6 Secondary data were obtained from a variety of sources . Community input was obtained during the fall and winter of 2015/16 via key informant interviews with local health experts , and focus groups with community leaders and representatives. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital and ASR also used primary data collected from the biennial Community Assessment Project (CAP) telephone survey conducted with a representative sample of Santa Cruz County residents. The CAP assesses quality of life across six subject areas: the economy, health, public safety, the social environment and the natural environment. Focus groups and interviews focused on four main questions: 1.What are the most important health needs in your community? What needs are not being met and which specific groups have greater unmet needs, or special needs? 2.What drivers or barriers contribute to health needs? 3.What are your suggestions for improvements or solutions to these health needs? 4.How has the Affordable Care Act impacted access to healthcare for the community? (option al question, time permitting) Needs were prioritized during the focus group and interview process, resulting in the following list . Health Needs Identified by 2016 CHNA Process Access to Health Care Additional Specialized Health Care Workers Asthma Cancer Climate and Health Depression & Mental Health Diabetes Economic Security Food Insecurity Heart Disease & StrokeHomelessness Human Trafficking Infectious Disease Issues Surrounding Undocumented Persons Maternal and Child Health Obesity/Healthy Eating, Active Living Oral Health Substance Use Unintentional Injuries Violence/Injury Prevention DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 7 In the final step, the Dominican Community Advisors (DCA) consolidated and finalized the list of prioritized health needs into the following prioritized health needs. Prioritized Health Needs Integrated Behavioral Health During their prioritization process, the DCA identified the need for a more integrated approach to behavioral health. For the CHNA, Integrated Behavioral Health is the idea that physical and emotional health are connected and can be addressed together to produce the best possible health outcomes. Providers collaborate to address physical, developmental, social, behavioral, and emotional needs, including mental health and substance abuse conditions, depression, health behaviors (including their contribution to chronic medical illnesses), life stressors and crises, and stress-related physical symptoms. Economic Security During their prioritization process, the DCA combined several needs into this one broader need: Economic security includes employment, access to education and/or vocational training, affordable housing, homelessness, food insecurity and other factors related to poverty and lack of income. A Continuum of Care Approach to Access & Delivery The Continuum of Care Approach is an integrated system that guides and tracks patients over time through a comprehensive array of health services spanning all levels and intensity of care. It combines prevention and early intervention, while addressing the Social Determinants of Health. For further details, including statistical and qualitative data, please refer to Section 5 (Identification and Prioritization of Community Health Needs) and consult the Prioritized Health Needs appended to this report as Attachment 5. To review a list of resources that could potentially address the prioritized needs, see P. 35 for an overview of organizations, facilities and programs. Next Steps This CHNA report was adopted by the Dignity Health Dominican Hospital Community Board of Directors on March 23, 2016. The report is widely available to the public on the hospital's website, and a paper copy is available for inspection upon request at Dominican Hospital's Community Health Integration Services Office. Written comments on this report can be submitted to Dominic an Hospital's Community Health Integration Services Office at 1555 Soquel Ave., Santa Cruz, CA 95065 , or by email to Michaella.Siplak@dignityhealth.org. DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 8 2. SCOPE The CHNA Effort Dignity Health Dominican Hospital collaborated with local health officials, County Health Department representatives, and community benefit organizations to conduct this community health needs assessment of Santa Cruz County. With this assessment, Dignity Health Dominican Hospital will develop strategies to tackle these prioritized needs and improve the health and well- being of community members. Note that for the purposes of this assessment, \"community health\" is not limited to traditional health measures. This definition includes indicators relating to the quality of life (e.g., access to health care, impact of new technology, affordable housing, child care, education , and employment), the physical environmental, and social factors that influence health, as well as the physical health of the county's residents. This reflects Dignity Health Dominican Hospital 's view that community health is affected by many factors and cannot be adequately understood without consideration of trends outside the realm of health care. The 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment is designed to serve as a tool for guiding policy and planning efforts, and the information provided here will be used to formulate strategies to improve the quality of life for Santa Cruz County residents . This assessment will also serve to assist in developing Community Benefit Plans pursuant to Legislative Bill 697, as well as assist in meeting IRS requirements for Community Health Needs Assessment pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (See Attachment 1 for the IRS Checklist) .

Identity & Qualifications of Consultants In 1994, Applied Survey Research (ASR), a nonprofit social research firm, was contracted by the United Way to incorporate best practices from other assessment efforts across the nation into a community assessment model that would provide public and private interests with clear information about past trends and current realities. Under the guidance of the Community Assessment Project Steering Committee, ASR continues to manage the project to this day, collecting secondary (pre- existing) data and conducting a biennial community survey for primary data. For the Dignity Health Dominican Hospital CHNA, ASR conducted primary research, collected secondary data, synthesized primary and secondary data, facilitated the processes of identification of community health needs and assets and of prioritization of community health needs, and documented the processes and findings into a report. ASR was uniquely suited to provide Dignity Health Dominican Hospital with consulting services relevant to conducting the CHNA. The team that participated in the work - Susan Brutschy, Abigail Stevens, John Connery, and Jennifer Anderson-Ochoa - brought together diverse, complementary skill sets and various schools of thought (public health, anthropology, sociology, psychology, education, and policy analysis). In addition to their research and academic credentials, the ASR team has a 35-year history of working with vulnerable and underserved populations such as young children, teen mothers, seniors, low-income families, immigrant families, families who have experienced domestic violence and child maltreatment, the homeless, and children and families with disabilities. ASR's expertise in community assessments is well-recognized. ASR won a first place award in 2007 for having the best community assessment project in the country. They accomplish DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 10 successful assessments by using mixed research methods to help understand the needs in question, and by putting the research into action through designing and facilitating strategic planning efforts with stakeholders. Communities recently assessed by ASR include Arizona (six regions), Alaska (three regions), the San Francisco Bay Area including San Mateo, Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, Santa Cruz, and Monterey Counties, San Luis Obispo County, the Central Valley area including Stanislaus and San Joaquin Counties, Marin County, Nevada County, Pajaro Valley, Solano, and Napa Counties. 3.

About Dignity Health Dominican Hospital's Community Benefit Program Dignity Health Dominican Hospital was founded on September 14, 1941and became a member of Dignity Health, formerly Catholic Healthcare West (CHW), in 1988. Dominican Hospital is licensed for 223 inpatient beds and is comprised of two campuses: the Soquel Drive acute care hospital for inpatient services and Dominican's Rehabilitation Services on Frederick Street for outpatient services. Dominican Hospital has a staff of 1,700 employees and professional relationships with more than 468 local physicians and allied health professionals. Major programs and services include Cardiovascular, OB/GYN, Orthopedics, General Surgery, Pulmonary, Neurosciences, Oncology, Maternal/Child Health , Level III NICU, Cardio/Thoracic/Vascular Surgery, Intensive Care Unit, Emergency Services and Rehabilitation. The hospital engages in multiple activities to conduct its community benefit and community health improvement planning process. These include, but are not limited to: conducting a Community Health Needs Assessment with community input at least every three years; using five core principles (see below) to guide planning and program decisions; measuring and DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 12 tracking program indicators; and engaging the Dominican Community Advisors and other stakeholders in the development and annual updating of the community benefit plan. As a matter of Dignity H ealth policy, the hospital's community benefit programs are guided by five core principles. All of their initiatives relate to one or more of these principles: Disproportionate Unmet Health-Related Needs : Seek to address the needs of communities with disproportionate unmet health-related needs. Primary Prevention : Address the underlying causes of persistent health problems through health promotion, disease prevention, and health protection. Seamless Continuum of Care : Emphasize evidence-based approaches by establishing operational linkages between clinical services and community health improvement activities. Community Capacity : Target charitable resources to mobilize and build the capacity of existing community assets. Collaborative Governance : Engage diverse community stakeholders in the selection, design, implementation, and evaluation of program activities. In response to identified health-related needs in the Community Assessment Project, ( a collaborative project to measure and improve the quality of life in Santa Cruz County), Dignity Health Dominican Hospital sets forth its commitment to the care of the poor, to wellness promotion, disease prevention and education. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital's community benefit program includes financial assistance provided to those who are unable to pay the cost of their care, unreimbursed costs of Medicaid, subsidized health services that meet a community need, and community health improvement services. Our community benefit also includes monetary grants we provide to not-for-profit organizations that are working together to improve health on significant needs identified in our Community Health Needs Assessment. Dignity Health's community investment program makes low-interest loans to nonprofit organizations that deliver health-related services to low-income communities. A Dignity Health loan to the Santa Cruz Women's Health Center (SCWHC) funded a new clinic that opened in 2014 in Live Oak for pediatric services, as well as primary care, mental health, and substance- abuse services for adults. The SCWHC is a nonprofit Federally Qualified Health Center dedicated to providing culturally appropriate and affordable medical services for Santa Cru z County's low -income, uninsured, and underinsured residents. DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 13 Community Served The Internal Revenue Service defines the \"community served\" by a hospital as tho se individuals residing within its hospital service area. A hospital service area includes all residents in a defined geographic area and does not exclude low-income or underserved populations. Geographic Description of Community Served Santa Cruz County has a population of approximately 271,804 and covers 445 square miles. The two major cities are Santa Cruz, located on the northern side of the Monterey Bay, and Watsonville, situated in the southern part of the county. The city of Santa Cruz, which is the county seat, has an estimated population of 63,789 as of January 2015. Santa Cruz is one of California's most popular seaside resorts with its historic Boardwalk, spectacular coastline, and accessible beaches. The City of Watsonville is the center of the county's agricultural activity, with major industries including food harvesting, canning, and freezing. As of January 2015, the City of Watsonville has an estimated population of 52,087. Other incorporated areas in the county include the cities of Scotts Valley and Capitola. Approximately 49% of the population lives in the unincorporated parts of the county, including the towns of Aptos, Davenport, Freedom, Soquel, Felton, Ben Lomond and Boulder Creek, and districts including the San Lorenzo Valley, Live Oak, and Pajaro. Demographic Profile of Community Served The county is 58% White and 33% Latino with the remainder of the population comprised of Asian, African American and other ethnic backgrounds. The county has a relatively mature population with 52% of the residents' ages 35 or older. The senior population, those aged 60 and older, represent 20% of the population. While the county's largest ethnic group is White, the fastest growing ethnic group is Latino. Most Santa Cruz County residents had a high school degree ( 86%) in 2015. Median family income was $80,788 in Santa Cruz County in 2014, higher than in California ($71,015) and the nation overall ($65,910). The unemployment rate in Santa Cruz County and throughout the country has steadily declined since 2010, following a ten-year high. The unemployment rate was 8.7% for the county during 2014, higher than the state overall (7.5%). The City of Watsonville had the highest unemployment rate at 11.2% for 2014. The median sales price of homes in Santa Cruz-Watsonville metro area has increased 80% since 2009; rent has decreased in the county since 2011. Average rent for a one bedroom apartment was $1,424 in 2011 compared to $1,387 in 2014, a decrease of 6%.

Total Population: 271,804 (Source: American Community Survey) Hispanic or Latino: 33% (Source: American Community Survey) DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 14 Race: 58% White, 9% Black/African American, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Other, or Two or More Races (Source: American Community Survey) Median Income: $80,788 (Source: American Community Survey) Unemployment: 8.7% Development Department) No HS (Source: American Community Survey) Medicaid Patients: 65,806 (24% of the population) Other Area Hospitals: 2 Medically Underserved Areas or Populations: Yes (The Felton/West Santa Cruz Area and Monterey Service Area (within Santa Cruz) With regard to medically underserved populations in Santa Cruz County: A greater proportion of surveyed adults aged 18 - 65 in 2014 ( 22%) than in 20 13 (14%) were without health insurance coverage (SCC CAP 2015: 69 ). White CAP survey respondents were significantly more likely than Hispanics, to have had dental care in the previous 12 months (White 74% vs. Hispanic 58%)(SCC CAP 2015) White CAP survey respondents were significantly more likely than Hispanics to have had a regular source of health care in 2015 (White 94% vs. Hispanics 80%) (SCC CAP 2105) One tool used to assess health need is the Community Need Index (CNI) created and made publically available by Dignity Health and Truven Health and Truven Health Analytics. The CNI analyzes data at the zip code level on five factors known to contribute or be barriers to health care access: income, culture/language, education, housing status, and insurance coverage. Scores from 1.0 (lowest barriers) to 5.0 (highest barriers) for each facto r are averaged to calculate a CNI score for each zip code in the community. Research has shown that communities with the highest CNI scores experience twice the rate of hospital admissions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions as those with the lowest scores. Santa Cruz County's CNI scores clearly indicate that the greatest areas of need are in South County. This tracks with CAP data and qualitative data gained through focus groups and key information interviews.

Specifically, adults earning less than 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (approximately $15,856 annually for an individual) are now eligible for Medi- Cal. In 2014, \"Covered California ,\" a State Health Benefit Exchange, was created to provide a marketplace for healthcare coverage for any Californian. In addition, Americans and legal residents with incomes between 139% and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level can benefit from subsidized premiums.1 The County of Santa Cruz reported that since October 2013 over 19,131 residents successfully enrolled in Covered California. Since 2009, Santa Cruz County has seen a 105% increase in Medi-Cal members from 31,415 to 64,329, with 46% of their current membership being Latino.2 1 http://www.healthforcalifornia.com/covered-california 2 Central California Alliance for Health.

The CHNA data collection process took place over six months and culminated in a report written for Dignity Health Dominican Hospital in March of 2016. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital' s CHNA Process Primary Qualitative Data (Community Input) Dignity Health Dominican Hospital worked with Applied Survey Research (ASR) to conduct primary research. They used three strategies for collecting community input: key informant interviews with health experts, focus groups with professionals, and telephone surveys with 700 randomly selected residents as part of the yearly Community Assessment Project. Each focus group and interview was recorded and summarized as a stand-alone piece of data. When all groups had been conducted, the team used qualitative research software tools to analyze the information and tabulated all health needs that were mentioned, along with health drivers discussed. ASR then made a list of all of the conditions that had been mentioned by a focus group or key informant, counted how many groups or informants listed the condition and how many times they had been prioritized by a focus group. Over th e past twenty years, a consortium of publi c and privat e health, education, human service, and civi c organizations, convened by th e United Way of Santa Cruz County, have sponsored th e Community Assessment Project (CAP), a collaborativ e project to measure and improv e the quality of lif e in Sant a Cruz County by: raising public awareness of human needs, changing trends, emerging issues, community assets and challenges; providing accurate, credible and valid information on an ongoing basis to guide decision making; October 2015 -January 2016 January - March 2016 DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 18 setting community goals that will lead to positive healthy development for individuals, families, and communities; and supporting and assisting collaborative action plans to achieve the community goals. Community Leader Input In all, ASR consulted with 55 community representatives of various organizations and sectors. These representatives either work in the health field or improve health conditions by serving those from the target populations. In the list below, the number in parentheses indicates the number of participants from each sector. Santa Cruz County Public Health Department (4) Santa Cruz County Health & Hospital System (4) Other Santa Cruz County employees (8) Nonprofit agencies (22) Business sector (5) Community Organizers/Volunteers (8) Education sector (3) Funder (1) See Attachment 3 for the titles and expertise of key stakeholders. See Attachment 4 for key informant interview and focus group protocols. Key Informant Interviews ASR conducted primary research via key informant interviews with 3 Santa Cruz County experts from various organizations. Between December 2015 and January 2016, experts including the health service agency director, and 2 community clinic directors were consulted. These experts had countywide experience and expertis e. Experts were interviewed in person or by telephone for approximately one hour. Informants were asked to identify the top needs of their constituencies, how access to healthcare has changed in the post-Affordable Care Act environment, the impact of the physical environment on health, and the effect of the use of new technologies for health-related activities.

Resident Input and the Santa Cruz County Community Assessment Project Dignity Health Dominican Hospital utilized the primary data collected and analyzed in the Santa Cruz County Community Assessment Project (CAP) to access resident input for the 2016 CHNA . The CAP assesses quality of life across six subject areas: the economy, education, health, public safety, the social environment, and the natural environment. The CAP features over 90 indicators across these fields, including both primary and secondary data. Biennially, ASR conducts a telephone survey of a representative sample of 700 Santa Cruz County residents: 2015 was a survey year. ASR uses a 5-step Assessment Process outlined here. Over 300 community stakeholders participate in setting goals for the CAP project. The goals for the health section of the report are set by the Health Improvement Partnership (HIP), a local coalition of public and private health care leaders dedicated to increasing access to health care and building stronger local health care systems. The HIP has representation from the public health department in addition to community clinics who are serving the medically underserved, low-income, and DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 20 minority populations. The goals from CAP are taken into account when identifying top health needs. CAP Methodology Sample Selection and Data Weighting In 2015, 784 surveys were completed with county residents. Telephone contacts were attempted with a random sample of residents 18 years or older in Santa Cruz County. Potential respondents were selected based on phone number prefixes, and quota sampling was employed to obtain the desired geographic distribution of respondents across North County, South County, and the San Lorenzo Valley. In 2015, quotas were also set for Latino respondents in order to increase the number of Latino survey respondents. In order to address the increasing number of households without landline telephone service, the sample included wireless-only and wireless/land-line random digit dial prefixes in Santa Cruz County. All cell phone numbers were dialed manually (by hand) to comply with Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) rules. Respondents were screened for geography, as cell phones are not necessarily located where the number came from originally. As previously mentioned, quotas were used with respect to respondents' location of residence. The quotas were designed to obtain sufficient samples to allow generalization to the overall population within each of the three designated geographic areas (North County, South County, and the San Lorenzo Valley). This method of sampling necessitated an over-sample of the San Lorenzo Valley due to its small size in relation to the rest of the county. The over- sampling of San Lorenzo Valley allowed for reliable comparisons with the other two regions (North County and South County). In total 784 surveys were completed, 282 in North County, 256 in South County, and 246 in San Lorenzo Valley. Data from the 2015 surve y were \"weighted\" along several demographic dimensions prior to data analysis. Data weighting is a procedure that adjusts for discrepancies between demographic proportions within a sample and the population from which the sample was drawn. For example, within the 2015 survey, the sample was 60% female and 40% male, whereas the population in Santa Cruz County is very near to evenly split between the two genders. When the data are weighted to adjust for the over-sampling of females, answers given by each female respondent are weighted slightly downward, and answers given by each male respondent are weighted slightly upward, thus compensating for the disproportionate sampling. The survey data for 2015 were simultaneously weighted along the following demographic characteristics: gender, ethnicity, and geographic location. Weighting for both ethnicity and gender was performed to be region-specific, based on 2010 Census data, in order to account for differences across the three regions of Santa Cruz County. The weighted data were used in the generation of the overall frequency tables, and all of the cross-tabulations, DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 21 with the exception of the regional cross-tabulations. For the regional cross-tabulations, the regional weights were dropped so that the San Lorenzo Valley oversample could be utilized. There are important characteristics of weighted data that need to be mentioned. Within a weighted data set, the weights of each person's responses are determined by that individual's characteristics along the weighted d imensions (gender, ethnicity, geographic location). Thus, different respondents will have different weights attributed to their responses, based on each person's intersection along the three weighted demographic dimensions. Sample Representativeness A sample size of 784 residents provides 95% confidence that the opinions of survey respondents do not differ from those of the general population of Santa Cruz County by more than +/- 3.5%. This \"margin of error\" is useful in assessing how likely it is that th e responses observed in the sample would be found in the population of all residents in Santa Cruz County if every resident were to be polled. It is important to note that the margin of error is increased as the sample size is reduced. This becomes relevant when focusing on particular breakdowns or subpopulations in which the overall sample is broken down into smaller groups. In these instances, the margin of error will be larger than the initially stated interval of 3.5%. It should be understood that all surveys have subtle and inherent biases. ASR has worked diligently with the CAP Steering Committee to reduce risks of bias and to eliminate identifiable biases. One remaining bias in this study appears in the area of respondent self- selection; the capturing of opinions only of those willing to contribute approximately 20 minutes of their time to participate in this community survey. Secondary Quantitative Data Collection ASR compiled the research and provided comparisons with existing benchmarks (Healthy People 2020, statewide and national averages). Information Gaps & Limitations ASR and Dignity Health Dominican Hospital were limited in their ability to assess some of the identified community health needs due to a lack of secondary data. Such limitations included lack of data for: Health data for residents without documentation More detailed information on Intentional and unintentional injuries Climate and Health DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 22 Asthma 5. IDENTIFICATION AND PRIORITIZATION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS Identification of Community Health Needs As described in Section 4, a variety of experts and community members were consulted about the health of the community. Community members were frank and forthcoming about their personal experiences with health challenges and their perceptions about the needs of their families and community. Collectively, they identified a diverse set of health conditions and demonstrated a clear understanding of the health behaviors and other drivers (environmental and clinical) that affect the health outcomes. They spoke about prevention, access to care, clinical practices that work and don't work, and their overall perception s of the community's health. Qualitative Data Findings Dignity Health Dominican Hospital sought to understand specific aspects of community health during the 2016 CHNA. Starting with a solid understanding of the health conditions, drivers, and social determinants of health that are concerning to the community, ASR dove deeper into these questions during focus groups and key informant interviews: 1. What are the most important health needs in your community? What needs are not being met and which specific groups have greater unmet needs, or special needs? 2. What drivers or barriers contribute to health needs? 3. What are your suggestions for improvements or solutions to these health needs? 4. How has the Affordable Care Act impacted access to healthcare for the community? (Optional question, time permitting) Health Needs ASR facilitated conversations with key community members that resulted in the list of prioritized community health needs listed below. Unmet health needs included access to healthy food, oral health, obesity, chronic health issues in the severely mentally ill, and ensuring access to health care for undocumented individuals. Specific populations identified as having greater need included mono-lingual Spanish speakers, \"I want to really emphasize that the health needs for North and South County really do differ. Oftentimes when we talk about the health of Santa Cruz County, we are talking only about North County. I would really like the needs of South County to be included in that.\" Participant DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 23 indigenous (non-Spanish speaking) persons, homeless adults and youth, youth with emotional issues or substance use disorders, and isolated seniors. South County was identified as an area having greater health needs. Drivers and Barriers The lack of affordable housing and homelessness were repeatedly mentioned as a driver or barrier that contributes to health needs. Other drivers/barriers mentioned included chronic substance abuse, lack of access to healthy food, poverty, immigration status, cultural and language barriers, low paying jobs and lack of access to preventive care. Suggestion for Improvements or Solutions Suggestions for improvements or solutions included increased and easier exchange of information between service providers to facilitate better coordination of care, more and better trained health providers (especially Spanish-speaking and specialized care), increased funding for substance abuse treatment, improved case management, and an increased focus on prevention and early intervention. Policy ideas included taxing sugar sweetened beverages, supporting parks and funding for active living spaces, and generally ensuring that policy makers consider health-impacts in their decisions. Healthcare Access ASR also specifically sought to understand how the Affordable Care Act implementation impacted residents' access to healthcare, including affordability of care. This question was addressed with several discussion points including awareness about health insurance and healthcare access, whether more or fewer residents were now insured, costs and affordability of healthcare, sufficiency of healthcare benefits, and the utilization of primary versus emergency care. Awareness about how to obtain health insurance and health care. Most residents are aware of how to access health insurance and health care, but some do not have the \"health systems li teracy\" that they need to navigate the system and make choices. Populations who may be less aware or have more difficulty accessing insurance are undocumented immigrants, those who do not speak English, those with limited/no literacy, and homeless persons who don't have the documentation necessary to enroll . Proportions Insured. Experts reported an increase in the number of insured since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was instituted ; the biggest increase is in the number people insured by Medi-Cal, which was credited to outreach by hospitals, county, and nonprofits . Difficulties affording insurance and care. Experts working with at-risk, low-income populations reported that their clients were having less difficulty affording insurance and DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 24 health care. However, service providers and health professionals reported that residents with private insurance often face prohibitive co-pays and other costs. Insurance benefits or \"coverage .\" There were mixed responses about benefits; some said coverage is better now and others said it was worse. Those who said it was worse reported that services that used to be covered are no longer covered . Participants said that mental health services are still insufficient \u2014 especially for those with plans outside of Medi-Cal . Primary care versus emergency care . Experts who serve Medi-Cal patients in community clinics report that more of their patients are seeking preventative care through the clinics and more are assigned to primary care physicians. There were mixed responses about whether people are using the emergency department (ED) as primary care to the same degree; some cited fewer people using the ED because they now have access to primary and preventative care, while others said some continue or increased use of the ED becaus e of long appointment wait times and lack of awareness about using primary care doctors . Health Needs Data Synthesis In order to generate a list of health needs, ASR started from the designated health list from Dignity Health Dominican Hospital's 2013 CHNA. Building on the CHNA work done by ASR in the East Bay, San Mateo and other locations, as well as the data collected during the CAP, focus groups, and key informant interviews, ASR finalized the list of significant health needs for Santa Cruz County and shared this with the Dominican Community Advisors for final review. A total of 20 health conditions or drivers were retained as community health needs and are listed below, in alphabetical order. Summarized Descriptions of Santa Cruz County's Community Health Needs Access and delivery continue to be a health need in Santa Cruz County . The County of Santa Cruz reported that since October 2013 over 19,131 residents successfully enrolled in Covered California. Since 2009, Santa Cruz County has seen a 105% increase in Medi-Cal members from 31,415 to 64,329, with 46% of their current membership being Latino. Ninety- four percent of White CAP survey respondents reported having a regular source of health care in 2015, as compared to only 80% of Latinos . White respondents were significantly more likely than Latino respondents to go to a private practice for their regular source of health care, while Latino respondents were significantly more likely than White respondents to go to a community clinic for their regular source of health care. Community members indicated that patients need help navigating the healthcare system. Language barriers , immigration status, and lack of cultural competence also negatively affect access for minority populations . Service providers and health professionals noted that residents with Medi-Cal and other low-income plans have effective insurance coverage, while those with private insurance often face prohibitive co-pays and other costs.

Need for additional specialized health workers is a health need as expressed by the community. Service providers and health professionals both expressed the need for more and varied specialized doctors and practitioners. Asthma has consistently been identified as a health need in Santa Cruz County, but there is currently no relevant data to track it. Cancer is a health need in Santa Cruz County as marked by breast cancer death rates that are higher than the California rate and that do not meet the Healthy People 2020 objective. 87.8%93.0%* 81.6%* 0%20%40%60%80%100% Overall White Latino DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 26 Climate and health is a health need in Santa Cruz County as marked by an increasing number of air quality related neighborhood complaints. Poor air quality can aggravate asthma and other respiratory conditions. Depression and mental health are health needs in Santa Cruz County as marked by a rise over time in the percentage of self-reported mental and emotional problems. Suicide is in the top 10 leading causes of death in the county. Community input indicates that the health need is likely being affected by a limited supply of mental healthcare providers and substance abuse treatment options as well as lack of insurance coverage for these behavioral health benefits among those who are insured. There were also indications that the level of stigma associated with behavioral health issues may make it harder for individuals with such issues to seek and obtain help . The community identified a variety of factors that cause stress and thus have a negative impact on well-being, including lack of affordable housing, experiencing food insecurity, being unemployed or under-employed or having multiple jobs, homelessness, having undocumented status , and experiencing economic disparities .

Diabetes is a health need in Santa Cruz County as marked by a slight rise over time in the percentage of self-reported diabetics. Diabetes is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the county. Of greatest concern to service providers and health professionals was the connection between poor outcomes for people with chronic diabetes, and poverty and the lack of access to affordable, healthy food. DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 27 Economic security is a health need in Santa Cruz County as marked by rising percentages of adults living below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. Unemployment rates are rising and are higher than both the state and national level. While educational indicators (high school exit exam performance, educational attainment) were better in the county as a whole than in the state, 67% of 3rd grade students did not meet the English Language Arts/Literacy Standards and 66% did not meet the Mathematical standards for the CAASPP test measuring student performance and progress. Low-income individuals were identified as having less access to basic needs such as affordable healthy food and housing, and even when having insurance, being unable to afford co-pays or prescriptions. Service providers and health professionals identified this as a significant need, under-pinning many factors affecting health.

Low-income individuals and families often have to make tough choices each month, sometimes foregoing certain basic needs such as food, housing, or utilities. Service providers and health professionals both stressed that access to affordable, healthy food is a significant health need in Santa Cruz County, impacting already vulnerable populations including seniors, undocumented individuals, homeless persons, low-income families, and individuals with mental health problems.

Note: Survey question was modified in 2013 and is therefore not comparable to previous years. *Significance testing: Latino respondents were significantly more likely than White respondents to be unable to get more food when the food they bought ran out in 2015. Heart disease and stroke are health needs in Santa Cruz County . Being overweight (or obese) is a cardiovascular risk factor. The percentage of surveyed adults who are overweight or obese has risen; the groups with higher percentages of obesity are low- income residents and Latinos. The community expressed concern about hypertension, the lack of nutrition education, and the availability of fast food in comparison to healthy/fresh food. Housing and homelessness are health needs in Santa Cruz County as marked by less affordable housing in the county compared to the country. The community identified the lack of affordable housing as of concern, with 24% of CAP respondents naming the cost of living/housing as the number one factor diminishing their quality of living. Service providers and health professionals repeatedly cited housing concerns as a significant factor impacting health conditions. They also cited the strong relationship between homelessness, substance use, and mental health issues.

Findings from the Massachusetts General Human Trafficking Initiative indicate that approximately 90% of victims have had a health care encounter while being held against their will and were not identified. Infectious/communicable diseases and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are health needs in Santa Cruz County as marked by a rise in the incidence rate of Pertussis, also known as whooping cough.3 The uncontrollable cough most commonly affects babies and young children, although it is important to note that there are a growing number of teenagers who are experiencing this disease . In Santa Cruz County, reported cases more than quadrupled between 2012 and 2013, and then tripled between 2013 and 2014. The most commonly reported STI over the past decade in Santa Cruz County has been Chlamydia, which increased from 661 cases in 2008 to 912 cases in 2014. Reported cases of gonorrhea increased by 193% between 2008 and 2014. Syphilis infections have steadily increased over the last six years, from 4 cases reported in 2008 to 45 cases in 2014. Maternal and child health were mentioned as health needs in Santa Cruz County. Community concerns focused on teen pregnancy, although the data show that the rate of teen births in the county is less than the state rate of teen births. Service providers and health professionals were particularly concerned with the disparity between whites (17 teen births) and Hispanics (150 teen births)4, particularly teens in Watsonville. Obesity/Healthy Eating, Active Nutrition is a health need in Santa Cruz County. While childhood weight statistics are unstable due to the low number of respondents to the California Health Interview Survey, the CAP survey of adult respondents showed an increase in overweight and obese adults and an increase in the frequency of eating fast food. Community concerns included the relative availability of fast food restaurants compared to healthy/fresh foods, the cost of healthy food, access to grocery stores in low-income neighborhoods, and not enough culturally appropriate nutrition education. 3 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Oral/dental health is a health need in Santa Cruz County as marked by a decrease in the percentage of surveyed adults who had dental care in the past year. Latino residents are disproportionately affected. The health need is likely being impacted by certain social determinants of health and by the cost of dental care. Service providers and health professionals stressed the need for early dental care for children, and cited high levels of soda consumption as a factor in poor dental health.

Substance Use is a health need as marked by the increase in binge drinking among CAP survey respondents . According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, binge drinking is \"a pattern of drinking that brings a person's blood alcohol concentration to 0.08 grams percent or above.\"5 This level of intoxication typically involves 5 or more drinks for males and 4 or more drinks for females in about a 2 hour period. Binge drinking greatly increases the chances of getting hurt or hurting others due to car crashes, violence, and suicide. In addition, the drug-related death rate in the county continued to be higher than the state and did not meet Healthy People 2020 objectives. Fifty five percent of CAP respondents replied that they were at least somewhat concerned about alcohol and drug abuse in their neighborhood. Considering all types of alcoholic beverages, during the past 30 days about how many times did you have 5 or more drinks on an occasion? An occasion is considered about 2 hours.

Significant factors include being afraid to access services due to undocumented status, and uncertainty about insurance eligibility. An additional related health need was their inability to afford healthy food. Mono-lingual, migrant workers who are uninsured were identified as a particularly at-risk group. Unintentional injuries are a health concern. Unintentional non-fatal injuries include accidents that are the result of falls, poisoning, being struck by an object, firearm, or moto r vehicle. There were 107 unintentional non-fatal injuries for children, youth, and young adults ages 0-20 in 2013, down 33% from 159 in 2007. Both the number and rate of injuries fell for this age group over the last 7 years. According to the California Department of Public Health6, the top cause of unintentional non-fatal injuries in Santa Cruz County was falls. Violence/Injury prevention are health needs in Santa Cruz County because although violence (including violent crime) and abuse are trending down in Santa Cruz County , 49% of surveyed adults report being at least somewhat concerned about gangs and/or violence in their neighborhood . Community input indicates that violence and abuse are seen as urgent health needs in the county. Quality of Life Racism and discrimination are important to measure because they adversely affect mental and physical health.7 Approximately 14% of CAP survey respondents felt they were discriminated against in Santa Cruz County in the 12 months previous to taking the survey . Forty-six percent of CAP survey respondents felt discriminated against or treated unfairly due to race/ethnicity, while 21% that indicated it was due to age. Less than two-thirds (61%) of CAP survey respondents reported being \"very satisfied\" with their overall quality of life in 2015, a slight decrease from 67% in 2013. In 2015, the number one factor that took away from quality of life in Santa Cruz County was cost of living/housing. However, 24% of CAP respondents responded 'strongly agree' when asked i f they knew how to make a positive change in their community. Prioritization of Health Needs The IRS CHNA requirements state that hospital facilities must identify significant health needs of the community, and prioritize those health needs. In order to identify significant health needs, ASR facilitated a discussion with the Dominican Community Advisors, who reviewed all of the quantitative and qualitative data, the list of significant health needs and their 6 California Department of Public Health.

DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 33 impact on the community. They were given the option to add or delete needs, and then went through a prioritization process to narrow the list to four, combining and redefining some to fit the specific needs of the county. (Data collection methods are further described in Section 4 .) The top three health needs, as prioritized by the Dominican Community Advisors are listed here, and explained in further detail below : Integrated Behavioral Health Economic Security (Income & Employment/Housing & Homelessness) A Continuum of Care Approach to Access & Delivery Integrated Behavioral Health During their prioritization process, the DCA identified the need for a more integrated approach to behavioral health. For the CHNA, Integrated Behavioral Health is the idea that physical and emotional health are connected and can be addressed together to produce the best possible health outcomes. Providers collaborate to address physical, developmental, social, behavioral, and emotional needs, including mental health and substance abuse conditions, depression, health behaviors (including their contribution to chronic medical illnesses), life stressors and crises, and stress-related physical symptoms. Selected comments from the DCA: Those with private insurance face prohibitive co-pays and other costs, making it difficult to afford support and treatment. Significant need for more behavioral health professionals in Santa Cruz County, especially bi-lingual providers. There is a lack of in-patient and in-crisis services for youth. Stigma prevents many people from seeking mental/behavioral health treatment. Three particularly under-served areas are South County, Live Oak, and San Lorenzo Valley. Suggestions for Improvements or solutions Sugg estions for improvements or solutions included increased funding for substance abuse treatment, Specific vulnerable populations mentioned Youth 0- 24 Transition Age Youth Children 0-5 Older adults 40- 55 LGBTQ Persons experiencing homelessness Chronically homeless Mono-lingual Spanish speakers Undocumented persons Low-income individuals DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 34 improved case management and care coordination, and an increased focus on prevention and early intervention. Health professionals asked for better information about risk assessment, intervention strategies and protocols. Economic Security (Income & Employment/Housing & Homelessness) During their prioritization process, the DCA combined several needs into this one broader need: Economic security includes employment, access to education and/or vocational training, affordable housing, homelessness, food insecurity and other factors related to poverty and lack of income. Selected comments from the DCA: Working youth struggle to find jobs that pay enough to cover health costs Low income families often have children who work. They need additional support so that children can focus on school . More support needed for low-income pregnant women and young mothers to stop the cycle of poverty. Teen moms are especially vulnerable in Watsonville Nutritious food should be more readily available and affordable. Many low income neighborhoods are \"food deserts \" making it challenging for families to eat nutritious meals The recently incarcerated and those in gangs struggle to find employment, and therefore pay for healthcare Grandparents raising grandchildren are particularly vulnerable to problems surrounding economic security Suggestions for Improvements or solutions Sugges tions for improvements or solutions included increased funding for skills development training and better education regarding earned income programs. Health care providers suggested that hospitals could screen for food insecurity and provide referrals to relevant programs. Policy ideas included supporting parks and funding for active living spaces, and generally ensuring that policy makers consider health-impacts in their decisions. A Continuum of Care Approach to Access & Delivery The Continuum of Care Approach is an integrated system that guides and tracks patients over time through a comprehensive array of health services spanning all levels and intensity Specific vulnerable populations mentioned Youth Families Pregnant women & young mothers Teen mothers Recently incarcerated & gang members GrandparentsDIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 35 of care. It combines prevention and early intervention, while addressing the Social Determinants of Health. Selected comments from the DCA: At-risk mothers would benefit from this integrated approach, ensuring timely advice, coordinated care and services Education about benefits of this approach is needed for funders and policy makers Prevention is a key factor Significant need for more healthcare professionals trained in Trauma Informed Care Att ention to oral health early is part of the continuum of care and is an important part of a child's overall health care Providers n eed specific training and sensitivity when working with youth Need more primary care doctors as well as specialty doctors Suggestions for Improvements or solutions Sugg estions for improvements or solutions included improved case management, an increased focus on prevention and early intervention (including a new vaccination policy), increased and easier exchange of information between service providers to facilitate better coordination of care, and more and better trained health providers (especially Spanish-speaking and specialized care), Policy ideas included taxing sugar sweetened beverages, supporting parks and funding for active living spaces, and generally ensuring that policy makers consider health-impacts in their decisions. Specific vulnerable populations mentioned 1st time mothers Low-income mothers Youth who experience Adverse Childhood EventsDIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 36 Human Trafficking* Dignity Health prioritized Human Trafficking because while every state in the nation is affected, California and Nevada record among the highest number of cases. Dignity Health hospitals are deeply embedded in communities that have transient populations and high rates of poverty, unemployment, and family instability that can create conditions ripe for human trafficking. Dignity Health clinicians and staff know that they are seeing victims in their facilities. However, findings from the Massachusetts General Human Trafficking Initiative indicate that approximately 90% of victims have had a health care encounter while being held against their will and were not identified. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital has assigned a task force to address this need, and trains key staff to identify signs of a human trafficking. *While not identified as a priority health need during the Dominican Hospital CHNA process, Dignity Health has placed a system-wide priority on this need. \"Human Trafficking is a global problem where every day innocent people become victims. It is not something that only happens in other countries, it happens where you live, and can affect the people you know. Once they are part of the system, most will become a statistic. Sometimes, the only chance they have is that one person notices something is wrong and speaks up.

Intervention Actions for Achieving Goal Prioritize grant applications that address target areas. Collaboration Homelessness Smart Path to Health and Housing Project is a collaboration with United Way of Santa Cruz County, Homeless Services Center, and Homeless Action Partnership. Smart Path to Health and Housing engages organizations in both health and homeless service sectors to create a single, shared system to identify, assess, match and track housing and health needs and outcomes for homeless individuals and families across our county. In January 2016, Dignity Health granted Smart Path to Health and Housing project $200,000 through the social innovation partnership grant program, to coordinate housing services for homeless individuals with medical vulnerability, high risk for early death on the street, and high use of costly crisis health care services. DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 48 Dignity Health Dominican Hospital was one of several community partners, including Watsonville Hospital, Hospice of Santa Cruz County, Central California Alliance for Health, and Palo Alto Medical Foundation among others, who recognized the value of coordination of services and collaboration between agencies to ensure the health and the continued recovery of homeless individuals coming out of the hospital. The Homeless Services Center 's (HSC) Recuperative Care Center (RCC) includes 24-hour shelter services with meals, housekeeping, security and onsite case management provided by the Homeless Services Center in combination with primary care, including medication management support, clinical social work and case management, provided by the County Homeless Persons' Health Projec t (HPHP). The RCC provides a safe place for people who are homeless to fully recover following hospital discharge. These are individuals who would otherwise be well enough to be discharged to home with support for self-care provided by friend or family member. The RCC provides a safe home-like setting and the support for recovery and onsite primary care. Because this is a socially and medically complex care population, additional care and support are provided to support full recovery, linkage to primary care and transition to temporary or permanent housing as often as possible. Planning and coordination for delivery of home health care services at the RCC will ensure that these services are also available when needed for full recovery. Mental Health Issues and Substance Use Disorders The Psychiatric Resource Team (PRT), a Dominican Hospital Community Benefit Program, improve s access to behavioral health services and helps to decrease the suicide rate in Santa Cruz County. They also develop and present behavioral health specific education and in-services to Dominican employees. Primary collaboration is with Santa Cruz County Behavioral Health Services. The Behavioral Health Center is operated by the Telecare Corporation, Encompass Community Services, as well as other related care providers with oversight of the Santa Cruz County Health Service Agency. There is also collaboration with The Recovery Center (the Center), operated by Janus of Santa Cruz, an independent contractor and program partner with expertise in addiction treatment. The Center operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Up to 10 adults (men and women) ages 18 years and older can safely recover from intoxication under the supervision of trained facility staff. The Center accepts admissions from any law enforcement agency in the County. Human Trafficking An initiative of Dignity Health, a Task Force has been identified at Dominican Hospital. The purpose of the task force at each facility is to ensure that each key department is represented (i.e. Security, Social Work/Care Coordination, Community Benefit, Chaplains, DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) P a g e | 49 ED Director/ Manager, Education). Each key department's representative(s) will ensure staff is educated and that protocols are up- to-date, understood by staff, and followed properly. Task force members will meet as needed to review cases and protocols and to communicate feedback to the point person(s) about successes, failures, obstacles, and opportunities for improvement. The Task Force also collaborates with national organizations like AMBER Alert, Dept. of Justice, Dept. of Homeland Security, Office for Victims of Crime, Humanity United, and others on anti-trafficking efforts. 7.CONCLUSION Dignity Health Dominican Hospital worked to meet the requirements of the federally required CHNA by pooling expertise, guidance, and resources for a comprehensive community assessment. By gathering secondary data, using primary data collected during the CAP survey, and conducting new primary data collection, Dignity Health Dominican Hospital was able to collectively understand the community's perception of health needs and prioritize health needs with an understanding of how each compares against benchmarks. After making this CHNA report publicly available in 2016, Dignity Health Dominican Hospital and its Community Advisors will develop an implementation plan and prioritize interventions around these health needs.

(b)(1) -(2)) Community inform ation & assessing health needs Community served by a hospital facility In defining the community it serves, a hospital facility may take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances, including the geographic area served by the hospital facility, target population(s) served for example, children, women, or the aged), and principal functions (for example, focus on a particular specialty area or targeted disease). However, a hospital facility may not define its community to exclu de medically underserved, low-income, or minority populations who live in the geographic areas from which the hospital facility draws its patients (unless such populations are not part of the hospital facility's target patient population(s) or affected by its principal functions) or otherwise should be included based on the method the hospital facility uses to define its community. In addition, in determining its patient populations for purposes of defining its community, a hospital facility must take into account all patients without regard to whether (or how much) they or their insurers pay for the care received or whether they are eligible for assistance under the hospital facility's financial assistance policy. In the case of a hospital facility consis ting of multiple buildings that operate under a single state license and serve different geographic areas or populations, the community served by the hospital facility is the aggregate of such areas or populations. (b)(3) Assessing community health needs To assess the health needs of the community it serves, a hospital facility must identify significant health needs of the community, prioritize those health needs, and identify resources (such as organizations, facilities, and programs in the community, including those of the hospital facility) potentially available to address those health needs. For these purposes, the health needs of a community include requisites for the improvement or maintenance of health status both in the community at large and in particular parts of the community (such as particular neighborhoods or populations experiencing health disparities). A hospital facility may determine whether a health need is significant based on all of the facts and circumstances present in (b)(4) 2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA ) IRS CHECKLIST Dignity Health Dominican Hospital - 2 | PageCHNA Requirement Information Required Section Reference CHNA Report Reference/ Comments the co mmunity it serves.

\u00a9 2015 Applied Survey Research 5 COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT PROJECT OVERVIEW The Santa Cruz County Community Assessment Project (CAP) is entering its third decade, with 2015 marking the 21st year of the project. The CAP was convened in 1994 through a collaboration of the United Way of Santa Cruz County and Dominican Hospital, with Applied Survey Research (ASR) as their research partner. The CAP assesses quality of life across six subject areas: the economy, education, health, public safety, the social environment, and the natural environment. The CAP features over 90 indicators across these fields, including both primary and secondary data. Biennially, ASR conducts a telephone survey of a representative sample of Santa Cruz County residents; 2015 is a survey year. Secondary data is collected from over 70 sources including at the national, state, and local level. Together with community stakeholders, the CAP is accomplished thr ough a five step process designed by ASR (see left ). One of the five steps of the community improvement process involves collaboration, while other steps focus on community action in order to achieve goals and sustain the project. The CAP in Action The CAP is one of the oldest projects of its kind with national recognition, with communities throughout the United States and Canada replicating the model. In 2007 , the CAP was chosen as one of the best community indicator projects in the United States, winning first place in the Community Indicators Consortium Innovation Awards sponsored by the Brookings Institution in Washington D.C. The Community Assessment Project was featured in Santa Cruz County's application and award of the first Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Culture of Health Prize in 2013. The prize is annually awarded to six communities in America that are making strides to become healthier and more equitable communities. Since that time, the CAP has been nationally featured by the National Academies of Science, Institute of Medicine's Roundtable for Population Health Improvement. The CAP, at its core, is an actionable document. Below are a sampling of the ways the CAP is being utilized to affect change across Santa Cruz County. Identifying Health Needs and Leveraging Resources The CAP helps The Santa Cruz Community Health Centers (SCCHC) to understand and respond to gaps in health access and disparities that exist along the lines of race and income. The CAP is a consistent source of timely, local data that allows the SCCHC to leverage funding to improve community health and insights in order to respond to community health needs. Community Assessment Project Overview Santa Cruz County Community Assessment Project, Year 21, 2015 6 \u00a9 2015 Applied Survey Research The Public Health Division of the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency is currently pursuing Public Health Accreditation, and are utilizing the data from the CAP to help complete various components of their required Community Health Assessment. The Public Health Division also utilizes CAP data in grant applications, specifically demographics, housing information, obesity, nutrition and physical activity data. Utilizing Data to Reduce Disparities As a data driven department, the Santa Cruz County Probation Department has used data from the annual CAP report in a number of ways, including improvement of services for Latino youth and residents residing in South County, securing a grant to help renovate juvenile hall and expand youth programming, securing funding to expand programming, particularly for Latino youth and families, and development of a proposal to put i n place a culinary arts program at juvenile hall. The CAP report supports the Probation Department's work around reducing racial and ethnic disparities, particularly for juveniles in the justice system. This type of work necessitates that any practice and policy changes are based on data. The annual demographics provided in the CAP allow the Probation Department to stay ahead of emerging trends and to prepare in order to be culturally and linguistically responsive to the needs of their clients. Creating Communities for Youth to Thrive Ecology Action (EA) used the CAP data regarding childhood obesity rates and overall population physical activity levels to assess where youth bike safety and encouragement programs were most needed, and to paint a picture of wellness in South County for a 2011 statewide grant proposal. The detailed CAP data about the disproportionate presence of childhood obesity in South County allowed EA to present a compelling picture of students' lives, and ultimately led to being awarded the grant amidst a very competitive field. The funding allowed EA to deliver new bicycle safety and encouragement programs in three South County schools, these programs began in 2012 and continue today. The Criminal Justice Council's Youth Violence Preve ntion Task Force (YVTF) used the unique information found in the CAP to help inform their strategic planning process. Indicators specific to the CAP and the household survey gauge how well the county is doing at creating strong communities where youth can thrive. As they move into the implementation of their strategic plan, this data will help the YVTF to track their success over time. Publications The CAP is profiled in Community Quality of Life Indicators, Best Practices III, a book about best practices in community indicator projects throughout the world1 and in the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development's (OECD) Statistics, Knowledge and Policy 2007: Measuring and Fostering the Progress of Societies .2 The United States General Accounting Office (GAO) determined that the CAP project was a best practice methodology for indicator reports. In 2010, the CAP project was featured in an article entitled \"Connecting Data to Action: How the Santa Cruz County Community Assessment Project Contributes to Better Outcomes for Youth\" in the Applied Research in Quality of Life Journal (ARIQ) focused on 1Sirgy, J., Phillips, R., Rahtz, D.

In 2011, the CAP was featured in a book entitled Diversity and Community Development: An Intercultural Approach. Goals and Heroes The CAP has nurtured and encouraged the community's focus by establishing Community Goals for improvement. There are several goals for each of the six topical areas. The Community Goals for the year 2015 were created with more than 1,000 community members, stakeholder groups, and organizations. Groups and organizations are asked to become champions to help achieve the Community Goals. The following groups led the community goal-setting process: Santa Cruz Community Credit Union, Santa Cruz County Office of Education, Ecology Action, The Health Improvement Partnership of Santa Cruz County, the Santa Cruz County Probation Department, and COPA (Communities Organized for Relational Power in Action). At the beginning of each of the subject chapters in this report is a list of community goals and community heroes who are helping to achieve those goals.

These rankings are averages calculated using data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using multiple years of data collected by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) . Rankings are based on nearly all of the 58 counties in California, where a lower ranking is better than a higher ranking. Between 2014 and 2015, Santa Cruz County improved in the quality of life and physical environment rankings. Among the various indicators, Santa Cruz County's b est scores were in health behaviors and clinical care, scoring seventh best out of 57 in 2015.

Families and individuals without health insurance coverage often have unmet health needs, receive fewer preventive services, suffer delays in receiving appropriate care and experience more hospitalizations.14 Seventy-eight percent adults were currently insured in 2014, down from 86% in 2013. Eighty-five percent of children ages birth through 17 were currently insured in 2014, down from the previous year. Covered California is the state's health insurance marketplace for the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.15 Coverage began in 2014 and includes unsubsidized coverage and subsidized coverage. Subsidized coverage varies from premium assistance, where health services are available on a sliding-scale basis, to no- cost Medi-Cal. Through subsidized care, individuals and families receive federal assistance to reduce the cost of premiums and out- of-pocket expenses for health coverage.16 During the period October 1, 2013 through March 31, 2014, there were a total of 15,071 individuals enrolled in Covered California in Santa Cruz County. During the second open enrollment period an additional 4,060 individuals enrolled bringing the total to 19,131 enrolled in Santa Cruz County. Source: UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. (2015).

There is strong evidence that shows children who are breastfed experience a decreased incidence of infectious disease, a decreased rate of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and enhanced cognitive development. Greater social benefits include decreased annual health care costs, decreased parental absenteeism from work, and a decreased environmental burden. Because of such benefits, the AAP recommends that infants be exclusively breastfed for at least six months after birth.19 In 2014 , 89% of Santa Cruz County mothers engaged in exclusive in-hospital breastfeeding, higher than California overall (67%). The percentage of Latina mothers who exclusively breast-fed in-hospital increased over the past five years, from 65% in 2010 to 85% in 2014. However, Latina mothers continue to have a much lower percentage of exclusive in-hospital breastfeeding (85%) when compared with White mothers (95 %).

Obesity is also linked to higher rates of nearly all types of cancer, including cancer of the colon, rectum, prostate, gallbladder, breast, uterus, cervix, and ovaries. For adults, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9. Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30.0 or greater. The formula for calculating the BMI of adults is: Weight in Pounds BMI = (Height in inches) x (Height in inches) x 703 Based on the Body Mass Index (BMI), the percentage of CAP survey respondents who were overweight and obese increased from 50% in 2007 to 59% in 2015 . Latinos had a higher percentage of overweight or obese respondents ( 66%), as compared to Whites (56%) in 2015. Childhood weight statistics are unstable due to the low number of respondents to the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). 2015 - Overall n : 729 ; White n : 410; Latino n : 249.

Binge drinking greatly increases the chances of getting hurt or hurting others due to car crashes, violence, and suicide.

For example, when there are more retail alcohol outlets near a university, there is more drinking among their students.24 High outlet density is also associated with higher levels of violent crime, assault, child maltreatment and abuse, and homicide.25 People who live in areas with high access to liquor stores tend to have higher levels of hospital admissions for anxiety, stress, and de pression as compared to people with low access.26 Several factors contribute to this relationship, including alcohol marketing, income, consumer spending habits, and public policy related to geographic placement of alcohol outlets. For example, there tend to be more alcohol and tobacco outlets in lower income neighborhoods compared to higher income neighborhoods . Over the past seven years, the number and rate of retail alcohol outlets per 1,000 residents in Santa Cruz County has gradually increased. Santa Cruz County consistently had a higher rate of retail alcohols outlets per 1,000 people than California (2.8 versus 2.2, respectively) in 2015. With its beaches, small population, restaurants, and entertainment venues, Santa Cruz County has become a tourist destination, which may contribute to the higher than average per capita rates of retail alcohol outlets.

The most commonly reported communicable disease over the past decade in Santa Cruz County has been Chlamydia, which increased from 661 cases in 2008 to 9 12 cases in 2014. Reported cases of gonorrhea increased by 193% between 2008 and 2014. Syphilis infections have steadily increased over the last six years, from 4 cases reported in 2008 to 45 cases in 2014. Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious yet preventable respiratory disease.26The uncontrollable cough most commonly affects babies and young children, although it is important to note that there are a growing number of teenagers who are experiencing this disease. For children under the age of one, the disease can be fatal. There were 48,277 cases of pertussis reported to CDC in 2012; the highest number of reported cases in the U.S. since 1955.27 In Santa Cruz County, reported cases more than quadrupled between 2012 and 2013 , and then tripled between 2013 and 2014 . 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 08-14% CHANGE Chlamydia 661 647 765 744 867 1,002 912 38.0% Gonorrhea 60 55 46 81 99 134 176 193.3% Hepatitis A1 2 2 0 3 2 7 3 ^ Hepatitis B (Chronic )1 19 10 19 21 44 19 55 ^ Lyme Disease 1 7 7 10 7 7 6 ^ Measles1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 ^ Pertussis (Whooping Cough)1 16 33 87 22 12 54 165 ^ Salmonellosis 60 56 31 36 28 33 52 -13.3% Shigellosis 10 2 7 9 7 10 8 ^ Syphilis (Infectiou s) 4 10 13 25 28 32 45 ^ Tuberculosis (Active) 10 5 11 10 7 5 5 ^ Source: Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency.

The top four leadi ng causes of death were cancer, especially lung cancer and breast cancer, coronary heart disease, unintentional injuries, and stroke in 2011-13. The drug related death rate in the county continued to be higher than the state and did not meet Healthy People 2020 objectives. Breast cancer in the county was also higher than the state, did not meet Healthy People 2020 objectives, and, according to the community health guide, was an area for concern with respect to the U.S. and similar demographic (peer) counties' rate s. Disparities were seen between the Latino and White population , with higher death rates for Latino residents in diseases of the liver, type 2 diabetes, and homicide . White residents had higher death rates for unintentional injuries and suicide. For Santa Cruz County youth ages 15 24, the leading cause of death over the last seven years was unintentional injuries.

When Dominican Hospital did their Community Health Needs Assessments in 2013, these are the health needs that came up. Additional needs that are relevant to our community have been added. (Using a list based on all of the needs identified by any hospital. List is at end of protocol.) a.We'd like you to let us know if you think there are any health needs (broadly defined, including social determinants of health) not on this list that should beadded. (Write them on the list.) i. Overall? ii. Specific needs for groups by gender, age, ethnicity, geography, etc.? Define unmet health needs: Needs that are not being addressed very well. For example, maybe we don't know how to prevent these problems, or we don't have enough medicines or treatments, or maybe there aren't enough doctors to treat these problems, or maybe health insurance does not cover the treatment. These are unmet because there needs to be more done about this problem. b.Please think about the top three from the list (including the added needs, if any)you believe are the most importan t to address in your community - the needs that still need attention. You'l l find some sticky colored dots on the table; once you've decided which three of these needs you think are the most important, please come on up here and put one sticky dot next t o each one of those three. We wi ll discuss your ideas on how these might be able to be addressed later in our conversation. c.Any par ticular subpopulations that are disproportionately affected? (Prompt for ethnic minorities, LGBTQ, low -income population, urban vs. rural/geographically isolated, etc.) Any other trends you are seeing in the past 5 years or so? How arethe needs changing? We will discuss your ideas on how these might be able to be addressed later in our conversation.3 2.DRIVERS/BARRIERS - 15 MIN.

CONCLUDING REMARKS Thanks for your time and sharing your perspective Confidential notes and summary of discussions to client Reminder about what will be done with the information Final CHNA report will be published in 2016 and available on Domincan Hospital's website DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Comm unity Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) Attachment 5: Prioritized Health Needs Focus Group Discussion As par t of the Community Health Needs Assessment process, Dominican Community Advisors met on January 21, 2016 and went through a facilitated process to identify and discuss the county's top health needs and most vulnerable populations. Below is a summary of the discussion. Top Three Prioritized Health Needs 1.Integrated Behavioral Health For the CHNA, Integrated Behavioral Health is the idea that physical and emotional health are connected and can be addressed together to produce the best possible health outcomes. Providers collaborate to address physical, developmental, social, behavioral, and emotional needs, including mental health and substance abuse conditions, depression, health behaviors (including their contribution to chronic medical illnesses), life stressors and crises, and stress- related physical symptom s. Selecte d comments from the DCA: Those with private in surance face prohibitive co- pays and other costs, making it difficult to afford support and treatment. Significant need for more behavioral health professionals in Santa Cruz County, especially bi- lingual providers. There is a lack of in- patient and in -crisis services for youth. Stigma prevents many people from seeking mental/behavioral health treatment. Three particularly under -served areas are South County, Live Oak, and San Lorenzo Valley. Speci fic vulnerable populations mentioned: Youth 0 -24, TAY, children 0-5, older adults 40-55, LGBTQ, p ersons experiencing h omelessness, chronically homeless m ono-lingual Spanish speakers, undocumented persons , low -income individuals 2.Economic S ecurity For the purposes of the CHNA, economic security includes employment, access to education and/or vocational training, affordable housing, homelessness, food insecurity and other factors related to poverty and lack of income. Selected comments from the DCA: Working youth struggle to find jobs that pay enough to cover health costs Low income families often have children who work. They need additional support so that children can focus on school . More support needed for low -income pregnant women and young mot hers to stop the cycle of poverty. Teen moms are especially vulnerable in Watsonville Nutritious food should be more readily available and affordable. Many low income neighborhoods are \" food deserts\" making it challenging for families to eat nutritious mea ls The recently incarcerated and those in gangs struggle to find employment, and therefore pay for healthcare Grandparents raising grandchildren are particularly vulnerable to problems surrounding economic security Specif ic vulnerable populations menti oned: Youth, families, pregnant women and young mothers, teen mothers, recently incarcerated, gang members, grandparents DIGNITY HEALTH DOMINICAN HOSPITAL SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 2016 Com munity Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) 3.Continuum of Care Approach to Health The Continuum of Care Approach is an integrated system that guides and tracks patients over time through a comprehensive array of health services spanning all levels and intensity of care. It combines prevention and early intervention, while addressing the Social Determinants of Health. Select ed comments from the DCA: At-risk mothers would benefit from this integrated approach, ensuring timely advice, coordinated care and services Education about benefits of this approach is needed for funders and policy makers Prevention is key a key factor Significant need for more healthcare professionals trained in Trauma Informed Care Attention to oral health early is part of the continuum of care and is an important part of a child's overall health care Need specific training and sensitivity for provider s who work with youth Need more primary care doctors as well as specialty doctors Speci fic vulnerable populations mentioned: 1st time/l ow-income mothers and youth with ACEs Other P rioritized Health Needs More risk assessment data from Dominican shared with community partners Increased Educational Attainment for English Language Learners Obesity Homelessness (also mentioned as part of Economic Security) Physical fitness Oral health Housing Diabetes Food insecurity Equity policy/Health Equity Built environment Other specific vulnerable populations mentioned: Undocumented workers need support with access to care Homeless youth, TAY, and foster youth are vulnerable to human trafficking, particularly sex trafficking Supportive housing is a concern for college -aged youth Health Needs Not Prioritized: Access to care Additional specialized and primary care health workers Asthma Cancer Climate and health Heart disease and stroke Infec tious disea se Maternal and child health Unintentional injuries Violence/injury prevention "}
