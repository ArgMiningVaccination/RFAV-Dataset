Here, you'll be assessed and receive a treatment schedule specifically designed for you, all in a gorgeously natural environment that encourages you to slow down and live in the moment. Devaaya Ayurveda and Nature Cure Centre If you think Goa exists only for partying and lounging on the beach, think again.

Ananda in the Himalayas This location for Ayurvedic bliss lies in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains in northern India. It boasts a program called \"Ayurvedic Rejuvenation,\" which is available for 7, 14 or 21 days and focuses on detoxing through diet, yoga and Ayurveda. It aims to give you a future plan for health and well-being, reduce stress and even delay the aging process. All that along with Ayurvedic gourmet cuisine and it's no mystery that it's been billed a \"destination spa.\" Of course, you can practice Ayurveda wherever you like, alone or with others. But there's something to be said for visiting and learning about it in the place where it originated. Book that flight and find your way to a more balanced life. "}
