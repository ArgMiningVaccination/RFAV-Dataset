It is a science that integrates the spiritual, mental, and physical aspects of our natural constitution to eliminate toxins, prevent their accumulation, and restore good health. Naturopathic diagnosis focuses on identifying the underlying causes of disease, while naturopathic therapies are supported by research drawn from journals from many disciplines, including naturopathic medicine, conventional medicine, European complimentary medicine, clinical nutrition, phytotherapy, pharmocognosy, homeopathy, psychology and spirituality. The six principles of Naturopathic Medicine are: - First Do No Harm - To avoid harming the patient, naturopathic doctors use methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects. NDs avoid, when possible, the harmful suppression of symptoms.Naturopathic Doctors acknowledge and respect the individual's healing process, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat illness. - Identify and Treat the Causes - The Naturopathic Doctor seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness rather than eliminate or merely suppress symptoms. - The Healing of Nature - Naturopathic Medicine recognizes the body's inherent ability to heal itself. NDs identify and remove obstacles to recovery to facilitate the healing process. - Doctor as Teacher - Naturopathic Doctors educate the patient and encourage self-responsibility for health. - Treat the Whole Person - NDs treat the individual by taking into account physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, and social factors. - Prevention - Naturopathic doctors emphasize disease prevention, assessment of risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease and making appropriate interventions to prevent illness.
