I have worked collaboratively with the gastroenterologists at Harborview Medical Center, and together we have developed a regionally well recognized inflammatory bowel disease program that treats and follows over Prepared: July 13, 2021 5 of 78 one thousand patients. As a result of this program development, we have improved patient outcomes by decreasing significantly the number of emergent admissions and surgical procedures. This has additionally led to a significant improvement in overall patient satisfaction. Additionally, I have worked collaboratively with both the neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons at the University of Washington to help train both surgical residents and spine fellows on the techniques of anterior exposures to the thoracic and lumbar spine. As a result, I was promoted to Adjunct Professor in both Neurosurgery and Orthopedics. As a result of these initiatives and overall patient care, I have been awarded both the UW Cares Award for the provider that embodies the service culture guidelines of the University of Washington Medical System, and the Harborview Employee of the Month that is exceedingly rare for a physician to receive. I have been integrally involved in the improvement overall of care provided at Harborview Medical Center. I have been highly involved in the development and implementation of a number of protocols and guidelines for injur ed patients within our trauma program, and have served for the last several years on our Surgical Executive Committee dedicated to improving OR efficiency and outcome. I have been integrally involved in the critical care provided at Harborview Medical Center as the medical director of our Trauma Surgical ICU, and previous Associate Medical Director for Critical Care Services. Additionally, I have served as the surgical chair of our institutional VTE committee that has established the guidelines and protocols associated with prevention and treatment of this disease for over 10 years. The implementation of these guidelines and protocols allowed us to be recognized in 2015 by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention as an awardee of the prestigious Health Care-Associated Venous Thromboembolism Prevention Challenge Champions.

During my time at the University of Washington I was extremely involved in a number of University processes, and institutional processes at Harborview Medical Center. Upon joining the faculty at the University of Washington/Harborview Medical Center I was named the medical director of our acute care Prepared: July 13, 2021 22 of 78 trauma floor. This allowed me to provide guidance to the management of injured patients, and to put several processes in place for discharge and post discharge care. As the years progressed, I was recognized for my strong leadership within critical care and I was named the medical director of our Trauma Surgical ICU and Associate Program Director for the Surgical Critical Care fellowship at the University of Washington. This allowed me to work closely with the Chief of Surgery to further expand and grow our fellowship form 2 fellows per year to currently 7 fellows per year. During this time, I developed a multidisciplinary ICU journal club that was a multidisciplinary conference including medical, anesthesia, and surgical ICU providers. This allowed us to collaborate to improve overall care within Harborview Medical Center. As a result, when our Associate Medical Director left our institution I was named the interim Associate Medical Director for Critical Care services. During this time I lead to update our brain death criteria, developed a response to extubation and assessment of difficult airways, helped to develop and implement our mobility protocol, improve care in geriatric ICU patients, and ICU sign-out processes. This continued until I was tasked with helping to improve our OR efficiency and finical stability. This led to the creation of a new position which I was appointed to as Associate Medical Director for Surgical Services. In this role, I have helped to improve anesthesia and surgical collaboration, OR turn-over and first case starts, and minimize waste. Although these processes where in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, modification and further improvements were required regarding communication, PPE, and testing all of which I helped to direct. In addition to these critical roles, I have been involved in a number of committees that have crossed over our entire medical system. Among these, was the UWMC Critical Care Council that oversaw critical care services across the entire medical system. As chair of this committee, I helped to develop and implement two critical care services at the University of Washington Medical Center at Mountlake which included both a Cardiothoracic ICU service, and Surgical Critical Care Service. These high intensity models have improved overall care and outcomes over the last decade. In addition, I have co-chaired not only our institutional VTE committee at Harborview Medical Center, but also our UWMC system wide VTE committee responsible for formalization of anticoagulation therapy and assessment of outcomes. Finally, I have been involved in the last year as part of our overall response to the COVID-19 pandemic to restore operative effici ency system wide, and surgical COVID-19 processes for testing and safety as part of an oversight UW committee. Throughout my time at UW I have been highly involved in multiple aspects of care, and have served to drive improvements overall in patient care, research, and education.

Specifically, this is important to providing optimal medical education, research, and clinical care. Without appropriate diversity and the ability to provide exceptional care without exception a disservice is delivered. In simple terms, all individuals are created equal and deserve equal education and treatment. However, we are governed by bias, both explicit and implicit, and a culture that does not consistently support diversity. Despite this, diversity and equity is essential. First and foremost, the concept of diversity and equity must be considered a central tenant in education and training, research, and health care. This requires awareness of inequities among underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups. Although I grew up in a diverse area of Michigan, I was aware of economic inequities but unaware of the extent of inequities based on race and sexual orientation. It was during my first faculty position when I was struck hearing that treatment should vary based on socioeconomic status. Obviously, my understanding of equality was na\u00efve and I was struck that professionals in the health care field actually thought and openly spoke this way. This led to me focus on furthering my education on inequities that exist, and to truly self-reflect on my own personal bias. But this injustice is not simply limited to socioeconomic status, it additionally includes race and sexual orientation. Prepared: July 13, 2021 25 of 78 As a healthcare leader and educator, I personally have strived to improving equity. As part of my training as a program director, I have been fortunate to have received further training in implicit bias and inequities. This education and sustained commitment has enforced my personal commitment to making our fellowship in Surgical Critical Care diverse. I have made sure that equity and diversity is part of the training program with selective didactics and education to all fellows. Furthermore, working in a county hospital providing care to all individuals regardless of age, gender, race, or sexual orientation has allowed our fellowship to further explore and focus on diversity. The simple motto of my current institution clearly demonstrates this importance, Exceptional Care without Exception. This is the same focus I have for each and every patient encounter. There is no selective VIP, rather all patients treated are VIPs. It has remained my focus to model this important concept, and as a full professor it is not only the expectation professionally but personally. This important to model for students, trainees, and staff taking care of these vulnerable patients. Although my research focus has been strongly associated with inflammatory changes following injury, I have focused efforts on further exploring the role of palliative care in our elderly population, and the financial effects on the uninsured in an effort to improve healthcare access to minorities and the underserved. TEACHING AND MENTORING TEACHING SUMMARY Medical education is the cornerstone to providing and improving care to future generations. Through education of housestaff and medical students, we provide the tools required for these bright individuals to continue to advance care and provide optimal care to every patient. Education, however, is not limited to housestaff and medical students. It is as important to help provide education to prehospital and hospital providers overall. This is especially true in taking care of patients following traumatic injury. The management and treatment of this critical patient population requires coordinated care beginning in the field and throughout their hospitalization and discharge. Without appropriate education to each member of this team, optimal care cannot be provided. I have been involved throughout my career in the education of housestaff and medical students. In fact, I weekly preform dedicated protected teaching rounds with the housestaff and medical students at Harborview Medical Center. The focus of these teaching rounds is through direct patient scenarios to provide insight into the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of critical ill surgical patients. I have also provide education to the prehospital providers of King County and nurses at Harborview Medical Center. Delivering medical education requires o ngoing refinement of teaching skills. Teaching adult learners requires a multi-domain approach that I have focused on. I have been fortunate to direct our ATLS instructor course that focuses on adult education along with a surgical educator. Every time I direct this course, I learn new tools to further my ability to teach. I think it is imperative that we take each opportunity to provide education. The deliver cannot be confrontational, and must be given in a format that allows the learner to further expand their current knowledge by using their current foundation. Teaching is not limited to lectures; it includes all aspects of the medical care we provide. Finally, I have had the opportunity to serve as Program Director for our Surgical Critical Care Fellowship at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Without any doubt, one of the proudest accomplishments I Prepared: July 13, 2021 26 of 78 have for my career is training an outstanding group of leaders in trauma and critical care surgery. As a result of these fundamental educational beliefs, I was recently awarded the John K. Stevenson Faculty Teaching Award in Surgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Recognition and refinement of teaching is what we provide as faculty, and it is truly one of the most rewarding parts of our career.

It is truly one of the most essential components of academic surgery. Providing guidance to help develop the next group of surgeons. However, academic mentoring has not been limited to helping to guide and develop the next group of surgeon scientists, but also to develop the next group of clinical surgeons that can provide outstanding care without exception. Over the last several years I have been fortunate to serve as Associate Program Director or Program Director of Surgical Critical at the Un iversity of Washington School of Medicine. This Prepared: July 13, 2021 30 of 78 has been an honor, and has allowed me to work closely with outstanding fellows. I am humbled to have played a critical but small role in each of their careers, and have been humbled by their career development. Many of them have become leaders regionally, nationally and internationally in the fields of trauma, critical care and burns. As a mentor, I take great pride in their outstanding achievements.

Assistant Professor of Surgery University of Washington RESEARCH AND CREA TIVE ACTIVITIES RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ACTIVITIES SUMMARY Medical research is essential for the improvemen t in patient care. It requires a multifaceted approach in which the pathophysiology, disease progression, and therapeutic options evaluated and optimized. In order to do this, basic science research is required to provide insight into the pathophysiology. This understanding not only provides insight into the disease to help develop therapeutics, but it also helps direct individual care through precision medicine. I have been involved in research my entire career and have focused on the inflammatory changes following injury leading to the development of organ failure. Through this research, I have helped demonstrate that the inflammatory changes following injury are sustained for long periods, and are associated with long-term complications. In addition, through a number of Prepared: July 13, 2021 41 of 78 collaborations I have helped develop a genomic signature that can identify injured patients at risk for complicated outcomes within 24 hours of injury. This genomic signature has been validated, and will hopefully help provide precision care in the future to this select patient population at the greatest risk for complications. Although my research has focused on trauma, research in all areas helps provide the foundation for critical thinking and improvement in patient care. My overall goal is to continue to further evaluate the acute inflammatory changes following injury, and help to determine potential areas of therapeutic intervention to the at risk patient population. This goal, however, is not limited to acute changes but the long term effects both clinical and immunologically due to injury. It is a result of this research that I hope we will be able to better predict and determine the course following multiple inflammatory disease processes, in addition to injury, to better inform patients and help with autonomous patient care decisions. It is imperative that overall we provide a collaborative atmosphere for research, and emphasize the importance and contributions that research provides. RESEARCH AWARDS - CURRENT 1. NCT02984384 Trauma Site PI 5 % effort O'Toole (PI) PICORI 7/1/2016 6/30/2022 PREVENTion of Clot in Orthopaedic Trauma (PREVENT CLOT) $ 11,198,854 total Prepared: July 13, 2021 42 of 78 There are 6 million fractures treated each year in the United States, and 2.3 million patients are admitted each year after trauma. Injuries t hat break certain bones, like the hip or thigh bone, are very common and associated with a particularly high risk of blood clots. If a patient does develop a blood clot, it can require the pati ent to take months of additional medications or can possibly even become fatal. However, medications to prevent blood clots can increase the risk of bleeding or other complications. Despite the frequency of these injuries and the potential devastating impact that blood clots can have on patients' lives, we currently do not know the best clot prevention medication for trauma patients. Current guidelines indicate that patients with certain fractures should be given medication to help prevent blood clots. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are medicines that have been used to prevent blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis) of trauma patients since the 1990s. Today, despite a lack of good evidence, LMWHs remain in widespread use for patients with fractures. Aspirin is another commonly used clot prevention medici ne that may have a similar or even superior ability to prevent blood clots in the legs and potentially fatal clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) that can occur after a traumatic injury. However, there have not been any studies to date that compare LMWHs with aspirin in preventing blood clots in fracture patients. This study should answer a question that is important to the millions of people who suffer a traumatic injury every year in the United States and are therefore at high risk for a blood clot. The study will compare the rates of death, blood clots in the lung, complications after surgery, patient satisfaction, out-of-pocket costs, and minor blood clots in patients to determine which medication is more effective in blood clot prevention after fractures. Patients and stakeholders have already taken an active role in developing this research proposal. Our research team comprises trauma survivors, blood clot survivors, caregivers, frontline clinicians, professional organizations, medical insurers, and experts in this field of research. In preparation for this study, we surveyed 232 trauma patients to determine the outcomes related to blood clots that they believed were most important. Our study is designed to respond to the concerns expressed by those patients. Trauma patients have historically been under-represented in research. The time-sensitive nature of traumatic injuries and the complicated medical condition of trauma patients at the time of hospital admission has long been a deterrent to scientific investigation. Our patients and caregiver team members have been crucial to designing this study so that it answers an important research question for patients and physicians while being respectful to the challenging circumstances faced by patients and their caregivers.

An impaired innate immune response can aggravate the septic condition by compromising the patient s ability to combat an infection. However, the cells and mediators that enhance the innate immune response in sepsis are still unknown. Basophils account for less than 1% of peripheral blood leukocytes, which makes them the rarest known granulocytes. Basophils are evolutionarily conserved in many animal species, suggesting a beneficial rather than deleterious role of basophils. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether basophils play any role in the host s defense against bacteria that can potentially prevent sepsis development. Our preliminary studies support such a role by showing that basophils are one of the very first cells to accumulate at the infection site at early stages of infection, and can improve survival and bacteria clearance in the polymicrobial model of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We think that our findings in the murine system may be translatable to humans because we observed that trauma patients show increased numbers of basophils in circulation when a nosocomial infection was circumscribed to local tissues (early stages of infection) while basophil numbers decreased or remain unchanged when a patient developed a systemic infection (bacteremia) and was therefore at high risk of developing sepsis. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that basophils play a protective role in sepsis by enhancing the innate immune response against infection. Accordingly, we propose a research plan aimed at investigating the contribution of basophils to the innate immune response against bacteria. In Aim 1, we will identify mechanisms involved in basophil activation during an infection. We will use a genetic approach to investigate whether basophil stimulation through the TLR and MyD88 pathways is required to induce basophil activation and to confer protection during an infection; and we will examine whether the epithelial cell-derived cytokine, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), can enhance the ability of basophils to respond to an infection. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms by which basophils confer protection against bacterial infections. Specifically, we will investigate interactions between basophils, the endothelium, and circulating leukocytes in a microvessel system and we will use mice with basophil-specific TNF deficiency to study these interactions during CLP. In Aim 3, we will establish the relevance of basophils in human infections and sepsis. Specifically, we will use mass cytometry (CyTOF) to assess basophil immune functions in samples collected from patients that develop nosocomial infections, mainly pneumonia, and we will establish whether these immune functions associate with clinical outcomes. We think that the studies proposed will expand our knowledge of sepsis physiopathology. Specifically, our studies will provide, for the first time, evidence for a critical role for basophils in the enhancement of the innate immune response against bacteria, an unexpected role for this rare cell population.

Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 random ization scheme to receive hMSCs or cell reconstitution of 5% albumin and 10% Dextran 40) as the placebo; the study will enroll 120 patients who achieve a stable clinical baseline and receive study product (either hMSCs or the placebo). The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review adverse outcomes and protocol compliance. A pre-specified interim review will occur after 60 subjects have been enrolled and received study product; enrollment will continue during the DSMB review. All pre-specified clinically important events and unexpected serious adverse events including death during hospitalization up to 60 days will be reported to the DSMB on an ongoing basis; the study will be stopped for a safety evaluation by the DSMB if they have any concer ns or if three subjects have pre-specified clinically important events or unexpected serious adverse events except death since death will be common in this critically ill population due the nature of the underlying illness (e.g., ARDS).

Muscle wasting occurs rapidly after major trauma and is often associated with multi-organ failure lasting from a few weeks to a long term disability. It is believed that FDY-5301 may help prevent or treat muscle weakness and organ dysfunction in major trauma patients. Approximately 252 subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive up to 7 daily bolus IV doses of FDY-5301 at 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg, or volume-matched placebo. To ensure equal representation in each group, the randomization will be stratified by the presence or absence of any pelvi c or lower limb fractures. All subjects who satisfy the eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups (FDY-5301 low dose, FDY-5301 high dose, or placebo). All subjects will be followed in-hospital until Day 28 or discharge, whichever occurs first, at Day 28 if discharged earlier, and then by telephone visits at Month 3 and Month 6.

K08GM068816 Primary Investigato r 75 % effort Cuschieri (PI) National Institutes of Health/NIGMS 9/1/2003 8/31/2008 Cellular Signaling Mechanisms Involved in Macrophage Priming and Activation. $ 129,330 direct/yr 1 $ 646,650 total Sepsis, following trauma/hemorrhage and ischemia/reperfusion, is a common etiology for subsequent Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and remains a leading cause of subsequent morbidity and mortality. A number of different inflammatory cells are responsible for this condition; however, it appears that the macrophage is the common central orchestrating cell underlying these conditions. It is becoming evident that this inflammatory driven signaling cascade is affected by a number of different \"priming\" agents, such as platelet activating factor (PAF) and oxidant stress. \"Priming\" does not lead to pro-inflammatory mediator production; rather it causes enhanced responsiveness by the macrophage to secondary inflammatory stimuli, such as endotoxin. The mechanism in which these \"priming\" agents cause this enhanced response is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this grant is to better delineate the intracellular signaling mechanisms which are responsible for this affect. This proposal will focus on the potential role that the secondary messenger, calcium, plays during initial \"priming\". Although calcium flux occurs during \"priming\", it is unknown if and how calcium could modulate endotoxin-mediated signaling. We, therefore, hypothesis that the increase in intracellular calcium results in the activation of regulatory kinases, such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK), leads to enhanced endotoxin-mediated signaling. Furthermore, we hypothesis that CaMK activation leads to modulation of actin polymerization and stress fiber polymerization induced by endotoxin resulting in enhanced intracellular spatial relationships and optimal endotoxin signaling. The role of calcium and CaMK during \"priming\" will be investigated through the use of specific inhibitors and activators on the ability of PAF and oxidant stress to induce \"priming\" of endotoxin-mediated activation within the macrophage. The overall aim of this proposal is to provide further insight into potential mechanisms that serve in the activation and \"priming\" of the macrophage. Through an enhanced understanding of these mechanisms it is our goal that potential therapeutic targets may be discovered to regulate the inflammatory response following trauma/hemorrhage and ischemia/reperfusion.

A greater understanding of the innate inflammatory response to serious injury will lead to the development of novel genomic and proteomic markers that can predict outcome, and will identify potential new avenues for further basic and clinical research, as well as targets for immunomodulatory interventions. The Program is organized to employ multip le high-throughput analytical tools including microarray and comparative, quantitative proteomics coupled with novel macroscale and microfluidics cell separation methodologies and bioinformatics approaches (including knowledge-based pathway analysis). The specific aims in Years 6-10 are as follows. (1) Determine genome-wide expression and the cellular proteome from well-defined cellular subpopulations of circulating leukocytes from hospitalized patients following severe trauma and burn injuries. (2) In these cell populations, identify patterns of gene expression and proteomic responses to the innate inflammatory response associated with different clinical trajectories and outcomes. (3) Using a systems biology approach, discover new biological knowledge based upon total cellular proteomi cs and genomics obtained from the cellular subpopulations. New knowledge will be obtained by fostering and supporting groups of investigators in vastly disparate disciplines, including clinicians, biochemists, immunologists, statisticians, and computational and systems biologists. These interactions will lead to the development of new paradigms for our biological understanding of the injury response. The project tasks and activities include the following: (1) enrollment of 580 severely traumatized or burned patients with stringent entry criteria and standardized guidelines for patient care; (2) high-throughput quantitative, comparative proteomic and functional proteomic analyses of enriched blood leukocyte populations; (3) genome-wide expression analysis of these same leukocyte populations using state-of-the-art high throughput formats; (4) implementation of a web-enabled trauma-related database containing clinical, physiologic, proteomic, and genomic expression data; (5) computational analysis of the complex data by data interpretation groups, comprised of biostatisticians, critical care physicians and basic scientists with the ultimate goal being an integrated systems view of the injury response.

R01GM078054 Primary investigato r 10 % effort Cuschieri (PI) National Institutes of Health/NIGMS 7/01/2008 6/30/2012 Trauma and Sepsis Induced Changes in Immune-cell Membrane Receptor Trafficking $ 270,480 direct/yr 1 $ 1,081,920 total Prepared: July 13, 2021 47 of 78 Mononuclear cells are critical to the eradication of invading organisms. The mechanism in which these innate immune cells respond to these invaders is through the activation of a series of pattern recognition receptors or Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors, on specialized plasma membrane microdomains is complex and poorly elucidated. Based on previous work by us, we hypothesize that formation of these complexes requires breakdown of plasma membrane sphingolipids into ceramide leading to the formation of lipid raft macrodomains and the formation of TLR complexes. As a result, specific infectious factors are presented to these pattern recognition receptors leading to cellular activation. Although these responses may be life saving, severe trauma is know to result in reprogramming and alterations in innate immunity. These altered phenotypes, rather than leading to host protection, are responsible for increased susceptibility to invading organisms leading to the development of sepsis and organ failure. This state has been recreated in vitro by subjecting mononuclear cells to factors induced by trauma, including platelet activating factor, oxidant stress and complement 5a. Although the mechanism(s) responsible for this reprogramming remain unknown, previous work has demonstrated that this process is associated with alterations in the lipid and protein content within the plasma membrane. These alterations are hypothesized to occur on lipid rafts. Following injury, we hypothesize that factors induced by trauma result in the production of ceramide, but to a lesser degree than that seen during activation. Ceramide once produced fuses within rafts leading to the formation of macrodomains similar to that which occurs with activation. Additionally, ceramide leads to the mobilization of calcium leading to the activation of CaMK II. Activation of these cellular messengers is associated with the formation of focal adhesion-like complexes that contain some but not all of the TLR components. We hypothesize that assembly of these complexes and changes in lipid raft ceramide content are responsible for subsequent reprogramming that induces enhanced activation in response to subsequent infection. Thus, this proposal sets out to determine more fully the molecular mechanisms responsible for reprogramming and activation following trauma by exploring the effects of ceramide, calcium and CaMK II in vitro, and in severely injured trauma patients.

The subproject and investigator (PI) may have received primary funding from another NIH source, and thus could be represented in other CRISP entries. The institution listed is for the Center, which is not necessarily the institution for the investigator. Following severe trauma mononuclear cells are reprogrammed leading to alterations in innate immunity. These phenotypes are responsible for increased susceptibility to invading organisms leading to the development of organ failure. This state has been recreated in vitro by subjecting mononuclear cells to factors induced by trauma, including platelet activating factor (PAF), oxidant stress and complement 5a (C5a). Although the mechanism(s) responsible for this reprogramming remain unknown, previous work has demonstrated that this process may be associated with alterations in the protein content within specific plasma membrane microdomains that are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids termed lipid rafts. Following injury, we hypothesize that factors induced by trauma result in the production of the lipid mediator ceramide from lipid rafts. Ceramide once produced fuses within rafts leading to the formation of macrodomains resulting in changes in membrane fluidity. Due to these changes, various proteins are recruited to the lipid raft resulting in the formation of focal adhesion-like complexes that contain some but not all of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) components. The following experimental approach will be followed: Differentiated THP-1 cells will be subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation for various periods of time up to 60 min. Selected cells will be pre-treated with PAF, hydrogen peroxide or C5a for periods of time up to 30-60 min. Lipid raft protein extraction will be performed using sucrose gradient centrifugation. Harvested proteins will then be used for analysis using the LC-ESI-MS system. It is our hypothesis that assembly of these complexes and changes in lipid raft content are responsible for subsequent reprogramming that induces enhanced activation in response to subsequent infection. Based on these in vitro observations, it is our hope to then explore potential changes that occur in severely injured trauma patients in order to determine potential prognostic and therapeutic targets.

The leading cause of late mortality following injury is multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, which results from dysfunctional inflammatory response of the patient early after injury. Previous studies, suggest that hypertonic saline may be beneficial in modulating this initial response and thus decrease the subsequent organ injury. These effects, which have been well described in the laboratory, have yet to be proven in humans, particularly in the setting of severe injury. This proposal takes advantage of a unique opportunity to obtain blood samples from patients enrolled in a NIH supported multi-center trial of hypertonic resuscitation and analyze their inflammatory responses early after injury. The proposed trial is to be conducted by the Resuscitation Outcom es Consortium (ROC), which consists often clinical centers in the US and Canada. This study is a three arm, blinded, randomized trial comparing 7.5% saline, 7.5% (0.9%) initial resuscitation fluid administered to patients in hypovelemic shock or with signs of sever traumatic brain injury. Three of the ROC clinical sites will collaborate to study then inflammation response of patients enrolled at theses sites. The specific aims include: Aim 1: To profile and characterize the phenotype of the innate and cellular immune systems in response to hypertonic resuscitation following injury. Aim 2: To define, in humans, the cellular mechanisms responsible for hypertonic modulation of the inflammatory response. Aim 3: To determine whether immunologic changes observed following hypertonic resuscitation associated with differences in clinical outcome as manifested by the development of organ dysfunction, and nosocomial infection.

The ultimate objective of our research is to optimize (and reduce) the duration of antibiotic therapy for intraabdominal infection throughout the world. The hypothesis to be tested is that four days of therapy for intraabdominal infection will lead to similar outcomes and a shorter duration of therapy when compared to a course based on the resolution of physiologic parameters in the setting of adequate operative or percutaneous intervention. This proposal is for a multicenter, randomized, double-blind (until the fourth day of therapy), non-inferiority clinical trial comparing a predetermined four days of antibiotic therapy to antibiotic therapy terminated one day after normalization of white blood cell count (= 11,000/ul) and normalization of systemic temperature (< 38.0\u00bf C) for one whole calendar day (and a maximum of 10 days of antibiotic therapy) in the setting of complicated intraabdominal infection treated with adequate source control. Inclusion criteria include age = 16 years, ability to obtain informed consent from the patient or surrogate, presence of an intraabdominal infection requiring any duration of hospitalization and managed with open, laparoscopic, or percutaneous intervention, and, adequate source control in the opinion of the local investigator and Principal Investigator. 1,120 patients will be enrolled to ensure adequate power to assess equivalence of the two arms. The primary endpoint will be percentage failure conditioned by assigned duration of antibiotic therapy (intent to treat analysis). Failure will be defined as need for reintervention (surgical or percutaneous), surgical site infection, or death within 30 days of the original intervention for intraabdominal infection. In addition, multiple secondary endpoints will be assessed, including duration of antibiotic therapy and the incidence of infection at non-abdominal and non-surgical wound sites, particularly with antibiotic-resistant pat hogens. The ultimate objective of our research is to change practice throughout the world, specifically by shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy for intraabdominal infections and thus decreasing resource utilization and decreasing the selection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Over the past 4 years we have successfully recruited to fill our positions and have addressed a key concern that was raised in our previous competitive renewal regarding diversity in our program. We have paid particular attention to identifying and recruiting strong under-represented minority candidates. Our previous competitive renewal also focused upon the \"key initiatives\", defined by the leaders at the National Institutes of Health and termed the \"NIH Roadmap\". This had direct bearing on the structure and direction of this training program. Briefly, the key initiatives or themes are: (1) New Pathways to Discovery, (2) Research Teams of the Future and (3) Reengineering the Clinical Research Enterprise. We propose to continue to educate trainees in established molecular biology techniques and will expand their training to include cutting edge research and analysis (i.e. biomedical computing) techniques. Through collaborations with basic scientists and integration with the available research education programs at the University of Washington, we will expose trainees to broad-based research teams and programs. Trainee education and experience will continue to include concepts of translational research, whereby basic observations will be evaluated as potential diagnostic and therapeutic benefit for critically ill patients. In summary, we aim to prepare a diverse group of interested scientists for academic careers as independent investigators and educators. Through a multidisciplinary and collaborative effort, trainees learn how to identify important research questions, how to design, conduct and analyze experiments that will address these questions and how to translate their findings into clinically relevant intervent ions. RELEVANCE: Trauma remains an important public health problem. Injuries are responsible for a high proportion of deaths in people of all ages and medical care for injury victims is costly. Our training program has successfully educated surgeons, physicians and post-doctoral students in aspects of the applied biology of injury and inflammation. Graduates from our program have demonstrated a commitment to understanding the biology of injury and to the care of critically ill injury victims.

Despite intensive investigation, there are few pharmacologic interventions, and care is largely supportive. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a human herpesvirus that infects 50- 80% of healthy adults and establishes lifelong latency in the lung, generally causing overt disease only in severely immunosuppressed patients. CMV reactivation (vir al replication) from latency occurs in ~40% of CMV seropositive, otherwise immunocompetent persons during critical illness and is associated with worse clinical outcomes including increased mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and increased ICU length of stay. Compelling evidence implicating CMV reactivation as a causal contributor to morbidity and mortality in sepsis- associated respiratory failure comes from animal models and our recently completed NHLBI-funded phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of ganciclovir this CMV seropositive adults with sepsis-associated respiratory failure, ganciclovir effectively suppressed CMV replication, had an acceptable safety profile, and was associated with improved clinical outcomes, including increased ventilator-free days (VFD), shorter duration of mechanical ventilation among survivors, shorter ICU length of stay, and improved PaO2/FiO2 ratio in day-7 survivors. We hypothesize that IV ganciclovir administered early in critical illness will effectively suppress CMV reactivation in CMV seropositive adults with sepsis-associated acute respiratory failure, thereby reducing lung damage, accelerating recovery, and leading to improved clinical outcomes. We propose to conduct a phase 3 RCT to determine whether the antiviral drug ganciclovir given as prophylaxis improves VFDs and other clinically relevant outcomes when administered within 5 days of ICU admission to CMV seropositive immunocompetent adults with sepsis-associated acute respiratory failure. We will measure the effect of the study intervention on the primary trial outcome (VFDs) and secondary outcomes (mortality at 28 days, duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors, oxygenation, static respiratory system compliance, CMV plasma and lung reactivation, and a core set of longer-term outcomes at 6 months). In exploratory analyses, we will assess baseline factors as predictors for CMV reactivation, and characterize the relationship of CMV viral load kinetics with VFDs and other clinical outcomes. Our interdisciplinary team has unique experience in successfully coordinating multi-site multi-PI ICU-based RCTs. We have established a network of 19 clinical sites in the US, all of which have robust infrastructure for ICU clinical trials and proven ability to recruit patients into RCTs. If it is effective, this inexpensive and feasible intervention has the potential to significantly improve care of patients with sepsis-associated respiratory failure, substantially change clinical practice, and offer new insights into the sepsis-CMV reactivation relationship.

The major goal of this project is to elucidate the changes and verify gene changes following severe injury. $ 449,340 direct/yr 1 $ 1,820,579 total Prepared: July 13, 2021 53 of 78 Injuries continue to be the fifth leading cause of death overall and the leading cause of death for persons less than 45 years of age in the U.S. Multiorgan failure (MOF) and death remain unacceptably common in severely injured patients. In our recent Glue Grant study, 19% of severe trauma patients died, 41% developed MOF and the average time to recovery was 16 days. Despite an improved understanding of the basic pathophysiology of severe trauma and its sequelae, there are essentially no biol ogical response modifiers that have proven successful in prospective, randomized clinical tr ials. We propose that a significant proportion of patients who would generally meet the inclusion criteria for a study of severely injured patients, are not in need of immunomodulatory therapy and are not only unlikely to benefit but also suffer direct toxicity from such therapies. In contrast, there exists subset of patients who are going to have a protracted clinical course, and would benefit from interventional therapies with biological-response modifiers. The most important challenge today is to identify prospectively the subset of patients who are going to have a protracted clinical course, and would benefit from interventional t herapies with biological-response modifiers. We believe that we have developed such a prospective genomic test. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to prospectively validate a rapid genomic test obtained from blood leukocyte subpopulations of severely traumatized patients in the first 24 hrs after admission that can be used to discriminate those patients who will have a complicated clinical trajectory and would, therefore, be good candidates for interventional, immunomodulatory therapies. Based on our preliminary data, we have developed several genomic models based on total leukocyte and enriched blood neutrophils that retrospectively can identify patients who will have a poor clinical outcome and would benefit from interventional immunological therapies. Here, we propose to validate this approach in 200 severely traumatized patients enrolled at two geographically-distinct institutions. These genomic tests will be compared for their precision to standard anatomical and physiological scoring systems, and models based on plasma cytokine concentrations. If successful, these studies would dramatically alter how clinical trials in severely traumatized patients would be conducted in the future. A successful, rapid, prognostic genomic test would reduce the size, cost and time required to evaluate new drugs in this population by identifying individuals at risk of a complicated outcome. Personalized medicine\" would be one step closer to reality Served as a co-investigator and site PI. I was responsible for study design, patient recruitment, data gathering, and analysis. 11.

In an effort to improve communication in the most critically ill patients, a hand-off tool was developed to provide essential components of individual patient condition and assessment of risk of worsening. Based on this tool, an assigned and constructed hand-off nightly will occur within the ICUs of the University of Washington Medical Center and Harborview Medi cal Center. Error rates will be looked at before and after implementation. Additionally, provider satisfaction will be determined. Primary Investigato r Prepared: July 13, 2021 54 of 78 12.

Drotrecogin alfa (activated), a recombinant form of human activated protein C, is the first therapeutic intervention shown to reduce all-cause mortality in severe sepsis. In the Phase 3 study (F1K-MC-EVAD; PROWESS), 1690 patients were randomly assigned to receive a 96-hour intravenous infusion of drotrecogin alfa (activated) 24 micrograms/kg/h or placebo (850 patients and 840 patients, respectively). Overall, administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) yielded a clinically significant reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality: 24.7% of drotrecogin alfa (activated) patients died 30.8% of placebo patients (19.4% relative risk reduction; p=0.005; Bernard et al. 2001). The only safety concern noted in the Phase 3 trial was an increased risk of serious bleeding among drotrecogin alfa (activated) patients (3.5% versus 2.0% of placebo patients). The difference between the two treatment groups in the number of patients who experienced a serious bleeding event was due to the greater number of drotrecogin alfa (activated) patients who experienced a serious bleeding event that was related to a procedure (for example, bleeding that resulted from the placement of a catheter or nephrostomy tube). The number of patients who experienced spontaneous serious bleeding events was similar between the two treatment groups. The Regulatory authorities have approved the use of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in severe sepsis patients with a high level of disease severity and risk of death. Thus, the regulatory authorities have requested a study evaluating drotrecogin alfa (activated) in a specific subpopulation of patients with severe sepsis and at lower risk of death Site PI 13.

A genomic storm in critically injured humans. J Exp Med. 2011:208(13):2581-90 In this paper the first four authors had equal contribution to the design, writing, and analysis of the data. This paper is an important paper that evaluated the genomic response following injury. It provided critical and novel insight into the immune response following injury. The study took part over nearly a 10 year period of time while severely blunt injured patients were prospectively enrolled with standardization of trauma care provided. During this period of time I was a site PI, and was at the primary enrolling center for the study. In addition, I served on the protocol and writing committees for the study. At completion of the enrollment, analysis was performed of all co llected samples and genome wide analysis was performed on circulating immune cells. The analysi s of this data demonstrated that immune dysfunction that was thought to be initially pro-inflammatory followed by an anti-inflammatory response was not the case. The data demonstrated concurrent pro and anti-inflammatory processes occurring immediately after severe injury, and these findings challenged historical dogma. Working together with all authors, we were able to clearly express these findings that have provided novel insight into the pathogenesis of organ failure and chronic critical illness following injury. 2.

Benchmarking Outcomes in the Critically Injured Trauma Patient and the Effect of Implementing Standard Operating Procedures. Ann Surg. 2012:255(5):993-9 In this paper I was the primary author evaluating the effect of a set of standard operating procedures in trauma care among 7 different geographically disperse institutions. In this paper I contributed to concept, data collection, analysis, and writing of the manuscript. This paper demonstrates that by careful assessment standard operating procedures can be incorporated into clinical practice and can lead to overall improvement in care. Additionally, this paper demonstrated that although mortality was improved compared to a number of comparisons, the number of patients still su ffering from organ failure remained high. It further demonstrated for the first time the concept in sustained organ failure, as demonstrated by a prolonged period of organ dysfunction or time to recovery from organ failure. This has led to the concept of chronic critical illness following injury. Prepared: July 13, 2021 72 of 78 3.

Comparing clinical predictors of deep venous thrombosis versus pulmonary embolus after severe injury: a new paradigm for posttraumatic venous thromboembolism? J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2013:74(5):1231-7 In this paper I was the senior author of looking at the pathophysiology of a common complication following severe injury, venous thromboembolism. In this paper I was responsible for the concept, analysis, and writing. This paper demonstrates that this common complication that was thought to occur late, actually occurred frequently early following injury. In fact, based on this observation the pathophysiology for early pulmonary embolism appears to be more closely associate with primary chest injury and as a result primary pulmonary thrombosis. 4.

Crit Care Med. 2017 Dec;45(12):1989-1996 In this paper I was the second author looking at the epidemiology of chronic critical illness following severe trauma. In this paper I was responsible for concept, data collection, analysis, and critical review. I served to hel p mentor Dr. Mira, and worked closely with the senior author on the final publication. This paper provides further novel insight into the concept of chronic critical illness following severe injury, and that patients suffering from this condition have poor functional outcome following discharge and that this process is associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality up to a year following injury. 5.

J Trauma Acute Care Surg 2020 Aug 6 In this paper I was the senior author looking critically at areas of improvement to minimize errors. I served to mentor the first author, and was involved in the concept, data organization, analysis, and critical review of the publication. This paper demonstrates an evolution of errors over a 20 year period of time as process improvement is implemented. That as an initially area of concern is addressed, new concerns develop that occur downstream. This important work demonstrates the importance of constant and careful process improvement to continue to optimize patient outcome. CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS 1.

AAST.org 2020 ACADEMIC LEADERSHIP Of the major leadership roles I have had over the last several years, three have played critical roles in improving education and clinical care. The first leadership role was serving as Associat e Program Director or Program Director of the Surgical Critical Care Fellowship at the University of Washington School of Medicine. During time in this role, I was responsible for the reorganization of the fellowship and further expansion of the fellowship from 2 fellows per year to 7. Additionally, within the fellowship the creation of three separate tracks focused on trauma, burn and cardiothoracic care. Each track provided an overview of surgical critical care with an emphasis on these specific areas. During the time in this leadership position I have been responsible for the education and training of 60 fellows. Many of whom have continued in academics and have become regional, national and international leaders. Additionally, I have served a critical role in the development of critical care services across UW Medicine as medical director of the Trauma Surg ical ICU at Harborview Medical Center, Acting Associate Medical Director of Critical Care overseeing 89 ICU beds at Harborview Medical Center, and chairing the UW Medicine Critical Care Committee that was responsible for the development of two high intensity ICU services at the University of Washington. During this time, I helped to lead our responses to the H1N1 and EBOLA pandemic, and still focus on our mission population of the underserved in King County, Washington. Finally, as Associate Medical Director of Surgical Services for the last year I have helped to improve overall efficiency, develop collaborations with nursing, anesthesia and surgery to Prepared: July 13, 2021 78 of 78 optimize patient care and outcome. Furthermore, this role was instrumental in our responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in developing our OR response as cases increased, and a mechanism to convert OR and PACU space to ICU space as needed. Furthermore, in this role I was critical to the development of our overall testing response to acute emergencies and surgical procedures to optimize patient care and staff safety. "}
