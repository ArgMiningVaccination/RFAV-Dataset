Here is a list of some complementary therapies that may be worth looking into. Please note: complementary therapy options may have varying research and evidence to support them. U.S. Pain Foundation does not endorse any one type of treatment. These definitions are for educational purposes only. To heal does not necessarily mean to cure. It can simply mean helping people to achieve a way of life compatible with their aspirations\u2014to restore their freedom to make choices\u2014even in the presence of continuing disease. -Rene Dubos Explore 85+ types of treatment across seven categories CREATE A PAIN PLAN BROWSE THROUGH OUR LIST OF COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES Active Release Technique ART is a patented, state of the art soft tissue system/movement based massage technique The ART provider uses his or her hands to evaluate the texture, tightness and movement of muscles, fascia, tendons, ligaments and nerves.

For More Info: [American Academy of Medical Acupuncture (AAMA)](http://www.medicalacupuncture.org) Acupressure/ Deep Tissue Release Acupressure is very similar to acupuncture, but instead of needles, practitioners apply pressure using their hands to trigger points in the body. Because it is very gentle and noninvasive, itmay be a good choice for someone who is uncomfortable with needles. Acupressure focuses on releasing tension, increasing circulation, and promoting relaxation. Aromatherapy Aromatherapy uses plant materials and aromatic plant oils to promote well-being; different smells are believed to provide different effects. Aromatherapy can be applied topically (as a lotion or oil) or inhaled (via an oil diffuser or scented candle). It is often used in conjunction with massage.

For More Information Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy uses low-level electromagnetic waves that accelerate the body's ability to repair injured cells. PEMF therapy speeds your body's ability to recover, increasing blood flow and reducing inflammation. PEMF technology has no known side effects and cannot be overused. The technology has been a trusted solution for pain management, tissue regeneration, bone growth, and many other conditions for decades. Active \"transporter\" channels in cells open or close according to small electrical potentials that develop across the cell membrane in accordance with movement. In each of our joints, compression and decompression of the cells (called the proteoglycan matrix) create what are called \"voltage differentials\" that open or close gates in the channels, thus controlling the flow of nutrients and waste products in and out of the cell. A healthy cell produces positive and negative charges required for the exchange, which takes place through these special gates or channels, of potassium, sodium and calcium ions. Healthy cells maintain this potential through active ion movement. Cellular metabolism is negatively affected when electrical potentials are lost through injury or degenerative issues. In order to stimulate and speed cellular regeneration, PEMF mimics the body's own electrical energy, restoring the electrical potentials needed for optimal ion exchange. For More Information Reflexology This powerful healing technique has the ability to relax our state of mind, allowing the body to heal itself naturally by balancing glands, calming muscles, detoxifying the body, and producing endorphins to ease pain. Reflexology can be performed on either hands or feet. More Information Reiki Reiki is based on the idea that an unseen \"life force energy\" flows through each of us.

Studies show the same amount of brain stimulation whether one is actually participating in an activity or imagining that same action. The use of energy and visualization can heal all problems.
