IV nutrient therapy can be beneficial for a wide range of concerns. Whether the goal is detoxification, relaxation and reduced anxiety, increased mood, feeling rejuvenated, or immune system enhancement, these therapies can improve you sense of well-being. The various types of IV therapies offered at Amen Clinics are targeted to each patient's unique set of needs. Intravenous treatments are exceptionally powerful because the nutrients are infused directly into the bloodstream. This is one of the fastest and most efficient ways to get essential nutrients into your body. And since they won't be broken down by the digestive process that occurs when you swallow supplements, your body can quickly get what it needs. Because they are administered through an IV, the process also averts some of the common issues related to taking large doses of supplements orally, such as problems with absorption, getting an upset stomach, and lower nutrient potency from the digestive process. Furthermore, when nutrients are infused right into the bloodstream and bypass the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, big doses can be administered without GI side effects that could otherwise limit dosing. Together with our expert team at BrainMD, Amen Clinics has more than a decade of experience developing the highest quality nutraceutical formulas that are based on the most recent and innovative neuroscience. Our expertise in this field is applied directly to the nutrients we use for IV therapy. Our formulas are designed to help increase energy, enhance mood and memory, boost immune function, decrease anxiousness and the effects of stress, and much more. Choosing to do IV nutrient therapy at Amen Clinics provides a sense of comfort in knowing that your treatment will take place in a medical facility and will be overseen by our Functional Medicine (also called Integrative Medicine) team. Keeping your best interest in mind, we do a brief screening interview to make sure that IV nutrient therapy is right for you. We offer several different types of IV nutrient therapies to support the optimal health of our patients. The options include: The Calm IV is well-known as a \"Myers Cocktail\" and is a highly effective formula that helps enhance cellular function, improve immunity, increase relaxation, lower anxiety, and boost energy and mood . Because it consists of high doses of B vitamins and magnesium, along with other important nutrients, the Calm IV can quickly lower blood pressure and help you feel relaxed and less anxious, while also elevating mental clarity and vitality. Depending on what is best for your health goals, the Antiox IV will consist of either glutathione or alpha lipoic acid (ALA)\u2014or both nutrients. Glutathione is a naturally occurring antioxidant that dramatically improves the detoxification and rebuilding processes in the body. It can give your immune system a boost and help protect you from oxidative stress caused by harmful types of free radicals in your body. In fact, glutathione is one of the body's most effective antioxidant and detoxifying substances, especially for the brain and liver. ALA is another powerful antioxidant that research has shown can reverse nerve damage. This nutrient can also be beneficial for treating liver problems, including hepatitis. The combination of glutathione and alpha lipoic acid (infused separately) is an extremely powerful antioxidant and detoxification regimen. Whether your immune system needs a boost, or you are struggling with an immune disorder, we offer the Immune IV infusion, which has very high doses of buffered vitamin C. This IV treatment can be very beneficial for people who have been stressed out for a while, are struggling with a lot of fatigue, or want some extra protection against infections. While a high dose of intravenous vitamin C is no longer antioxidant, it turns into a pro-oxidant that works against bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful pathogens. If you are worn down by illness or stress, or simply want to stay healthy and energized, the Boost IV may be perfect for you because it contains a high-dose vitamin C and multivitamin/mineral combination. Following the Boost IV with the Antiox IV provides even more antioxidant protection\u2014and is excellent for the cold and flu season. Chelation refers to the process of clearing heavy metals from the bloodstream. Our Cleanse Combo uses specific chelating agents, such as ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) to remove heavy metals from your body, including aluminum, cadmium, lead, and others. The importance of this is that heavy metals are serious neurotoxins and endocrine disruptors. The Cleanse Combo can also be helpful when using a \"provocation\" test to check for unwanted heavy metals in the body. Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) is a co-enzyme derived from vitamin B3, signal molecule, and a novel neurotransmitter that is present in every cell in the body. Intravenous NAD+ has been used by clinicians to help people detoxify from chemical dependencies and addictions. It can support chemistry in the brain that lowers symptoms of anxiety and depression; improves sleep, energy, and focus; and reduces inflammation in the body. It is also used as a potential anti-aging therapy because it is thought to improve the health of cells. PXT infusion can be helpful for a number of conditions. Toxic chemicals, such as heavy metals and pesticides can get stored in the body for a long time and become detrimental to your health. PXT is an effective way to detoxify cell membranes by replacing the bad fats and oils in them with good essential fatty acids, thereby creating younger, healthier membranes. This type of lipid exchange can reverse age-related changes in the lipid membrane composition, which in turn rejuvenates all your cells. \"With A Better Brain Comes A Better Life\" - Daniel G.
