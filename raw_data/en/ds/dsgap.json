Most people think that the food they eat is the culprit of food allergies. If someone has an allergy to some food and if they assume that its treatment is to \"Just avoid that Food\", it is not the correct way of management. The \"Culprit is not Food; the Culprit is Human Being itself\". The way humans do genetic mutation to crops, the way humans are using pesticides or herbicides, the way humans are using preservatives, the way humans are eating unnatural or synthetic foods, the way of cooking they had adopted like microwaves, etc. are the major causes for food-related discomforts. The most common among them is to have food combinations that are incompatible like dairy products with meat, milk with seafoods, etc. Causes of Food Allergy An allergy is caused when body's immune system is inappropriately activated. The immune system is formulated to attack bacteria, viruses, parasites etc. Sometimes, body's immune system reacts to certain food items. This is called \"food allergy\" or \"food intolerance.\"When the immune system is activated, antibodies or immunoglobulin are produced against antigen or allergen. Antigen-Antibodies reaction, in turn, triggers an inflammatory response. Inflammation causes pain and tissue damage, leading to increased mucous production. Further, symptoms like rash, itching, or severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis may occur. When food is eaten is broken down and absorbed by the gastrointestinal system, it is distributed through the bloodstream to all body tissues. Therefore an allergic reaction can occur just anywhere in the vascular body. Ayurveda suggests that the reasons for food allergy include intake of incompatible food items, unfamiliar food, improperly cooked food, untimely food etc. Ayurveda outlines a number of foods that on combination may become unhealthy and ill effecting. Combinations of some rasa are incompatible like madhura (sweet) with amla (sour), madhura with tikta (bitter), etc. Causes of food allergy are divided into three parts as per dosha dominance: - Vata-Related Reasons in Food Allergy - Vata gets aggravated in Vata dominant body type people by consuming spicy, dry, bitter, astringent, raw, and cold food items. - Pitta-Related Reason in Food Allergy - Pitta gets aggravated in Pitta dominant body Type people by consuming excessive spicy, sour, salty, fermented, deep-fried food items, raw vegetables, etc. - Kapha-Related Reason in Food Allergy - Kapha gets aggravated in Kapha dominant body type people by consuming excess milk products, excess sweets, sour, salty, cucumber, watermelon, cold items. Ayurvedic Reference of Food Allergy (Aahara Asatmyata) Classification of Food Allergy Any food can cause an adverse reaction. But according to the International Standards, eight types of food are considered as the reason for about 90 percent of food allergy events. They are: - Eggs - Milk - Fish - Shellfish - Peanuts - Tree Nuts - Wheat - Soy Certain seeds, including sesame and mustard seeds (the main ingredient in the condiment mustard) are also common food allergy triggers and are considered as major food allergens in India. In Ayurveda, on the basis of dosha dominance, food allergies are classified into: - Vata Related Food Allergy - Pitta Related Food Allergy - Kapha Related Food Allergy Symptoms of Food Allergy Mostly food allergy symptoms occur within two or three hours of ingestion or often start within minutes in some patients. Delayed reactions by four-six hours or even longer are typically seen in children who develop eczema or any other skin related ailment as a symptom.

IAFA holds your hand for an allergy-free and healthy life! - Dr. Sahil Gupta (B.A.M.S., M.H.A.) Ayurvedic Allergy Specialist CEO & Founder of IAFA\u00ae Ayurvedic Concept of Food Allergy (Aahar Asatmya) The term Satmya is used in Ayurveda which means tolerance to anything. The term used Asatmya means Intolerance to something. Satmya and Asatmya towards any food, weather or any habit is basic principle in terms of food allergy in Ayurveda. Thus Aahar Asatmya term in Ayurveda is a defined as Food Intolerance or Food Allergy. Asatmya is a result of weak digestive fire or agni. Body's digestive fire (agni) becomes weak due to ama visha (toxin) formation in the body because of imbalance in body doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha are life forces). Maximum allergic problems are common in people whose body contains ama visha (toxins) in the body. Aam visha the hard rock that originates first and then gradually accumulates in your body is due to ingestion of food in inadequate combination that is asatmya aahar. Adequate Food Combination the Ancient Eating Principle of Ayurveda The digestive tract and immune system are interlinked, adequate food combination (historical as per Ayurveda principles) can provide essential support by helping us to improve digestive health, which in turn can improve immune health. Ayurveda divides Food (Ras) Tastes into two Group 1 and Group 2 as below: | | Food (Ras) Six Tastes of the Tongue | | Group 1 | | Group 2 |1. Madhura (Sweet) - like sugar, honey, sugarcane juice, rice, wheat, milk, and fruits like mango||4. Katu (Pungent) - like Chili pepper, and black pepper, spices such as mustard, ginger, garlic, and onion| |2. Amla (Sour) - Citrus fruits like limes, lemons, oranges, sour cream, yogurt, vinegar & fermented food.||5. Tikta (Bitter) - like bitter gourd and bitter melon, Herbs like neem.| |3. Lavana (Salty) - Sea salt, rock salt, and salt||6. Kashaya (Astringent) - like Unripe banana, chickpeas, alum, and okra.| Ayurveda outlines a number of foods that, while perhaps fine to eat individually. The three ras of same group 1 madhur, amla and lavan are incompatible to eat with one another like madhura with amla and are compatible to eat with another three ras of different group 2 katu, tikta and kashya like madhura with tikta. Inadequate combination (virudha aahar) of ras (food) leads to food allergies. That's the ancient principle of aahar-vihar of ayurveda.
