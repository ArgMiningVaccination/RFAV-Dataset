The announcementmade it clear that the wider scientific community would be involved in theprocess. The purpose of the Workshop was to assist in determining the scientificinput and approaches required to meet research needs. Advice would be soughton what should be included in a Research Requirements Document which willinvite expressions of interest in addressing specific research questions raised byCOT and others. The Workshop had been designed to include researchquestions and issues which are being addressed by researchers but which are notincluded in COT's recommendations. 1 This summary comprises views expressed at the meeting which are not necessarily those agreed by the workshop as a whole. Responsibility for the content of abstracts remains with their individual authors.2 of 293.3 The chairman explained that speakers would include those working currently within and outside of the specific areas identified by COT as priorities. Anoverhead presentation of the five main areas of the COT recommendations wasdisplayed, as shown below. The COT Recommendations 1) What are the most common patterns of exposure, clinical presentation and subsequent clinical course among people in the UK with chronic illnesses that they attribute to OPs? 2) How common is dipper's flu and what causes it?3) Does low-level exposure to OPs cause disabling neurological or psychiatric disease in a small sub-group of exposed persons? 4) Do people with chronic disabling illness that is suspected of being related to OPs differ metabolically from the general population? 5) Other then acetylcholinesterase inhibition, what mechanisms play an important role in the causation of adverse health effects by OPs? ----------------------------------------- 4.SCIENTIFIC SESSION 1 NOMINATED KEYNOTE SPEAKERS & DISCUSSION (10.15-11.30) Abstracts of presentations submitted by nominated speakers are given (see Appendix 2). 4.1COT recommendations for further research (David Coggon) The focus of the COT report on whether exposure to low doses of OPs can cause long term adverse health effects was reviewed, along with the research that hasbeen published in this area. The possibility that a small sub-group of exposedpersons became too unwell to continue working following exposure to OPs hadnot been investigated in any of the studies that were available for the COT. Thisgap in current knowledge, together with other areas requiring clarification, wereidentified by the COT. Discussion after the presentation clarified the rationalebehind the COT's view that adverse neurophysiological effects due to OPexposure were rare and that exposure was not a major factor accounting for theexcess of suicides in farmers. Dr Coggon recognised however the many cases ofchronic ill health which were attributed to OP exposure which needed to beinvestigated in a systematic fashion. 4.2An epidemiological study of exposure to organophosphate pesticides and neuropathy among UK sheep dippers (Adele Pilkington) The aims, methods and results of this work were described. An empirical model developed in phase 1 was used to develop an exposure questionnaire for use inthe phase 2 cross-sectional study of sheep dipping farmers and a control group.The third phase had focused on a sub-group and involved more detailedneurological and neuropsychological investigations. There were no questionsafter the presentation.3 of 294.3Epidemiologic design (Nicola Cherry) Professor Cherry described the current SCOPE study funded by HSE into genetic variation in susceptibility to chronic effects of OP. This addressed key points: why some people get sick and some don't after dipping sheep that there were alternative alloenzyme (A & B) forms of paraoxonase that genetic differences may determine phenotypes of A & B above a case-referent study (ill and unaffected dippers) using blood sampling to determine enzyme type should reveal any association between thatcharacteristic and susceptibility careful means to control for exposure history and definition of patterns of illness would be needed 144 pairs of subjects had been analysed to date and a total of 175 would be completed by June report to HSE by July and peer reviewed paper by August were planned. In discussion it was confirmed that blood samples remained available for further analysis, that the study covered different types of exposure to OPs and that itinvolved both genotyping and phenotyping. 4.4Survey of health complaints among sheep dippers registered with sufferers' support groups (Tony Fletcher) The background to this proposed project was described as a systematic survey among those reporting to have suffered from ill health following exposure toOPs. It is intended to conduct a systematic survey of those registered withvarious organisations in order to gain a coherent overview of the consistency ofthe patterns of reported ill health. There were no questions. 4.5Non-cholinergic neurotoxicity induced by organophosphates: elucidation of molecular targets and mechanisms (Paul Glynn) Research into mechanisms other than cholinesterase inhibition in the causation of adverse health effects by OPs was described. This included brain proteinsinvolved in peptide metabolism and implicated with NTE. In discussion, theissue of whether work on NTE had been done in relation to children was raised.It was confirmed that NTE had an important development r\u00f4le but that the youngwere likely to be less susceptible to the effects of OPs on NTE than older people.It was agreed that there was some controversy as to whether an OP enhancedNTE effect was a causative factor or a marker of neuropathy. 4.6Use of biomarkers of exposure and effect to define exposure to organophosphates in the workplace and potential toxic effect (Richard Glass/ Faith Williams) In discussion, examples of what might be biomarkers were given. In particular it was suggested that electrophysiological or enzyme biomarkers, such as serumcholinesterase, NTE or blood protease might be used.4 of 295.SCIENTIFIC SESSION 2 PLENARY DISCUSSION (12.00-13.10) 5.1 The Chairman sought and received confirmation that there was a consensus among participants that the recommendations for further research made by theCOT were relevant in addressing the fundamental question of a possible linkbetween long term low level exposure to OPs and chronic symptoms which hadbeen reported. In discussion on the meaning of low-level exposure, it was notedthat COT had defined \"low doses\" as doses lower than those causing overt acutetoxicity (i.e. symptoms and signs of acute toxicity). However, this raised thequestion of whether exposure not sufficient to cause cholinergic symptomsshould be regarded as low level. In examining the literature it was necessary toestablish whether a history of cholinergic episodes was or was not relevant tocase studies. It was agreed that there could be a sub-set among those reportingchronic symptoms who had experienced cholinergic symptoms which had notbeen \"recognised\" at the time of the acute event. Such a sub-set would need tobe distinguished in any further research for those who had not displayed anysigns or symptoms of acute toxicity. It was noted that the existing literature hadnot identified a clear correlation between severity of cholinergic effects andchronic symptoms. 5.2 The issue of whether there was a sub-group who were particularly susceptible to OPs was linked to the issue of multiple chemical sensitivity. A possiblecorrelation between sensitisation to very low doses of OPs and the symptoms ofchronic fatigue syndrome had been suggested. In this context it was explainedthat sensitisation was a reaction to serial exposures to very small doses or an\"acquired intolerance\". 5.3 The meeting noted that COT had concluded that the proposal that dippers' flu is a manifestation of acute OP toxicity remained unproven. The Committee hadnot, therefore, regarded it as an indicator of acute OP toxicity. The meetingagreed that it would be important for further research into dippers' flu to addressthe question of whether symptoms could be due to an acute cholinergic effectbecause, if it was, those reporting symptoms of dippers' flu might developchronic sequelae. The possibility that dippers' flu could be caused by an allergicresponse to endotoxins was also raised. 5.4 There was a consensus that the possibility that chronic symptoms could be linked to low-level exposure to OPs had not been fully explored because those withsymptoms sufficiently severe to take them out of work had generally not beenincluded in previous epidemiological studies. It was agreed that there was aneed to widen the population base in any future studies to include thosepreviously exposed to OPs who were no longer fit to work. 5.5 It was noted that previous studies had not, generally, been able to provide valid quantitative data for exposure to OPs. If possible, future research should seek toestablish such data and it would be important for researchers to have rapid accessto exposed persons. It was pointed out that there was no certainty that the \"doseto insult\" curve was linear. The response could be affected by the susceptibilityof individuals and the possibility that susceptibility could be changed.5 of 295.6 It was noted that changes in the formulations of veterinary medicines and pesticides could be relevant to the question of chronic effects following lowlevel exposure to the OP active ingredient. It was suggested that exposure to theco-formulants or additives themselves might cause or exacerbate symptoms. Forexample, phenols which were removed from sheep dip formulations in the early1990s could alter the metabolic base for toxicological outcomes and this couldbe an important issue in relation to the possibility of sensitisation. 5.7 In turning to issues not identified by COT as those which should be addressed by further research, consideration was given to the possible immune or hormonaleffects of OPs. It was noted that there had been a small number of studiesincluding an item in the Lancet circa 1996 which had examined extensivedisturbance of cellular components of immunity in a laboratory study. Referencewas also made to a WHO document indicating an OP eliciting auto-immuneresponse and, therefore, advising caution in undergoing vaccination followingexposure to OPs. It was suggested that there was also a possibility of an OPimpact on hormones (as endocrine disruptors) which could be synergistic oradditive. 5.8 The issue of whether cholinergic conditions should be examined as a possible generic cause of Alzheimer's disease, glaucoma, ME and related Gulf WarSyndromes was raised. It was noted that this symptomology could be looked outfor in the examination of data held by OPIN and PEGS to be carried out byDr Fletcher. However, it was recognised that such symptoms were not specificand could be caused by several different diseases. There was also the possibilitythat, if such diagnoses had been made, those with the symptoms might not havelinked or reported them in relation to OP exposure. 5.9 Among other possibilities noted were : possible synergy between OPs and other agents; possible effects of OPs on gastro-intestinal disturbance, kidney disease,liver dysfunction and skeletal effects; cardiac conduction abnormalities; visualfield defects. The meeting also noted the possibility, to be reviewed in thefollowing session, that children as a group might be particularly vulnerable toOPs. 5.10 It was suggested that future research should seek to address three important areas. The first was cholinergic effects which were still not fully understood.For example Sedgwick et al had demonstrated adverse synaptic effects 30months after a single dose administration. The second was that hypotheses ofcauses of Gulf War Syndrome had described disparities between in-vitro and in-vivo effects, which were possible to explain by individual differences (e.g.sodium chloride status). The third was that diagnosis of \"disabling\" diseaseshould include reports of symptoms by individuals. The Chairman concluded that there would be a further possibility of discussing additional research questions following further presentations after the lunchbreak.6 of 296.INTRODUCTION TO OPEN SESSION 3 (14.00) 6.1 Baroness Hayman (MAFF Minister of State in the House of Lords) introduced the afternoon sessions, describing herself as Minister currently responsible forOP issues at MAFF. She thanked speakers and delegates who had come to themeeting in response to what was acknowledged to be a difficult issue (of thehighest order). The need to listen closely to good scientific advice as well as to abroad base of opinion (scientific and non-scientific) was stressed. TheWorkshop was intended to allow expression of opinion in an inclusive andtransparent way, through debate aimed at helping to establish an ongoingresearch programme to underpin developing policy in this area. OPEN SESSION 3 NOMINATED SPEAKERS (14.05-15.15) 6.2Concerns about possible effects on children of exposure to OPs, either parental or direct (Elizabeth Sigmund) Also cited : Early brain injury - potential risks from organophosphate compounds D A Johnson & J Clarke In discussion it was reported that a similar cohort of children (about 12 cases) had been identified. It was suggested that it would be helpful to have evidenceof the clinical characteristics of individuals in the two groups identified althoughit was recognised that individuals might be reluctant to expose their children tosuch scrutiny. 6.3Occupational OP Insecticide Exposure and Reduced Proximal Femur Bone Density (Stephen Hodges) Dr Hodges described in vitro experiments using paraoxon and diazinon to determine their impact in altering bone reabsorption. In discussion it wasconfirmed that data had been age-adjusted to take account of the fact that the OPexposed group was older than the control group. It was noted that the OPexposed group and the sub-group selected for biopsies were self-selected andnot, therefore, a random sample. It was pointed out that farmers would normallyhave high density bone stock due to hard physical work. Although it was notpossible to make a link, certain symptoms of fatigue could be linked to boneatrophy. 6.4Neurological effects of orgnophosphorus compounds (Goran Jamal) Dr Jamal described four main areas requiring further research; firstly, investigation of \"dipper's flu\", secondly, the full profile of COPIND, thirdly theeffects of synergism and combination exposures with OP impurities and withother non OP compounds, and fourthly, to study the effects of both physical andpsychological stress on OP toxicity.7 of 296.5Autonomic Features of Chronic Exposure to the Organophosphates in Sheep- dip (Peter Julu) A description was given of investigations into 40 patients who developed chronic neurological dysfunction following clear histories of several episodes ofmild to moderate acute OP poisoning. A comprehensive examination ofautonomic function provided evidence of patterns of autonomic lesions whichwere proposed as a possible basis for diagnosis of adverse health sequelae of OPpoisoning. 6.6Neuropsychological sequelae of organophosphate poisoning (Sarah Mackenzie-Ross) The place of cognitive impairment alongside physical symptoms in the diagnosis and treatment of health problems arising from OP exposure was described.Methodological problems inherent in previous work were discussed. 7.OPEN SESSION 4 PLENARY DISCUSSION (15.45-16.45) Chair Professor Anthony Newman-Taylor 7.1 The meeting noted that, although chronic fatigue as a symptom had been recognised as an effect of pesticide exposure in a report from CDC Atlanta, itwould be difficult to distinguish between OP or viral exposure as the singlecause of a chronic fatigue 'syndrome'. 7.2 In discussion of Dr Julu's paper, the functions of the autonomic nervous system were explained. The suite of tests employed examined and characterised thesefunctions and identified certain functions, e.g. barroreceptors and parts of thecentral parasympathetic nervous system, which were affected by OPs. Indiscussion it was confirmed that patients who had been tested (also usingelectrophysiological tests) had generally been exposed to OPs through the skinalthough in a very small number exposure had been through inhalation oringestion. It was recognised that, although dermal exposure was most common,there could be circumstances when inhalation would also be involved so it wasdifficult to be certain. However, studies carried out by the IOM had establishedthat aerosols were not found to be a significant exposure hazard. It was notedthat OPs could also be absorbed through the nasal mucosa during inhalation. 7.3 Concern was expressed about recommendations for treatment with anti- depressants in cases of OP exposure or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. There hadbeen one case of an OP user who was given antidepressants who had committedsuicide shortly after admission to a psychiatric hospital. A suggested basis forthis reaction to psychotropic drugs could have been an elevation of seratonin byOPs. 7.4 It was noted that, because the COT's remit had been to look at class effects of OPs, the developmental toxicity of individual compounds had not beenreviewed. It was recognised that the paper presented by Mrs Sigmund had drawn8 of 29attention to a possible link between exposure to OPs (both post and pre-natal) and subsequent cognitive impairment. As recognised when the paper had beenpresented, it might be possible to carry out research into this question. However,it would be important to look at consistency of symptoms and to establishwhether there was any pattern. In doing so, it would be helpful to have availablethe clinical characteristics and history of children who had been reported asbeing exposed to OPs. 8.SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS (16.45-16.55) At the invitation of the Chairman, Ray Anderson recapped on the key points of the Government's announcement of 20 December 1999, referring to a targetedprogramme of R&D to be funded by MAFF, HSE and DOH and to address theissues identified by COT plus such issues as were identified by this workshop. Without attempting to summarise the whole discussion, he highlighted examplesof issues arising: dippers' flu and the possibility that it was due to cholinergic effects; the importance of defining what is meant by low level exposure and distinguishing between individuals who may have suffered anunrecognised acute event from those who have not; possible susceptible groups (including children exposed either directly or in the womb). Explaining the further process to follow the meeting, it was confirmed that: the meeting had been helpful in the context of producing a specific list of R&D questions; these questions would be drafted into a Research Requirements Document; that document would be placed in the public domain; those research requirements would be subject to open competition (with an independent involvement in their scrutiny); a rapid response to addressing these questions would be sought. The meeting was closed at 17.00 hrs.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Further copies of this document will be accessible to download from the InternetWebsite addresses given below:MAFF: www.maff.gov.uk/research/publicationsDH: www.doh.gov.uk/opwkshop.htmHSE: www.hse.gov.uk/research/content/opps/index.htm9 of 29Appendix 1a AGENDA WORKSHOP ON ON ORGANOPHOSPHATES Society of Chemical Industry Headquarters 14/15 Belgrave Square, London SW1X 8PS 28th March 2000 9.00 ARRIVAL AND REGISTRATION 10.00 OPENING OF MEETING Chair Prof. Anthony Newman-Taylor10.10 INTRODUCTION TO SCIENTIFIC SESSION 1 Chair Prof. Anthony Newman-Taylor10.15 SCIENTIFIC SESSION 1 NOMINATED KEYNOTE SPEAKERS & DISCUSSION (10 mins each including questions)1 David Coggon2 Adele Pilkington3 Nicola Cherry4 Fletcher5P a u l G l y n n6 Richard Glass / Faith Williams 11.15 COFFEE11.45 SCIENTIFIC SESSION 2 Chair Prof. Anthony Newman-Taylor PLENARY DISCUSSION 13.00 LUNCH14.00 INTRODUCTION TO OPEN SESSION 3 Chair Prof. Anthony Newman-Taylor14.05 OPEN SESSION 3 NOMINATED SPEAKERS 1 Elizabeth Sigmund2 Stephen Hodges / Juliet Compston3 Goran Jamal / Stig Hansen / Peter Julu 2 4 Sarah Mackenzie-Ross 15.00 TEA15.30 INTRODUCTION TO SESSION 4 Chair Baroness Hayman MOS (L) PLENARY DISCUSSION Chair Prof. Anthony Newman-Taylor 16.45 SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS Ray Anderson17.00 CLOSE 2 Due to lack of time presentations were made by Dr Jamal and Dr Julu only.10 of 29Appendix 1b WORKSHOP ON RESEARCH ON ORGANOPHOSPHATES (OPs) Tuesday, 28th March 2000 Attendee List Dr Robert Abel DETR Mr Paul Adamson Pesticides Safety DirectorateDr G M Ahmed Consultant PsychiatristMr Brian Anderson OPIN ScotlandMr Ray Anderson Veterinary Medicines DirectorateDr Barrowman Scientist's GroupMr Peter Graham Bonwick Chester CollegeMr Paul Brown \"The Guardian\" Mr of MedicineMr Richard MAFFMs Petrina Day \"New Scientist\" MagazineDr Frank Dewhurst De Montfort UniversityMr Ian Dewhurst Safety DirectorateDr Martin Donaghy Scottish Executive Health DepartmentDr Philippa Edwards Department of HealthDr Robin E Ferner Birmingham City HospitalDr Robin Fielder Department of HealthDr Tony Fletcher London School of Hygiene and Tropical MedicineDr John FowlerDr Teg Freer Wonford House HospitalDr H FullertonDr Andrew Gilbert Central Science LaboratoryMr Richard Glass Central Science LaboratoryDr Paul Glynn MRC Toxicology Unit, University of LeicesterDr Stig Hansen Southern General Hospital NHS Trust, GlasgowMr John Harvey Freelance JournalistDr F Hassib PPD ICCJBaroness Hayman House of LordsDr Stephen University of EssexProf Malcolm Hooper University of SunderlandMs Miriam Jacobs University of SurreyDr Goran Jamal Central Middlesex HospitalMr Evan Jones Organophosphates Research Doris M JonesDr Peter Central Carlton LaytonDr MacintyreDr Sarah University College LondonDr M I Mackness University of ManchesterDr B Mackness University of ManchesterMs Louise Marriott Hodge, Jones and AllenProf Tim Marrs Department of HealthMr Rob Mason Pesticides Safety Directorate11 of 29Dr Howard Mason Health and Safety Laboratory Prof Cecil McMurray DARD NIDr Elaine Mutch University of NewcastleDr Sarah Myhill British Society of Allergy, Environmental and Nutritional Medicine Prof Anthony Newman-Taylor National Heart & Lung InstituteMrs Penny Palmer MAFF Chief Scientist's Group Ms Sarah Passingham Ministry of DefenceDr Adele Pilkington IOMMs Claire Piper Hodge, University of ManchesterMs Sue Rabbitt Vala Rees Renwick Clinical SERADDr Craig Sams and LaboratoryDr Maurice Sauer Veterinary Scott DERADr David MAFF Chief Scientist's GroupMrs Elizabeth Sigmund OP Information NetworkMr William Sigmund OP Information NetworkDr A E Smith University of ManchesterDr Stuart Smith Health and Safety ExecutiveMr Alan Spence Health and Safety ExecutiveProf Mike Taylor Veterinary Laboratories AgencyProf P K Thomas Royal Free & University College Medical School Paul Tyler MP Dr Sarah Wark Medicines Control AgencyMr Stephen Wentworth MAFFMrs Joanna WheatleyDr Garry Wiles Health and Safety ExecutiveDr Faith M Williams University of NewcastleDr John Williams Chester CollegeMs Frances WolferstanProf H F Woods University of Sheffield12 of 29Appendix 2 SUMMARIES AVAILABLE FROM NOMINATED SPEAKERS - SESSION 1 1. David Coggon COT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH The COT report focuses on whether exposure to low doses of OPs can cause long-term adverse neurological or neuropsychiatric health effects. Quite a lot of research has now beenpublished in this area and from this the report draws several useful conclusions. However, amajor gap in current knowledge was identified. This relates to the possibility that low doses of OPs might cause important disabling neurological or neuropsychiatic disease in a small sub-group of exposed persons.As well as research to address this question directly, the report identifies four other questions,answers to which would help to clarify the remaining uncertainties. What are the most common patterns of exposure, clinical presentation and subsequent clinical course among people in the United Kingdom with chronic illnesses that theyattribute to OPs? How common is dipper's flu, and what causes it? Do people with chronic disabling illness that is suspected of being related to OPs differ metabolically from the general population? Other than acetylcholinesterase inhibition, what mechanisms play an important role in the causation of adverse health effects by OPs? -------------------13 of 292. Adele Pilkington An epidemiological study of exposure to organophosphate pesticides and neuropathy among UK sheep dippers Pilkington A, D, Jamal GA*, Gillham R**, Hansen Julu PO*, SF *, Abdel-Azis M JF, Soutar CA. Institute of Occupational Medicine(IOM), Edinburgh, *Imperial College, London (formerly at INS, Glasgow), **Institute ofNeurological Sciences (INS), Glasgow, *** Leicester Royal Infirmary Aims The broad aim of the study was to investigate whether cumulative exposure to organophosphates (OPs) in sheep dips is related to clinically detectable measures ofpolyneuropathy. Methods The study was completed in three main phases. The first phase sought to develop an empirical model for the uptake of OPs during different activities involved in dipping. This involvedobserving dipping sessions at twenty farms, and measuring OP metabolites in urine samples ofsheep dippers both before and after dipping. This information was then used to develop anexposure questionnaire which was used in the second phase of the study, and appliedretrospectively over a working life. The second phase was a cross-sectional field study of 612 sheep dipping farmers, together with control groups of farmers with no sheep dipping experience and ceramics workers.Neurological assessments were based on a standard neuropathy symptoms questionnaire, andthermal and vibration quantitative sensory tests. The third phase of the study involved more detailed neurological and neuropsychological investigations of a subgroup of 79 exposed sheep farmers from phase two. The questionnaireand sensory tests used in the cross-sectional study were repeated. Additional tests includednerve conduction, electromyography and clinical assessment. Neuropsychological assessmentincluded the CANTAB battery and standard measures of anxiety and depression. Results The results from Phase 1 suggested that the most important source of exposure to OPs was contact with concentrate dip. Levels of urinary metabolites increased with increased handlingof the concentrate containers. Increased splashing with dip wash was also found to bepositively associated with increment in urinary metabolites. In phase 2 after adjusting for confounders there was a weak positive association between cumulative exposure to OPs and neurological symptoms, the significance of which wasdependent on the inclusion of a few individuals with extremely high exposure. There was noevidence of an association between cumulative exposure and the thermal or vibration sensorythresholds. However, separating the effects of exposure intensity and duration, revealed ahigher prevalence of symptoms, primarily sensory, among sheep dippers who handled the OPconcentrate. There was also evidence that thermal and vibration thresholds were higher amongconcentrate handlers.14 of 29More detailed clinical assessments during phase 3, also suggested that the pattern of changes found was consistent with a sensory neuropathy. Individuals classified with a probable clinicalneuropathy were also more likely to report symptoms of anxiety and depression. Conclusion The findings suggest an association between exposure to OPs, predominantly the concentrate, and sensory neurological symptoms, and to a lesser extent, sensory thresholds .This suggests that long term health effects may occur in at least some sheep dippers exposed to OPs over aworking life and is consistent with results from earlier studies. -------------------15 of 293.

Tony Fletcher Outline of presentation to MAFF workshop 28/3/00 \"Survey of health complaints among sheep dippers registered with sufferers' support groups\"Tony Fletcher Environmental Epidemiology UnitLondon School of Hygiene & Tropical MedicineKeppel Street, London WC1 7HT Background Substantial numbers of individuals with a history of repeated exposure to organophosphates used in sheep dipping, have complained of a variety of symptoms, above all neurological andneuro-psychiatric. They attribute these to their organophosphate exposure and have sought orare seeking, treatment, recognition and in some cases financial compensation for their illness.Some of them are sufficiently disabled to be unable to work. Many report frustration at thescepticism that they face, including from medical professionals, that their conditions areindeed attributable to their exposure to sheep dip chemicals. A number of supportorganisations have sprung up who provide information and moral support to these sufferers, inparticular OPIN, PEGS and NIOPSA (respectively the Organophosphate PesticideInformation Network, the Pesticide Exposure Group of Sufferers and the Northern IrelandOrganophosphorous Sufferers' Association). Members of and subscribers to these three organisations with symptoms and OP exposure add up to approximately 1000 individuals across the UK. It is likely that that individuals whohave left sheep farming through ill-health and are included among these 1000, would not bepicked up by cross-sectional studies of farmers such as those recently published. Theseregisters therefore offer a unique route to assembling information on this potentially sizeablepopulation. However systematic data are not available across this populations and so we wereasked by them to design and carry out a systematic survey of these sufferers., so the scope ofthe potential health burden could be assessed. This project is proposed as a collaborativeexercise between LSHTM and IOM and funding is being discussed with MAFF. Survey It is proposed to undertake an interview-based survey of all the individuals in these registers, with detailed clinical examination of a sample of them to validate their answers. This lattergroup will be provided with a detailed diagnostic report as well as advice on treatment. Asthis population is self-selected, and there is no control group, it will be impossible to establishthe cause of their conditions on an individual basis to the survey participants. However it wasjudged to be of value to gain an overview of the consistency and coherence (or not) of thepatterns of exposure and symptomatology. The survey, for the first phase is thus principallydescriptive, though once the population is surveyed and described may well be that usefulnested studies will be identified. This and other aspects of the project will be overseen by anAdvisory Group including representatives of the government departments, supportorganisations and scientific advisers. It is expected that the main outcome will be adescription of the patterns of reported ill-health and exposure history, and their inter-relationships, from which the size of the health burden which might conceivably be attributedto OPs in this population, can be given. -------------------17 of 295. Paul Glynn Non-cholinergic neurotoxicity induced by organophosphates: elucidation of molecular targets and mechanisms. Paul Glynn, MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, UK. Recommendations of the COT Report* (1999) included the need for further research into mechanisms, other then acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, in the causation of adversehealth effects by OPs. Recently we have begun to identify brain proteins more sensitive tocommonly-used OPs than AChE itself: one of these is an enzyme involved in peptidemetabolism. The basic methodology in this new project, using a proteomic approach, is anupdated version of that used by our laboratory to identify NTE, the target for OP-inducedneuropathy. By cloning the NTE gene we have gained insights into the structure of thisunusual protein and into the molecular consequences of its reaction with neuropathic OPs.Our studies with NTE transgenic mice are allowing an assessment of the possibility that themechanism of OP-induced neuropathy involves not simply an inhibition of NTE's enzymeactivity, but instead a toxic gain of function in the protein. Increased mechanisticunderstanding is vital for hazard assessment and prediction of health risks in man, and toprovide epidemiologists with more specific indices of effect. * ORGANOPHOSPHATES: Committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment.

Richard Glass / Faith Williams JOINT PROJECT BETWEEN CENTRAL SCIENCE LABORATORY AND NEUROTOXICOLOGY UNIT, NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY USE OF BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE AND EFFECT TO DEFINE EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHATES IN THE WORKPLACE AND POTENTIAL TOXICEFFECT Background There is currently limited information relating exposure history to biomarkers of internal exposure or to biomarkers of effect other than acetylcholinesterase inhibition, which isgenerally low and recovers soon after exposure. There is a requirement for a more sensitivebiomarker of effect. Worker study External dose profile\u00afInternal dose profile\u00afBiological effect markers\u00afElectrophysiology psychology Supporting percutaneouspenetration datagenotyping phenotypingsupporting animal mechanistic data Scientific Approach Selected distinct types of exposure scenarios in volunteer workers using normal working practice, which will include repeat exposures. To investigate the same workers on more thanone occasion to define the effects of multiple exposures associated with each type of exposurepattern. 1. Evaluation of worker exposure. Using existing in-house protocols to determine potential dermal and inhalation exposure, and estimate skin deposition and stratumcorneum reservoir by tape stripping. Contamination of protective clothing and rates ofits penetration by OP's will be an essential part of this evaluation. 2. Internal dose profile. Blood levels of parent OP and active oxon metabolite (if sufficiently sensitive assay can be developed) for levels immediately post exposure.Full urinary metabolite profile up to 48 hours after dose to define uptake. 3. Biomarkers of effect. Serial blood samples for monitoring of red blood cell acetylcholinesterase, serum cholinesterase, neuropathy target esterase (if appropriate),blood integrity and function 4. Genotyping and phenotyping of individuals5. Markers of effects on neurotransmission. Use of the electrophysiological technique (SFEMG) as used in Newcastle and psychological measurements both short term afterthe exposure and longer term. Parallel approaches to define organophosphate effects in man that Newcastle University would propose:19 of 29Mechanism of organophosphate toxicity Experimental animal studies of repeated low-level exposure to OPs has demonstrated long- term neurotoxic effects. Electrophysiological measurements in the mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation have shown that multiple low-level doses of OPs can cause changes inneurotransmission (an increase in the variability of latency of evoked end-plate potentials(EPP jitter)). This effect on nerve function was delayed and occurred whenacetylcholinesterase activity had returned to normal levels The aims would be to determine the site and mechanism of the increase in EPP jitter in the mouse. Are these pre-junctional effects related to changes in conduction along the motor nerve, changes inend-plate morphology or caused by nerve-terminal regeneration ? to establish if there is any histological evidence in the mouse of nerve damage in the brain, spinal cord or peripheral axons after repeated low-level dosing with OPs. to determine the effects of repeated low-level dosing with OPs on the function of the neuromuscular junction in the mouse. Inter-individual differences in susceptibility It has been suggested that a small sub-group of the population may be more susceptible to the effects of OPs than others. Few reasons have been put forward as to why this should be, butvariability may be influenced by the individual's capacity to metabolise these compounds.Most organophosphates require activation by by the A-esterases (PON1) and carboxylesterases. Interindividual differences inactivation and detoxification may be different for different compounds and contribute todifferences in susceptibility to toxicity Our approach would be to genotype and phenotype a group of over 60 individuals who have been referred to Professor Peter Blain reporting adverse effects following chronic exposure toorganophosphates and compare to the control population Clinical picture Clinical experience (Professor Blain) of over 60 patients, referred for an expert medical opinion has failed to identify a specific set of symptoms and signs that could define asyndrome. The clinical features in these patients are not consistent nor is the causative agenteasily determined, although organophosphates in sheep dips are most commonly implicated.Clinical investigation of these cases is difficult without a clear case definition or a diagnosticmarker and in most cases there are poor historical data on exposure. The aim of this study would be to compare a series of specific variables in this group of patients with a comparable control group. The protocol adopted for the study will enable us:(I)to determine the health profiles of the patient and control groups using a General HealthQuestionnaire (2) to determine the differences in neurobehavioural parameters between thepatient group and the control group (3) to determine the differences in neurophysiologicalparameters (including single fibre electromyography (SFEMG)) between the patient group andthe control group and (4) to assess the patient group genotypically and phenotypically for theenzymes involved in the metabolism and toxicity of organophosphates and to compare thisprofile to that of the control group. -------------------20 of 29Appendix 3 SUMMARIES AVAILABLE FROM NOMINATED SPEAKERS - SESSION 3 1. Elizabeth Sigmund Contribution to the OP Workshop 28/3/2000 Concerns about possible effects on children of exposure to OPs, either parental or directIn September 1998 members of OPIN, accompanied by Dr Vyvyan Howard of the Foetal and Infant ToxicoPathology Unit, Liverpool University, presented evidence to members of the HSE at Rose Court,Southwark Bridge, London, relating to twenty two cases of severe cognitive impairment among children offamilies with direct occupational exposure to OP sheep dips. In each case one or other parent has been personallyaffected. Members of HSE present were: Dr Stuart Smith, Senior doctor in the Health Policy Directorate of HSE; Glynne Jones, from HPD, HSE; Julia O'Hara, head of Human Health Effects Section, of the HSE Pesticide RegistrationSection, Bootle. Also present for part of the meeting was Margaret Clare, the newly-appointed Head of Physicaland Biological Agents Division of HSE Health Policy Directorate. Dr Roger Rawbone of the HSE, whose updateon MS 17 is published tomorrow, informed me two weeks ago that he was never informed of this meeting, eitherbefore or since. He was not happy. On October 9 1998 Dr Stuart Smith wrote to OPIN, saying that the points made at the September meeting were \"weighty\", and that the HSE members present \"will need to put the argument more formally to our scientificadvisers, both Governmental and independent, before deciding what to do\", he said that they had foundthemselves \"handicapped by our need to rely on our unaided recollection of what was said\". It would seem to usthat such senior representatives of HSE would have provided a secretary to take detailed notes of such a meetingin which \"weighty\" matters of health were to be discussed. What follows is a list of five questions to us, which would be the suitable basis for a formal scientific enquiry ie: \"The evidence for thinking that pre-natal or post natal exposure takes place at high enough levels to cause the effects in question\", \"The reasons for thinking that the abnormalities referred to are caused by the exposures referred to,\"\"The reasons for thinking that the behavioural and other developmental disorders suffered by the children whose cases you described are linked to morphological abnormalities referred to \" (by Dr Howard), and \"Why these effects, or correlates of them, would not be expected to emerge during assembly of the pre- approved data package for the products involved\". The latter question,is, of course, of great significance, and one to which we would all like to see detailed answers.His letter ended by saying: \" I am sorry if this seems a rather lengthy list, but to do your concerns justice I think that it is important that we cover all the links in the chain of cause and effect\". We considered this letter in detail, and Dr Howard forwarded several scientific papers to Dr Smith, but no further action was taken. OPIN is a small, modestly funded support-group for people who contact us, with evidence ofoccupational exposure to OPs; we are not - and have never pretended to be - a scientific body, and see our role ashaving a duty to raise issues with the relevant Governmental department, as and when they come to our attention.Having conferred with several specialists, and taken note of a number of scientific papers relating to the effects ofOP exposure on children, we considered that we had taken the appropriate action in taking the matter to the HSE.It seems anomalous that we should then be asked to supply detailed scientific proof of the \"links in the chain ofcause and effect\", that is what we had hoped that the HSE might undertake. It still seems to us that research inthis area of concern should be undertaken.21 of 29As you will be hearing (have heard) directly of Dr Howard's concerns I will not attempt to repeat his words. [SEE EDITORIAL NOTE BELOW] I have been asked to read a short paper from David Johnson, a paediatric neuropsychologist from the Ainslie Hospital, Edinburgh. As David is unfortunately unable to be present in person he asked me to deliver this paperon his behalf. (To be forwarded later).As you will see there are very real concerns about possible central nervous system damage to the foetus or infant, whose nervous system is extremely vulnerable to nerve toxins such as OPs. All the reports received by OPINshow strikingly similar symptoms - ie cognitive impairment involving short term memory loss, language deficits,sequencing, both of numbers and letters, and lack of the ability to order information - all leading in the olderchild to lack of confidence and self esteem, which causes outbreaks of depression and anger. Two young children from Cornwall have been seen by a leading London-based paediatric neurologist, who gave a written report which confirmed that both children were suffering severe neurological imbalances, but owing tothe consultant knowing nothing about the possible effects of OP exposure he could not comment on thepossibility that exposure to OPs might have contributed to their condition. He recommended geneticinvestigation, which after a three year waiting time, has not yet transpired! As this audience will know, none of the Government funded studies undertaken in Britain have ever considered possible damage to children, despite OPIN's appeal to the HSE, and to the COT committee in 1998. We find thisinsupportable, and recommend that a research programme, conducted by experienced experts, be set up as soonas possible. This is obviously an extremely important area of research, as there are many thousands of childreninvolved in agriculture and horticulture world wide, and therefore potentially exposed to OPs. It is surely theresponsibility of the developed nations to make sure that such detailed research is carried out.

Stephen Hodges Occupational Organophosphate Insecticide Exposure and Reduced Proximal Femur Bone Density IntroductionOrganic compounds incorporating a phosphate group have the innate possibility to interact with skeletal metabolism. This is true for the bisphosphonate class of drugs,which have been designed specifically to target metabolic bone disease and asagents to counter the skeleton eroding secondary effects associated with sometumours. There is no reason to suspect that organophosphate insecticides would notalso have some effects on the skeleton. This issue has not been thoroughlyinvestigated. In vitro experiments using the specific organophosphate insecticides paraoxon and diazinon, which are said to be greatly different from a lethal-dose 50 perspective, were found to be equipotent in altering bone resorption in a tissue culture experimentusing mouse calvaria. At 'high' concentrations (10 -6 M) these chemicals inhibited 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D 3 initiated bone resorption. However, at 'low' concentrations (10-8 - 10-9 M) these chemicals augmented bone resorption by some 15%. The fact that the compounds had very similar activities suggests that the sulphur atom in diazinon,which is thought to confer the greater safety to the chemical, does not have to beconverted to an oxygen atom to exert an effect on the skeleton. This conversion isconsidered to be a function of hepatic metabolism. MethodsThe clinical investigation that was initiated to investigate the possibility of skeletal effects in humans exposed to organophosphate insecticides recruited men withdocumented occupational long-term, low-level exposure to these chemicals. Onlymen were investigated in this study in order to limit the possibility of confoundingfactors imposed by women experiencing the menopause, which is a known riskfactor for osteoporosis. The exposure group men were self-reporting as sufferingfrom health problems, allegedly from exposure to organophosphate insecticides.There were 88 men in the exposure group and these were compared to 43 men inthe control group. The latter were drawn from an urban environment and none ofthese men had an overt exposure to organophosphate insecticides. All the menrecruited into the study were subjected to rigorous exclusion criteria for the possibilityof any factors known to interfere with skeletal metabolism. All the men had bonemineral density measurements assessed at the proximal femur, lumbar spine anddistal radius. They had a plain radiography and bloods were drawn for routineclinical chemistry analyses. Blood and urine samples were also collected for specificassays for biochemical markers of skeletal metabolism and for genetic susceptibilitystudies. From the strictness of the exclusion criteria, on examination these menshould have presented with very healthy skeletons. A subset of the men (n=24) who were undergoing litigation had an iliac crest biopsy for the assessment of tissue levels of organophosphate insecticides and for specifichistomorphometric analyses.25 of 29Results The men in the control groups and the exposure groups had similar mean body mass, but the exposure group were slightly older (50.5 \u00b1 10.8 vs 43.9 \u00b1 11.1, P=0.002). Bone mineral density decreases as a function of age, therefore the bonemineral densities were adjusted to account for this using a linear regression analysis(Statgraphics Plus V4, Manugistics) to generate parameters to correct for agedifferences on bone mineral densities. Distribution characteristics structured thestatistical comparisons, log transformation of the data was necessary in someanalyses and unequal variances were accounted for. All the men had similar bone mineral densities at the lumbar spine and the distal radius. However, there were statistically significant differences between the controland exposure group with respect to the bone mineral densities at all regions of theproximal femur. The histomorphometry data on the iliac crest biopsy samples showed clear and distinct differences between the organophosphate insecticide exposure group andarchived control samples for specific bone cell activity parameters. The sameoperator conducted all the measurements in the histomorphometric study in order toreduce errors. These data have been published in The Lancet (Vol. 354 pp1791 - 1792 [1999]). Discussion The current methodologies used to measure bone mineral density have a well- documented history of reliability, accuracy and precision. The differences observedin the proximal femur between the control group and the organophosphate group aretherefore of interest. This difference amounts to approximately 0.4 standarddeviation units. A recent consensus document from a leading group of clinicalexperts has suggested that men with a one standard deviation unit difference fromage matched controls should be considered for possible intervention. For theproximal femur, and under normal circumstances, it is not considered that men wouldpresent with reduced bone mass until their mid-late sixties onwards. Epidemiologicalstudies suggest that for men about 50 years there is an approximate 6% chance ofpresenting with a fracture of the proximal femur. The men from our exposure groupwould have a predicted risk of up to 9%. This finding gives cause for concern as theexposure group were highly selected against presenting with low bone mineraldensity through other factors such as steroid use or hypogonadal status.Furthermore, exercise is well known to increase bone mass; the nature of theemployment of the men in our study suggested that their skeleton should havebenefited from their work practice and that they would have been expected to havebanked a respectable bone stock. It could be argued that a control group of morephysically active men would have given a more accurate reflection on the likely bonemineral density status of the men exposed to organophosphate insecticides. A central problem is that using cross sectional data, as in this study, there is no information on what is going to happen to the skeleton of the organophosphateinsecticide exposed men. Indeed, just as the bone mineral density data of theskeleton may be a witness to past insult, the histomorphometric data suggests that26 of 29the current skeletal status of these men may be deteriorating at an alarming rate. Further studies are urgently required to define and understand the full impact of skeletal toxicity induced by occupational long-term, low-level exposure toorganophosphate insecticides. It is of concern that the in vitro studies cannot show a distinction between the two forms of organophosphate insecticide on skeletal metabolism. This data strongly suggests that there does not need to be hepatic conversion of the sulphur containingorganophosphate insecticides to inflict skeletal damage. This is alarming as, in thetreatment of headlice, organophosphates are left in contact with the child for severalhours. Re-infection, or incomplete clearance of the infestation, often means that thesame children can be exposed to multiple doses of these chemicals. The skeletaltoxicity issue of these organophosphate compounds needs to be addressed as theadult histomorphometry study suggests that there are potentially, long-term skeletalhealth problems, as the men that were examined had not been overtly exposed toorganophosphate insecticides for several years. As a footnote it is worth mentioning, as it arose in the question session following the presentation, that the histomorphometric tissue samples cannot, in themselves, beconsidered to carry bias due to the fact that the subjects were proceeding withlitigation. This is too subjective an issue for scientific debate, but I suggest thatlitigation does not, in this case, carry the sub-clause 'most ill', but may reflect morethe fact that these subject were possibly the 'most committed' to resolving theirclaims for ill-health. -------------------27 of 293. Jamal NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ORGNOPHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS GORAN A. JAMAL, MB ChB MD PhD FRCP Imperial College School of Medicine In addition to the acute cholinergic poisoning, organophosphorus (OP) compounds are capable of producing intermediate syndrome, delayed OPINDand chronic neurological, neurobehavioural and psychiatric disorder(COPIND). The concept of the neuropathy target esterase (NTE) inhibition andageing as a marker of OPIDN and the use of the hen test as an exclusivescreening test for neurotoxicity of Ops is flawed. COPIND syndrome can beproduced either following one or more episodes of acute cholinergic effect(phenomenon 1) or following repeated prolonged exposure to relatively smallquantities of OP which do not produce cholinergic manifestations(phenomenon 2). The chronic effects on children is serious under recognisedand may be more incapacitating. There are four main important areas which require further research; Firstly, investigation of \"dipper's flu\" as these may well represent cholinergic episodes and if so then they could be causing COPIND through phenomenon 1 in large numbers of farmers. Secondly, the full profile of COPIND and the extent of the overlap between its various components needs further research. Thirdly, to study the effects of synergism and combination exposures with OP impurities and with other non OP compounds. Fourthly, to study the effects of both physical and psychological stress on OP toxicity.28 of 294. Peter Julu Abstract: Autonomic Features of Chronic to the Organophosphates Sheep-dip Peter O.O.Julu, Stig Hansen1 and Goran A. Jamal Peripheral Nerve and Autonomic Unit, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Department of Neurology, Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, Park Royal, London NW10 7N and 1Department of Clinical Physics, Institute of Neurological Sciences, Southern General Hospital, Glasgow G51 4TF. We investigated 40 patients who developed chronic neurological dysfunction following clear histories of several episodes of mild to moderate acute organophosphate poisoning. Extensive failureof the cutaneous thermoregulatory vasomotor function was found in 38 patients (95%), but emotionalsudomotor function was absent in only 11 patients (27%). There was failure of the cardioacceleratorfunction in 28 patients (70%), failure of the sympathetic control of blood vessels in the skeletalmuscles was found in 18 patients (46%). Twenty patients (50%), some with clear history of oralingestion of organophosphates had failure of the sympathetic control of the splanchnic vascular bed.We saw disturbances of the baroreflex function in 33 patients (83%). Nearly all patients in this grouphad lower than normal resting cardiac vagal tones. Despite the sympathetic failures, there was eithernone, or very mild postural hypotension in these patients, contrary to this being the common effect ofother causes of autonomic failure like diabetes mellitus and pure idiopathic autonomic failure. Our finding support existing evidence that long-term neurological sequelae follows acute organophosphate intoxication and repetitive low level exposure to these compounds. Autonomictarget-organs in the skin, large blood vessels and the heart including central parasympathetic functionsare most affected. This pattern of autonomic lesions is unique to chronic organophosphate poisoningand could be diagnostic of the condition. This is the first detailed study of autonomic dysfunction inthe neurological disorders associated with organophosphate exposure to our knowledge. -------------------29 of 295. Sarah MacKenzie-Ross Neuropsychological sequelae of organophosphate poisoning ABSTRACT Much has been written about the physical symptoms of acute organophosphate poisoning and possible mechanisms of damage. Cognitiveimpairment has often been looked at in rather a limited way, which isunfortunate as it can be severe and disabling in some individuals.Methodological problems inherent in previous research are discussed, forexample: (1) The lack of epidemiological studies on the prevalence andseverity of neurological problems in farmers exposed to organophosphates.This makes it difficult to determine if organophosphates are equally toxic to allindividuals or if certain individuals are vulnerable. (2) The majority of studieshave examined individuals with a history of acute poisoning. Less is knownabout the effects of long-term low level exposure. Agreement about the natureof 'dippers flu' is lacking, so it is difficult to know whether it represents acutemild poisoning. If it does then individuals with and without a history of 'dippersflu' should be examined separately. To date, studies have not made thisdistinction and have combined both groups of farmers in their analysis. (3)Many researchers have only included a small number of cognitive tests in theirprotocols which may lack sensitivity and produce false negative results.Through the course of clinical work, the author has carried out in-depthpsychometric testing on a small number of farmers with a history of exposureto organophosphates (and 'dippers flu'). These farmers show evidence ofsignificant mental and motor slowing, impaired memory, executive dysfunctionand emotional changes (anxiety and depression). Further studies are neededto determine the mechanism of damage; and whether these farmers areparticularly vulnerable to the effects of organophosphates ( and if so, why ?). ------------------- "}
