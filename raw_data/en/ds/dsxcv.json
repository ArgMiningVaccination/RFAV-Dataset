To administer medicine to a disease ... is comparable to the behavior of one who begins to dig a well after he has become thirsty...... Would these actions not be too late?\" - Su Wen, Yellow Emperor's Classics Traditional Chinese Healing Arts Towards Becoming a Health Coach Certification is a professional program focusing on classical Chinese Herbal Medicine, Oriental Nutrition, and the Taoist Healing Arts through Movement. This is Part 1 called Healing with Foods. The Traditional Chinese Healing Arts have been used successfully for over 2000 years. These techniques are still being practiced in modern clinics throughout the world today. This program was designed to de-mystify Chinese Herbalism and Oriental Nutrition / Food Techniques for the western practitioner and give a working knowledge of terminology and protocols. These can be successfully applied to complement your current healthcare practice, begin working on your own health or improve your overall health. In this program, we are reuniting Traditional Chinese Medicine with the Taoist Healing Arts, as they originally were practiced in China. Over time these practices were separated out and treated as individual practices, and taken away from the idea of holistic learning, which must work as a whole leaf, not just the stem, or the vein of a leaf. The disconnect is separating these teachings which contain knowledge of food, herbs, meditations and movements, and when taken as stand-alone pieces, they are not as comprehensive. This is what makes this training more complete and returns to the original state of how these techniques were meant to be taught. This series will teach you how to diagnose and treat patient/client symptoms by nourishing the body with specially prepared plants, herbal extracts, minerals and more through clinical practice working with clients. You will learn to incorporate herbs, healing foods and techniques in nutrition, balanced by how to address the spiritual side of the body through Tai Chi, QiGong, and healing meditations into your current clinical practice and everyday life. The approach used will help to de-mystify Chinese Herbalism, the Oriental way of healing with food and healing Taoist practices and movement to give a working knowledge of terminology and protocols that can be successfully applied to your current practice as well as your own overall health.
