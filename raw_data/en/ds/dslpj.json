Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California's oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorous undergrad-uate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, education, engineering, counseling psychology, law, and pastoral ministries. The University boasts a diverse community ofscholars characterized by small classes and a values-oriented curriculum, and is dedicated to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The traditions of Jesuit education\u2014educating the whole person for a life of service\u2014run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs. Santa Clara University is perennially ranked among the top comprehensive universities by U.S. News & World Report. SCU has one of the highest graduation rates for undergrad- uate students among all comprehensive universities. The University has a national reputa-tion for its undergraduate program that features a distinctive core curriculum, an integratedlearning envir onment, and r esearch oppor tunities for undergraduate students. The MBA program in the Leavey School of Business is annually ranked in the top 20 among the nation's part-time programs and in the top five in California. The School of Law is rankedin the top 100 of the nation 's law schools with its intellectual property program recognized among the top 10 of such programs in the country. The U niversity was established as Santa Clara College on the site of the Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally operated as a preparatory school and did not offer courses of collegiate rank until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. O ne-thir d of the students w ere enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college's preparatory and high school departments. Santa Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added.In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business began in 1926 and, within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the countr y to r eceive national accr editation. For 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admissions explosion\u2014from 1,500 students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began thelargest building program in school history, building eight residence halls, a student union,and an athletic stadium. In the early 1970s, the Board of T rustees voted to limit the sizeof the undergraduate population, an action that was intended to pr eserve the character and ensure the quality of the University for generations to come. In 1985, the Universityadopted \"Santa Clara University\" as its official name. 12 SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY VISION, MISSION, AND FUNDAMENTAL VALUES Santa Clara University has adopted three directional statements to describe the kind of university that it aspires to become (Strategic Vision), its core purpose and the constituenciesit serves (University Mission), and the beliefs that guide its actions (Fundamental Values). Strategic Vision Santa Clara University will excel in educating men and women to be leaders of compe- tence, conscience, and compassion. By combining teaching and scholarship of high qual-ity, an integrated education in the Jesuit tradition, and a commitment to students as persons, we will prepare them for professional excellence, responsible citizenship, and service to society, especially on behalf of those in greatest need. University Mission Santa Clara University is a Catholic and Jesuit institution that makes student learning its central focus, promotes faculty and staff learning in its various forms, and exhibits orga-nizational learning as it deals with the challenges facing it. Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in an educational en- vironment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective en-gagement with society , and a commitment to fashioning a mor e humane and just world. As an academic community, we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching, research, artistic expression, and other forms of scholarship. It is prima- rily through discovering, communicating, and applying knowledge that we exercise our institutional r esponsibility as a v oice of r eason and conscience in society . We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to the development of: Undergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orientation in a primarily r esidential setting Graduate students, many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley, who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contributionsto their fields In addition to these core programs, we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for non-matriculated students. Fundamental Values We hold ourselves responsible for living out these core values, which are critical for carrying out our mission in pursuit of our vision: Academic Quality. We seek an uncompromising standard of excellence in teaching, learn- ing, and scholarship. All three elements are essential to academic quality at Santa Clara. Weprize original scholarship for its own sake and for the contribution it makes to teaching andto the betterment of society. Our commitment to academic freedom is unwavering. Integrated Learning. While valuing the integrity of established disciplines, we endeavor to integrate different forms of knowledge, to educate the whole person, and to foster moraland spiritual development. By promoting learning in everything we do, we foster a lifelongpassion for learning. Commitment to Students. As teachers and scholars, mentors and facilitators, we nurture and challenge students as we help them become independent learners and responsible leaders insociety .SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 3 Service to Others. We promote throughout the University a culture of service\u2014service not only to those who study and work at Santa Clara but also to society in general and to its mostdisadvantaged members. Community and Diversity. We cherish our diverse community and the roots that must sustain it: shared values amidst diversity, close personal relationships, effective communica-tion, respect for others, and an engaged concern for the common good of the campus, the local community, and the global society. Jesuit Distinctiveness. We preserve and renew the Jesuit tradition that incorporates all of these core values. Our tradition is an expression of Christian humanism in which faith and reason together animate the most fundamental human quest: the pursuit of truth and good- ness. This pursuit challenges us to counter inhumanity with humanity, to act ethically, andto promote justice with faith. We also take part in the broader Catholic tradition to whichJesuits have made a major contribution.

The Santa Clara undergraduate program is designedfor students who seek an integrated education with a strong humanistic orientation in a primarily residential setting. An integrated education is one that encourages students to seek connections between differing ways of knowing and being in the world, between differentforms of knowledge within established disciplines, and between new knowledge and thatwhich preceded it. Santa Clara 's concept of the \"whole person\" inevitably embraces our social nature. When he inaugurated Santa Clara's sesquicentennial year, Father Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then superior general of the Society of Jesus, noted that \"Tomorrow's 'whole person' cannot bewhole without an educated awareness of society and culture with which to contribute socially, generously, in the real world.\" Calling for a new Jesuit educational standard, \"to educate the whole person of solidarity in the real world,\" he explained: \"Students, in thecourse of their formation, must let the gritty r eality of this world into their liv es, so they can learn to feel it, think about it critically, respond to its suffering, and engage in it construc- tively. They should learn to perceive, think, judge, choose, and act for the rights of others,especially the disadv antaged and the oppressed.\" The S anta Clara undergraduate pr ogram offers a curriculum and other learning experi - ences whose content and pattern combine the acquisition and cr eation of kno wledge with the quest for meaning and purpose. The learning environment encourages students to make connections acr oss the Cor e Curriculum, the academic major, and elective courses. It helps students relate their classroom learning with out-of-classroom learning through community- based education, R esidential Learning Communities, student organizations, athletics and recreation, and other experiences. In a more general way, the undergraduate program nur-tures students' ability to knit the intellectual, social, moral, spiritual, creative, and behavioralaspects of life into a coherent and meaningful whole. Santa Clara U niversity offers undergraduate degr ees leading to the B achelor of Ar ts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Science in Commerce with majors in 51 fields.

THE SANTA CLARA CORE CURRICULUM A university expresses its most basic values in its Core Curriculum, that part of an under- graduate education required of all students. Santa Clara's Core Curriculum explicitly integratesthree traditions of higher education. As a Catholic university, it is rooted in the tradition ofpursuing an understanding of God through the free exercise of reason. As a Jesuit university,it promotes a humanistic education that leads toward an ethical engagement with the world.As a comprehensive American university committed to liberal education, Santa Clara seeksto prepare its students for intelligent, responsible and creative citizenship. Reflecting these traditions, the Core Curriculum provides every undergraduate with the common learning that all students need to become leaders of competence, conscience, andcompassion. The distinctiveness of a Santa Clara education emerges in the Core Curriculum, both in its sense of purpose rooted in the University's traditions and in its commitment to a breadthof learning that complements and suppor ts all majors. The Cor e Curriculum opens students to the study and practice of the ar ts, humanities, mathematics, technology, natural sciences, and social sciences. It educates students for ethically informed participation in civic life. Opportunities for experiential learning foster the development of compassion and attention to the ways human suffering can be alleviated. Reflecting the University's founding mission, the Cor e Curriculum includes a disciplined and critical r eflection on the religious dimensions of human existence. I n addition, because the Cor e Curriculum continually highlights the crit - ical and compelling questions facing individuals and communities, the Core Curriculum supports students both in making professional career choices and in discerning their largervocation\u2014their life 's purpose in the world. Learning G oals: What will students lear n in the Cor e Curriculum? Because a liberal education in the Jesuit tradition is oriented toward particular ends, the Core Curriculum affirms a set of central learning goals. These goals are divided among three broad categories\u2014Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with theWorld. Knowledge To be prepared for well-informed engagement in society, students must comprehend the forces that have shaped the world they have inherited and the ways the world is inter-preted and understood. They must also understand how they might transform the world THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 9 for the better. The Core Curriculum deepens students' knowledge of the ideas and ways of knowing that emerge from the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences. Global Cultures: The intertwined development of global cultures, including Western cultures, ideas, institutions, and religions Arts and Humanities: The production, interpretation, and social influence of the fine and performing arts, history, languages, literatures, philosophy, and religion Scientific Inquiry: The principles of scientific inquiry and how they are applied in the natural and social sciences Science and Technology: The formative influences, dynamics, social impacts, and eth- ical consequences of scientific and technological development Diversity: Diverse human experiences, identities, and cultures within local and global societies, especially as formed by relations of power and privilege Civic Life: The roles, rights, and responsibilities of citizens and institutions in societies and in the world Habits of Mind and Heart To contribute to a rapidly changing, complex, and interdependent world, students must develop ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that allow them to educate themselves for therest of their lives with passion and purpose. By attending to the cognitive and affective di-mensions of human experience, the Cor e Curriculum enables students to think mor e deeply , imagine more freely, and communicate more clearly. Critical Thinking: The ability to identify, reflect upon, evaluate, integrate, and apply different types of information and knowledge to form independent judgments Mathematics and Quantitative Reasoning: Analytical and logical thinking and the habit of drawing conclusions based on quantitativ e information Complexity: An approach to understanding the world that appreciates ambiguity and nuance as well as clarity and precision Ethical Reasoning: Drawing on ethical traditions to assess the consequences of individ- ual and institutional decisions Religious Reflection: Questioning and clarifying beliefs through critical inquiry into faith and the religious dimensions of human existence Communication: Interacting effectively with different audiences, especially through writing, speech, and a second language Engagement with the W orld To engage with the world in meaningful ways, students need opportunities to explore and refine self-knowledge in relation to others. The Core Curriculum enhances students' un- derstanding of the integrity of their o wn liv es and the dignity inher ent in the liv es of others, especially the impo verished, suffering, and marginalized. Perspective: Seeking out the experience of different cultures and people, striving to view the world thr ough their eyes Collaboration: The capacity to collaborate intellectually and creatively with diverse people Social Justice: Developing a disciplined sensibility toward the causes of human suffer- ing and misery, and a sense of responsibility for addressing them Civic Engagement: Addressing major contemporary social issues, including environ- mental sustainability and peaceful resolution of conflict, by participating actively as an informed citizen of society and the world 10 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The Curriculum: What courses will students take in the Core Curriculum? Each course in the Core Curriculum addresses at least three of the learning goals listed above. Students have multiple opportunities to encounter, practice, and master eachlearning goal. In addition, specific learning objectives for each area of the Core Curriculum have been developed by faculty Core Curriculum committees. These learning objectives are associated with particular learning goals and describe the knowledge, skills, and valuesstudents will be able to demonstrate after completing the courses in the Core Curriculum. The learning objectives are posted on the Core Curriculum Web site and published annu- ally in the Core Curriculum Guide. The structure of the Core features two phases of coursework designed to foster develop- mental learning and curricular coherence. The first phase, Foundations, consists of courses normally taken in the first year, introducing students to the processes and expectations foruniversity-level education: Critical Thinking & Writing, Cultures & Ideas, a second lan-guage, mathematics, and the first course in the Religion, Theology & Culture sequence. Thisphase helps students begin to set their own goals for learning, preparing them to makethoughtful choices in the Core Curriculum, their majors, and co-curricular activities. The second phase, Explorations, includes courses that expand students' understanding of a broad range of knowledge and abilities needed for effective participation in contempo-rary life. Each student will take courses in ethics, civic engagement, diversity, arts, social science, natural science, and science, technology & society, and they will take additionalcourses in the C ultures & Ideas and Religion, Theology & Society sequences. Many Explo- rations courses overlap with courses in students' majors. The Core Curriculum also includes Integrations that help students make connections among courses in the Core Curriculum and between the Core Curriculum and their majors. Integrations usually ar e not additional courses. Rather , they ar e components of other courses. One Integrations course includes an experiential learning element oriented toward issues of social justice. O ne course inv olves an adv anced writing component. Students also link a set of Core Curriculum, major, and/or elective courses into an interdisciplinary Pathway. Path-ways foster integrative, intentional learning, providing opportunities for undergraduate research, complementing the majors, and encouraging the application of knowledge in theworld. P athways focus on a wide range of themes including American studies; applied ethics; beauty; childr en, family, and society; democracy; thinking; the digital age; food, hunger, poverty & environment; gender, sexuality & the body; global health; human rightsin a global world; I slamic studies; justice & the ar ts; law & social justice; leading people, organizations & change; paradigm shifts; politics and religion; public policy; race, place & social inequality; sustainability; v alues in science & technology; pr ogress thr ough the str uctur e of the Cor e Curriculum is not strictly sequential, from Foundations through Explorations to Integrations. While some courses, such as Crit- ical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2, Cultures & Ideas 1, 2, and 3, and Religion, Theology &Culture 1, 2, and 3 must be taken in sequence, all students have the opportunity to discoverother sequences that ar e best for their individual undergraduate experience. At the same time, all students engage in course work designed to help them achiev e the shared set of learning objectives for each component of the Core Curriculum. Furthermore, the Experiential Learn-ing for S ocial J ustice, A dvanced Writing, and Pathways components of the Core Curriculum help students experience requirements not only as individual courses but as related educationalactivities that help structure and integrate their entire experience of university study. THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 11 The 2010-11 Core Curriculum Guide provides more detailed information about each component of the Core Curriculum, the learning goals and objectives associated with eachcomponent, and the courses from which students may choose. An online version is avail- able at www.scu.edu/core. The Cor e Curriculum and the College of Arts and Sciences Students in the College of Arts and Sciences should consult Chapter 3 for the require- ments for their majors. There are no additional college-wide requirements beyond the requirements for the University Core Curriculum. The Core Curriculum and the Leavey School of Business Leavey School of Business requirements determine how students in the business school satisfy some University Core Curriculum requirements\u2014some Core Curriculum require- ments must be fulfilled with specific courses. Students in the Leavey School of Businessshould consult Chapter 4 for the complete list of requirements for the majors and the school. The Core Curriculum Guide provides additional information. The Core Curriculum and the School of Engineering Students in the School of E ngineering satisfy their Mathematics requirement with math courses r equired by their majors; their S econd Language r equirement is met b y Santa Clara's entrance requirements. Some sections of Core courses in Arts, Civic Engagement, Social Sci- ence, and Science, Technology & Society will allow engineering students to satisfy two re-quirements with one course, with the understanding that other course work for their majors will complete the acquisition of knowledge and skills required in the Core. Engineering students will complete their Pathways with three courses. Core Curriculum Policies A single course may satisfy only one Core requirement, with the following exceptions: Some students satisfy some r equirements with more than one course, each of which partially completes the r equirement. Those courses ar e identified in Courseav ail as \" xxxPAR\" be - cause they \"partially\" fulfill a requirement. Engineering students may satisfy more than one requirement with one course when the course has been approved for those Core require-ments. All students may satisfy major r equirements with Cor e courses when the courses ar e approved for both the major and the Core. All students may satisfy multiple Integrations requirements with courses that satisfy other Core and major requirements when the coursesare approved for the Integrations requirements as well as for the other Core and major re-quirements. Many courses offered through the study abroad program are pre-approved to fulfill Core Curriculum r equir ements. The second-lev el Cor e Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology, & Culture can be fulfilled with a pre-approved study abroad course. The third- level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology & Culture cannot be fulfilled with a study abr oad course. T ransfer students entering the University in fall 2010 normally follow the Core Curricu- lum described in the 2008-2009 Undergraduate Bulletin. T ransfer students entering the University in fall 2011 or later will follow the Core Curriculum described above. Studentswho transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 as well as the chap-ters relevant to their school or college. T ransfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in the required 12 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate test credit, takeany two Religion, Theology & Culture courses. RESIDENTIAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES The Residential Learning Communities were established to further the goal of foster- ing integrated education within a community of scholars. By creating a culture in whichstudents connect their academic experiences with their social and residential ones, thelearning communities enhance the education of the whole person and deepen the connec-tion between learning and living as responsible members of a community. All entering first-year students, whether or not they live on campus, become members of one of eight theme-based Residential Learning Communities. Nonresident first-year stu-dents are given access to the residence hall in which their learning community is located sothat they can participate fully in its programs. Students take some courses in common withothers in their learning community, which enriches coursework and promotes the forma-tion of study groups. Students also interact directly with faculty and staff and participate intheme-based co-curricular and extracurricular activities both on and off campus. The Res-idential Learning Communities are primarily two-year communities, but some offer theopportunity for students to remain throughout their undergraduate careers. UNIVERSIT Y HONORS PR OGRAM The University Honors Program provides a learning experience appropriate to students of exceptional academic talent and imagination. The pr ogram offers small seminar-style classes, especially in courses fulfilling the University Core Curriculum requirements. Admis- sion to the University Honors Program is by invitation or application and considers thestudent's academic record, standardized test scores, recommendations, and any other infor-mation the student might pr ovide about inter ests, goals, or experiences. The pr ogram is organized as two distinct but related levels open to undergraduate stu- dents from arts and sciences, business, and engineering. Level I of the program accepts first-year students for a curriculum organiz ed around courses that satisfy University Core Curriculum requirements applying to students in every field. The University Honors Pro- gram r equir es that all par ticipants maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or higher , and Lev el I par ticipants must successfully complete a minimum of six pr ogram courses within the first six quarters of enrollment. Most participants complete Level I during their first year. Unless exempted by the director, Level I participants must fulfill spe-cific F oundations courses in the Cor e Curriculum\u2014C ritical Thinking and Writing, Cultures and Ideas, and Religion, Theology, and Culture\u2014through special class sections arranged by the program. Participants are also strongly urged to satisfy Core Curriculum requirements such as mathematics, ethics, social sciences, natural sciences, advanced writ-ing, and advanced religion, theology, and culture with Honors Program sections. Participants in Level I normally continue to Level II, in which they complete a minimum of four additional program courses including a senior thesis or project. Students who havecompleted 32 or more units but not more than 88 units at Santa Clara may apply to enterLevel II by contacting the Honors Program Office. Students joining the program at LevelII complete six program courses including the thesis or senior project. Some Level II courses,while not limited to pr ogram par ticipants, offer academic opportunities especially suitable for them. For both continuing and new participants, the thesis usually grows out of a THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 13 regular or independent study course taken in conjunction with the participant's major or Pathway. Successful completion of the program at Level II becomes part of a student's per-manent record and appears on academic transcripts issued by the University. Honors Program students have the opportunity to participate in the Honors Advisory Council. The University Honors Program is allied with the Office of Student Fellowships,which helps prepare students to compete for nationally competitive graduate fellowships, such as Rhodes, Marshall, Fulbright, Mitchell, Goldwater, Udall, Jack Kent Cooke, and Gates Cambridge. A competitive annual award permits one Honors Program student tospend his or her junior year at Mansfield College, Oxford University. Courses offered through the University Honors Program can be found in Chapter 6 under Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study. LEAD SCHOLARS PROGRAM The LEAD (Leadership, Excellence, and Academic Development) Scholars Program provides, for selected first-generation University students, a smooth transition to life at SantaClara. Participation in the program is by invitation. LEAD scholars are selected from amongthose awarded a grant or scholarship by Santa Clara University. The LEAD Scholars Pro-gram forms a community of undergraduate peers and faculty dedicated to rigorous aca-demic achievement and student leadership. The program involves support as well aschallenge throughout the four years, with a special emphasis on the first-year experience. TheLEAD Scholars Program is committed to fostering an atmosphere of successful scholar-ship, community engagement, and service. Social and academic programs include semi-nars, academic advising and suppor t, peer mentoring, team building, and outr each to families. All LEAD Scholars participate in LEAD Week, which is scheduled for the week immediately preceding the beginning of the fall term. INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS Santa Clara University aspires to create a learning community that promotes competence, conscience, and compassion among students with a mandate to pursue scholarly under-standing and constr uctive engagement with the world. As the principal University-wide or- ganization focusing on international, intercultural, and global subjects, International Programs pr ovides a variety of academic settings and learning opportunities around the world thr ough study abr oad offerings. A cademically the appr oach is both inter disciplinar y and multi-disciplinary and recognizes that learning takes place in the classroom, in the field, in the community, and in service to others. International Programs appreciates that inter-cultural competence and kno wledge of the global envir onment should not be limited to the humanities or social sciences, but is relevant to business, engineering, and the natural sci- ences as well. While International Programs' mission is informed by a variety of disciplinesand viewpoints, it is inspired by the challenge offered by martyred Salvadorian Jesuit Ignacio Ellacuria: We, as an intellectual community, must analyze causes; use imagination and creativity together to discover remedies; com-municate to our public a consciousness that inspires the freedomof self-determination; educate professionals with a conscience,who will be immediate instr uments of tr ansfor mation; and con - tinually hone an educational institution that is academicallyexcellent and ethically oriented. Undergraduate students can choose from a variety of study abroad programs in over 100 locations, including Santa Clara's own programs, several direct exchange programs, anda number of programs affiliated with other universities and study centers. Credits earned from all approved study abroad programs are accepted as degree credit at Santa Clara, and some coursework can fulfill University Core Curriculum, major, and minor requirementssubject to appropriate approval. Courses offered through International Programs can be found in Chapter 6 under Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study. DOMESTIC PUBLIC SECTOR STUDY PROGRAMS The Public Sector Studies Program at Santa Clara University offers an introduction to the areas traditionally known as public policy, public administration, public affairs, andurban planning, and is designed to provide a closer look at the creation, implementation,and analysis of public policies, and the operation of governments and public organizations.The program also provides an excellent foundation for those who would like to pursuegraduate studies in public policy or public administration and an alternative perspective forstudents who wish to pursue public law. Oppor tunities for Firsthand Study Through the Public Sector Studies program in the Department of Political Science, stu- dents have the opportunity to participate in public sector internships, the Washington Se-mester Program, and the Panetta Institute's Congressional Internship program. Theseprograms offer preparation and training for students interested in working at the city, county, state, or federal level of government, in a public agency or nonprofit organization, or con-sidering graduate-level studies in related fields. Internships Perhaps the best way to understand is b y doing\u2014students par ticipating in public sector internships not only see what happens in the \"real world,\" but they are able to take part as well, gaining invaluable experience and knowledge. Placements in public sector internshipshave included the San Jose mayor's office, district offices of members of Congress and theCalifornia Legislature, government relations departments of high-tech corporations, public law offices, political campaigns, and nonpr ofit organizations. Many students end their internships with excellent employment prospects. The Washington Semester Program In the Washington Semester Program, students combine coursework taken at American University with hands-on experience via internships. I n the past, SCU students hav e interned at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI, interest groups, Fox News, various nonpr ofit organizations, and offices of members of the House of Representatives. The Wash- ington Semester Program offers students the opportunity to live, study, and work in our nation's capital for one semester along with other students from throughout the country, as wellas from abroad. Numerous programs of study are available, including American Politics, Public Law, Foreign Policy, International Environment and Development, Economic Policy,Journalism, I nternational B usiness and T rade, Peace and Conflict Resolution, Israel Studies,14 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM and Contemporary Islam. Students participating in the Washington Semester Program earn 22.5-24 quarter credits for one semester of study. Grades and units received at American University will count toward the student's SCU GPA and course requirements for the depart- ment and the University. The P anetta Institute's Congressional Internship Program The Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University\u2014 Monterey Bay, founded by Santa Clara political science alumnus and adjunct faculty mem-ber Leon Panetta, offers an opportunity for students to gain an inside look at the legislativebranch of the U.S. federal government and Washington politics. This Congressional in-ternship begins with a two-week course at California State University\u2014Monterey Bay,where students work directly with seasoned veterans examining the legislative process andits functions. The remaining two and a half months of the internship are spent in Washing-ton, D.C. working on Capital Hill in the office of a member of the California Congressional delegation. One exceptional Santa Clara University student is chosen each year for this fully subsidized internship. Eligibility To be eligible to par ticipate in a P ublic S ector S tudies P rogram, students must have com- pleted at least 88 quarter units of credit by the date that the program of study begins, must not be on academic or disciplinary probation, and must be in good financial standing withthe U niversity. Students must also meet grade point average and other eligibility require- ments for the specific program. For mor e information about the P ublic Sector Studies Program, please visit the Web site or contact the director of the Public Sector Studies Program.THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 15 163 College of Arts and Sciences Dean: W.

Managed through the Liberal Studies Pro-gram, this office also supervises special teaching-related scholarships such as the Noyce schol-arship for futur e teachers of math, science, and technology. ANTHROPOLOGY 19 DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY Professor: George D. Westermark Associate Professors: Luis Calero, S.J., Mary Hegland, Lisa (Department Chair) Assistant Professors: Michelle Bezanson, Gregory S. Gullette The Department of Anthropology offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Anthropology. A solid undergraduate foundation in anthropology secures the analytical skills needed to undertake professional degrees in anthropology, business, law, public health, social services or provides a foundation for embarking on a number of otherprofessional careers. The department also offers a minor, as well as several emphases and an honors thesis option. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling the University Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree, students majoring in anthropology must complete the following depart-mental requirements: ANTH 1, 2, 3 SOCI 1 ANTH 50, or ENVS 50, or POLI 50 ANTH 110, 112, 114, 198Five additional approved upper-division courses in anthropology, including at least one selected from each of the following four groups: biological (ANTH130-139), archaeological (ANTH 140-149), cultural (ANTH150-179), and regional (ANTH 180-189) An introductory statistics course Four anthropology seminars Emphasis Programs in Anthropology Anthropology majors have the option of completing a special emphasis program to com- plement their majors. The emphasis is not a narr ow specialization but reflects competence in subfields of the discipline. Completion of a special emphasis program will be noted on student transcripts with the appr oval of the depar tment chair. The emphasis in applied anthropology prepares students to use anthropological knowl- edge to address pressing human problems in careers outside the University. Through course-work and related internships, students will gain a better understanding of howanthr opological knowledge and skills can be used in occupations related to health and med- icine, international development, environment, government, business, education, immi-gration, and po verty. The emphasis in archaeolog yfocuses on a deeper understanding of the human past and how it is studied. This is a possible course of study for majors with aninterest in employment in cultural resource management or graduate study in archaeology. 20 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 1.

H ernande z Associate Professors: Blake de Maria, Kathleen Maxwell, Andrea Pappas Assistant Professors: Katherine Aoki, Karen Fraser, Don Fritz, Katherine L. Morris The D epartment of Ar t and Ar t History offers a degree program leading to the Bache- lor of Arts in two undergraduate majors, art history and studio art, with courses in both dis- ciplines fostering a thor ough understanding of the histor y and practice of ar t. Department faculty encourages interdisciplinary connections with the Santa Clara com- munity through course offerings that fulfill a wide range of College and University Core Curriculum requirements, as well as courses through the University Honors Program. ART HISTORY The art history major at Santa Clara is distinguished by excellent teaching and men- toring, challenging coursework, and opportunities for study abroad, peer educating, andstudent internships at local and Bay Area institutions. Moreover, we support, in conjunc-tion with our fully accredited campus museum, Explore with Me, a docent-training pro-gram for our students. Advanced art history majors are encouraged to participate in ourannual Ar t History Symposium and the Art History Research Paper Competition. The art 26 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES history major features numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth to understand better the meanings and purposes of the visual arts, including their historic de-velopment, their roles in society, and their relationships to other fields in the humanities. Students learn to think critically and communicate clearly about works of art. The art his- tory major develops the following skills: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, analysisof visual and textual sources, advanced research and writing skills, and sophisticated oral presentations. These intellectual skills enable art history majors to pursue a diversity of in- terests in a wide spectrum of fields and professions, including graduate work in art history. STUDIO ART Studio art majors develop comprehensive skills that help prepare them for graduate study or careers in either the fine or commercial arts. Faculty members emphasize the developmentof conceptual and technical competence, as well as critical analysis of the student's ownwork and that of others. By graduation, every student develops a body of original artwork to be exhibited in a senior show in the department gallery. Students are required to articu- late an artist's statement reflecting their own engagement with the creative process, in con-junction with their senior show. Studio art majors take two sections of Western culture art history and are encouraged to continue with one or mor e courses in 20th-century or contemporary art. The studio sem- inar is highly recommended for all studio art majors and should be taken in the third yearwhen possible. At the end of each year, students are encouraged to submit their work to theAnnual Student Art Exhibit, which is judged by an outside professional in the field of art.The depar tment also oversees merit-based scholarships, which are usually given to outstand- ing students with junior status.

Hess, Justen Whittall The Department of Biology offers a program leading to the Bachelor of Science degree. The major provides students a broad background in biology, while allowing the opportu-nity to explore particular areas of biology in greater depth. The biology major serves as a strong foundation for graduate, medical, or professional studies, as well as for careers in teaching, research, and business. Most courses emphasize laboratory or field work, and stu-dents are also encouraged to work with faculty on research projects. Minor degrees in biol- ogy and related disciplines (biotechnology, biomedical engineering, and environmental studies) are available. The Biology Department also offers courses that satisfy the natural sci-ence requirement of the Core Curriculum, which are available to all University studentswho ar e curious about the natur e of life. The D epartment of B iology also offers courses for majors and nonmajors that satisfy the Science, Technology & Society requirement in the Core Curriculum. Numerous study abroad opportunities in the life sciences, both for bi-ology majors and nonmajors, ar e available through the International Programs office. Stu- dents are encouraged to participate in original research as part of their undergraduate training. M ost faculty members inv olve students in their research programs; opportunities also exist at neighboring institutions. Qualified students can obtain course credit for re- search by enrolling in BIOL 198.

Pfeiffer Associate Professor Emeritus: Michael A. Sweeney Professors: John C. Gilbert (Department Chair), Patrick E. Hoggard (Fletcher Jones Professor), W. Atom Yee Associate Professors: Linda S. Brunauer, Michael R. Carrasco, Brian Professors: Thorsteinn Boothe Steven Suljak, Korin E. Wheeler Senior Lecturer: Steven L. Fedder The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers three baccalaureate degrees: the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, the Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and the Bach-elor of Arts in Chemistry. The curriculum is accredited by the American Chemical Society, the professional organization for chemistry. The program prepares students for further work in chemistry or biochemistry, either in graduate school or as professional chemists. In ad-dition, a chemistry or biochemistry degree is excellent preparation for careers in medicine,dentistr y, law, engineering, business, and teaching. A minor in chemistr y is also av ailable. All Bachelor of Science degrees provide graduates with the background necessary to begin a career in chemistry or biochemistry at industrial and governmental laboratories, foradmission to institutions offering graduate degr ees in chemistr y and biochemistry, and to medical and dental schools as well as other professional programs in the health professions. The chemistr y major pr ovides equal training in all the disciplines in chemistry, and the bio- chemistry major combines training in chemistry with additional coursework in cell and molecular biology. The Bachelor of Science-ACS certified degrees meet all recommendedstandards for chemists and biochemists as mandated by the American Chemical Society. The B achelor of Ar ts degr ee allo ws students the most freedom in choosing electives, and therefore is an excellent program for pre-medical or pre-teaching students. Students with a strong interest in the liberal arts or who wish to pursue subjects outside the standard sciencecurriculum will benefit from this degree. The Bachelor of Arts degree can be effectivelycombined with a pre-law or business curriculum to provide excellent preparation for law orbusiness car eers in the technology sector. Undergraduate r esearch is a critical component of our degr ees and most of our majors conduct r esearch in collaboration with faculty mentors. Research in the department has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund, the D reyfus F oundation, and the R esearch Corporation. M ajors in chemistr y, bio- chemistry, biology, and public health science participate in faculty research projects through CHEM 182, 183, and 184. In addition, advanced students have opportunities for part-timeemplo yment assisting faculty in laborator y and r elated teaching activities. The chemistr y and biochemistry curricula are designed to be flexible in the sequence of upper-division coursework so as to allow students to participate in study-abroad programs.Students interested in study abroad should meet with a faculty advisor to plan the juniorand senior y ear courses as early as possible in their academic careers. 48 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling University Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degrees, students majoring in chemistry and biochemistry mustcomplete the following departmental requirements for each degree option: Bachelor of Science in Chemistry CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 102, 111, 141, 151, 152, 154 Three upper-division chemistry electives Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 31, 32, 33 or PHYS 11, 12, 13 Bachelor of Science in Chemistry - ACS Certified CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 102, 111, 141, 150, 151, 152, 154 CHEM 183, 184 T wo upper-division chemistry electives Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 31, 32, 33 Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 101, 111, 141, 142, 143, 150, 151 or 152 T wo additional upper-division chemistry electives; BIOL 110, 113, 174, or 176 may be taken to satisfy one of these two electives Four quarters of CHEM 115MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 31, 32, 33 or PHYS 11, 12, 13 BIOL 21, 24, 25, 175 Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry - ACS Certified CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 101, 111, 141, 142, 143, 150, 151 or 152, 154CHEM 183, 184 T wo additional upper-division chemistry electives; BIOL 110, 113, 174, or 176 may be taken to satisfy one of these two electiv es Four quarters of CHEM 115 CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY 49 Note: N o course offer ed by the D epartment of Chemistr y and B iochemistry is subject to challenge, i.e., to fulfillment b y a special examination. 1.

Heath (Department Chair) Associate Professors: Scott LaBarge, Michael McCarthy, S.J., Helen E. Moritz Assistant Professor: Daniel W. T urkeltaub Senior Lecturer: John R. Dunlap Classics in the broad sense is the study of all aspects of the life and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. The Department of Classics offers courses that explore the most impor- tant areas of these ancient civilizations and their Mediterranean context: language (ancient Greek and Latin), literature, history, philosophy, mythology, religion, and art. Most courses in the department are open to any interested student. Classics courses, such as Mythology, Classical T ragedy, Ancient Greek Religion, and Women in Antiquity, require no knowledge of an ancient language. Latin or Greek may be taken to satisfy the secondarylanguage requirement. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the field, classics provides an ideal liberal arts curriculum that is an excellent background for careers in many areas. Majors and minors are available in several programs in the Department of Classics: an- cient studies, classical studies, and classical languages and literatures (Latin or Greek). Thereis a major , but no minor , in Latin and G reek. B ecause course offerings in any one term ar e limited, students wishing a classics major are encouraged to plan their curriculum in con- sultation with a faculty advisor at the earliest possible date. Students may fulfill their for eign language Core Curriculum requirement by success- fully completing a proficiency examination in Latin or Greek at the level required for their program of study . Contact the department chair to make arrangements.

McAnany, Paul A. S.J., Sunwolf Associate Professors: Laura Ellingson, Stephen C. Lee, Yahia Mahamdi, Charles H. Raphael (Department , Michael Professors: Hsin-I Cheng, Rohit Professor: Justin P . Boren Senior Lecturer: Barbara Kelley The D epartment of Communication offers a pr ogram of studies leading to a B achelor of Arts in Communication. The major prepares students for various graduate and profes- sional studies and for careers in the communication industry. An academic minor also isavailable. Communication majors focus on the communication pr ocess in interpersonal, mass media, and computer-based contexts. They explore the theory, research methodolo- gies, r esponsibilities, institutional structures, and effects of mass and interpersonal commu- nication. The department gives special consideration to new and developing communicationtechnologies. The major also integrates theory with practice. It allows students to apply their knowl- edge of the communication process to the study and creation of communication products(speeches, television pr ograms, ne wspaper stories, Web sites, etc.). Particular attention is given to dev eloping students' concerns for ethics and the common good. COMMUNICATION 61 Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts education, students work closely with a department faculty advisor to plan a cohesive academic pro-gram that combines courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often students complete a minor or take a number of courses in related dis- ciplines, such as marketing, theatre arts, psychology, or political science. The communication curriculum provides nonmajors with the opportunity to acquire a critical understanding of the communication process and contemporary media, to improve oral and written skills, and to heighten visual awareness. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student-run campus media. Spe- cial credit practica for such work may be included in the student's academic program. All junior and senior students are encouraged to complete an internship at an off-campus mediaorganization or other communication-related institution. The department maintains a listof potential internships that may be completed for credit as COMM 198. The Department of Communication will accept no more than two study abroad courses (lower-division, upper-division, or a combination) toward completion of the communica-tion course requirements. Courses taken abroad will be accepted on a case-by-case basis ascompleting specific communication lower-division requirements. Upper-division coursestaken abroad will be accepted only as communication upper-division elective credit. Coursestaken abroad will not be accepted as completing the required List A, List B, research meth-ods, or thesis/capstone requirements. Whenever possible the chair of the department willdetermine equivalency credit based upon the course description in the literature from theforeign university. Study abroad programs run by Santa Clara may fulfill some communi-cation r equirements subject to appr oval by the chair of the department. One of the oldest forensic programs in continuous operation on the West Coast, Santa Clara Debate provides a challenging and rigorous co-curricular activity designed to developpublic speaking skills, critical thinking, and public policy analysis. The program is open to all majors and y ears regardless of pr evious speech or debate experience. The schedule offers national lev el competition in both policy team debate and in parliamentar y team debate along with numerous on-campus activities related to competitive speech, including hosting high school invitationals. S tudents may r eceive academic credit, and policy debate partici- pants are eligible to apply for merit scholarships.

Mitchener (Robert and Susan Finocchio Professor), Helen Popper, Professor: Homa Zarghamee Acting Assistant Professor: Arunima Sinha As one of the social sciences, economics studies how the choices we make as individu- als\u2014as consumers and producers, as savers and investors, as managers and employees, as cit-izens and voters\u2014combine to determine how society uses its scarce resources to produce and distribute goods and services. This practical, useful discipline provides insights into impor- tant issues such as the determinants of wealth and poverty; unemployment, inflation, inter-national trade, and economic growth; and success and failure in the marketplace. Therigorous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the pub- lic sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Eco-nomics graduates pursue v aried car eers in business, law, banking and finance, government service, education, and private consulting.

The companion major in environmental studies is offered as a second-ary major; students majoring in envir onmental studies also must complete the r equirements for a primar y major . The envir onmental studies major wor ks well with a wide v ariety of pri - mary majors, including anthropology, communication, political science, and economics. A minor in environmental studies and a special version of the environmental studies minorfor engineering majors also ar e available. Both the envir onmental studies and envir onmen - tal science programs provide students with the intellectual and ethical foundations they will need in addr essing crucial environmental challenges of the 21st century: e.g., human pop- ulation growth, urban sprawl, deforestation, global climate change, waste disposal, the needfor renewable energy, air and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Environmental studies programs are enriched by colloquia, including bi-weekly seminars, featuring presentations on environmental subjects by journalists, politicians, business people, scientists, and other scholars. M ajors in envir onmental science and envir onmentalENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 89 studies are expected to apply their knowledge outside the classroom by completing an approved internship or research experience, culminating in ENVS 198 Environmental Proseminar. Environmental studies students are encouraged to study abroad in programs approved by the department. Courses such as Natural History of Baja include one week of immer-sion travel during University breaks. Environmental studies faculty occasionally offer summer courses in Costa Rica or in T rinidad and Tobago.

Hayes The Ethnic Studies Program provides a critical analysis of historical and contemporary formations of race, ethnicity, class, and gender. In the pursuit of social justice, it challenges dominant views of racial and ethnic groups that lead to inequalities. Ethnic studies focuseson the roles and experiences of African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islander Americans, Lati- nas/Latinos, Native Americans, and other people of color within the framework of the United States and within transnational frameworks. As an academic program, ethnic studies fosters interdisciplinary inquiry. The faculty comprise a community of scholars of critical race and ethnic studies, while serving as teach- ers, mentors, and role models for undergraduate students. Ethnic studies strives to make con-nections between University learning, racial and ethnic communities, and social change and encourages a reflective engagement with society and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. The Ethnic Studies Program serves as a resource for students,faculty, and staff across the University who are interested in issues of race and ethnicity. Theprogram offers both a minor and a companion major in ethnic studies: a student must de - clare a primary major in another discipline as well as companion major in ethnic studies. The companion major is designed to complement a student's primary major by broaden-ing the field of study to include an academic focus on race/ethnicity . It enhances a student's employment opportunities in business, education, law, medicine, social work, and govern- ment.

(1-5 units) DEPARTMENT OF MODERN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Professors: Rose Marie Beebe, Francisco Jim\u00e9nez (Fay Boyle Professor), Catherine R. M ontfor t (Department Chair), Victor B. Vari (Harold and E dythe Toso Lecturers: Elsa Li, Lucia Varona The D epartment of Modern Languages and Literatures offers courses in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as degree programs leading to theBachelor of Arts in French and Francophone Studies, German Studies, Italian Studies, orSpanish Studies. Honors programs are available for French and German majors. In addition,the department offers minors in French and Francophone studies, German studies, Italianstudies, Japanese studies, and Spanish studies. The courses are designed to help studentsachieve proficiency in both the oral and written language and to provide them with an understanding of the experiences, v alues, and traditions of those peoples whose languagesMODERN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES 131 are studied. Courses range from beginning language to linguistics, from an introduction to literary texts to advanced courses in literature and culture. All courses are open to any stu-dent with the requisite preparation. A few courses in literature and culture offered by the department are taught in English and are open to all students. Some of these courses may be used as credit toward a major orminor in French and Francophone studies, a major or minor in German studies, or a minor in Japanese studies. However, these courses in English will not fulfill the University Core Curriculum foreign language requirement. Students may fulfill their second language CoreCurriculum requirement by successfully completing a proficiency examination in a mod-ern foreign language at the level for their program of study. Students who have never studied the language in which they wish to enroll, or who have studied that language for one year in high school, should register for Language 1. Those whowish to continue in a language that they have studied for two years in high school shouldenter Language 2. Students with three or more years of study in a single language, those whowish to continue language study beyond the second language requirement, or those who feelfollowing the formula would place them in a higher or lower level course than their back-ground warrants should consult a member of the appropriate language faculty for placementadvice. Students having the necessary proficiency, as demonstrated by an interview with amember of the language faculty , may enroll in higher-numbered courses than those of the placement formula. O nce pr oficiency has been established, lo wer-division students may en - roll in upper-division courses with the permission of the instructor. Such courses will be counted as fulfilling major or minor requirements. Courses number ed 1 thr ough 102 ar e not open to challenge; for courses numbered above 102, consult the individual listing. For more information about placement and/or proficiency, please visit the department's Web site. Study abroad is a valuable enhancementof the undergraduate experience and is particularly recommended for students pursuing amajor or minor in a foreign language. Both the Office of International Programs and thestudent's foreign language advisor should be consulted to ensure appropriate integration ofthe wor k done abr oad into the student 's program of study.

Felt, S.J. Professors: Philip J. Kain (Department Chair), Michael Meyer, William J. Prior Associate Professors: Christopher B. Kulp, Scott LaBarge, Lawrence Nelson, William A. Parent, Mark A. Ravizza, S.J. Assistant Professor: Shannon Vallor The Department of Philosophy offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. Philosophy inquires directly into the relation of human beings to the world: what we are, how we know, what values are, how we live. Worth pursuing for its own sake,philosophical inquiry also promotes analytical thinking and precise expression and, thus, is excellent undergraduate preparation for a number of professional careers, such as law, gov- ernment, writing, social work, and computer programming. To qualify for honors in phi-losophy, the major ordinarily must have a 3.5 grade point average in philosophy courses and complete PHIL 197 with a grade of A- or better. REQ UIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling U niversity Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degr ee, students majoring in philosophy must complete the follo wing depar tmental requirements: 2-10, 11A, 12A, 60-89 PHIL 25 or 27, 50, 51, 52, 53 T wo courses from different historical periods: PHIL 131 (ancient), PHIL 132 (Medieval), PHIL 133 (modern), and PHIL 135, 136, 137, 139 (contemporary), or PHIL 134, 139 One course fr om PHIL 120-129 One course from PHIL 125 or 140-149 Four additional upper-division courses from PHIL 109-199 Emphasis in Pre-Law The pre-law emphasis in philosophy is intended to provide the skills of analytic reason- ing and conceptual investigation necessary for law. Philosophical research hones the tech-niques of careful argumentation and logically disciplined reasoning essential to the legalanalysis of cases and statutes. Also, emphasis on ethics courses will help pr epare students for the study and analysis of normative issues. The pre-law emphasis may be taken as part of a philosophy major or minor. Requirements for the pre-law emphasis include: One course from PHIL 25, 27, 29, or 152 One course from PHIL 111, 113, or 154 One course from PHIL 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 80, 109, 110, 112, 115, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 129, 136, or 142 Two additional courses fr om those in the three lists above PHILOSOPHY 159 Emphasis in Ethics The ethics emphasis in philosophy is intended to provide students with a broad under- standing of ethical theory and the conceptual analysis of moral problems, including mat-ters of social justice central to the Jesuit educational mission, and thus with the ability toreflect on their own ethical decisions and on their role as morally responsible members ofthe human community. The ethics emphasis may be taken as part of the philosophy majoror minor. Requirements for the ethics emphasis include: One lower-division ethics class from PHIL 2-10 T wo ethical theory courses from PHIL 120-129T wo courses from the following: PHIL 109-119, PHIL 154.

Professors: Richard P . Barber Jr., Betty A. Young Associate Professors: John T. Birmingham (Department Chair), Philip R. Kesten Assistant Professors: Guy Ramon, Christopher P . Weber The Department of Physics offers major programs of lecture and laboratory instruction leading to the Bachelor of Science in Physics and the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics. The department also provides an academic minor in physics and required and elec- tive courses for students majoring in other fields. The usual career goal of a physics major is professional scientific employment in indus- try or government, by a university, or in a secondary school teaching physical science. The undergraduate major program in physics is appropriate preparation for graduate study inphysics, astronomy and astrophysics, biophysics, environmental science, geological science and geophysics, medical physics and medicine, patent law, oceanography, and other fields. The engineering physics major is particularly appropriate for the applied science stu- dent who intends to do research and development and/or attend graduate school in physics,applied physics, or v arious engineering disciplines. The engineering physics major co vers a broad spectrum of courses in mathematics, engineering, and physics. This program em- phasizes, to a greater extent than the traditional engineering major, the physics fundamen-tals that ar e applicable to ne w technologies as well as to the more established ones. Research in the department currently is funded by the National Science Foundation, NASA, R esearch Corporation, and the Department of Energy. Majors in physics, engineer- ing, and engineering physics participate in faculty research projects through PHYS 198 (Undergraduate Physics Research).

Recommended courses for complet-ing the three emphasis options are available on the department's Web site. Emphasis in Public Sector Studies The public sector emphasis is a specialized area of concentration within the political sci- ence major allo wing students to focus their course work toward public sector studies. The emphasis is designed to provide a closer look at the creation, implementation, and analysis of public policies, and the operation of governments and public organizations. The public sec-tor emphasis provides an excellent foundation for those who would like to pursue careers or graduate studies in public policy, public administration, public affairs, urban planning, and law. Requirements for the public sector emphasis include a variety of courses both inside andoutside of the political science depar tment.

Stephens The Public Health Program in the College of Arts and Sciences offers the Bachelor of Science degree in Public Health Science. The program also offers a minor degree in public health, and manages the Global Health Pathway of the University Core. The public health science (PHS) major is an interdisciplinary degree providing students with a strong scientific foundation in biology and chemistry, in order to understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease. The PHS major further addresses the complex influences of environmental and social factors on human health through relevantcoursework in the social sciences and humanities. Courses for the major are drawn from nu- merous departments, but are connected through required and elective public health courses. Through the senior capstone and a mandatory internship, PHS majors engage in health-focused service and research projects integrating learning across disciplines and apply their education to real world public health problems. Students are encouraged to study abroad if possible, to gain perspective on global health issues. Because new, relevant courses are con-tinually being developed at Santa Clara and partner institutions abroad, students are encour-aged to petition the dir ector of the P ublic H ealth P rogram for consideration of courses not on the elective list shown here. Public health science majors will be well prepared for careers, graduate education, or professional training in health-r elated professions, including medicine and nursing. There are many professional options in the field of public health, including healthcare adminis- tration, planning, and public policy; epidemiology and disease sur veillance; clinical research and clinical trials management; health-related education and social work; health and science communication; and basic research. Students intending to pursue a medical degree, or post-graduate training in other health- related pr ofessions, should contact the U niversity pre-health advisor to discuss prerequisites for admission to such programs. Many require a full year of physics coursework (e.g. PHYS 11-13 or 31-33) and completion of the organic chemistry series (CHEM 33).

Hill Senior Lecturers: Derek Duarte, Kristin Kusanovich, David Sword The D epartment of Theatr e and D ance celebrates cr eativity of the human spirit, offer- ing a well-rounded education leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theatre Arts with an emphasis in either theatre or dance. This study involves both academic disciplines and cre-ative processes. These include practice and analysis of skills required in the performing arts; critical evaluation of literature, history, and theory of drama and dance; collaboration in production and public pr esentation of per formance.

Theatre and dance are distinct but related areas of emphasis. While each has its own set of requirements, students in either emphasis share common courses. Through lectures, stu-dio courses, labs, and pr oductions, students wor k closely with faculty and staff mentors. The theatre program offers coordinated courses in acting, design, technical production, di-recting, dramatic literature, and theatre history. Students within the theatre emphasis willhave a well-rounded foundation but may focus their study on any of the above areas.

COMPUTER ENGINEERING 287 COMBINED BACHELOR OF SCIENCE AND MASTER OF SCIENCE PROGRAM The Department of Computer Engineering offers a combined degree program leading to the Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science open to students pursuing an undergrad- uate degree at Santa Clara in Computer Science and Engineering, Web Design and Engi- neering, or Computer Science. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduatestudent begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the require- ments for the bachelor's degree and typically completes the requirements for a Master of Sci- ence within a year of obtaining the bachelor's degree. Undergraduate students admitted to the program may begin taking graduate courses no earlier than the fall term of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the standard undergraduate degree requirements. To earnthe master's degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including thecompletion of 45 units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree. Completion of 12 or more units of courses in computer science and engi-neering taken for the master's degree satisfies the Educational Enrichment requirement ofthe undergraduate program. Some courses required in the master's degree programs may bereplaced by free electives due to similar undergraduate coursework.

Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for the bachelor's degreeand typically completes the requirements for a Master of Science in Electrical Engineeringwithin a year of obtaining the bachelor's degree. Undergraduate students admitted to the combined degree program are required to en- roll in the program between February of their junior year and December of their senioryear. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the standardundergraduate degree requirements. To earn the master's degree, students must fulfill all therequirements for the degree, including the completion of 45 units of coursework beyondthat applied to their bachelor's degree. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree. Completion of 10 or more units of coursework in electrical engineeringtaken for the master's degree satisfies the Professional Development requirement of the un-dergraduate pr ogram. The pr ogram of studies for the master 's degree may include up to 20 units of elective coursework from ELEN 112, 116, 117, 118, 127, 130, 133, 134, 141, 143, 144, 152, 153, 156, 160, 161, 162, 164, 200, and above. These undergraduate unitscan count toward a master's degree only if a grade of B or better is earned. Students who donot complete the combined degree program within six years of entering the University willautomatically be transferr ed to the regular master's degree program. Although six years is the maximal timeframe for completing the combined degr ee, full-time students enr olling in February of their junior year normally complete both degrees within five years.

For many business majors, broad business theories will develop deeper meaning as they are applied specifically to the retail industry. The innova-tions in Internet retailing and supply chain management provide great opportunities for OMIS majors and students interested in computer science. Retailing is at the forefront of trends in current culture and communication patterns. This provides a fertile ground for artsand science students to leverage their unique background. One of the most v aluable and unique aspects of the r etail studies minor is par ticipation in an internship during the summer after the junior year. This immersion experience gives students insight into the retail industry and potential careers that are available. Students ac-quire experience thr ough a full-time, 10-week paid or nonpaid internship at internationally recognized retailers such as the Gap, Gymboree, Williams-Sonoma, DFS Stores, and Nord- strom. A wide v ariety of internships meet diverse student interests and needs. The minor is composed of a set of core courses and either a multi-channel or Internet retailing option based on the interests of the individual student. The core courses include amulti-channel retailing class in the spring quarter of their junior year and a two-quarter ad-vanced r etail seminar in the fall and winter quar ters of their senior y ear. The core classes cover topics such as branding, product development, merchandise management, negotiation, store operations, team building, information systems, supply chain management, e-com-merce, and pricing and promotion analysis. Nonbusiness majors are encouraged to apply for admission to the program during their freshman or sophomore year to allow time to integrate their course of study in retailing with the r equirements in their major field. B usiness students who hav e completed the lo wer- division r equirements can enter the program as late as their junior year. The number of stu- dents admitted into the minor may be restricted in some years by the number of qualified internships av ailable.

The urban education minor has two distinctive components. First, the minor contains foundational courses nec-essary for a career in education. Second, the minor focuses on societal problems, such aspoverty, crime, and pr ejudice, and ho w these issues impact today's youth and families. Through the urban education minor, students will critically evaluate the modern social challenges facing teachers and policy makers who struggle daily with how to strengthen theeducational experience for childr en. This minor is recommended for students from di- verse majors who are interested in careers that involve working directly with children and families fr om multicultural and multifaceted backgr ounds.

Shoup International Programs offers minors in international studies and international business and coordinates study abroad and experiential learning opportunities for undergraduate students. MINOR IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Interim Executive Director: Terry E. Shoup The minor in international studies is designed for students who wish to concentrate course work beyond their majors on selected nations, regions, or topics of international sig- nificance. Students can choose between an area studies emphasis with a focus on Africa,Europe, or Latin America or a thematic emphasis with a focus on a topic, such as povertyand dev elopment, international human rights, or peace studies. The area studies emphasis on Africa offers an introduction to the cultures, languages, pol- itics, and global challenges facing the continent of Africa and its people spread across theplanet thr ough colonialism, slav ery, and globalization. The area studies emphasis on Eu- rope offers an inter disciplinar y intr oduction to the cultur es, languages, politics, and global challenges facing the continent. The area studies emphasis on Latin America offers an in- terdisciplinary introduction to the cultures, languages, politics, and global challenges facingthe region. The thematic emphasis offers students the opportunity to examine broad international issues that transcend a single nation or geographic area. Subjects such as international or-ganization, poverty and development, cultural interdependence, diplomacy and law are bytheir very nature international. Such subjects require systematic approaches distinct fromthe examination of single-nation or area studies. Students develop their own themes andpresent a detailed pr oposal to the I nternational S tudies Committee for appr oval usually no later than the first quarter of their junior year. Students planning an off-campus program for their junior year should obtain this approval prior to their departure.

Fedder Santa Clara University has an excellent reputation for preparing students for careers in the health sciences. Most incoming students tend to be focused on either allopathic medi-cine or dentistry, but a much broader spectrum of careers can be equally or more attractive,including osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physician assistant,nurse practitioner , public health pr ofessional, and others. A S anta Clara education pr ovides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by med- ical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the commu-nication, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school andin one 's subsequent medical practice. Although S anta Clara does not hav e a pre-med major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. Most medical schools require: One year of general chemistry (CHEM 11, 12, and 13) One year of organic chemistry (CHEM 31, 32, and 33)One year of biology (BIOL 21, 24, and 25) One year of physics (PHYS 11, 12, and 13 or PHYS 31, 32, and 33) One year of mathematics, typically calculus (MATH 11 and 12) and a statistics course INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 349 engagement in the face of international ter- rorism.

Topic selected in consultation withthe department chair. Issues of diversity inthe military will be embedded in the topic. Prerequisite: Approval of the department chair. (3 units)In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses, often but not exclusively in biochemistry, genetics,and human physiology, that are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The choice of academic major is much less important than completing the coursework above; however, many pre-health students select a natural science major like bi-ology, biochemistry, chemistry, or public health science. Students should consult the pre- health Web site, and should maintain regular contact with the pre-health sciences advisor throughout the undergraduate years for assistance with adjustment to college academic rigorand social life; an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; assistance with the balance between academics, social life, work, health community volunteering, and internships; and assistance with the relevant entrance examinations and application to grad-uate health science programs. PRE-L AW Advisors: Larry Nelson, Terri Peretti Santa Clara University provides a wide range of opportunities for undergraduates inter- ested in attending law school to build a strong pre-law foundation. Early in their undergrad-uate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but alsowith one of the designated pre-law advisors to formulate a program designed for their spe-cific needs and career goals. There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify forlaw school admission. S uccessful law school applicants come fr om majors as div erse as an - thropology, philosophy, communication, political science, physics, English, history, biol- ogy, and economics. Law school admissions officers recommend undergraduate preparationin a major that demands discipline, analytical ability, research skills, and precision in writ-ten and oral wor k. The depar tments of Anthr opology , Philosophy , and Political Science offer a pr e-law or a law and society emphasis within the major. Elective courses also provide valuable training and breadth of academic and analytical experience. Some elective coursesstrengthen specific abilities, while others pr ovide perspective on legal issues and topics.

Elder Law PRE-TEACHING Director: Carol Ann G ittens Santa Clara University is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Creden- tialing to offer pr ofessional pr eparation for pr ospectiv e elementar y school, middle school, and senior high school teachers. The Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offers graduate programs for the multiple-subject credential forelementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades, both with a cross-cultural language and academic development emphasis. The preliminary teaching creden-tial can be initiated during the four-y ear undergraduate program through the undergraduate Accelerated Teaching C redential P rogram or during a fifth y ear of graduate study. Students interested in teaching should consider completing a minor in urban education offered through the Liberal Studies Program. The Eastside F uture Teachers Project is a program developed to attract Eastside Union High School District high school students into the teaching profession. This program was established in order to increase the number of underrepresented students who choose teach-ing as a career. Six students are chosen each year to join the program, which provides spe-cial mentoring, coursework, and practical experience related to teaching as well as scholarshipassistance during their undergraduate and fifth-y ear cr edential programs.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 351 Preparation for Multiple-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in elementary school teaching should fulfill the require- ments of the liberal studies major in the College of Arts and Sciences. Those requirementscan be found in Chapter 3, College of Arts and Sciences. Students must demonstrate the subject matter competency component for the multiple-subject credential by passing the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET) for Multiple Subjects. While studentsmay sit for the examination whether or not they majored in liberal studies, both the exam- ination and the liberal studies degree requirements are closely aligned with the state of Cal- ifornia's elementary curriculum framework. Therefore, Santa Clara strongly recommendsthat students interested in being elementary school teachers major in liberal studies. An un- dergraduate minor in urban education is also recommended. Students must also demon- strate basic educational skills by completing the Writing Skills exam that can be added tothe CSET or by passing the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). Preparation for Single-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in secondary school teaching in a particular subject matter area should fulfill the requirements of the academic major of their intended teach-ing specialization. California teaching cr edentials ar e available in the following subject areas: agriculture, art, business, English, health science, home economics, industrial and technol- ogy education, mathematics, modern languages, music, physical education, science, andsocial science. Those requirements can be found in each department in Chapter 3, Collegeof Arts and Sciences and Chapter 4, Leav ey School of B usiness. S tudents must demonstrate specific subject matter competency by passing the California Subject Matter Examination for Teachers (CSET) in the subject area they desire to teach. An undergraduate minor inurban education is also recommended. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills by passing the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). Requir ements for M ultiple-S ubject and S ingle-Subject Credentials The minimum requirements for the multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential include: A bachelor's degree in a subject area from an accredited institution Demonstrated knowledge of the United States Constitution by completion of undergraduate coursework or passage of an approved examination Demonstrated basic educational skills (see sections above for specific program requirements) Completion of an appr oved program of professional education, including field experience achiev ed thr ough student teaching or internship Completion of a state-approved subject matter preparation program or passage of the California S ubject Examination for Teachers, a subject-area competency examination, in the area one plans to teach For multiple-subject only: D emonstrated knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading by passing the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA) examination352 INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY Accelerated Teaching Credential Program The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential program can be pursued at Santa Clara in conjunction with the student's undergraduate program. Undergraduate pre-teaching students can apply to either the multiple-subject or single-subject credential program in education during the winter of their junior year. Upon acceptance, students in the accel- erated credential program are eligible to begin the credential coursework during the summerbetween their junior and senior years. The curriculum of the undergraduate Accelerated Teaching Credential Program is identical to the curriculum of the graduate program. Under- graduates are able to take University-based credential coursework prior to the completion ofthe baccalaureate degree, but must complete the bachelor's degree before initiating their field- based directed teaching. In addition to the bachelor's degree, students must demonstrate basic educational skills via the California Basic Educational Skills Test or the CSET WritingSkills Exam (option available to multiple-subject candidates only) and demonstrate subjectmatter competency via the California Subject Examination for Teachers or completion of anapproved subject matter preparation program before beginning the directed teaching portionof the credential. Any 200 or 300 upper-division level courses taken for the credential are notcounted toward the student's undergraduate degree unit requirement. Selected California state credential coursework may be waived by successful completion of specific undergraduate courses: A course in community health education by EDUC 70 A course in teaching childr en with ex ceptional needs in the r egular classr oom by EDUC 138 A course in educational policy, social foundations of education, and applied internship b y EDUC 198 A course in the psychological foundations of education by PSYC 134 Coursework on the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution by POLI 1 or HIST 96A Fifth-Year Teaching Credential Program The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching cr edential pr ogram can be completed as a fifth year of study following the bachelor's degree and qualifies the student for a prelimi- nary teaching credential. This 50-quarter-unit program includes graduate coursework ineducational foundations, curriculum design, teaching methods, and super vised student teaching. A field experience internship option may be completed in lieu of a regular two- quarter student teaching assignment. The selection of teacher cr edential candidates for in - ternships is conducted by the participating school districts in collaboration with the University. Students admitted to a credential program may choose the two-summer cre-dential option to do their primary coursework in conjunction with the field experience in-ternship option. Students interested in fulfilling the field experience requirement throughthe internship option should seek academic advising during the senior year to learn aboutcourse prerequisites. INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 353 3547 Admission of Undergraduate Students Santa Clara University is a selective admission university that admits new students based on potential for academic performance and contribution to the campus community con- sistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Applicants are admitted as full- time, degree-seeking students. Santa Clara does not have a part-time undergraduate programoption and does not enroll non-degree students except under the limited conditions out- lined in Chapter 8, Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations. Entering freshmen and transfer students are admitted for fall and winter terms. Students are admitted for spring term only by special exception with the approval of the dean of ad- mission. Entering freshmen are admitted to the University and to a specific school based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schoolsmay apply for a transfer at the end of their first year of attendance. ADMISSION OF ENTERING FRESHMEN Admission of applicants to Santa Clara University as entering freshmen is based on their academic r ecord in high school including course rigor , results on standar dized tests, and other criteria outlined below. While Santa Clara University does not have a specific high school grade point or standardized test score requirement, potential for successful academicperformance in the rigorous undergraduate program at Santa Clara is highly correlated with academic performance in high school in challenging courses and the results on standardized tests. S anta Clara also bases admission on demonstrated potential for contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Applications for admission as an entering freshman are evaluated using the following criteria: Overall quality of high school courses and appropriately challenging coursework Academic performance in high school, including the cumulative grade point average from the first year of high school through the junior year of high school(grades fr om the first term of the senior y ear may also be included) Results of standardized tests (SAT I or ACT) Letter of recommendation Involvement in school and community activities The basic subject requirements for admission as an entering freshman include: History and Social Science: 3 years English: 4 y ears Mathematics: 3 years required; 4 years recommended Laboratory Science: 2 years required; 3 years recommended Language Other Than English: 2 years required; 3 years recommended; 4 years preferred Visual and Performing Arts: 1 year recommended College Preparatory Electives: 1 year Admission to freshman standing at Santa Clara depends on a continued high level of per- formance during the remainder of the applicant's senior year in high school and upon re- ceipt of a high school diploma.

Students wishing to change schools must meet the admit-tance criteria of the school and complete the application process specified by that school.Upon acceptance by the school, the student must submit a completed Program PetitionForm to the Drahmann Center. Repetition of Courses Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than \"C-.\" In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the cal-culation of the student's grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation onlyonce for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and performancecourses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful com-pletion. S tudents should consult the chair of the depar tment in which the course is offer ed to confirm that a given course may be repeated for credit. Independent Study Students may pursue independent study thr ough dir ected reading, directed research, in- ternships, practica, or cooperative education. To qualify, a student must have demonstrated a sufficient kno wledge of the academic discipline inv olved to make independent study both possible and beneficial. No more than 20 units of independent study may be used to sat- isfy graduation requirements, and no more than 5 units of independent study may be takenper term. Students must enroll for the term in which the independent study occurs. Directed r eading and dir ected r esearch are limited to upper-division students who un- dertake a research project or other well-defined study beyond the scope of a regular course under the supervision of a faculty member. Such work should be comparable to that requiredfor courses of equiv alent unit value. Students can obtain practical learning experience through internships, cooperative edu- cation, and practica. I nternships and cooperativ e education are approved work experiences in a non-classroom environment in industry, government, or other setting, generally avail- able only to upper-division students. S tudents who enr oll in an internship or cooperativ e education experience for academic credit must fulfill specified academic requirements inaddition to the responsibilities expected by the organization hosting the internship or co-operative education experience. Practica provide practical experience in a discipline-specificfield experience or an approved University program activity, such as participation on theschool newspaper.

Challenging Courses Students may challenge certain courses to satisfy specific subject requirements for grad- uation. A student may petition to challenge any course listed in the Undergraduate Bulletinexcept those involving laboratory, studio, or specialized group work and those whose descrip-tions in the catalog are followed by the letters NCX. No more than one course may be chal-lenged each term. Although course requirements may be fulfilled by challenging a course,a successful challenge neither earns units toward the total needed for graduation nor con-tributes to the fulfillment of the residency requirements. In order to be eligible to challenge a course, a student must have completed at least one term at Santa Clara, have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3, and receive per-mission of the faculty member and the chair of the department in which the course is of-fered. Only currently enrolled students are eligible to challenge a course.

The student is returning within five years of the date of their withdrawal. Students who do not meet the conditions abo ve must seek permission to r e-enroll from the dean of academic suppor t services. Re-enrolling students are subject to degree and cur- riculum r equirements in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect at the time of re-entry. Students wishing to re-enroll must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing of their intent to return using the Returning Student Form and should consult with a University advisor in the Drahmann Center to review their academic plans. Students on leave who have attended another college or university are only permitted to transfer in a maximum of 10 units of elective credit and are required to forward to the Office of the Registrar an officialtranscript of all work completed during their absence. GRADING POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Grading Grades are assigned by the instructor to reflect the quality of a student's work. The University uses the following grades: GoodC: AdequateD: Barely PassingF: Not PassingP: PassNP: No Pass The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by (+) or (-) suffixes, except that the grade of A may not be modified b y a (+) suffix. G rade point v alues per unit ar e assigned as follo ws: A = 4.0 A- = 3.7B+ = 1.3D = 1.0D- = 0.7F = 0 Unit credit, but not grade point credit, is awarded when the grade of \"P\" is assigned. Unit credit is not awarded when the grade of \"NP\" is assigned. The University also uses the following marks for which no unit credit or grade point value is granted: I: Incomplete N: Continuing workNS: N o Show AUD: AuditW: Withdrawn366 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 367 Pass/No Pass (P/NP) A grade of \"P\" signifies that the quality of work done is equivalent to a letter grade of \"C\" or higher, while a grade of \"NP\" denotes work at the level of \"C-\" or lower. A maxi-mum of six courses taken under the pass/no pass option in which the student receives a mark of \"P\" can be used to fulfill the unit requirements for graduation. Some courses are offered only on a pass/no pass basis. If a graded option is not available a course can satisfy Core, major, and/or minor requirements. A student with junior or sen- ior standing and a declared major may choose to take an elective course on a pass/no pass basis. Students may enroll in only one elective course on a pass/no pass basis per quarter. Stu-dents may choose the pass/no pass option for a class through the end of the fourth week of classes, but may not change the grading option after that date. Incomplete (I) The mark of \"I\" (incomplete) may be assigned by the instructor when a student does not complete some essential portion of the assigned work in a class because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control. The unfinished work must be completed and given to the course instructor within three weeks of the beginning of classes in the nextscheduled term (not the student 's next term of enrollment), excluding summer session, un- less extraordinary circumstances require an extension. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing by the instructor and approved by the University registrar within theoriginal three-week period. Extensions shall not be for longer than two academic quartersafter the mar k of \"I\" was assigned, ex cluding summer session. An incomplete that has not been completed within the specified deadline or has not received an approved extension will be converted to a grade of \"F .\" Continuing Work (N) The mark of \"N\" (continuing work) may be assigned by an instructor when course re- quirements span mor e than one term. When the course requirements are completed, the instructor assigns a standard grade. A student may not graduate and receive a degree with a mark of \"N\" on their academic record. No Show (NS) The mar k of \"NS\" (N o Show) may be assigned b y an instructor when a student never attends a class and does not drop the class. A mark of \"NS\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark after it is assigned by the instructor. A mark of \"NS\" is included in the stu-dent's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the cal- culation of the student's grade point average. No adjustment in tuition will result from the awarding of a mar k of \"NS\" in a class. Audit (AUD) The mark of \"AUD\" is assigned when a student enrolls in a class on an audit basis. A mark of \"AUD\" cannot be changed to any other grade. Withdrawn ( W) The mark of \"W\" is assigned by the Office of the Registrar when a student completes the formal requirements dropping a class or withdrawing from the University. A mark of\"W\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark. A mark of \"W\" is included in the stu-dent's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included the cal- culation of the student's grade point average. Grade Point Average A student's grade point average is determined by multiplying each grade point value by the number of quarter units assigned to the course, adding these grade point units from allcourses taken, and dividing this sum by the total number of quarter units for which letter grades were reported. Grade reports are posted at the end of each quarter and indicate both the grade point average earned by the student during the quarter and the cumulative gradepoint average earned by the student for all courses completed to that point. Grades earned in courses in SCU-operated or -affiliated study abroad or domestic study programs are included in the calculation of a student's grade point average. Grades earnedin courses at other institutions accepted for transfer credit are not included in the calcula- tion of a student's grade point average, but will be considered when determining honors at graduation. Evaluation of Progress Grades are available at the end of the term via University e-campus. Faculty members are expected to apprise students of their course progress at reasonable intervals. Some meas- urements of progress should take place in time to enable students to make reasonable deci-sions with r espect to the four th-week and seventh-week withdrawal deadlines. Change of Grade Only the faculty member responsible for a course may assign grades. All grades become final when they have been assigned and reported to the Office of the Registrar. A facultymember may r eport a corr ection of a final grade to the O ffice of the R egistrar only if a cler - ical or procedural error was made in assigning, transmitting, or recording the original grade. A grade may not be changed as a result of re-evaluation, re-examination, or the submissionof additional wor k after the term ends. Any grade change must have the approval of the de- partment chair and the associate dean of the student's school or college. No grade may be changed after one y ear. Student Appeals of Grades Grades are not negotiable. There should be no questioning of a faculty member's aca- demic judgment on a grade. In registering for a class, students implicitly agree to allow thefaculty member to make a qualitativ e judgment of their command of the subject matter , which will be expressed as a letter grade. Any questioning or appeal of a grade should there- fore be limited to procedure, e.g., to computational errors or failures to follow grading poli-cies set for th in the syllabi. Any system of grade-appeal should protect the rights of faculty members as well as the rights of students. The r esults of any system of grade-appeal should not be binding upon the faculty member. Any decision to initiate a change of grade should remain the faculty member 's. Any pr ocedural complaint regarding a change of grade must be initiated within four weeks of the beginning of the next scheduled term, not including summer session. A student with a complaint must first discuss the matter with the faculty member. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student may then take the matter to the chairpersonof the department involved. The chairperson will discuss the case with the faculty memberand may recommend that the faculty member review the grade. Upon the request of thestudent, the dean will proceed in similar fashion. Should the student request it, the dean willpass the matter on to the provost. This process of review gives the chairperson, dean, and provost the right to discuss the matter with the faculty member , and if they think it appr opriate, r equest that the faculty368 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 369 member review the grade. Any recommendations made will not be binding upon the fac- ulty member against whom the complaint is lodged. The decision to change a grade re-mains with the faculty member. ACADEMIC STANDING AND STUDENT CLASSIFICATION Student Classification The University only admits students to its undergraduate degree programs on a full- time basis. Students who have not been admitted to degree status at the University may register for classes in accordance with the policies and regulations outlined in the section of this chapter covering non-degree students. The classification of students is determined by the number of quarter units completed with passing grades. Lower-division students are considered freshmen if they have com- pleted fewer than 44 units and sophomores when they have completed at least 44 units butfewer than 88 units. Upper-division students are considered juniors when they have com- pleted at least 88 units but fewer than 131 units and seniors when they have completed at least 131 units. If a student is enrolled for 12 or more units in a given term, they have full-time status for academic purposes. S tudents enr olled for less than 12 units hav e part-time status for that term and may not qualify for all University activities and benefits, such as eligibility for financial aid, on-campus housing, and intercollegiate athletic competition. Continuing en-rollment at the U niversity in part-time status requires approval by the dean of academic support services. Academic S tanding To be in good academic standing at the University, a student must normally be enrolled for 12 or more units, must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 basedon all courses taken at Santa Clara, and must have completed at least a minimum numberof units as specified belo w. Failure to meet these r equirements may result in academic pro- bation or disqualification from future registration at the University. Students in their last term of enrollment before completing a degree may be classified as a full-time student when enr olled for less than 12 units. Academic Probation Students who have completed at least three quarters of academic work at Santa Clara or elsewhere are subject to academic probation if their cumulative grade point average is lowerthan 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara. Students who have not yet completedthree quarters of academic work at Santa Clara or elsewhere normally are not subject to ac-ademic pr obation as long as their cumulativ e grade point av erage is at least 1.6 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara. Students are also subject to academic probation if they fail to make satisfactory progress toward their degree as defined below: Completing at least 36 quarter units in the previous three quarters of residencyORCompleting at least 36 quar ter units b y the end of the third quarter of residency Completing at least 76 quar ter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing at least 115 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing at least 160 quarter units by the end of the twelfth quarter of residency Academic Disqualification Students are subject to disqualification from further registration at the University for any of the following: Remaining on academic probation for more than two consecutive quarters without improvement Failing to maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 OR Completing fewer than 30 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing fewer than 64 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 100 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 150 quarter units by the end of the twelfth quarter of residency Reinstatement to the University Reinstatement to the University after disqualification is rarely permitted and requires favorable action by the dean of academic support services in consultation with the dean of the student 's college or school. R equests for r einstatement are made to the dean of academic suppor t services and must include a description of any activities during the period of dis- qualification that would indicate that an improved academic performance can be expectedin the future. A student generally may not apply for reinstatement within a year of the dateof disqualification. The request for reinstatement will be considered only if the student's ac-ademic deficiencies can be corr ected within a reasonable time. ACADEMIC CREDIT EVALUATION Santa Clara awards credit based on the Advanced Placement Program, the International Baccalaureate Program, courses completed at other colleges and universities, and coursescompleted in U niversity-appr oved study abroad and domestic study programs using the criteria outlined herein. Students may not take a course for credit for which they have re- ceived advanced placement, International Baccalaureate, or transfer credit. Advanced Placement Credit Santa Clara participates in the Advanced Placement Program to recognize college-level academic achiev ement prior to matriculation and to encourage students to pursue adv anced studies in their areas of interest. Credit or placement is determined by the appropriate de- partment based on review of the student's advanced placement scores, sometimes in thecontext of supplemental departmental examinations. Students will be notified of advancedplacement cr edit upon matriculation at the U niversity. The follo wing chart indicates the subject examination, required scores, and Santa Clara credit granted through the Advanced Placement (AP) tests. Courses waived will always sat- isfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However,only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum. Courses waived by Advanced Placement test scores, when relevant, may satisfy Second Language, Mathematics, Natural Science, and Social Science requirements in the Core Cur-riculum. N o other undergraduate Cor e requirement can be satisfied with AP test scores. Final decisions on academic cr edit for some AP scores are made individually by the ap- propriate academic department in consultation with the University Registrar.370 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 371 *See department chair for evaluation of credit toward major or minor.Exam SubjectRequired ScoreSCU Unit CreditSCU Equivalent Core AP Art History 4, 5 4 Art History 21, 22 or 23 No Core Credit AP Biology 4, 5 4 Elective Credit * No Core Credit AP Calculus AB 4, 5 8MATH 11 & 12; or MATH 30 & 31Mathematics AP Calculus BC 3 4 MATH 11 or MATH 30 Mathematics AP Calculus BC 4, 5 12MATH 11 & 12 & 13 or MATH 30 & 31 & 13Mathematics AP Chemistry 3 5 CHEM 11 Natural Science AP Chemistry 4 10 CHEM 11 & 12 Natural Science AP Chemistr y 5 10-14CHEM 11 & 12 (cr edit for CHEM 13 granted aftercompleting CHEM 99) Natural Science APChinese Language & Culture4, 5 4 CHIN 21 Second Language APComparativ e Government & Politics4, 5 4 POLI 2 Social Science AP Computer Science A 4, 5 4 COEN 11 or CSCI 10 No Core Credit AP English Language 4, 5 4 Elective Credit No Core Credit AP English Literature 4, 5 4 Elective Credit No Core Credit AP Environmental Science 4, 5 4 ENVS 11 Natural Science AP European History 4, 5 4 HIST 23 No Core Credit AP French Language 4, 5 4 FREN 21 Second Language AP German Language 4, 5 4 GERM 21 Second Language AP Human G eography 4, 5 4ANTH 50 or ENVS 50 or POLI 50No Cor e Credit AP Japanese Language & C ulture4, 5 4 JAPN 21 Second Language AP Latin Vergil 4, 5 4 Electiv e Credit * No Cor e Credit AP Macroeconomics 4, 5 4 ECON 2 Social Science AP Microeconomics 4, 5 4 ECON 1 Social Science AP Music: Theory 4, 5 4-8MUSC 1 or MUSC 1 & 1A*No Core Credit AP Physics B 4, 5 4 PHYS 11 No Core Credit AP Physics C: Mechanics 4, 5 4 PHYS 31 No Core Credit APPhysics C: E lectricity & M agnetism4, 5 5 PHYS 33 Natural Science AP Psychology 4, 5 4 PSYC 2 Social Science AP Spanish Language 4, 5 4 SPAN 21 Second Language AP Spanish Literature 4, 5 4 SPAN 22 Second Language AP Statistics 4, 5 4 MATH 8 or OMIS 40 Mathematics AP U.S. G overnment & P olitics 4, 5 4 POLI 1 No Cor e Credit AP U.S. History 4, 5 4 HIST 96A or 96B No Core Credit AP World History 4, 5 4 Elective Credit * No Core CreditInternational Baccalaureate Santa Clara University recognizes the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program for admission and advanced placement.

ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 373 Units Taken at Other Institutions Credit is awarded for coursework completed at other colleges and universities subject to certain limitations. Courses from accredited institutions are generally transferable if theyare similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin. Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses of atrade or technical nature do not transfer. Courses from colleges not accredited, trade schools, extension programs, or correspondence programs do not transfer. Students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities prior to matriculation at Santa Clara for no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for the specific Santa Clara degree. After enrolling at Santa Clara, students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities for no morethan 10 quarter units of free electives, subject to the limitation that no more than half ofthe total number of quarter units required for a Santa Clara degree can be earned at anotherinstitution. T ransfer credit earned after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used tofulfill University Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or program requirements. T ransfer credit for all coursework completed at other colleges and universities requires approval from the Drahmann Center and the chair of the department offering the equiva-lent Santa Clara course. The student must have earned a grade of \"C\" or better in a coursefor transfer credit to be granted. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basisare not accepted as transfer cr edit. Grades for units earned at other institutions are not in- cluded in a student's Santa Clara academic history or in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. Study Abroad and Domestic Study Programs Units and grades earned for coursework in University-operated study abroad programs, University-affiliated study abroad programs, University study abroad exchange programs,and U niversity-affiliated domestic study pr ograms ar e included in a student 's Santa Clara academic history. Units earned in approved study abroad and domestic study programs may be used to fulfill University Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or pro-gram r equirements subject to prior approval by the appropriate dean's office, department chair, or pr ogram dir ector. However, such units do not satisfy the University residency re- quirement. Grades earned in approved study abroad and domestic study programs are in- cluded in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. Units earned for course work in study abr oad and domestic study programs not operated by or affiliated with the University are accepted only as transfer credit and are subject to the policies go verning units taken at other institutions. The second-lev el Cor e Curriculum re- quirement in Religion, Theology, and Culture can be fulfilled with a pre-approved study abroad course. The third-level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology & Cul-ture cannot be fulfilled with a study abroad course. NON-DEGREE STUDENTS The S anta Clara University undergraduate program is designed primarily for full-time, degree-seeking students. To maintain the University's commitment to its primary undergrad- uate constituency of degree students, non-degree students are permitted to register in accor-dance with the following policies subject to space availability in classes. Santa Clara Alumni Santa Clara alumni who have been awarded a degree from Santa Clara University may enroll in undergraduate classes on a for-credit basis or may audit undergraduate classes.Alumni may enroll for no more than 10 units per term on a for-credit basis, or they may audit one course per term. They are certified for enrollment by the Office of the Registrar and register for classes during the late registration period of the term. University Employees University employees who are students at another accredited college or university may enroll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and have a cu-mulative grade point average of \"C\" or better at their home institution. They may not en-roll concurrently at Santa Clara and another college or university. University employees whoare not currently admitted to degree status are certified for enrollment by the Office of theRegistrar and may audit one course per term. Students from Other Colleges and Universities Students from another accredited college or university may enroll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and have a cumulative grade point aver-age of \"C\" or better at their home institution. They may not be enrolled concurrently atSanta Clara and another college or university. Students from other colleges and universitiesmay enroll for no more than three quarters, not including summer session and are not eli-gible to audit classes. Students from other colleges and universities are certified for enroll-ment b y the D rahmann Center and the O ffice of the R egistrar and r egister for classes during the late registration period of the term. Students from Other Colleges and Universities Participating in SCU Exchange Programs Students from other colleges and universities participating in SCU exchange programs may enr oll in undergraduate classes at S anta Clara if they ar e in good standing and hav e a cumulative grade point average of \"C\" or better at their home institution. They are not el- igible to audit classes. Students from other colleges and universities participating in exchangeprograms are certified for enrollment by the International Programs Office and the Officeof the R egistrar . Students from Other Institutions Enrolling in SCU Study Abroad Programs Students from other colleges and universities who meet the applicable eligibility require- ments for SCU study abr oad pr ograms may enr oll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and have a cumulative grade point average of \"C\" or better at their home institution. They are not eligible to audit classes. Students from other collegesand univ ersities enrolled in SCU study abroad programs are certified for enrollment by the International Programs Office and the Office of the Registrar. Young Scholars High school students who meet the applicable eligibility requirements for the Young Scholars program may enroll in undergraduate classes. Young Scholars may enroll for nomore than 10 units per term and are not eligible to audit classes. Young Scholars are certi-fied for enrollment by the appropriate Dean's Office and the Office of the Registrar after re-ceiving permission of the faculty member to enr oll in a specific class.374 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 375 ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The University is committed to academic excellence and integrity. Students are expected to do their own work and to cite any sources they use. A student who is guilty of a dishon-est act in an examination, paper, or other work required for a course, or who assists others in such an act, may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a grade of \"F\" for the course. In addition, a student found guilty of a dishonest act may be subject to sanctions, up to andincluding dismissal from the University, as a result of the student judicial process as de- scribed in the Student Handbook. A student who violates copyright laws, including those covering the copying of software programs, or who knowingly alters official academic recordsfrom this or any other institution is subject to similar disciplinary action. Academic Integrity Protocol Allegations within the Context of a Course These procedures are intended to protect the integrity of the instructional program and of student academic achievement. Any member of the Santa Clara University communitywith a suspicion or evidence of academic dishonesty of some kind as described in the Stu-dent Conduct Code (e.g., plagiarism, falsification of data, misrepresentation of research, orthe use of pr ohibited materials during an examination, and other acts generally understood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context) may initiate an allegation of student academic dishonesty . The follo wing describes pr ocedures for resolution by due process. If the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolu- tion begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs thestudent of the suspicion. I f the instr uctor judges on the basis of av ailable evidence that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severityof the academic sanction (e.g., r efusal to accept an assignment, \"F\" on the particular assign- ment, or \"F\" for the entire course). The instructor will report in writing to the department chair and the O ffice of S tudent Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred and what academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the mat- ter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University judicial process. Thisprocess is not intended to limit academic freedom. Appeal Process for Academic Sanctions If, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the stu- dent wants to challenge the instr uctor's decision, the student will contact the chair of the de - partment in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered or his/herdesignate, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely related department. The department chair hearing the appeal has the option to convene an ad hoc panel if he or she believes that the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspectedof committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only roleis to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time faculty members fr om the depar tment in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty mem- ber fr om a closely related department, and two students who are trained student judicial board members. Staff in the Office of Student Life will arrange for the participation of thestudent panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered and newly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all parties concerned, and make a recommendation to the department chair. The parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a partic- ular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection must be based upon a belief that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evalua-tion and therefore will not review the case in an impartial manner. The objection is filed with the chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a different faculty member or student. After reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidence available, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of her or his recommendationregarding the alleged violation, and report the recommendation to the student and the Of-fice of Student Life. However, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the in-structor of the course. Decisions may only be appealed to one level above the instructor. All proceedings are in- tended to be confidential. If the student wishes to withdraw from the course but the instructor's signature is required for the withdrawal process, the instructor may refuse to sign an approval of the withdrawal. University Judicial Process When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the assistant dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether fur-ther judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain onfile in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa ClaraUniversity. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files. If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warningto expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the sever-ity of the cir cumstances, including the student 's judicial history and previous academic in- tegrity violations. Allegations Outside a Course If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The assistant dean will confer with all parties concerned. Afterhearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean willeither hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University JudicialProcess. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved. PATENT POLICY For information on the University's Patent Policy, contact the Office of Research Initiatives, http://www.scu.edu/provost/research/376 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 377 ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS CLERY ACT In accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Cam- pus Crime Statistics Act, Santa Clara University annually collects information about cam- pus crimes and other reportable incidents as defined by the law. Information presented in compliance with this act is made available to assist current and potential students and em-ployees in making informed decisions regarding their attendance or employment at theUniversity. These reports and other information about the law are available on the Campus Safety Web site. It is the policy of Santa Clara University that the campus community will be informed on a timely basis of all reports of crime and other information affecting the se-curity of our campus and the personal safety of our students, faculty , staff, and guests COMMUNICATION BY THE UNIVERSITY TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS The University will communicate with undergraduate students through a variety of for- mats. Information that is sent to undergraduate students from the University via their cam-pus mail box, local address, or their Santa Clara e-mail address is considered officialcommunication and should be tr eated as such. S tudents ar e asked to check their campus mailbox and their Santa Clara e-mail account on a daily basis, and are responsible for read-ing and responding to the information they receive from the University. The University urges undergraduate students to use their Santa Clara e-mail address as their primary e-mail; students who will not be checking that addr ess regularly should for ward their email to their preferred e-mail account. CONSENSU AL REL ATIONS BET WEEN EMPL OYEES AND STUDENT S In addition to prohibiting sexual harassment under the Policy on Unlawful Harassment and Unlawful Discrimination, the University prohibits any consensual dating, romantic, or sexual r elationship between an employee and a student over whom that employee has any instructional, super visory, advising, or ev aluativ e responsibility. Such a relationship is fraught with problems, including the potential for exploitation, favoritism, and conflict of interest. The appearance of impropriety or unfairness may also adversely affect the learning and workenvironment for other students and emplo yees. This policy applies to faculty, staff, and stu- dent employees. Employees who violate this policy are subject to sanctions for misconduct under the policies of the F aculty H andbook, S taff Policy Manual, or Student Employment Handbook, as appropriate to their employment status. Employees or students with ques- tions about this policy should contact the Office of Affirmative Action or the Departmentof Human Resources. DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE AND SCHOOL PROGRAM It is the goal of Santa Clara University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufactur e, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of contr olled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is pr ohibited on the Santa Clara University campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University's activ-ities. This includes the unlawful use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace evenif it does not result in impaired job performance or in unacceptable conduct. The unlawful presence of any controlled substance or alcohol in the workplace and cam- pus itself is prohibited. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Santa Clarapremises where the activities of the University are conducted. Violations will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employ- ment for faculty and staff or expulsion of students. A disciplinary action may also includethe completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. The program information is distributed on an annual basis to all faculty, staff, and stu- dents. New staff employees are given a copy at New Employee Orientation. New faculty em- ployees are given a copy at New Faculty Orientation.

FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILIT Y Enrollment Status and Financial Aid Eligibility Undergraduate students receiving financial aid must meet general University eligibility requirements and any applicable eligibility criteria associated with specific federal, state, or University aid pr ograms fr om which they ar e receiving suppor t. Financial aid recipients generally must be enr olled as full-time students in a minimum of 12 units each quar ter in which aid is received, must be making satisfactory progress toward a degree, and must main-tain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0. Financial aid awards to students whodrop below full-time status (i.e., less than 12 units) will be adjusted unless certification for continuing eligibility is granted by the Financial Aid Office. Eligibility for financial aid is limited to a maximum of 12 quarters of undergraduate study. Financial aid awards willcease after the twelfth quarter of enrollment in a post-secondary institution unless certifica- tion for continuing eligibility is granted by the Financial Aid Office. Specific financial aid awards may have additional requirements for continuing eligibility. Academic Standing and Satisfactory Progress Requirements All financial aid recipients must maintain good academic standing and be making sat- isfactory progress toward a degree according to the University standards and applicable fed-eral and state regulations. In general, students must maintain a cumulative grade pointaverage of 2.0 or higher in courses taken at Santa Clara and must successfully complete atleast 75 percent of the cumulative quarter units they attempt. The completion rate is cal-culated using all quarters of attendance, whether or not the student received financial aid. Students receiving notification of unsatisfactory progress toward a degree will continue to be eligible for financial aid during the first two quarters of a probationary period. If a stu- dent has not improved their cumulative grade point average to at least a 2.0 and improvedtheir cumulative course completion rate to at least 75 percent after two quarters, eligibilityfor federal and state financial aid will cease. I f a student has not improved his or her cumu- lative grade point average to at least a 2.0 and improved his or her cumulative course com- pletion rate to at least 75 percent after a third quarter, eligibility for University financial aidwill cease. Students who lose eligibility for financial aid and later regain good standing mustreapply for financial aid. Reinstatement of financial aid will be based on the availability offunds at the time of r ecertification of eligibility for aid. If a student's financial aid was can- celled because his or her academic progress did not meet the minimum standards, the stu-dent may appeal for reinstatement of financial aid based on serious illness, death or serious illness of an immediate family member, or other compelling circumstances. Academic Disqualification Students who have been academically disqualified are ineligible for financial aid. If a stu- dent is disqualified for a limited amount of time, the student will lose eligibility for finan-cial aid for that period. The period of disqualification will be considered part of the 12-quarter limitation just as if the student had been in attendance and received aid during the period of temporar y disqualification. A student who has been reinstated after disquali- fication by the University may not be eligible for certain federal, state, or University finan-cial aid programs depending on the specific eligibility requirements and availability of funds. Disciplinary Probation and Disqualification Eligibility for financial aid is contingent on a student r emaining in good judicial stand - ing at the University. Students who are placed on disciplinary probation for the first time will continue to r emain eligible for financial aid, unless otherwise prohibited by federal, state or University regulations. Students who are placed on disciplinary probation a secondtime within two years of the date the first probation was imposed will lose eligibility for SantaClara financial aid effective the date the second probation is imposed. Students who aresuspended from the University are not eligible to receive financial aid. If a student is placedon disciplinar y probation or deferr ed suspension or is inv olved in other significant discipli- nary matters, their eligibility for financial aid is subject to r eview by the Office of Student Life and the F inancial Aid Office.392 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 393 Study Abroad and Domestic Public Sector Study Programs Santa Clara University students participating in study abroad and domestic public sec- tor study programs operated by or affiliated with the University are eligible for SCU finan-cial aid and tuition remission as well as federal and state aid consistent with the policies and practices applicable to students enrolled for on-campus classes.

CANCELLATION OF FINANCIAL AID AND RETURN OF FUNDS Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are sub- ject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulationsassume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she re-mains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal finan-cial aid funds go verned under Title IV other than those earned under the college work-study program. Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in dir ect proportion to the length of time he or she remains enr olled. That is, the per centage of time during the term that the student r emains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IVaid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges o wed by the student play no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled. All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to state or University financial aid pr ograms or to the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received Federal Title IV assistance. Unsubsidized William D.

Santa Clara University complies with this requirement byparticipating in the Federal Quality Assurance Program. Each year, a percentage of studentsreceiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the informationon which their awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to sub-mit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number offamily members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar in-formation for v erification purposes for any student awar ded aid and to verify the attendance of other children in college. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply withthe request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds. BILLING AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES STUDENT ACCOUNTS AND BILLING Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrollment at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures.

The center also collaborates with other areas to enhance the ongoing ad- vising support for all students, such as providing support for the peer advising program in the School of Business and working with the Office for Multicultural Learning to offer op-portunities for faculty to develop advising skills in support of students from varied back- grounds. University advisors in the Drahmann Center assist students in working effectively with faculty members, with petitions for exceptions to University policy where unusual cir-cumstances warrant, and with the resolution of special problems. New Student Programs for undergraduate students are coordinated by the Drahmann Center. Through the New Student Orientation programs, advisors and staff at the centerwork with the faculty and staff throughout the University to introduce students to the cam-pus community, to provide advising for new students' initial registration, and to help newstudents adjust to the demands and opportunities of University life. In support of the LEADScholars program, the Drahmann Center works to ensure that first-generation college stu-dents have access to the full range of University support services. The Tutoring Center offers individual and group tutoring as well as consultation and workshops on learning strategies, study skills, and time management. The center also pro-vides advising outreach in support of first-year and undeclared students through the Resi-dential Learning Communities. For undergraduate students interested in pursuing graduate study, the Drahmann Cen- ter offers a Guide to Graduate Study on its Web site. The Career Center also has a Resource Guide to Graduate School on its Web site. The Office of Fellowships maintains information on nominated graduate fello wships (e.g., F ulbright, G oldwater , Marshall, Rhodes) on its Web site and pr ovides assistance in the application process for these awards. Faculty mem- bers are often the best source of information on the nature and quality of graduate pro- grams in their academic discipline. The Disabilities Resources Office has been designated by the University to ensure ac- cess for students with disabilities to all academic pr ograms and campus r esour ces. The goal is to support students with medical, physical, psychological, attention-deficit, and learning disabilities to participate fully in campus life, its programs, and activities. Emphasis is ongrowth and individual achievement through the provision of academic accommodations,suppor t services, self-adv ocacy skill training, and disability-r elated educational pr ogram- ming for the campus community. Reasonable accommodations are provided to minimize the effects of a student's disability and to maximize the potential for success. International Student Services provides assistance to undergraduate and graduate in- ternational students with issues related to visas, matters pertaining to immigration law, and general support for their transition to and continued success in their studies on campus. The D rahmann Center also houses the University transcript analyst and the special pro- gram transcript analyst for evaluation of coursework taken either prior to transferring toSanta Clara or during an approved studies abroad or domestic program. STUDENT LIFE 421 HOUSING AND RESIDENCE LIFE The undergraduate residence halls at Santa Clara University are home to eight Residen- tial Learning Communities that are vehicles for advancing the University's goals of inte-grated education and educating the whole person. In the theme-based LearningCommunities, resident directors and faculty directors coordinate the efforts of resident min- isters, faculty-in-residence, and student staff to encourage high academic achievement, ef- fective community living, and individual development. University residence halls accommodate more than half of the undergraduate population in co-educational communities with common lounge areas, study rooms, kitchen and laun- dry facilities, and other services. Most residence halls offer traditional double-occupancyrooms with common bath facilities; some halls offer suites and apartment-style accommo- dations with bathrooms en suite. All residence hall rooms and suites are equipped with a cable television connection and with Ethernet. Wireless network service is also available inthe residence halls.
