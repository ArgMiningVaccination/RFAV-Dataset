CULVER, GOVERNOR DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES PATTY JUDGE, LT. GOVERNOR CHARLES KROGMEIER, DIRECTOR September 27,2010 Michael Marshall Secretary of Senate State Capitol LOCAL Mark Brandsgard Chief Clerk of the House State Capitol LOCAL Dear Mr. Marshall and Mr. Brandsgard: Enclosed please find copies of reports to the General Assembly relative to the Iowa Medicaid Annual DUR Report. These reports were prepared pursuant to the directive contained in Iowa Code 249A.24, subpart 3. The Commission realized an overall direct cost savings of $2.90 for every dollar spent on the program administratively. State money for this program is matched by the federal government at a 3 to 1 ratio (federal to state), so savings can also be stated as $11.60 per state dollar spent. Total annualized cost savings estimates ($785,066.40) were increased by approximately 30% when compared to state fiscal year ending 2009. Savings from patient-focused reviews ($103,577.16) decreased slightly compared to state fiscal year ending 2009. This decrease was most likely due to the fact that a large portion of suggestions are on duplicate therapy with mental health drugs, which typically do not result in a change in drug therapy. In addition, an evolving PDL that controls costs through cost effective medications and Prior Authorization (PA) resulted in fewer suggestions being made to providers. Savings from problem- focused reviews ($681,489.24) increased by 83% ($563,956.21) compared to state fiscal year ending 2009 due to an increase in the number of interventions sent to providers.

This report provides a summary description of the activities of the Iowa Medicaid Drug Utilization Review Commission, along with an evaluation of the Iowa Medicaid retrospective drug utilization review program. Information contained in this report covers projects completed and evaluated during the time period of July 2009 through June 2010. [ Background Information 1 Established in 1984, the DUR Commission is charged with promoting the appropriate and cost- effective use of medications within the Iowa Medicaid member population. Acting as a -. - professional advisory group, the Commission analyzes medication utilization by the members of Iowa Medicaid and performs educational initiatives to optimize member outcomes. The Commission performs retroDUR and educational outreach through patient-focused reviews and problem-focused reviews. The Commission supports the proDUR program through criteria review and acts as a resource to the DHS on other issues concerning appropriate medication use. Patient-Focused Reviews Patient-focused reviews are completed with the review of 300 member profiles at each meeting (eight times annually). The DUR subcontractor generates these profiles through a complex screening process. The first step of the screening process subjects member profiles to a therapeutic criteria screen. If a profile is found to have failed one or more therapeutic criteria, the member profiles are then assigned a level of risk based on their medication history and potential for adverse events regarding medication. The profiles with the highest level of risk are then selected for the Commission to review. Six months of prescription claims data and medical claims data, if available, are assessed to determine this risk factor. The member profiles selected from this process are manually reviewed by the Commission to minimize false positives generated by the computer selection process. The Commission identifies situations where educational intervention might he appropriate. Through these interventions, suggestions regarding medication therapy are communicated to the care providers. Templates are developed for suggestions that are frequently communicated to providers. The reviewer may also author an individualized suggestion if a template suggestion is not applicable. These template suggestions are located in the tab labeled Therapeutic Recommendations. Educational interventions are generally done by letters to prescribers and pharmacists, but may also he done by telephone or in person. The suggestions made by the Commission are educational and informative in nature. Suggestions may he classified as either therapeutic or cost saving in nature. In addition, these suggestions are classified by problem identified for reporting purposes. The classifications are as follows: Not Optimal Drug Not Optimal Dose Not Optimal Duration Unnecessary Drug Use Therapeutic Duplication - High Cost Drug Drug-Drug Interaction Drug-Disease Interaction Adverse Drug Reaction Patient Overuse Patient Underuse Therapeutic Alternative Missing Drug Therapy Not Optimal Dosage Form Potential Generic Use Inappropriate Billing Suggestions are intended to promote appropriate and cost-effective use of medications. When suggestions result in cost savings, these savings are calculated based on decreased cost of medications. However, several of these classes of interventions are intended to increase the use of medications. Examples are member underuse and missing drug therapy. In these cases, the addition of medication therapy will increase medication expenditures, but will be beneficial to the member and should result in cost savings in medical services andlor improved quality of Life. Cost savings in these situations cannot be calculated due to data limitations. Therefore, these suggestions are considered to have a positive impact on the program with no medication cost savings. Cost savings on medical services are assumed however not calculated. Providers are invited to respond to the Commissions' suggestions and to request additional information from the Commission. Reponses are voluntary and response rates are calculated for prescribers and pharmacists. Once a member's profile is reviewed, it is excluded from the selection process for nine months to eliminate repeat selections. After this waiting period, the current profile for each member is generated and reviewed to determine if the Commission's suggestion was implemented. If so, fiscal considerations resulting from that change are also calculated. The policy regarding these calculations is included in Appendix B. Problem-Focused Reviews Problem-focused reviews narrow the emphasis of review to a specific issue that has been determined to be an area where a targeted educational effort to providers may be valuable. Topics for review are selected from findings of patient-focused reviews or from reviews of medical literature. Criteria are developed to identify the members who may benefit from intervention and educational materials are disseminated to their providers. Providers are encouraged to voluntarily respond. The member profile is generated again in an appropriate amount of time (typically 6 to 9 months) to determine the impact rate of the intervention, along with any fiscal considerations. The policy regarding these calculations is also included in Appendix B. Administrative Review The Commission will review utilization data and medical literature to make recommendations to the Department of Human Services (DHS) regarding policy issues. These recommendations are made to promote the appropriate use of medications and positive member outcomes. Recommendations are made at the request of the DHS or at the Commission's discretion. All authority to accept or reject DUR Commission recommendations lies with the DHS. The Commission may make recommendations but does not make policy. Primary areas for recommendations include proDUR, drug prior authorization (PA), coverage of medications, and administrative and billing procedures. The prospective drug utilization review (proDUR) system is currently administered by Goold Health Systems (GHS) and was implemented statewide in July 1997. The Commission reviews the criteria utilized by GHS and provides input regarding therapeutic validity. Special attention is given to eliminating false positive messaging. The Commission recommends new or updated guidelines for use in the drug prior authorization program. This process is based on reviews of medical literature in addition to comparisons with other public and private sector programs. Input from providers outside the Commission, particularly specialists, is often sought when developing these guidelines. Once developed, the guidelines are sent to the medical and pharmacy associations in the state for comments. After considering these comments, a final recommendation is made to the Department. The Department may or may not accept the recommendation or may alter the recommendation. These guidelines are then subject to the administrative rules process prior to any policy implementation. The Commission also makes recommendations regarding coverage of medication or devices. As most coverage requirements are defined by OBRA '90, these recommendations generally encourage coverage of optional services. An example would be the coverage of select over-the-counter medications. If the Department accepts the Commission's recommendation, the proposed coverage change is subject to the administrative rules process prior to implementation. The Commission reviews pharmacy claims with respect to administrative procedures. Situations where funding for medication can be obtained from other sources are relayed to the Department for their action. For instance, Medicare will pay for immunosuppressive medications for transplant patients and nebulizer solution for dual eligible patients. The Commission also identifies situations where the Department may recover funds from inappropriate billing. I Overall Results Activities of the Commission were evaluated during the fiscal year ending 2010 for interventions performed in the previous or the current fiscal year. The direct cost savings from all activities of the Commission are calculated to be $785,066.40\" which equates to $2.90* for every $1.00 of combined federal and state dollars spent administratively. This calculation is based on estimates regarding two types of reviews: patient-focused reviews and problem-focused reviews. These results are also found in Appendix C. Cost Savings Estimate 1 Cost of the Program (state and federal dollars) $270,000.00 I Net cost Savings Estimate Savings per Total Dollar Spent (state and federal) Savings per State Dollar Spent Patient-focused reviews resulted in $ IO3,577.16* in direct cost savings, or $1 19.05* per patient evaluated. This estimate is based on the 1,252 suggestions made by the Commission identified from the review of the medication therapy of 2,400 patients. Of these 1,252 suggestions, 119 suggestions were implemented by the providers, resulting in a 9.50% impact rate. 1 Patient-Focused Profile Review Suggestions Made Therapy Changed IMPACT RATE / Cost Savings Estimates: Dollars Saved per Patient Evaluated Dollars Saved on Medication * Savings reported are pre-rebate, total dollars Problem-focused reviews resulted in an estimated cost savings of $681,489.24\" or $419.38 saved per patient evaluated. This estimate is based on the review of profiles with 1,625 patients selected for interventions. Therapy was changed for 567 patients, resulting in an impact rate of 34.89%. Problem-Focused Profile Review Patients Evaluated Therapy Changed IMPACT RATE Cost Savings Estimates: Dollars Saved on Patient Reviews Dollars Saved per Patient Evaluated Total Dollars Saved on Medication Comparison to Previous Reports Cost savings estimates for State FYE 2010 ($785,066.40*) are higher than last year. However, in comparison to previous years, the cost savings estimates are lower. This decrease is due in part to the following: e An evolving Preferred Drug List (PDL) that controls costs through Prior Authorization (PA) and the use of preferred medications that are cost effective for the State which resulted in fewer suggestions being made to providers. e A majority of cost savings opportunities that had been included in past annual reports are no longer available such as quantity limits, dose consolidation, and age edits as these were implemented as ProDUR edits for the pharmacy program. The savings from State FYE 2010 patient-focused reviews ($103,577.16*) were lower than State FYE 2009 ($1 14,357.25*). The number of suggestions made (1,252) vs. (407) increased while the number of suggestions that were accepted (1 19) vs. (193) decreased from State FYE 2009. These decreases in the number of suggestions that were accepted are iargely due to the fact that a large number of suggestions made are related to duplicate therapy of mental health drugs, which usually do not result in a change in drug therapy. The savings from problem-focused reviews for State FYE 2010 ($681,489.24\") were higher than State FYE 2009 ($1 17,533.03*). This was due to the fact that in State FYE 2010, there were eight total problem focused studies evaluated versus five problem focused studies in State FYE 2009. * Savings reported are pre-rebate, total dollars Patient-Focused Review During this evaluation period, 2,5 15 educational intervention letters were mailed to prescribers and pharmacies regarding medication therapy. Of this total, 1,252 letters (49.78%) were mailed to prescribers, and 1,263 (50.22%) letters were mailed to pharmacies. Providers are invited to voluntarily respond to Commission letters. Providers returned 943 responses to these letters, resulting in an overall response rate by the providers of 75.32%. Of this total, 557 (59.07%) responses were from prescribers and 386 (49.03%) were from pharmacies. The response rate differed between physicians and pharmacies; 45% for physicians and 31% for pharmacies. In these 2,515 educational letters, the Commission made 1,252 suggestions. Of these suggestions, 1,214 (96.96%) were therapeutic in nature while 38 (3.04%) were cost- saving in nature. The suggested change was implemented in 119 cases, resulting in an overall impact rate of 9.50%. Of these changes, I12 (94.12%) were therapeutic in nature while 7 (5.88%) were cost-saving in nature. Of the 1,252 suggestions, four types of suggestions accounted for over 90.26% of the total. Those four suggestions were Drug-Drug Interaction (4.18%), Patient Overuse (3.04%), Therapeutic Duplication (80.19%), and Not Optimal Dose (4.15%). No other single category accounted for more than 3% of the total suggestions. Of the 119 changes, the most common reasons for the Commission's inquiry were Inappropriate Billing (5.04%), Therapeutic Duplication (76.47%), Not Optimal Dose (7.56%), and Drug-Drug Interaction (3.36%). No other single category accounted for more than 2.5% of the changes. Detailed information is found in Appendix D. The suggestions that resulted in change the highest percentage of the time were Inappropriate Billing (1 5.49%), Therapeutic Alternative (23.83%), Missing Drug Therapy (17.39%), and Not Optimal Dose (17.39%). Implementation of therapeutic suggestions resulted in direct drug cost savings of $103,107.12*. Implementation of the cost-saving suggestions resulted in direct drug cost . -. savings of $470.04\". The total amount saved on medication utilization was calculated to be $103,577.16\" for the 870 patients evaluated, or $1 19.05* per patient. The complete details of the results of patient-focused studies reported monthly are also outlined in Appendix D. Included in Appendix D are Intervention Case Summary examples presented to the Commission during the year. These summaries detail the process of specific patient- focused reviews including problem identification, intervention, provider response and outcome. The examples provide an easily understood method to demonstrate the value of retrospective patient focused DUR. \" Savings reported are pre-rebate, total dollars Problem-Focused Reviews Eight problem-focused reviews were evaluated during the fiscal year. In conducting these studies, 1,625 patient profiles were reviewed and selected for intervention. Of these patients, 567 cases showed evidence of a positive outcome, resulting in an impact rate of 34.89%. These changes in therapy resulted in annualized cost savings of $681,489.24 or $419.38 per patient evaluated. Results of all focus studies are detailed in Appendix E. The purpose for each problem-focused review and a complete description of results are available in Appendix F. Administrative Review Prior Authorization The Commission annually reviews the prior authorization program for clinical appropriateness. Changes are recommended to the Department of Human Services. During the State FYE 2010, the Commission reviewed all therapeutic categories requiring prior authorization as well as therapeutic criteria to support operations of the Preferred Drug List. Recommendations for modifications to existing criteria were made for the following categories: Ketorolac, Muscle Relaxants, Antihistamines, Smoking Cessation Biologicals for Ankylosing Spondylitis, and Biologicals for Arthritis. The following is a list for which new categories of clinical prior authorization criteria were developed: Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists, Inhibitors, Lidocaine Patch, and Chronic Pain Syndromes. The recommendation was made to remove existing criteria for Ergotamine Derivatives due to low utilization of this category of drugs. In addition, the Commission reviewed the new Red Boolc Guidelines on RSV prevention to determine if changes needed to be made to the Palivizumab (Synagis) Clinical PA criteria. They felt that the evidence supporting the new Red Boolc Guidelines contained no new clinical data. Therefore, the Commission recommended making no changes to the PA criteria for the 2009-2010 RSV Season. They went on to recommend a start date of November 15\" with a maximum of 5 doses. These recommendations can be found in Appendix G Prospective Drug Review The Commission reviews and recommends prospective drug utilization review criteria to be utilized by the Department. The following prospective DUR edits were recommended to the Department by the Commission in State FYE 2009: * Quantity Limit of 30 tablets per 30 days on Ulovic 40mg tablets. Point of Sale age edit on Nuvigil to restrict use to members 17 years of age and older. 0 Quantity Limit of 120 tablets per 180 days at a maximum dose of four tablets per day for carisoprodol when the criteria for coverage is met. 1nformati6n regarding the Commission recommendations for prospective DUR can be found in Appendix H. Other Activities The Commission reviews changes made to the state maximum allowable cost (SMAC) list and the federal upper limit (FUL) list for prescription drugs to determine if narrow therapeutic index concerns exist. Appendix I lists the changes to the SMAC and FUL programs that were reviewed by the Commission. Three newsletters were written and distributed by the Commission to the Medicaid provider community during this fiscal year. A copy of these newsletters is provided in Appendix J. Topics include: Palivizumab (Synagis) PA Criteria 2009-2010 RSV Season .- -, Recommendation Regarding ECG Monitoring in Patients on Methadone by the CSAT * Drugs for Dementia 0 Anti-Acne Prior Authorization Criteria DUR Activities * Diabetes News FDA Updates Health Reform Legislation The Commission maintains a web site to improve communication with a variety of stakeholders. The web site is found at www.iadur.org. The site contains information regarding upcoming meeting dates, locations, agendas, minutes from the previous meeting, the Smoking Cessation Report to the State, as well as past issues of the provider newsletter, the DUX DIGEST. In addition the web site provides meeting agendas and minutes for the Drug Utilization Review Mental Health Advisory Group. A copy of this web site is found in Appendix K.

Appendix B Evaluation Procedure EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF PROSPECTIVE AND RETROSPECTIVE DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW INTERVENTIONS The goal of Drug Utilization Review (DUR) is to evaluate cost savings and provide quality assurance of medication use. The DUR Commission works in conjunction with the pharmacy medicalpr~gram at the !owa Medicaid Enterprise . . .. to contribute to the overall success of the program. The Drug Utilization program: 6 Evaluates three areas of activity including Patient-focused Drug Utilization Reviews, Problem-focused Drug Utilization Reviews, and Administrative Activities. 6 Examines only direct drug costs. DUR evaluation does not have the ability to quantify its impact on other health services such as hospitalizations, ER visits, and physician visits. s Reports pre-rebate savings since access to supplemental rebates is not within the scope of the DUR program. e Often provides recommendations that are qualitative, such as improved health outcomes, rather than quantitative in nature. As a general principle, evaluations are based upon an observed change in the targeted prescribing or dispensing pattern, as well as changes seen in therapy of the individual patients. One evaluation approach is to observe and quantify changes in prescribing due to a given intervention compared to a control group of providers who do not receive the intervention. The intervention's impact on prescribing may be more readily detectable by this method and could be measured by comparing the two groups of patients or prescribers. However, It is very difficult to design a scientifically sound control group given the many variables surrounding patient care. Therefore, in most instances the DUR Commission has chosen to forego use of a control group to achieve the greatest impact. Although the evaluation of the intervention may be less scientific, intervention on behalf of all the patients is more desirable. In this instance, prescribing trends may not be available for comparison, but savings and benefit can still be quantified at the individual patient level. Patient-focused DUR Patient-focused DUR concentrates efforts on specific suggestions made about an individual patient. Each suggestion, or template, attempts to make a change in therapy. These changes are either therapeutic or cost-saving in nature; however, these situations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A therapeutic change -- one that improves the patient's therapy in some way -- may also produce cost savings. Cost-saving changes are attempted when a patient is not receiving a medication in the most economical form. The intervention does not change the medication but points out that the same medication could be given in a more cost-effective manner. Each template and intervention is evaluated to determine if the proposed change was implemented and, if so, what economic implications can be calculated. All savings for patient-focused review are based on annualized savings for one year only. Reporting on patient-focused interventions will provide the following information: B Total number of tem~lates mentioned Number of templates that were therapeutic in nature a Number of templates that were cost-saving in nature Total number of changes implemented Number of changes that were therapeutic in nature Number of changes with positive impact without savings Number of changes that were cost-saving in nature Total dollars saved from therapeutic changes Total dollars saved from cost-saving changes Total dollars saved Impact of interventions expressed as a percentage All templates are described by one of sixteen classifications. These classifications indicate the general type of intervention addressed by the template. Reports will also include a breakdown by classification (therapeutic or cost-saving) of the templates used in the patient-focused letters. This data will show which templates are cited most often, result in change most often, and result in higher cost savings. Templates that are therapeutic in nature include: a Not Optimal Drug Not Optimal Dose Not Optimal Duration of Use ~9 Unnecessary Drug Use Therapeutic Duplication 0 High Cost Drug s Drug-Drug Interaction Drug-Disease Interaction a Adverse Drug Reaction Patient Overuse e Patient Underuse s Therapeutic Alternative Q Missing Drug Therapy Templates that are cost saving in nature include: Not Optimal Dosage Form B Potential Generic Use Inappropriate Billing recommending step therapy for appropriate drug use. Example: The DUR Commission developed the criteria for the Nicotine Replacement Therapy prior authorization. Prior Authorization is required for over-the-counter nicotine replacement patches and nicotine gum. Requests for authorization must include: I) Diagnosis of nicotine dependence and referral to the Quitline lowa program for counseling. 2) Confirmation of enrollment in the Quitline lowa counseling program is required for approval. 3) Approvals will only be granted for patients eighteen years of age and older. 4) The maximum allowed duration of therapy is twelve weeks within a twelve-month period. 5) A maximum quantity of 14 nicotine replacement patches and/or I10 pieces of nicotine gum may be dispensed with the initial prescription. Subsequent prescription refills will be allowed to be dispensed as a 4 week supply at one unit per day of nicotine replacement patches andlor 330 pieces of nicotine gum. Following the first 28 days of therapy, continuation is available only with documentation of ongoing participation in the Quitline lowa program. 0 Preferred Drug List lPDL) Definifion: A list comprised of drugs recommended to the lowa Department of Human Services by the lowa Medicaid Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committee that have been identified as being therapeutically equivalent within a drug class and that provide cost benefit to the Medicaid program. Impacf: The DUR Commission makes referrals to and considers requests from the Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee to improve drug therapy. Example: he DUR Commission recommended that the lowa Medicaid Pharmacv and Thera~eutics Committee chanae the status of products containing darisoprodh on the PDL from prefeired to nonpreferred. s Disease management Definition: A coordinated process by which lowa Medicaid identifies and treats diseases within defined patient populations. This goal is achieved by identifying and delivering the most effective and efficient combination of available resources. Impacf: The Commission reviews disease state guidelines to determine appropriate drug use, shares drug utilization information, and makes recommendations to improve therapeutic outcomes. Example: DUR exchanged patient specific information with case management regarding utilization patterns of Advaim.

IOWA MEDICAID DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW COMMISSION 100 Army Post Road - Des Moines, IA 5031 5 (5 15) 725-1287 0 Fax i Chad Bissell. Pharm.D DUR Project Coordinator August 12,2009 Susan L. Parker, R.Ph., Pharm.D. Pharmacy Director Iowa Medicaid Enterprise 100 Army Post Road Des Moines, Iowa 503 15 Dear Susan: The lowa Medicaid Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Commission met on Wednesday, August 5,2009. At this meeting, the DUR Commission members discussed the Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists and Palivizumab (Synagis) clinical prior authorization criteria. The following recommendations have been made by the DUR Commission: Since no comments were received from medicaI associations or the Iowa Pharmacy Association in response to a June 4th letter that was sent to them detailing the proposed Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists criteria, the DUR Commission recommends the following criteria be considered for implementation: Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists: Newly Proposed Criteria: Payment for a preferred thrombopoietin receptor agonist will only be considered for cases in which there is a diagnosis of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura - - (ITP) in addition to documentation of an insufficient response to a corticosteroid, an immunoglobnlin, or the member has undergone a splenectomy. Payment for a non-preferred thrombopoietin receptor agonist will be considered following documentation of a recent trial and therapy failure with a preferred thrombopoietin receptor agonist unless such a trial would be medically contraindicated. The DUR Commission also reviewed the new Red Book guidelines on RSV prevention to determine if changes needed to be made to the Palivizumab (Synagis) Clinical PA criteria. Since the evidence supporting the new Red Book guidelines have not yet been made available, the Commission recommended making no changes to the PA criteria for the 2009-10 RSV season. They went on to recommend that approved prior authorizations be given a November 1'' (2009) start date for 5 doses initially. Requests for additional doses after the initial five towards the end of the season will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis based on Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) and Iowa Department of Public Health virology data specific to Iowa and the Midwest. Thank you in advance for the Department's consideration of accepting the DUR Commission's recommendation for clinical prior authorization criteria for Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists, and adopting the recommendations for coverage of Synagis for the 2009-10 RSV season.

Parker, R.Ph., Pharm.D. Pharmacy Director Iowa Medicaid Enterprise 100 Army Post Road Des Moines, Iowa 503 15 Dear Susan: The Iowa Medicaid Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Commission met on Wednesday, September 2, 2009. At this meeting, the DUR Commission members discussed the febuxostat (Uloric) and Palivizumab (Synagis) clinical prior authorization criteria. The following recommendations have been made by the DUR Commission: Following a review of the comments submitted by members of the Iowa Pharmacy Association (no comments were received from medical associations) in response to an August 6th letter that was sent to them detailing the proposed febuxostat (Uloric) criteria, the DUR Commission recommends the following criteria be considered for implementation: Febuxostat (Uloric): Newly Proposed Criteria: Prior authorization is required for febuxostat (Uloric). Payment for febuxostat (Uloric) will only be considered for cases in which symptoms of gout still persist while currently using 300mg per day of a preferred allopurinol product unless documentation is provided that such a trial would be medically contraindicated. The Commission members felt as though it were more important to manage a member's symptoms of gout, as opposed to \"chasing\" uric acid levels, and therefore, did not recommend monitoring of uric acid levels to be a part of the criteria. Additionally, the Commission recommended a quantity limit of 30 tablets per 30 days be placed on the Uloric 40mg tablets. The DUR Commission also reviewed the American Academy of Pediatrics Position Statement on the new Red Book Guidelines for RSV prevention to determine if changes needed to be made to the Palivizumab (Synagis) Clinical PA criteria. It was felt that the evidence supporting the new Red Book guidelines contained no new clinical data, only new pharmacoeconomic modeling data. Therefore, the Commission again recommended making no changes to the PA criteria for the 2009-10 RSV season. They went on to revise their original recommendation in that approved prior authorizations be given a November 16\" (2009) starl date for a maximum of 5 doses. It was felt that by pushing back the start date, more children would be covered for Synagis during the peak of the RSV season in Iowa. The Commission also voted in favor of giving the Department authority to replace the words \"adequate dose@)\" with \"therapeutic dose(s)\", throughout the clinical PA Criteria without having to review each individual category. Thank you in advance for the Department's consideration of accepting the DUR Commission's recommendation for clinical prior authorization criteria and quantity limit for Febuxostat (Uloric), and adopting the recommendations for coverage of Synagis for the 2009-10 RSV season.

Patients 21 years of age and older must have three unsuccessful trials with antihistamines that do not require prior authorization, prior to the approval of a non-preferred first generation or preferred second generation prescription antihistamine. Two of the trials must be with cetirizine and loratadine. Prior to approval of a non-preferred second generation antihistamine, in addition to the above criteria, there must be an unsuccessful trial with a preferred second generation prescription antihistamine. Patients 20 years of age and younger must have unsuccessful trials with cetirizine and loratadine prior to the approval of a non-preferred first generation or preferred second generation prescription antihistamine. Prior to approval of a non-preferred second generation antihistamine, in addition to the above criteria, there must be an unsuccessful trial with a preferred second generation prescription antihistamine. The required trials may be overridden when documented evidence is provided that the use of these agents would be medically contraindicated. Fentanyl, Short Acting Oral Products Newly proposed criteria: Prior authorization is required for short acting oral fentanyl products. Payment will be considered only if the diagnosis is for breakthrough cancer pain in opioid tolerant patients. These products cany a Black Box Warning. ActiqQ, FentoraB, and OnsolisTM: * Are indicated only for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies already receiving and tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. Are contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain. Because life-threatening hypoventilation could occur at any dose in patients not taking chronic opiates, do not use in opioid non-tolerant patients. Thank you in advance for the Department's consideration of accepting the DUR Commission's recommendation for clinical prior authorization criteria for Ketorolac, Muscle Relaxants, Antihistamines, and Fentanyl Short Acting Oral Products.

At this meeting, the DUR Commission members discussed the febuxostat (Uloric) and Palivizumab (Synagis,) clinical prior authorization criteria. The following recommendations have been made by the DUR Commission: Following a review of the comments submitted by members of the Iowa Pharmacy Association (no comments were received from medical associations) in response to an August 6th letter that was sent to them detailing the proposed febuxostat ((Ulric) criteria, the DUR Commission recommends the following criteria be considered for implementation: Febuxostat (Uloric): Newly Proposed Criteria: Prior authorization is required for febuxostat (Uloric). Payment for febuxostat (Uloric) will only be considered for cases in which symptoms of gout still pexsist while currently using 300mg per day of a preferred allopwinol product unless documentation is provided that such a trial would be medically contraindicated. The Commissiol~ members felt as though it were more important to manage a member's symptoms of gout, as opposed to \"chasing\" uric acid levels, and therefore, did not recommend monitoring of uric acid levels to be a part of the criteria. Additionally, the Commission recommended a quantity limit of30 tablets per 30 days be placed on the Uloric 40mg tablets. The DUR Commission also reviewed the American Academy of Pediatrics Position Statement on the new Red Book Guidelines for RSV prevention to determine if changes needed to be made to the Palivizumab ($magis) Clinical PA criteria. It was felt that the evidence supporting the new Red Book guidelines contained no new clinical data, only new pharmacoeconomic modeling data. Therefore, the Commission again recommended making no changes to the PA criteria for the 2009-10 RSV season. They went on to revise their original recommendation in that approved prior authorizations be given a November 16& (2009) start date for a maximnm of 5 doses.

In the Spotlight: Anti-Acne Prior Authorization Criteria Prior authorization is required for all prescription topical acne products for the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Payment for non-preferred topical acne products will be authorized only for cases in which there is documentation of previous trial and therapy failure with a preferred agent. An initial treatment failure of an over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide product, which is covered by the program, is required prior to the initiation of a prescription product, or evidence must be provided that use of these agents would be medically contraindicated. If the patient presents with a preponderance of comedonal acne, tretinoin products may be utilized as first line agents with prior authorization. lowa Medicaid does not cover duplicate topical anti-acne prescription products. The member must have an unsuccessful trial of at least 4 to 6 weeks with each product alone before duplicate topical therapy can be considered.

Doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals can visit www.fda.aov/health~rofessiona/s for access to reporting adverse events or to find new safety alerts, warnings, and recalls. Users can also find content regarding new approvals information, or access to the current version of the label, or prescribing information in \"DailyMed.\" 4- MDl's vs. Inhalation Solution - According to the evidence-based guidelines published by the American College of Chest Physicians and the American College of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology, efficacy should not be the basis for selecting one inhalation delivery device over another, as inhalation delivery devices have been found to be equally effective. There is a significant cost difference between inhalation solutions and metered dose inhalers. Where possible, MDls should be used as they are the most cost effective. Spacers are covered as DME. In January, 2009, the following recommendation was issued: The Center for Substance Abuse and Treatment (CSAT) of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has developed a consensus guideline statement outlining recommendations regarding ECG monitoring in patients being considered for and being treated with methadoue regardless of indication. Of note, these recommendations should not supersede clinical judgment or patient preferences and may not apply to patients with terminal, intractable cancer pain. Five recommendations have been developed: Recommendation 1 [Disclosure]: Clinicians should inform patients of arrhythmia risk when methadone is prescribed. Recommendation 2 [Clinical History]: Clinicians should inquire about any history of structural heart disease, arrhythmia, and syncope. Recommendation 3 [Screening]: Clinicians should obtain pretreatment ECG for all patients to measure QTc interval, follow up ECG within 30 days, then annually (monitor more frequently if patient receiving >I00 mglday or if unexplained syncope or seizure occurs while on methadone). Recommendation 4 [Risk Stratification]: If before or at anytime during therapy: QT, >450-499 msecs: Discuss potential frequently QT, 2.500 msecs: Consider discontinuation or reducing methadone dose or eliminate factors promoting QT, prolongation (eg, potassium-wasting drugs) or use alternative therapy (eg, buprenorphine) Recommendation 5 [Drug Interactions]: Clinicians should be aware of interactions between methadone and other drugs that either prolong the QT interval or reduce methadone elimination. The panel also concluded that the arrhythmia risk is directly associated with methadone's ability to block the delayed rectifier potassium chai~nel (Ikr) and prolong repolarization. The guideline further states that the use of the Bazett formula is adequate even though it is likely to overcorrect with high heart rates. The patient should remain supine for at least 5 minutes prior to obtaining ECG. In addition, screening for QT, prolongation using automated readings does not require a specialist (eg, cardiologist) and may be performed in a primary care setting. However, in cases when uncertainty exists about whether or not clinically significant QT, prolongation is present, the ECG should be repeated or interpreted by a cardiologist. Methadone is a preferred drug on the Iowa Medicaid PDL. Other preferred options within the long acting narcotics PDL category include morphine sulfate ER, ~adian~, and ~vinza@. No PA is required, but quantity limits do apply. Krantz MJ, Martin J, Stimmel B, et ai, \"QT, Interval Screening in Methadone Treatment,\" Ann Int Med, 2009, 150(1):1-10. At a recent meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, two observational studies were presented looking at the effect of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors in patients taking tamoxifen in preventing recurrence of breast cancer. One of these two studies found that women who took CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as SSRls, had a higher recurrence rate. Tamoxifen is a prodrug that requires metabolism by CYP2D6 to its active metabolite. SSRls such as fluoxetine and paroxetine are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6. Sertraline is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6, and citalopram and escitalopram are less potent inhibitors of CYP2D6. Since there is no good evidence that one SSRI is more effective than another for treating depression, citalopram or escitalopram may be the safest choice for women that are taking tamoxifen and need to start an SSRI. The FDA is reminding health care professionals about the increased risk of neural tube defects and other major birth defects, such as craniofacial defects and cardiovascular malformations, in babies exposed to valproate sodium and related products (valproic acid and divalproex sodium) during pregnancy. The FDA will be working with the manufacturers of these products to address labeling changes. Healthcare practitioners should inform women of childbearing potential about these risks, and consider alternative therapies, especially if using valproate to treat migraines or other conditions not usually considered life-threatening. Women of childbearing potential should only use valproate if it is essential to manage their medical condition. Those who are not actively planning a pregnancy should use effective contraception, as birth defect risks are particularly high during the first trimester, before many women know they are pregnant. Preferred Drug List (PDL) Information e Antihistamines: Patients 21 years of age and older must have three unsuccessful trials with antihistamines that do not require prior authorization, prior to the approval of a non-preferred first generation or preferred second generation antihistamine. Two of the trials must be with cetirizine and loratadine. Patients 20 years of age and younger must have unsuccessful trials with cetirizine and loratadine prior to approval of a non-preferred first generation or preferred second generation prescription antihistamine. c Muscle Relaxants: Requests for carisoprodol will be approved for a maximum of 120 tablets per 180 days at a maximum dose of 4 tablets per day when the criteria for coverage are met.

As a result of the intervention, the Commission reported a total cost savings of $60,629.33 (State & Federal Dollars, pre-rebate) over a three month time frame. The Commission mailed out the first Quarterly Narcotic Utilization Report to Prescribers in September 2009. It is important for pharmacies to enter the correct prescriber information. Several phone calls were made to lowa Medicaid by prescribers stating they do not have record of treating a listed member. The most common reason for this was incorrect information entered by the pharmacy.

The goal of the DUR program is to ensure appropriate medication therapy, while permitting appropriate professional judgment to individualize medication therapy. In Iowa, the DUR Board is referred to as the Iowa Medicaid DUR Commission. The Iowa DUR Commission is composed of four Iowa licensed physicians and four Iowa licensed pharmacists who serve four-year terms, as well as a representative from the Department of Human Services. The Commission meets on the first Wednesday six months of the year from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The DUR Commission is currently seeking a Pharmacist who serves Medicaid members to join the committee. Any Pharmacist interested in serving in this capacity should send a resume or curriculum vitae, as well as a letter indicating their interest to Pam Smith at the address shown below. Candidates that would like more information about the Commission or who would like to speak to a present Commissioner are encouraged to call. The deadline for applications is May 1,2010.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and tacrine) inhibit the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, thus increasing its concentration in the brain, which may have a beneficial effect on the symptoms of dementia. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors carry with them a common adverse effect profile seen with cholinergic medications. such as bradycardia, syncope, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. These adverse effects seem to be most common with initiation of therapy and when the dose is increased. The mechanism of action for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist, memantine, is unknown. It is postulated that it blocks the amino acid glutamate, which contributes to the symptoms of AD. Common adverse effects include dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, delusions and insomnia. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, ~rice~t@ ,Namendam (memantine), currently do not require a Prior Authorization but are restricted to patients 40 years of age and older. ~rice~t@ (donepezil) is FDA approved for treatment of mild-to-moderate AD, Exelon@ (rivastigmine) is FDA approved for treatment of mild to moderate dementia associated with AD or Parkinson's disease, and Namendae (memantine) is FDA approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Although FDA approved for Alzheimer's, additional studies performed have questioned these drugs' efficacy. A meta-analysis published by Raina et al reviewed 20 years of English language randomized, controlled trials evaluating all cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. A total of 96 publications and 59 discrete studies were included in this review. Their conclusions were that all agents used to treat dementia provide statistically significant yet clinically marginal outcomes in terms of improved cognition.'A 2008 clinical practice guideline co-authored by the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians, reviewed the current five drug treatment options for dementia. In addition to reporting results on the statistical significance of trials, the guideline panel assessed clinically important effects of treatment regimens, as measured by generally-accepted magnitudes of changes in tools used to measure cognition defects. As in Raina's review, the guideline panel found statistical significance without uniform clinical significance, and lack of convincing evidence demonstrating superiority of one therapeutic treatment over an~ther.~ When prescribing these medications, consideration must be given to the significant cost of the medication and the adverse effects caused by these medications. If patients have not responded to therapy three months after initiation of therapy, the medication should be stopped. It should also be noted that these medications do not stop or reverse the progression of AD. References: 1. American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th ed, APA Press.

However, much of the morbidity associated with the long term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be avoided with tight glycemic control. In early 2009, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) as well as the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADNEASD) updated their consensus guidelines for treating type 2 diabetes. The consensus algorithm from the ADNEASD has two treatment tiers; Tier 1 is 'bell-validated core therapies\" which includes metformin + lifestyle as step 1, and rnetformin + lifestyle + basal insulin or a sulfonylurea as step 2, and rnetformin + lifestyle + intensive insulin as step 3. Tier 2 is considered \"less well-validated therapies\" and includes pioglitazone and GLP-1 agonists guideline states that amylin agonists, a- glucosidase inhibitors, glinides, and DPP-4 inhibitors are not included in the two tiers of preferred agents in the treatment algorithm due to their lower or equivalent overall glucose-lowering effectiveness compared with the first and second-tier agents and/or to their limited clinical data. However, these agents may be appropriate in selected patients. '. In addition, it is well established that self blood glucose monitoring in type 2 diabetics who are not using insulin is not cost effective. A trial published in the British Medical Journal in 2008 looked at the wst effectiveness of self monitoring of blood glucose in type 2 diabetics who were not using insulin. The data for this trial came from the randomized controlled diabetes glywmic education and monitoring (DiGEM) trial which looked at 12 months of data before the baseline and 12 months of trial follow up data. This study concluded that self monitoring of blood glucose with or without additional training in incorporating the results into self care was associated with higher costs and lower quality of life in patients with non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes3 Similar results from different studies were recently published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. The 201 0 American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes states that the optimal frequency and timing of self blood glucose monitoring for patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin is unc~ear.~ References: 1.

I Health Reform Legislation I e The President recently signed into law the Healthcare Reform bill which will allow for coverage expansion of uninsured persons beginning in 2014. Medicaid will be expanded to 133% of poverty level increasing Medicaid coverage by 16 million. Overall, the bill is expected to increase the number of Americans with insurance coverage to 92% of the population (95% excluding illegal immigrants) and increase the number of insured people by 32 million by 2019. e The cost of Medicaid expansion will be fully funded by the federal government through 2016 at which time the federal matching rate will be decreased to 90% by 2020 for newly covered members.

Welcome & Introductions Dr. Thomas Kline called the meeting to order at 9:33 a.m. at the Hoover Building in Des Moines. Commission members, guests, and observers were welcomed and introduced. The minutes from the June 3, 2009 meeting were approved following some noted corrections. (Motion by Bruce Alexander, second by Dr. Rick Rinehart, unanimous approval by voice vote.) The Commission members were reminded they needed to complete their annual Conflict of Interest Disclosure forms, Business Associates' Agreement, and Confidentiality forms. They also elected Dr. Mark Graber as Chairperson (Bruce Alexander nominated him, and Craig Logemann seconded) and Laurie Pestel as Vice-Chairperson (Dr. Rick Rinehart nominated her, and Bruce Alexander seconded). The Commission developed a new policy for literature cited during public comment. Any data that are to be referenced during the Public Comment period(s) should be limited to published, peer reviewed literature only. \"Data on file\" and \"articles submitted for review\" are not considered published, peer reviewed literature and should not be referenced during public testimony. All referenced data that is to be presented should be submitted to the DUR professional staff electronically at info@iadur.orq at least one week prior to the meeting date for consideration and distribution to the Commission members. This policy applies to any articles Commission members bring to the meetings themselves, as well. Craig Logemann motioned to accept this new policy, and Bruce Alexander seconded. The motion passed with no objections. lowa Medicaid Enterprise U~dates The Medical Services department at the IME is attempting to obtain URAC accreditation. As Dart of this Drocess. all of Medical Services' oolicies are uo for review at the next'clinical ~dbisor~ cbmmittee meeting. ~herk is a current 'state- wide movement to develop a patient-centered medical home. The University of lowa is sponsoring this project, and there will be a meeting September 18'h to discuss it. The SSDC met in June to discuss supplemental rebate negotiation. The P&T Committee will have its annual review of the PDL in November. Any changes will be effective January 1,2010. The Department of Human Services has put out a letter stating they will be providing RFP in the fall of this year for 7 of the 9 contracts that are currently being handled at the IME. New contracts will be effective July 1, 2010. Chad Bissell explained how his new position with the company contracted to provide the professional staffing services for the DUR Commission has resulted in a transition of primary duties to Pam Smith. Management Reports for Quarter 4 lowa Medicaid member enrollment, as well as number of claims, was down in the 4'h Quarter of State Fiscal Year 2009 compared to Quarter 3. The average price per claim was $63.88, which was also less than the $65.71 average for the 3rd quarter. Generic utilization is over 70% now. Behavioral Health drugs continue to dominate the top 5 drugs by dollars spent and top therapeutic classes by total prescriptions reports. However, Synagis was the top drug by dollars spent for the entire fiscal year, and ProAir HFA had the most prescriptions for SFY 2009. Public Comment Lisa Goetz, Pharm.D. (Medlmmune) and Susan Harrell, M.D. both spoke about Synagis. Geoff Wall, Pharm.D., from lowa Methodist Medical Center spoke about Uloric. PA Criteria Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Payment for a preferred thrombopoietin receptor agonist will only be considered for cases in which there is a diagnosis of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in addition to documentation of a recent trial and therapy failure with a preferred corticosteroid, a preferred immunoglobulin, and/or the member has undergone a splenectomy. Payment for a non-preferred thrombopoietin receptor agonist will be considered following documentation of a recent trial and therapy failure with a preferred thrombopoietin receptor agonist unless such a trial would be medically contraindicated. The Commission members had no further comments regarding these criteria. This recommendation will be sent to the Department for consideration. Uloric: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for febuxostat (Uloric). Payment for febuxostat (Uloric) will only be considered for cases in which symptoms of gout still persist while currently using a therapeutic dose of 300mg per day on a preferred allopurinol product unless documentation is provided that such a trial would be medically contraindicated. Bruce Alexander motioned to accept, Dr. Mark Graber seconded, and the motion passed unanimously. Craig Logemann also motioned that a quantity limit be placed on the 40mg Uloric tablet, limiting to 30 for 30 days, since the 40mg and 80mg tablets are the same price. Larry Ambroson seconded this. This also passed with no objections; however, Bruce Alexander abstained, as he was out of the room during the end of the discussion. Additionally, Pam Smith and Susan Parker explained how FUL and SMAC pricing, OBRA, and supplemental rebates work for the new Commission members. These recommendations will be sent to the medical and pharmacy association(s) for comments. Palivizumab (Synagis): In June, 2009, Red Book modified their guidelines for use of palivizumab (Synagis) for RSV prevention in high-risk infants and young children. Using additional data regarding the seasonality of RSV and risk factors for babies born between 32 and 35 weeks gestation, the guidelines for use have been modified to ensure costlbenefit optimization. The updated recommendations include: 1. Modz@cation of recommendations for initiation and termination of RSV prophylaxis based on current CDC descriptions of seasonality in different areas of the United States. 2. Emphasis on need for no more than a maximum of 5 doses in all geographic areas. 3. Modification of risk factors for severe disease (congenital abnormalities of the airway or neuromuscular disease) in infants less than 12 months of age and born before 35 weelm of gestation. 4. For infants 32 through 35 weeks ofgestation who qualifi for prophylaxis based on presence of risk factors, prophylaxis is recommended beyond 90 days of age (maximum of 3 doses) The Commission decided to leave the lowa Medicaid criteria for Synagis the same as what was used last year for now due to the lack of published evidence behind the new Red Book guidelines. The start date for PAS will be November 1'' (unless virology data shows it should be earlier), with an initial 5 doses approved; additional doses would be contingent upon RSV epidemiology data collected by the lowa Department of Public Health. However, this decision may be re-evaluated once the data that spawned the new Red Book guidelines is released. Annual Review of Clinical PA Criteria: The Commission members suggested some changes to existing PA criteria. Pam Smith recommended that since OTC cetirizine is now available (and a much more cost-effective alternative), that the criteria on the Antihistamine PA form be modified to require 3 preferred trials (among them OTC cetirizine and OTC loratadine) for any member 20 years of age or older, and a trial of both OTC cetirizine and OTC loratadine for anyone younger than 20. In the Biologicals for Ankylosing Spondylitis category, Chad Bissell recommended requiring a trial of 2 NSAlDs for a duration of 3 months, which matches the requirements of the Spartan Guidelines. If a member had only peripheral symptoms, they would also have to have a trial of a preferred DMARD product, such as sulfasalazine or methotrexate. For the Biologicals for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Dr. Graber made a comment about updated guidelines suggesting two DMARDS be tried prior to initiation therapy with a biological. These guidelines will be reviewed more closely and brought to a future meeting. It was suggested that the Ergotamine Derivatives PA form no longer be required as the category is not being utilized. A new product will be added to the Fentanyl PA Form. There will be new wording on the Ketorolac PA Form, as there is no longer a preferred ketorolac agent, as follows: \"prior to the consideration of IM/IV Ketorolac Injection, a recent trial and therapy failure with two preferred COX-2 preferrentially selective NSAIDs\". In the Muscle Relaxants category, Pam Smith said long term use of the non-preferred agents, specifically carisoprodol, had been an issue within the PA Department. Recommended duration of therapy with this drug is two to three weeks, and requests for chronic treatment are not uncommon. Susan Parker asked that Wellbutrin and Zyban be added to the Nicotine Replacement PA Form. Pam Smith said that the Pregabalin PA Form needed to be more specific; \"at adequate doses\" should be added to all line items so they match. Sandy Pranger suggested that criteria needed to be developed for Lidoderm, as Iowa sported the highest utilization at the SSDC meeting. Also, Januvia was suggested to have criteria developed. These criterion will be brought to future meetings for more specific discussion. Public Comment There were no speakers in this public comment section. Focus Studies Duplicate SSRls: The purpose of this study was to follow-up on the 15 unique members identified as having duplicate SSRls in their claims history for three consecutive months during the time frame 8/1/08 to 10/31/08. Letters were sent to providers at the end of December, 2008. Five unique members were still using duplicate SSRl therapy after DUR intervention. Ten members discontinued duplicate therapy which resulted in a total savings of $8,723.49 (State and Federal, pre-rebate), of which $3,280.03 (pre-rebate) were State funds. Long Acting Narcotics Plus Methadone: The purpose of this study was to follow-up on the 16 unique members identified as using methadone in combination with other long acting narcotics in their claims history during the time frame 8/1/08 to 11/30/08. Letters were sent to providers at the end of November, 2008. Ten unique members were still using methadone in combination with long acting narcotics after DUR intervention. However, six members' therapy changes resulted in a total savings of $2,081.70 (State and Federal, pre-rebate), of which $782.72 (pre-rebate) were State funds. Benzodiazepines withouf SSRI/SNRI: The purpose of this study was to determine how many lowa Medicaid members are being treated for various anxiety disorders with benzodiazepines but not a reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). At the February 2009 DUR Meeting, a report was generated which looked at duplicate benzodiazepine utilization for members between the time period of 9/1/2008 through 11/3012008. This report found 300 unique members who were using two or more benzodiazepines concurrently. In the discussion, an interest was expressed to look at members who were being treated for anxiety disorders with benzodiazepines but not an SSRIISNRI. A second report was reviewed at the June 2009 DUR meeting which looked at benzodiazepine use without an SSRIISNRI. Following a review of the diagnosis codes used to develop the study population, some changes were recommended. This report was run looking at members with a diagnosis code of panic disorder with agoraphobia, panic disorder without agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, andlor dysthymic disorder at anytime in their medical claims history. Members with Medicare Part D eligibility were excluded from this analysis. These members' pharmacy claim histories were reviewed to identify utilization with SSRllSNRls and benzodiazepines between the dates of 6/1/2008 and 6/30/2009. Those members who had two or more months of utilization with SSRllSNRls and benzodiazepines that continued therapy through the month of June, 2009 are reported. Eight thousand, seven hundred sixty members were identified as fitting these diagnostic criteria. As of June 2009, 45 members were still using BZD but no SSRIISNRI, 578 members were using both SSRllSNRl and BZD concurrently, and 912 members were using SSRIISNRI but no BZD. With such a small number of members, the Commission decided not to send letters. However, they asked that the data be re-run to evaluate if the members fitting the criteria but not taking BZD or SSRIISNRls were on Antipsychotics or Tricyclics. These findings will be brought to the November meeting. Utilization of Products for influenza: The purpose of this study was to provide trending information over several recent years' influenza treatment and outpatient vaccine utilization within the lowa Medicaid oooulation. (These data were collected prior to when the 2009 HI N1 influenza strain was identified.) Influenza is a highly contagious upper respiratory tract infection that affects several million Americans each year. Drugs that are commonly used to treat or prevent influenza, oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), amantadine, rimantadine, and the annual influenza vaccine, all appear on the Preferred Drug List as preferred products. During the 2008-2009 influenza season, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention revised their recommendations for treating seasonal influenza a couple of months into the influenza season after a high percentage of isolated strains showed resistance to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). The utilization data suggests that providers followed the CDC's revised recommendations when treating members with influenza. There is currently a quantity limit in place for oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for quantities greater than 75mL for the liquid and 14 units for the capsules. Compared to other Sovereign State Drug Consortium states, lowa has extremely high utilization of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) compared to other states of similar Medicaid size. Additionally, prior to the 2008-2009 season, there were several cases where members were treated twice in the same season with oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Susan Parker suggested contacting lowa Medicaid Member Services to see if they had any informational letters planned for this topic. Chronic Use of Metoclopramide: The purpose of this study was to identify instances where lowa Medicaid members are using metoclopramide on a chronic basis or high doses in light of the new black box warning issued by the FDA. Metoclopramide stimulates the upper gastrointestinal tract to increase motility and increase the rate of stomach emptying. It is FDA approved for short-term management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetic gastroparesis, and nausea. Short-term management is defined as 4 to12 weeks by the manufacturers of metoclopramide. Recently, the FDA announced that manufacturers of metoclopramide must include a Black Box Warning regarding the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia after receiving reports of this side effect with long term use or use at high doses. The symptoms of tardive dyskinesia are often times irreversible, and may continue to be bothersome for a considerable time following the discontinuation of the causative agent. The FDA reports suggest that metoclopramide is the most common cause of drug-induced tardive dyskinesia. A claims analysis was conducted over a six month time frame (111109 through 6130109) to identify: I) unique members (adult and children) with one or more fills of metoclopramide in their claims history, and 2) the number of unique members using a high dose of metoclopramide (>60mglday) for more than two months. Due to a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, the manufacturer does not recommend the use of metoclopramide in children. However, metoclopramide has been known to be used off-label in children for GERD. A second analysis was done to determine the extent of chronic metoclopramide use at three and four or more consecutive months. There were 23 members taking metoclopramide for four or more consecutive months, and four unique members on a high dose (more than 60mg per day). Dr. Wadle suggested that direct contact would achieve better results with this small population than an article in the DUR Digest. Some further analyses will be done to determine how many providers are involved in prescribing metoclopramide for long term use or at high doses. Miscellaneous SMAC Update: The Commission members were given a copy of the SMAC changes effective August 14, 2009. FUL Update: The Commission members were given a copy of the CMS FUL changes that were implemented July 17, 2009. MedWatch: The Commission members received FDA announcements concerning new Black Box Warnings. A unanimous vote was made at 12:26 to adjourn the meeting and move to closed session (lSt by Bruce Alexander 2\"d by Dr. Rick Rinehart). The next meeting will be held at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, September 2, 2009 at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines, IA. Attendees: - Commission Members Rick Rinehart. Pharrn.D. Staff Thomas Kline, D.O.; Chad iss sell, Pharm.D.; and Pam Smith, R.Ph. -- .- [ Wiggins, IME; Sandy praGger, R.Ph., IME; and Melissa Biddle, IME. Welcome & Introductions Dr. Thomas Kline called the meeting to order at 9:30 a.m. at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines. Commission members, guests, and observers were welcomed and introduced. The minutes from the August 5, 2009 meeting were approved following a correction from Bruce Alexander. (Motion by Dr. Rick Rinehart, second by Dr. Sara Schutte-Schenck, unanimous approval by voice vote.) Iowa Medicaid Enterprise Uadates Medical Services has been investigating prior authorization of elective CTs, MRls, PET scans, and MRAs for possible future savings. An estimated $27 million was spent on these last year, so there is an opportunity for savings. Medical Services is also in the process of developing a maternal health program with the Department of Public Health, attempting to identify all high-risk pregnant women in the state in their first trimester. Medical Services is working toward URAC accreditation. There will be a Clinical Advisory Committee meeting on September I lm; they will discuss Medipass provider reporting among other topics. The Mental Health Advisory Group meeting scheduled for Friday October 23' has now been cancelled. Case Studies Pam Smith presented four intervention case studies. Recommendations by omm missioners from these three examples resulted in an annualized total savings of $16,871.65 pre-rebate (state and federal). Public Comment Patricia Harwood (Medlmmune) and Susan Harrell (Blank Children's Hospital) both spoke about Synagis. Nancy Bell from Pfizer spoke about changes to the Lyrica prior authorization criteria. PA Criteria Uloric: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for febuxostat (Ulon'c). Payment for ,febuxostat (Uloric) will only be considered for cases in which symptoms of gout still persist while currently using 300mg per day of a preferred allopurinol product unless documentation is provided that such a trial would be medically contraindicated. There were four responses from members of the Iowa Pharmacy Association, in response to letters that had been sent out regarding these proposed criteria. Commission members were given a copy, but had no further changes. Bruce Alexander did suggest that the informational letter include an explanation of why the uric acid level was not part of the criteria as it had come up in discussion. Ketorolac: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for ketorolac tromethamine, a nonsteroidal anti- infammatoiy drug indicated for short term (up to five days) management of moderately severe, acute pain. It is NOT indicated for minor or chronic conditions. This product carries a Black Box Warning. Initiate therapy with IV/ZM and use oral ketorolac tromethamine only as a continuation therapy to ketorolac tromethamine IVlIM. The combined duration of use of IVlIM and oral is not to exceedfive (5) days. Payment will be approved under the,following conditions: 1. For oral therapy, documentation of recent IMLV ketorolac tromethamine injection including administration date and time, and the total number of injections given. 2. Request falls within the manufacturer's dosing guidelines. Maximum oral dose is 40mg/day. Maximum IV/IM dose is IZOmg/day. Maximum duration of therapy is 5 days per month. 3. Diagnosis indicating moderately severe, acute pain. Requests for IV/IM lcetorolac must document previous trials and therapy failures with at least two preferred nonsteroidal anti-inJammatoq~ drugs. The Commission asked that language be added to the last sentence indicating the two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug trials be at an adequate dose to keep consistent with other PA criteria. Bruce Alexander motioned to accept these criteria with the suggested change, and Craig Logemann seconded. The motion passed with no objections. Muscle Relaxants: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required,for non-preferred muscle relaxants. Payment for non-preferred muscle relaxants will be authorized only for cases in which there is documentation ofprevious trials and therapy failures with at least three preferred muscle relaxants. Requests for carisoprodol will be approved for a maximum of 120 tablets per 30 days within a six month timeframe when the criteria for coverage are met. Dr. Rick Rinehart motioned to accept these criteria, and Larry Ambroson seconded. The motion passed unanimously. Antihistamines: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for all non-preferred antihistamines and preferred 2nd generation prescription antihistamines. Patienls 21 years of age and older must have three unsuccessful trials with antihistamines that do not require prior authorization, prior to the approval of a preferred IS' generation or preferred 2\"d generation prescription antihistamine. Two of the trials must be otc cetirizine and loratadine. Prior to approval of a non- preferred 2\"\" generation antihistamine, in addition to the above criteria, there must be an unsuccessful trial with a preferred 2\"d generation prescription antihistamine. Patients 20 years of age and younger must have unsuccessfil trials with otc cetirizine and loratadine prior to the approval of a non-preferred IS' generation or preferred 2\"d feneration prescription antihistamine. Prior to approval of a non-preferred 2\" generation antihistamine, in addition to the above criteria, there must be an unsuccessful trial with a preferred 2\"d generation prescription antihistamine. The required trials may be overridden when documented evidence is provided that the use of these agents would be medically contraindicated. Craig Logemann motioned to accept these criteria, and Bruce Alexander seconded. The motion passed unanimously. Fentanyl - Shorf Acting Oral Products: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for short acting oral fentanyl products. Payment will be considered only if the diagnosis is,for breakthrough cancer pain in opioid tolerant patients. These products carry a Black Box Warning. ActiqB, FentoraB, & OnsolisTM: * Are indicated only for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies already receiving and tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. Are contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain. Because life-threatening hypoventilation could occur at any dose in patients not taking chronic opiates, do not use in opioid non-tolerantpatients. Bruce Alexander motioned to accept these criteria, and Dr. Rick Rinehart seconded. The motion passed unanimously. Pregabalin (Lyrics): The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for pregabalin (LyricaO). Payment will be considered under the following conditions: 1. A diagnosis ofpartial onset seizures, as adjunct therapy. 2. A diagnosis of post-herpetic neuralgia and previous treatment failure with at least two of the following agents at a therapeutic dose to treat post-herpetic neuralgia: tricyclic antidepressant, topical lidocaine, or gabapentin. 3. A diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and previous treatment failure with at least two of the following agents at a therapeutic dose to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy: tricyclic antidepressant, topical lidocaine, tramadol, or gabapentin. 4. A diagnosis ofjbromyalgia and a previous treatment failure with a preferred agent at a therapeutic dose to treatjbromyalgia. This topic was deferred to a future meeting so as to give time to review why the original language did not have \"a therapeutic dose\" added to #2 and #3. Bruce Alexander motioned that all references to \"adequate\" dose on all PA forms be replaced with \"therapeutic\" dose. Dr. Mark Graber seconded, and the motion passed with no objections. Palivizumab (Synagis): In August 2009, the American Academy of Pediatricians modified their guidelines for use of palivizumab {Synagis) for RSV prevention in high-risk infants and young children. Using 'additional data regarding the seasonality of RSV and risk factors for babies born between 32 and 35 weeks gestation, the guidelines for use have been modified to ensure costlbenefit optimization. The updated recommendations include: I. Modification of recommendations for initiation and termination of RSV prophylaxis based on current CDC descriptions of seasonality in different areas of the United States. 2. Emphasis on need for no more than a maximum of 5 doses in all geographic areas. 3. Modzjkation of rislz.factorsfor severe disease (congenital abnormalities of the airway or neuromuscular disease) in infants less than 12 months of age and born before 35 week of gestation. 4. For infants 32 through 35 weeh ofgestation who qualzfi for prophylaxis based on presence of risk factors, prophylaxis is recommended beyond 90 days of age (maximum of 3 doses) Dr. Mark Graber motioned to move the start date for Synagis coverage back to November 16'~ and to allow for 5 doses, which would bring some cost savings for the State. Dr. Casey Clor seconded, and the motion passed unanimously. As the Commission then seemed to be at a standstill regarding their opinion of adopting the new Red Book guidelines, Dr. Mark Graber motioned to accept the Red Book guidelineslAAP policy statement and Dr. Casey Clor seconded. However, upon voting, the majority opposed this motion, as well as 3 (Laurie Pestel, Dr. Mark Graber, and Dr. Sarah Schutte-Schenck) abstaining. Therefore, the Synagis PA criteria will remain the same as last year, but with the modified start date and maximum of 5 doses for the season. Public Comment There were no speakers in this public comment section. Focus Studies Tiotropium plus lpratropium: The purpose of this study was to follow-up on the 35 unique members identified as having duplicate inhaled anticholinergics (tiotropium and ipratropium) in their claims history between the time period of 9/1/2008 through 11/30/2008. Letters were sent to providers in March, 2009. Following the intervention, there were only 17 members using duplicate therapy, a change which brought about a cost savings of $60,629.33 (state and federal pre-rebate). ACE lnhibitors combined with Angiotensin Receptor Blockers: The purpose of this study was to identify instances where Iowa Medicaid members are using Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) lnhibitors in combination with Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB). The ONgoing Tehnisartan Alone, in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) was a multi-year study that examined 25,620 patients to compare the effects of telmisartan (Micardis) alone, telmisartan in combination with ramipril (Alface), and an ACE lnhibitor alone in patients with established atherosclerotic vascular disease or diabetes with end- organ damage who were 55 years of age or older. Patients who used the ACE lnhibitor and ARB combination had 2-3 mmlHg lower overall blood pressure compared to patients using monotherapy; however, more patients experienced hypotensive side effects when using the combination. Overall, the primary outcome (death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, time to first dialysis, doubling of serum creatinine, or death) was the same in all three groups of patients. Therefore, the combination of ACE lnhibitors and ARBs is not recommended as it does not reduce poor outcomes and actually increases the likelihood of adverse drug events compared to either drug used alone. However, these findings do not apply to patients with congestive heart failure, as this group of patients was specifically excluded from the ONTARGET trial. Potential benefits of combining ACE lnhibitors and ARBS have been found in studies of patients with poorly controlled congestive heart failure. Reports also show that the combination of an ACE lnhibitor and an ARB is superior to either therapy alone in decreasing proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. An analysis was performed looking at three months worth of pharmacy claims history (April 1, 2009 - June 30, 2009). Members using ACE lnhibitors and ARBs were identified, in addition to members using the combination as defined as two or more consecutive months. Six thousand, nine hundred nineteen (6,919) unique members were identified, of which only 73 met the criteria for further analysis. Just 72 of them had a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, and nine had diabetes with renal manifestations. The prescribers of the remaining members without a valid diagnosis will be contacted at the request of the Commission. Ophthalmic Fluoroquinolones and Macrolides for Bacterial Conjuncfivitis: The purpose of this study was to identify instances where Iowa Medicaid members are prescribed ophthalmic fluoroquinolones as first line treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the eye that affects both adults and children. It is spread by direct contact with infected secretions and contaminated objects. A patient with bacterial conjunctivitis will typically present with redness and discharge from one or both eyes, and is often times described as being \"stuck shut\" in the morning. A thick, globular, purulent discharge continues throughout the day and may appear yellow, white, or green. The most common organisms responsible for bacterial conjunctivitis include Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilius influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause in adults, where other organisms listed are more commonly found in children. The American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines on treating bacterial conjunctivitis state that \"The choice of antibiotic is usually empirical. Since a 5-to-7-day course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is usually effective, the most convenient or least expensive option can be selected.\" The recommended first line treatment options for bacterial conjunctivitis include erythromycin ophthalmic ointment (particularly for children), sulfacetamine ophthalmic drops, or polymyxin/trimethoprim drops. Most common organisms responsible for bacterial conjunctivitis respond to these agents within one to two days with a marked decrease in discharge, irritation, and redness. Alternative treatments include bacitracin ointment, sulfacetamide ointment, ~olvmvxin/bacitracin ointment, fluoroauinolone drops or azithromycin drops. ~mhd~l~coside drops are not recommknded as they can be toxic to-the cornka~ epithelium and can cause reactive keratoconjunctivitis after several days use. Due to the considerable cost difference between the recommended first line therapy ophthalmic antibiotics, fluoroquinolone drops, and azithromycin drops, it would be most cost effective to initiate therapy with a preferred first line therapy ophthalmic antibiotic drop or ointment. It would be desirable to shift prescribing practices away from fluoroquinolones and azithromycin drops to preferred first line therapy ophthalmic antibiotics, except for cases in which patients have had ocular surgery or are contact lens wearers. An analysis was performed looking at three months worth of pharmacy claims history (March 1, 2009 - May 31, 2009). Members who had claims for fluoroquinolone drops or azithromycin drops without a claim for a preferred first line therapy ophthalmic antibiotic solution/ointment (suggesting that the recommended first line therapy ophthalmic antibiotic product was not tried prior to switching to a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin product after a therapeutic failure) were identified. 94.8% of identified members were using a fluoroquinolone or macrolide ophthalmic antibiotic as first line therapy. Dr. Rick Rinehart motioned that this issue be referred to the P&T Committee, with the hope that they would make ophthalmic fluoroquinolones and macrolides non-preferred on the PDL. Dr. Sara Schutte- Schenck seconded, and the motion passed unanimously. Rate of Compliance with Atypical Antipsychotics: A medication possession ratio was run on new starters (with continuous Medicaid eligibility during the timeframe of April lSt through June 3oth) of an antipsychotic regimen. An NPR of greater than 80% was enough to signify that a patient had sufficient adherence to the therapy. There were 2,958 new starters total, of which 93.5% had sufficient adherence. Geodon (ziprasidone), which is dosed twice daily, actually had the highest adherence rate. The Commission asked that a longer time frame (six months minimum) be examined, as well as focusing on quantity and days supply to see where compliance drops off. Drugs that cause Edema: The purpose of this study was to identify instances where prescribers were prescribing medications that typically cause edema as a side effect in disease states that often have edema present as a symptom. Edema is defined as palpable swelling as a result of interstitial fluid volume expansion. There are many different clinical conditions that can cause edema such as heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephroitic syndrome. Certain medications can also cause edema as a side effect. When used in patients with peripheral edema, the addition of these drugs can cause worsening symptoms of edema such as swollen legs, difficulty walking, increased abdominal girth, and shortness of breath due to pressure on the diaphragm. These patients become high utilizers of prescribers' offices and emergency departments seeking medical care for the discomfort caused by the worsening edema. An analysis was performed to identify instances where prescribers were prescribing medications that typically cause edema as a side effect in Iowa Medicaid members who have disease states that commonly cause edema. The Commission asked that these findings be narrowed down to members who have had a heart failure diagnosis resulting in hospital admission, and take out those already on diuretics. Tamoxifen Interactions with Select SSRls: The purpose of this study was to identify instances where members were combining tamoxifen with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRls). Two observational studies were presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology that looked at the effect of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors in patients taking tamoxifen in preventing recurrence of breast cancer. One of these two studies found that women who took CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as SSRls, had a higher recurrence rate. Women being treated for breast cancer with tamoxifen are frequently prescribed SSRls to help manage depression and decrease hot flashes (off label use). Tamoxifen requires metabolization by CYP2D6 to become pharmacologically active. SSRls such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, are strong inhibitors of CYP206. Sertraline is a mild inhibitor of CYP2D6, and citalopram and escitalopram are weak inhibitors of CYP2D6. Since there is no good evidence that one SSRI is more effective than another for treating depression, it may be appropriate to recommend use of citalopram or escitalopram for treatment of depression in women who are also taking tamoxifen. An analysis was done over a three month time period (5-1-09 through 7-31-09) to determine how many women using tamoxifen were also using an SSRI. Of those members identified, a total of 32 (23.4%) were using tamoxifen with an SSRi during the past three months (5/1/09 through 7/31/09). The prescribers of the 16 members who were identified as using SSRls that are inhibitors of CYP2D6 in combination with tamoxifen will be contacted, and an article reminding prescribers of this drug-drug interaction will be published in the next DUR Digest. Miscellaneous DUR Digest: The Commission members offered suggested changes to the draft for 2009 Volume 22, Number I. FUL Update: The Commission members were given a copy of the CMS FUL changes that were implemented August 28, 2009. MedWatch: The Commission members received FDA announcements concerning new Black Box Warnings. A unanimous vote was made at 12:OO to adjourn the meeting and move to closed session (1'' by Dr. Casey Clor, 2\" by Bruce Alexander). i The next meeting will be held at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 4, 2009 at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines, IA. Attendees: Commission Members Rick Rinehart. M.D.: .. . sandy Pranger, R.Ph., IME; and Melissa Biddle, IME. 1 Welcome & Introductions Dr. Mark Graber called the meeting to order at 9:31 a.m. at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines. Commission members, guests, and observers were welcomed and introduced. The minutes from the September 2, 2009 meeting were approved following a spelling correction from Bruce Alexander. (Motion by Bruce Alexander, second by Dr. Sara Schutte-Schenck, unanimous approval by voice vote.) lowa Medicaid Enterprise Updates The re-procurement process is currently underway, with almost all of the IME contracts uo for bid. The Deoartment of Human Services is still in the orocess of finalizing the required budgei cuts. Susan Parker reported some of thd proposed changes are as follows: The 30-day override for non-preferred drugs on the PDL will be eliminated. The dispensing fee will be lowered to $4.34, which is a temporary rate cut effective December 1,2009 through June 30,2010. There will also be some changes to SMAC, and the way that reimbursement is set; the multiplier for that formula will be decreased form 1.4 to 1.2, and the average acquisition cost based solely on generic pricing now. Additionally, a specialty drug list has been created. AWP Reimbursement for drugs on this list will be AWP minus at a rate > AWP minus 12%. AWP reimbursement methodology will no longer be an option within less than two years, because of the lawsuit regarding First Data Bank. Member coverage has thus far not been affected. However, as the lowa Medicaid population continues to grow, it will become increasingly difficult to provide benefits with a decreased budget. Lastly, Sandy Pranger reported that the next P&T Committee Meeting will be held November 12'~, for the annual PDL review to determine next the PDL for 2010 will occur. Quarterlv Manaqement Report The average amount paid per claim was down to $62.52, compared to $63.59 last quarter; 1,005,342 claims resulted in a total amount paid of $62,854,354.45. The number of eligible members continues to increase; it was 366,476 in the first quarter of State Fiscal Year 2010. Iowa's unemployment rate was 6.7% in September 2009, which is much lower than the national average of 9.8%. ProAir HFA remains the top drug by number of prescriptions per NDC. The top drugs by dollars spent were all mental health drugs. The therapeutic class by total prescriptions report remained the same as last quarter, with SSRls in the top spot. The therapeutic class by dollars spent also kept the same line-up, with Atypical Antipsychotics costing $10,899,841.64. Lastly, generic utilization was up to 70.85% last quarter. Case Studies Pam Smith presented four intervention case studies. Recommendations by a om missioners from these four examples resulted in an annualized total savings of $2,157.89 pre-rebate (state and federal). Annual Smoking Cessation Report The Commission was presented with a copy of the current year's draft report, as well as the finalized report that had been sent to the legislature in 2008. Jeremy Whitaker from the lowa Department of Public Health was on hand for questions. Quitline received 5,473 fax referrals for lowa Medicaid members between October I, 2008 and September 30, 2009, of which 3,339 were enrolled in the program. A total of 9,207 prior authorization requests were received in that same time span for smoking cessation products, of which 6,852 were approved. There were 5,682 prescriptions dispensed, costing just over $512,000. Of that, Chantix costs alone came to $402,000. Administration costs totaled $102,000. The Commission members requested that a report be run to identify any members taking Chantix and antidepressants concurrently. Bruce Alexander recommended searching for any related hospitalizations. A revised report will be brought to the next meeting in December. Public Comment Jennifer Stoeffel from Ortho-McNeil Janssen spoke about Nucynta. PA Criteria Bupropion SR for Smoking Cessation: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior Authorization is required for varenicline (ChantixTM) or bupropion SR that is FDA approved for smoking cessation. Requests for authorization must include: 1) Diagnosis of nicotine dependence and referral to the Quitline Iowa program for counseling. 2) Con$mation of enrollment and ongoing participation in the Quitline Iowa counselingprogram is required for approval and continued coverage. 3) Approvals will only be granted for patients eighteen years of age and older. 4) The duration of therapy is initially limited to twelve week within a twelve- month period. For patients who have successfully stopped smoking at the end of 12 week, an additional course of 12 week treatment will be considered with a prior authorization request. The maximum duration of approvable therapy is 24 week within a twelve month period. 5) Requests for varenicline to be used in combination with bupropion SR that is FDA indicated for smoking cessation or nicotine replacement therapy will not be approved. 6) The 72-hour' emergency supply rule does not apply for drugs used for the treatment of smoking cessation. Bruce Alexander motioned to accept these criteria, and Dr. Casey Clor seconded. The motion passed unanimously. Short-Acting Narcotics: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for all non-preferred short acting narcotics. Payment will be considered for cases in which there is documentation of previous trial(s) and therapy failures with three (3) chemically distinct preferred short acting narcotics (based on narcotic ingredient only) at therapeutic doses, unless evidence is provided that the use of these products would be medically contraindicated. Dr. Casey Clor motioned to accept these criteria, and Bruce Alexander seconded. The motion passed unanimously. Proton Pump Inhibitors: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is not required for the preferred proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for a cumulative 60 days of therapy per 12-month period. Prior authorization will be required for all non-preferred proton pump inhibitors as indicated on the Iowa Medicaid Preferred Drug List beginning the first day of therapy. Payment,for a non- preferred proton pump inhibitor will be authorized only for cases in which there is documentation of previous trials and therapy failures with three preferred products. Prior authorization is required for any PPI usage longer than 60 days or more frequently than one 60-day course per 12-month period. The 12-month period is patient specific and begins 12 months before the requested date ofprior authorization. Payment for usage beyond these limits will be authorized for cases in which there is a diagnosis of: 1.Specific Hypersecretory conditions documentation of previous therapy failure with at least one histamine H2-receptor antagonist at full therapeutic 5.Recurrent peptic ulcer disease after documentation of previous trials and therapy failure with at least one histamine HZ-receptor antagonist atfi*ll therapeutic doses and with documentation of either failure of Helicobacter pylori treatment or a negative Helicobacterpylori test result. Prior authorization is NOT required for Prevacid SoluTabs for children age 8 years old or younger for the first 60 days of therapy. Prior authorization is required for Prevacid SoluTabs for patients over 8 years of age beginning day one of therapy. Authorization for Prevacid SoluTabs will be considered for those patients who cannot tolerate a solid oral dosage form. The required trials may be overridden when documented evidence is provided that the use of these agents would be medically contraindicated. Dr. Casey Clor motioned to accept these criteria, and Dr. Sara Schutte-Schenck seconded. The motion passed unanimously. Biologicals for Ankylosing Spondylitis: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for biologicals used for ankylosing spondylitis. Payment will be considered following inadequate responses to at least two preferred non-steroidal anti-injlammatories (NSAIDs) at maximum doses unless there are documented adverse responses or contraindications to NSAID use. These trials should be at least three months in duration. Patients with symptoms of peripheral arthritis must also have failed a 30-day treatment trial with at least one conventional disease modzjj&g antirheumatic drug (DMARS), unless there is a documented adverse response or contraindication to DMARD gold, is required for all non-preferred biologicals for ankylosing spondylitis as indicated on the Iowa Medicaid Preferred Drug List beginning the first day of therapy. Payment for non-preferred biologicals for ankylosing spondylitis will be considered only for cases in which there is documentation of a previous trial and therapy,failure with a preferred agent. Following a discussion of the \"International ASAS Consensus Statement for the use of Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Agents in Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis\", Dr. Casey Clor motioned to accept these criteria, and Craig Logemann seconded. The motion passed unanimously. Biologicals for Arthritis: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Pvior authorization is required for biologicals used for arthritis. Payment will be considered following an inadequate response to a preferred disease modzjjing antirheumatic drug such as hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotvexate, lejlunomide, Prior authorization is required for all non-preferred biologicals for arthritis as indicated on the Iowa Medicaid Preferred Drug List beginning the first day of therapy. Payment for non-preferred biologicals for arthritis will be considered only for cases in which there is documentation of a previous trial and therapy failure with a prefrred agent. The Commission members asked that a rheumatologist be contacted for input prior to any changes in prior authorization criteria. Ketorolac: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for ketorolac tromethamine, a nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug indicated for short term (up to five days) management of moderately severe, acute pain. It is NOT indicated for minor or chronic conditions. This product carries a Black Box Warning. Initiate therapy with IVNM and use oral ketorolac tromethamine only as a continuation therapy to ketorolac tromethamine IV/IM. The combined duration of use of IVNM and oral is not to exceedjbe (5) days. Payment will be approved under the following conditions: I. For oral therapy, documentation of recent IMW ketorolac tromethamine injection including administration date and time, and the total number of injections given. 2. Request falls within the manufacturer's dosing guidelines. Maximum oral dose is 40mg/day. Maximum IVNM dose is 120mg/day. Maximum duration of therapy is 5 days per month. 3. Diagnosis indicating moderately severe, acute pain. Requests for IV/IM lcetorolac must document previous trials and therapy failures with at least two preferred nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at adequate doses. As this was the second review of this topic, no motion was necessary. The Commission members had no further comments. Muscle Relaxants: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for non-preferred muscle relaxants. Payment for non-preferred muscle relaxants will be authorized only for cases in which there is documentation ofprevious trials and therapy failures with at least three preferred muscle relanaizts. Requests,for carisoprodol will be approved for a maximum of 120 tablets per 180 days at a maximum dose of 4 tablets per day when the criteria for coverage are met. Although a vote was taken, (Dr. Rick Rinehart motioned to accept these criteria, and Larry Ambroson seconded. The motion passed unanimously.) it was not required as this was the second review and there were no recommended changes. Antihistamines: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for all non-preferred antihistamines and preferred second generation prescription antihistamines. Patients 21 years of age and older must have three unsuccessful trials with antihistamines that do not require prior authorization, prior to the approval of a preferred first generation or preferred second generation prescription antihistamine. Two of the trials must be with cetirizine and loratadine. Prior to approval of a non-preferred second generation antihistamine, in addition to the above criteria, there must be an unsuccessful trial with a preferred second generation prescription antihistamine. Patients 20 years of age and younger must have unsuccessful trials with cetirizine and loratadine prior to the approval of a non-preferred first generation or preferred second generation prescription antihistamine. Prior to approval of a non-preferred second generation antihistamine, in addition to the above criteria, there must be an unsuccessful trial with a preferred second generation prescription antihistamine. The required trials may be overridden when documented evidence is provided that the use of these agents would be medically contraindicated. Although a vote was taken (Craig Logemann motioned to accept these criteria, and Dr. Sara Schutte-Schenck seconded. The motion passed unanimously.) it was not required as this was the second review and there were no recommended changes. Fentanyl - Short Acting Oral Products: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for short acting oral fentanyl products. Payment will be considered only if the diagnosis is for breakthrough cancer pain in opioid tolerant patients. These products carry a Black Bo x Warning. ActiqB, FentoraB, & OnsolisTM: Are indicated only for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies already receiving and tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. * Are contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain. Because life-threatening hypoventilation could occur at any dose in patients not taking chronic opiates, do not use in opioid non-tolerantpatients. Although a vote was taken, (Bruce Alexander motioned to accept these criteria, and Dr. Mark Graber seconded. The motion passed unanimously.), it was not required as this was the second review and there were no recommended changes. Public Comment There were no speakers in this public comment section. Focus Studies TZD iolus Conaestive Heart Failure: The Qurwose of study was to follow- up or; the 72 ucique members identified as having a diagnosis of CHF while on a TZD during the time frame of 7/1/2008 through 12/31/2008. Letters were sent to providers in March 2009. Fourteen members discontinued a TZD after the DUR intervention. This resulted in a total cost savings of $136,555.61 (state and federal pre-rebate). Benzodiazepines without SSRI/SNRI: The purpose of this study was to determine how many Iowa Medicaid members are using alternative mental health drugs instead of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) in members with panic disorder with agoraphobia, panic disorder without agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and/or dysthymic disorder. At the August 2009 DUR Meeting, a report was generated which looked at members with a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia, panic disorder without agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and/or dysthymic disorder at anytime in their medical claims history, and what drug therapies (SSRI, SNRI, and/or benzodiazepine) were being prescribed. Due to the high number of members who met these criteria, but showed no current treatment with antidepressants or benzodiazepines (7,225), the Commission was interested in seeing if other mental health drugs and/or anticonvulsants were being used as treatment. Further analysis was done to remove members with a diagnosis code for epilepsy or seizure disorder from the members who fit the diagnostic criteria listed above, who were not being treated with an SSRI, an SNRI, or a benzodiazepine. The pharmacy claims histories for the remaining members were searched over a one year time frame (611108 through 6/30/09) for Antipsychotics and Bus~arhus~irone. Each hember who had two or more fills of one or moredrugs'from these classes who then continued therapy into July 2009 were accounted for. One-hundred-sixty-nine unique members were identified as fitting the above criteria. Bruce Alexander pointed out there are a total of 113 members using an antipsychotic and the focus should be on these members for current treatment and additional diagnoses. These findings will be brought to a future meeting: Lithium Drug-Drug Interactions: The purpose of this study was to identify instances where Iowa Medicaid members are combining lithium with drugs that can potentially interact and cause lithium toxicity. Drug-drug interactions between lithium and ACE Inhibitors, diuretics, NSAIDs, andlor COX-2 lnhibitors are frequently identified on the member-specific profile reviews done for each meeting. Lithium and sodium compete for reabsorption in the kidneys. When sodium is depleted, lithium is reabsorbed at a greater rate and serum lithium levels rise, possibly leading to toxicity. While it is not an absolute contraindication, when lithium is combined with ACE lnhibitors andlor certain diuretics, the depletion of sodium can lead to an increase in serum lithium levels. Similarly, NSAlDs and COX-2 lnhibitors can affect the renal proximal tubular resorption of lithium, thus increasing serum lithium levels. Symptoms of lithium toxicity include ataxia, confusion, and tremor. It is recommended that patients be closely monitored anytime a new drug from the above mentioned classes are added to a lithium regimen for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity. Close monitoring is also recommended anytime there is a dose change of these products. An analysis was performed looking at paid, non-reversed pharmacy claims over a six month time period (111109 through 6130109). Members who had two or more fills for lithium during this time frame were identified. Once those members were identified, a second analysis was done to see how many of these patients were combining lithium with an ACE Inhibitor, a diuretic (loop or thaizide), a blood pressure product combined with a diuretic (i.e. lisinopril HCTZ), an NSAID, or a COX-2 Inhibitor. Those who continued the combination of lithium and a potential interacting drug into the month of July 2009 were selected for review. These findings will be narrowed down to target the prescribers of the 34 members who are receiving their prescriptions from different prescribers, adding in members who are also taking ARBS. Miscellaneous DUR Digest: The Commission members were given a completed copy of 2009 Volume 22, Number 1. FUL Update: The Commission members were given a copy of the CMS FUL changes that were implemented September 25,2009, as well as SMAC changes that went into effect in October. MedWatch: The commission members received FDA announcements concerning new Black Box Warnings. A unanimous vote was made at 11:20 to adjourn the meeting and move to closed session (lSt by Bruce Alexander, 2\"d by Dr. Mark Graber). The next meeting will be held at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, December 2,2009 at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines, IA. Attendees: Commission Members Rick Rinehart, Chairman Dr. Mark Graber called the meeting to order at 9:30 a.m. at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines. Commission members, guests, and observers were welcomed and introduced. The minutes from the November 4, 2009 meeting were approved following a spelling correction from Bruce Alexander. (Motion by Dr. Casey Clor, second by Larry Ambroson, unanimous approval by voice vote.) lowa Medicaid Enterprise Updates There were none. Case Studies Pam Smith presented four intervention case studies. Recommendations by Commissioners from these four examples resulted in annualized total savings of $6,071.61 pre-rebate (state and federal). Annual Smokinq Cessation Report The Commission was presented with a copy of the current year's draft report. Their additional recommendations will be added, and a revised report will be brought to the next meeting in February. MMWR - State Medical Coverage for Tobacco-Dependence Treatments The Commission members reviewed this report created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Varenicline Safety Recent varenicline (Chantix) utilization within the lowa Medicaid program was reviewed to evaluate use in 'patients with underlying mental health 'disorders, as well as those who develop new mental health disorders after starting varenicline. Commission members had expressed interest in this at a previous meeting. They also were curious if these prescribing practices resulted in an increased number of hospitalizations for psychiatric reasons. Additionally, a query was conducted of other state Medicaid programs asking what type of specific criteria restrictions were in place for varenicline when a past history of psychiatric disorders is present or if it is left to the discretion of the prescriber. Seventeen states responded, of which 15 states leave it to the discretion of the prescriber. Two states, lndiana and Washington, have restrictions specific to psychiatric disorders. lndiana currently denies a claim if the member has a diagnosis of depression, suicidal behaviorlattempt, or psychosis and has not previously tried both NTR and buproprion in the past two years, unless otherwise contraindicated. Washington has specific criteria based on FDA labeling and denies claims if there is history of a psychiatric disorder. Two analyses were performed looking at paid, non-reversed Iowa Medicaid pharmacy claims over a recent six month time frame (May I, 2009 through October 31, 2009). The first analysis looked at members who were taking an antidepressant and added varenicline. The second analysis looked at members who started varenicline who then added an antidepressant shortly thereafter. Medical claims were also reviewed during this time to identify how many members required hospitalization for psychiatric illness shortly after starting varenicline. A total of 1,207 unique members were on varenicline during this time frame. One hundred eleven of them added an antidepressant (SSRI, SNRI, TCA, andlor MAOI) after starting varenicline, and three new varenicline starters had a hospitalization for a psychiatric reason. Claims data will be re-evaluated to search for psychiatric breaks and/or mood stabilizing medications, and the prescribers of these 11 1 members will be contacted. Public Comment Nancy Bell from Pfizer spoke about Chantix and fibromyalgia PA criteria. Eric urns from Alcon Labs spoke about ophthalmic antibiotic criteria changes, and Farid Manshadi, a physician, spoke about Savella and fibromyalgia criteria. Pro-DUR Edits Armodafinil - Proposed Age Limit: On August 1, 2007, the DUR Commission voted in favor of following an age restriction per the package insert of modafinil (Provigil) restricting use to members 16 years of age and older to prevent off- label use. Since implementation, there have been no issues regarding the age edit on modafinil. There have been several requests for off-label use of the drug in children to treat ADHD. To prevent off label use of armodafinil (Nuvigil), it is being proposed to add an age edit to restrict use to members 17 years of age and older. Bruce Alexander motioned to accept this recommendation, and Larry Ambroson seconded. The motion passed with no objections. Brand Opthalmic Fluroquinolone Products - Proposed Age Edit: The P&T Committee had voted in favor of changing the status of brand ophthalmic fluoroquinolone products to non-preferred for members less than 18 years of age. This was in response to the DUR Commission's recommendation from September 3, 2009, requesting the P&T Committee consider making all ophthalmic fluoroquinolones non-preferred on the PDL, to shift utilization towards less expensive, first-line treatment options when treating bacterial conjunctivitis since ophthalmic fluoroquinolones are not considered first line options. The DUR Commission disagreed with the P&T Committees recommendation, and again proposed that all ophthalmic fluoroquinolones be non-preferred for children 18 years of age and younger. Dr. Schutte-Schenck suggested DUR staff contact pediatric ophthalmologists to get their opinion on how this will affect their practice. This topic will be taken back to the next P&T Committee meeting. PA Criteria Bupropion SR for Smoking Cessation: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior Authorization is required for varenicline (ChantiiTM) or bupropion SR that is FDA approved for smoking cessation. Requestsfor authorization must include: I) Diagnosis of nicotine dependence and referral to the Quitline Iowa program for counseling. 2) Confirmation of enrollment and ongoing participation in the Quitline Iowa counselingprogram is required for approval and continued coverage. 3) Approvals will only be granted for patients eighteen years of age and older. 4) The duration of therapy is initially limited to twelve weeks within a twelve- month period. For patients who have successfilly stopped smoking at the end of 12 weeks, an additional course of 12 weelis treatment will be considered with a prior authorization request. The maximum duration of approvable therapy is 24 weeks within a twelve-month period. 5) Requests for varenicline to be used in combination with bupropion SR that is FDA indicated for smoking cessation or nicotine replacement therapy will not be approved. 6) The 72-hour emergency supply rule does not apply for drugs used for the treatment of smoking cessation. No motion was necessary as this was the second review of the topic. The criteria will now be forwarded to the Department of Human Services (DHS). Proton Pump Inhibitors: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is not required for the preferred proton pump inhibitors (PPl),for a cumulative 60 days of therapy per 12-month period. Prior authorization will be required for all non-preferred proton pump inhibitors as indicated on the Iowa Medicaid Preferred Drug List beginning the$rst day of therapy. Payment,for a non- preferred proton pump inhibitor will be authorized only for cases in which there is documentation of previous trials and therapy failures with three preferred products. Prior authorization is required for any PPI usage longer than 60 days or more Jlequently than one 60-day course per 12-month period. The 12-month period is patient specijk and begins 12 months before the requested date ofprior authorization. Payment for usage beyond these limits will be authorized for cases in which there is a diagnosis of: l.Speczj?c Hyperseeretoy conditions afler documentation of previous trials and therapy failure with at least one histamine H2-receptor antagonist at full therapeutic doses. 5.Recurrent peptic ulcer disease a& documentation of previous trials and therapy failure with at least one histamine H2-receptor antagonist at full therapeutic doses and with documentation of either failure of Helicobacter pylori treatment or a negative Helicobacter pylori test result. Prior authorization is NOT required for Prevacid SoluTabs for children age 8 years old or younger for the first 60 days of therapy. Prior authorization is required for Prevacid SoluTabs for patients over 8 years of age beginning day one of therapy. Authorization for Prevacid SoluTabs will be considered for those patients who cannot tolerate a solid oral dosage form. The required trials may be overridden when documented evidence is provided that the use of these agents would be medically contraindicated. No motion was necessary as this was the second review of the topic. The criteria will now be forwarded to DHS. Biologicals for Ankylosing Spondylitis: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for biologicals used for ankylosing spondylitis. Payment will be considered following inadequate responses to at least two preferred non-steroidal anti-inzammatories (NSAIDs) at maximum doses unless there are documented adverse responses or contraindications to NSAID use. These trials should be at least three months in duration. Patients with symptoms of peripheral arthn'tis must also have failed a 30-day treatment trial with at least one conventional disease modifiing antirheumatic dmg (DMARD), unless there is a documented adverse response or contraindication to DMARD gold, is required for all non-preferred biologicals for ankylosing spondylitis as indicated on the Iowa Medicaid Preferred Drug List beginning the first day of therapy. Payment for non-preferred biologicals for ankylosing spondylitis will be considered only for cases in which there is documentation of a previous trial and therapy failure with a preferred agent. No motion was necessary as this was the second review of this topic. The criteria will now be forwarded to DHS. Short-Acting Narcotics: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for all non-preferred short acting narcotics. Payment will be considered for cases in which there is documentation ofprevious trial@) and therapy,failures with three (3) chemically distinct preferred short acting narcotics (based on narcotic ingredient only) at therapeutic doses, unless evidence is provided that the use of these products would be medically contraindicated. No motion was necessary as this was the second review of this topic. The criteria will now be forwarded to DHS. Biologicals for Arthritis: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for biologicals used for arthritis. Payment will be considered following an inadequate response to a preferred disease mod~fiing antirheumatic drug such as hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, lejlunomide, Prior authorization is required for all non-preferred biologicals for arthritis as indicated on the Iowa Medicaid Preferred Drug List beginning the jrst day of therapy. Payment for non-preferred biologicals for arthritis will be considered only for cases in which there is documentation of a previous trial and therapy failure with a preferred agent. Dr. Graber volunteered to speak to some rheumatologists to get their input on the new criteria. The topic will then be revisited. Cymbalta, Lyrica, Savella: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria follows: Prior Authorization is required,for duloxetine* (Cymbalta), pregabalin (Lyrica), and (Savella). Payment will the following conditions: 1. A diagnosis of$bromyalgia (Cymbalta, Lyrica, and Savella) a. a trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with a tricyclic antidepressant (such as amitriptyline), AND b, a trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with a preferred muscle relaxant (such as cyclobenzapriue), AND c. at least two trials and therapy failures at a therapeutic dose from the following agents: SSRI, tramadol, or gabapentin, AND d. documented non-pharmacolgic therapies (cognitive behavior therapies, exercise etc.), AND e. documentation of a previous trial and therapy ,failure at a therapeutic dose with Savella, when Cymbalta and Lyrica are requested. 2. A diagnosis ofpost-herpetic neuralgia (Lyrica) The patient must have previous trials and therapy failure at therapeutic doses with at least two of the following agents: tricyclic antidepressant, topical lidocaine, or gabapentin. 3. A diagnosis ofdiabetic peripheral neuropathy (Cymbalta and Lyrica) The patient must have previous trials and therapy failure at therapeutic doses with at least two of the following agents: tricyclic antidepressant, topical lidocaine, tramadol, or gabapentin. 4. A diagnosis ofpartial onset seizures, as adjunct therapy (Lyrica) 5. A diagnosis of major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (Cym balta) *PA requiredfor new starts only. The Commission members thought this wording might be confusing for providers, and had an extensive clinical di.&ussion as to the appropriateness-of the criteria. Pam Smith will edit and bring a rearranged version to the next meeting for further deliberation. DPP-4 Inhibifors: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior Authorization is required for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Payment will be considered under the following conditions: 1) A diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, 2) Patient is 18 years of age or older, 3) The patient has not achieved HbgAlC goals using insulin or a combination of two or more antidiabetic medications (metformin, su~onyulurea, or thiazolidinedione) at maximum tolerated doses unless otherwise contraindicated. Initial authorizations will be approved for six months; additional prior authorizations will be considered on an individual basis after review of medical necessity and documented improvement in HbgAlC since the beginning of the initialprior authorization period. Craig Logemann motioned to accept the proposed criteria, and Bruce Alexander seconded. The motion passed with no objections. Lidocaine Patch: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for topical lidocaine patches (Lidoderm). Payment will be considered for a diagnosis ofpain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia following a previous treatment failure or contraindications with a preferred agent at therapeutic dose from one of the following: tricyclic antidepressant, opioid, or gabapentin. In addition, the Commission decided to limit the quantity to 30 for the first fill, and also limit to 90 patches per 30 days. There will be no limit on duration of therapy, however, as post-herpetic neuralgia is a chronic condition. Dr. Casey Clor motioned to accept the proposed criteria and quantity limits. Dr. Rick Rinehart seconded, and the motion passed unanimously. Ergofamine Derivatives: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for preferred ergotamine derivatives used for migraine headache treatment for quantities exceeding I8 unit doses of tablets, injections, or sprays per 30 days. Payment for ergotamine derivatives for migraine headache treatment beyond this limit will be considered on an individual basis after review of submitted documentation. Prior authorization will be required for all non-preferred ergotamine derivatives beginning the first day of therapy. Payment for non-preferred Ergotamine agents will be authorized only for cases in which there is documentation of previous trial and therapy failure with a preferred agent. For consideration, the following information must be supplied: I. The diagnosis requiring therapy. 2. Documentation of current prophylactic therapy or documentation of previous trials and therapy failures with two different prophylactic medications. It was proposed that these criteria be removed due to low utilization of this category and higher utilization of Triptans for acute treatment of migraine. For SFY 2009, there was one approved PA out of a total of five PA requests. Six months after removal of the PA, a follow-up will be done to monitor utilization of this drug class. Bruce Alexander motioned to accept the recommendation, and Craig Logemann seconded. All members voted in favor of the motion. Public Comment Dr. Geoff Wall spoke about the Biologicals for Arthritis criteria, Focus Studies Drugs that cause Edema: The purpose of this study was to identify instances where prescribers were prescribing medications that typically cause edema as a side effect in disease states that often have edema present as a symptom. Edema is defined as palpable swelling as a result of interstitial fluid volume expansion. There are many different clinical conditions that can cause edema such as heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephroitic syndrome. Certain medications can also cause edema as a side effect. When used in patients with peripheral edema, the addition of these drugs can cause worsening symptoms of edema such as swollen legs, difficulty walking, increased abdominal girth, and shortness of breath due to pressure on the diaphragm. These patients become high utilizers of prescribers offices and emergency departments seeking medical care for the discomfort caused by the worsening edema. An analysis was performed to identify instances where prescribers were prescribing medications that typically cause edema as a side effect in lowa Medicaid members who have disease states that commonly cause edema. At the September meeting, the Commission had asked that these findings be re-run and remove members who have had a hospital admission for heart failure, andlor those already on diuretics. They reviewed the updated report, but later decided to send letters to all prescribers of members that had appeared in the initial query results. Abilify for Depression without Antidepressants: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which aripiprazole (Abilfyl is being used as monotherapy to treat major depression. Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic that was first approved for use in schizophrenia in 2002. Unlike other atypical antipsychotics that bind to D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway, aripiprazole acts as a partial agonist at the D2 receptors. In 2008, the FDA approved the use of aripiprazole as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. This indication was based on two short-term (6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials of adult patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for MDD who had an inadequate response to venlafaxine ER, paroxetine CR, fluoxetine, escitalopram, or sertraline. In both trials, aripiprazole was superior to placebo in reducing the mean Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores. At a recent DUR Commission meeting, some concern was expressed as to the possibility that providers were using aripiprazole to treat MDD as monotherapy instead of as adjunctive therapy. This was based on observations made during profile reviews and observations in practice. An analysis was performed looking at paid pharmacy claims over a six month time period (311109 through 8/31/09) to identify members using aripiprazole with and without SSRls or SNRls concurrently. For those identified as using aripiprazole as monotherapy, anyone with a diagnosis for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder was removed. Concurrent therapy was defined as having two or more fills for aripiprazole while also receiving prescriptions for an SSRl or an SNRI. Three thousand seventy-eight unique members were using aripiprazole for depression, of which 1,974 used a SSRl or SNRI in combination, (Abilify) as monotherapy. Forty-three of those 1,104 members were using a drug from the Tricyclic Antidepressant or MA0 Inhibitor PDL category. The Commission asked that the report be rerun to look for GAD, mood stabilizers, and second-generation antipsychotics as well. Chronic Use of Transdermal Scopolamine: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which lowa Medicaid members are using transdermal scopolamine (Transderm Sccip) on a chronic basis andlor in with oral medications. Transdermal scopolamine is a belladonna alkaloid that is FDA indicated to prevent motion sickness and nausea and vomiting associated with anesthesia following surgery. It is compendia indicated for excessive salivation. Transdermal scopolamine is a small flat patch that is applied behind the ear at least four hours before the prevention of nausea and vomiting is required, typically four hours before travel. Transdermal scopolamine comes in boxes of four patches, and each patch lasts for 3 days. The most common use for transdermal scopolamine is to prevent motion sickness prior to air, car, or boat travel. Transdermal scopolamine is a preferred product on the Preferred Drug List, and is not subject to clinical prior authorization criteria, quantity limits, or ProDUR edits of any kind. Based on marketshare data for State Fiscal Year 2009, there were 659 prescriptions billed for Transderm Sc6p for an average of 6 units per prescription at a cost of $50.82 (state and federal dollars, pre-rebate) per prescription. When compared to other therapies used for motion sickness, this average cost per prescription is considerably higher due to SMAC prices on the other products. For example, the average cost per prescription for meclizine is $5.64 (state and federal dollars, pre-rebate) for an average of 52 tablets per prescription. Through the usual course of profile reviews, it has been noticed there are members using transdermai scopolamine on both a regular basis and in combination with other oral medications. To evaluate the extent of this practice, an analysis was done over a three month timeframe (711109 through 9130109) to determine how many members were using transdermal scopolamine chronically, who had previous trials with meclizine, who was taking other oral medications, and who was receiving quantities greater than four. Twenty-eight unique members had more than two fills on the claim histories. This data will be rerun to remove cancer patients, and then letters will be sent to the prescribers involved. Long-Term Use of Short-Acting Opioids: The purpose of this study was to determine the number of members using four or more doses per day of a short acting opioid for an extended period of time without using a long acting opioid. Potential benefits of switching to a long acting opioid in chronic non-cancer pain could provide members with a more consistent control of pain, improved adherence, and lower risk of addiction or abuse. There are no clear guidelines for use of short-acting opioids versus long-acting opioids, as there is insufficient evidence comparing the two. There is a lack of studies that support a recommendation of as-needed versus around-the-clock dosing of opioids. The decision to switch to a long-acting opioid should be based on outcomes of a trial with a short-acting opioid lasting several weeks to a few months. An example of outcomes to consider would include progress toward meeting therapeutic goals, presence of adverse effects, changes in the underlying pain condition, changes in psychiatric or medical comorbidities, identification of aberrant drug-related behaviors, addiction, or diversion. It is important to note that although neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain conditions appear to respond to chronic use of long-acting opioids, evidence that supports efficacy of these products for conditions such as chronic low back pain, daily headache, and fibromyalgia are lacking. An analysis was preformed looking at paid pharmacy claims over a six month time period (411109 through 9130109). Members who had four or more doses per day for 90 days or longer of any drug from the Narcotics - Miscellaneous PDL category without claims for any drug in the Narcotics - Long Acting PDL category during the same time period were identified. If members are using short-acting opioids on a chronic basis for non-cancer pain, it is thought that they should be considered for a trial with a preferred long-acting opioid. One thousand three hundred five members were identified as using four or more doses of a short-acting opioid per day for more than 90 days without claims for a long-acting narcotic. Their average length of therapy was five months. Letters will be sent to prescribers with patients on two or more short-acting opioids. If Maine's new restrictive PA criteria (members having 90 days of opiates in the past 100 days would require a PA to ensure appropriate indication, non- pharmacologic and non-opioid treatments have been considered andlor tried, an opiate/controlled substance contract exists, and review of a monitoring plan, i.e. urine drug screens and pill counts, if necessary) for this category proves effective, it could possibly be adopted in Iowa in the future. Miscellaneous SMAC Update: The Commission members were given a copy of the SMAC changes effective November 25,2009. MedWatch: The Commission members received FDA announcements concerning new Black Box Warnings. A unanimous vote was made at 12:04 p.m. to adjourn the meeting and move to closed session (Motion by Bruce Alexander, second by Craig Logemann). The next meeting will be held at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, February 3,2010 at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines, IA. Attendees: Commission Members / staff I I Chad Bissell, Pharm.D.; and Pam R.Ph. introductions Vice-Chairperson Laurie Pestel called the meeting to order at 9:30 a.m. at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines. Commission members and guests were welcomed and introduced. The minutes from the December 2, 2009 meeting were approved following several corrections from Commission members. (Motion by Bruce Alexander, second by Larry Ambroson, unanimous approval by voice vote.) Iowa Medicaid Enterprise Updates Vendors bidding for IME contracts gave oral presentations to DHS last week. Decisions should be announced to the public next week. With the contract re- negotiation, there will only be 6 DUR meetings per year, every other month, starting in August. The next P&T Meeting will be April ath at the Botanical Center in Des Moines. Case Studies Pam Smith presented four intervention case studies. Recommendations by Commissioners from these four examples resulted in annualized total savings of $17,791.48 pre-rebate (state and federal). Quarterly Manaaement Reports (Summary) For the second quarter of State Fiscal Year 2010, the average amount paid per claim was $59.81, which was a subtle decrease from the previous quarter. Total dollars paid for the quarter was up to $64.2 million. The number of paid claims, along with the number of eligible members, also continues to trend upwards. There were 373,114 eligible Medicaid members in the second quarter. The average number of claims per utilized member was 5.39, and percent of controlled substances was 18.67%. ProAir HFA (albuterol) continues to be the top drug by number of prescriptions, and Synagis (palivizumab) was the top drug by dollars spent. Brand single source drugs made up 22.87% percent of paid claims, while generic utilization was up to 72.1 1%. Lastly, the average amount paid per generic claim was $13.09. Annual Smokina Cessation Re~ort The Commission was presented with a copy of the current year's draft report, which had been updated with their additional recommendations from the last meeting. Larry Ambroson motioned that this finalized version be forward to the Department of Human Services. Craig Logemann seconded, and the motion passed with no objections. Public Comment Rose Mullen, Outcome Liaison Consultant and Dr. Donna Bahls, Lecture Bureau Speaker, representing Eli Lilly spoke of Cymbalta and fibromyalgia PA criteria. Nancy Bell from Pfizer spoke about fibromyalgia PA criteria. Kristin Crouch from Forest Labs spoke about Savella and fibromyalgia criteria. Sarah Sullivan from Merck reviewed the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists consensus statement regarding DPP-4 Inhibitors. Pro-DUR Edits Arrnodafinil - Proposed Age Limit: On August 1, 2007, the OUR Commission voted in favor of following an age restriction per the package insert of modafinil (Provigil) restricting use to members 16 years of age and older to prevent off- label use. Since implementation, there have been no issues regarding the age edit on modafinil. There have been several requests for off-label use of the drug in children to treat ADHD. To prevent off label use of amodafinil (Nuvigil), it is being proposed to add an age edit to restrict use to members 17 years of age and older. This was the second review of this topic, and the Commission had no further comments. This will now be forwarded to DHS. PA Criteria PEG 3350 Utilization: Pam Smith followed up on the days supply edit that had been placed on PEG 3350 to allow for the colonoscopy in children. A review of claims for the past six months identified only one member using this drug for something other than a colonoscopy. Calls were made to the pharmacy and the doctor's office, and they've been asked to correct this. It has not been filled since November 2009. Biologicals for Arfhrifis: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for biologicals used for arthritis Payment will be considered following an inadequate response to a preferred disease modzjjtng antirheumatic drug such as hydronychloroquine, sulfaalazine, methotrexate, lejlunomide, Prior authorization is required ,for all non-preferred biologicals ,for arthritis as indicated on the Iowa Medicaid Preferred Drug List beginning the first day of therapy. Payment for non-preferred biologicals for arthritis will be considered only for cases in which there is documentation of a previous trial and therapy,failure with a prefered agent. As this was the second review of these criteria and the Commission had no further comment, this will now be forwarded to DHS. DPP-4 Inhibitors: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior Authorization is required for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Payment will be considered under the following conditions: I) A diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, 2) Patient is 18 years of age or older, 3) The patient has not achieved HbgAlC goals using a combination of two or more antidiabetic medications (metformin, sulfonyulurea, thiazolidinedione, or insulin) at maximum tolerated doses unless otherwise contraind icated. Initial authorizations will be approved for six months; additional prior authorizations will be considered on an individual basis a&r review of medical necessity and documented improvement in HbgAlC since the beginning of the initial prior authorization period. As this was the second review of these criteria and the Commission had no further comment, this will now be forwarded to DHS. Lidocaine Patch: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for topical lidocaine patches (Lidoderm). Payment will be considered for a diagnosis of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia following a previous treatment failure with a preferred agent at therapeutic dose from one of the following: tricyclic antidepressant, opioid, or gabapentin. A maximum of 30 patches may be dispensed with the initial prescription to determine efficacy. In addition, the commission decided to limit the quantity to 30 patches for the first fill, and also limit to 90 patches per 30 days. There will be no limit on duration of therapy, however, as post-herpetic neuralgia is a chronic condition. As this was the second review of these criteria and the Commission had no further comment, this will now be forwarded to DHS. Ergotamine Derivatives: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Pn'or authorization is required for preferred ergotamine derivatives used fov migraine headache treatment for quantities exceeding 18 unit doses of tablets, injections, or sprays per 30 days. Payment for ergotamine derivatives for migraine headache treatment beyond this limit will be considered on an individual basis ajkr review of submitted documentation. Prior authorization will be required for all non-preferred ergotamine derivatives beginning the first day of therapy. Payment for non-preferred Ergotamine agents will be authorized only for cases in which there is documentation of previous trial and therapy failure with a preferred agent. For consideration, the following information must be supplied: I. The diagnosis requiring therapy. 2. Documentation of current prophylactic therapy or documentation of previous trials and therapy failures with two diferent prophylactic medications. It was proposed that these criteria be removed due to low utilization of this category and higher utilization of Triptans for acute treatment of migraine. For SFY 2009, there was one approved PA out of a total of 5 PA requests. Six months after removal of the PA, a follow-up will be done to monitor utilization of this drug class. As this was the second review of these criteria and the Commission had no further comment, this will now be forwarded to DHS. Cymbalfa, Lyrica, Savella: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior Authorization is required for duloxetine (Cymbalta), pregabalin (Lyrica), and milnacipran (Savella). Payment will be the following conditions: I. A diagnosis of3bromyalgia (Cymbalta, Lyrica, and Savella) a. a trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with three drugs from any of the following: tricyclic antidepressant, muscle relaxant, SSRI, tramadol or gabapentin, WITH b. documented non-pharmacolgic therapies (cognitive behavior therapies, exercise etc.), AND c. documentation of a previous trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with Savella, when Cymbalta and Lyrica are requested. 2. A diagnosis ofpost-herpetic neuralgia (Lyrica) The patient must have previous trials and therapy ,failure at therapeutic doses with at least two of the following agents: tricyclic antidepressant, topical lidocaine, valproate, carbamazepine, or gabapentin. diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (Cymbalta and Lyrica) The patient must have previous trials and therapy failure at therapeutic doses with at least two of the following agents: tricyclic antidepressant, topical lidocaine, tramadol, or gabapentin. 4. A diagnosis ofpartial onset seizures, as adjunct therapy (Lyrica) 5. A diagnosis of major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (Cymbalta) The Commission members thought the preferred medications should be listed on the PA form for the convenience of prescribers. The draft PA form will be brought to the next meeting. Public Comment There were no speakers in this public comment section. Focus Studies AbilifL for Depression without Antidepressants: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which aripiprazole (Abilify) is being used as monotherapy to treat major depression. At a recent DUR Commission meeting, some concern was expressed as to the possibility that providers were using aripiprazole to treat MDD as monotherapy instead of as adjunctive therapy. This was based on observations made during profile reviews and observations in practice. An analysis was performed looking at paid pharmacy claims over a six month time period (311109 through 8/31/09) to identify members using aripiprazole with and without SSRls or SNRIs concurrently. For those identified as using aripiprazole as monotherapy, anyone with a diagnosis for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder was removed. Concurrent therapy was defined as having two or more fills for aripiprazole while also receiving prescriptions for an SSRl or an SNRI. A total of 3,078 unique members were identified as using aripiprazole for depression, of which 1,974 used a SSRl or SNRI in combination, (Abilify) as monotherapy. Forty-three of those 1,104 members were using a drug from the Tricyclic Antidepressant or MA0 Inhibitor PDL category. At the December 2009 DUR meeting, it was requested the data be re-run, removing members with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, members using a mood stabilizer (lamotrigine, levetiracetam, divalproex, carbamazepine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, andlor lithium), and to look to see if other antipsychotic medications are being used. Of the 1,104 members originally identified in the initial study, only 1,006 members were currently eligible when the data was re-run. One-hundred-sixty-four (164) of these members were identified as not meeting any of the criteria for use of aripiprazole (Abilifyl based on their medical claims data. Letters will be sent to their prescribers. Dr. Casey Clor suggested that they be reminded that Abilify is very expensive compared to other alternatives. The letter could suggest other more cost efficient options they might prescribe instead. Off-Label Utilizafion of Cholinomimefics: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which drugs approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia are being used for off-label indications. In June 2007, the DUR Commission recommended to the Department that an age edit be placed on the cholinomimetic drugs used for Alzheimer's dementia due to the high prevalence of off-label use in young members for diagnoses such as traumatic brain injury and autism. Since July 30 2007, claims for members under 40 years of age have required a prior authorization. These have been dealt with on a case-by-case basis. For those over 40 years of age, claims for cholinomimetics, specifically Aricept (donepezil) and Namenda (memantine), which are preferred drugs on the Preferred Drug List, have paid without a review of the member's diagnosis. Both drugs have been used off label in the treatment of attention-deficitlhyperactivity disorder (ADHD); behavioral syndromes impairment; traumatic brain injury; autism; and stroke. A pharmacy claims analysis was performed looking at paid, non-reversed pharmacy claims between 6-1-09 and 11-30-09. Members who had two or more claims for Aricept (donepezil) and/or Namenda (memantine) were identified. A search of these members' medical claims histories was done to look for diagnosis codes corresponding with Alzheimer's dementia, dementia (senile, pre-senile, vascular, etc), amnestic disorder, and frontotemporal dementia. One-hundred-fifteen (115) unique members met the search criteria. Eighty-five (85) of them were found to have an off-label diagnosis in their pharmacy claims history. Their prescribers will be contacted. This topic will also appear as an article in an upcoming DUR Digest under a \"dementia\" header as requested. Utilization of Multiple Oral Anti-Diabetic Agents without Use of Insulin: The purpose of this study was to determine the number of members using three or more oral anti-diabetic medications concurrently. Based on observations made during member-specific profile reviews, it was suspected that many lowa Medicaid members with type 2 diabetes were prescribed multiple oral anti- diabetic products in various combinations as opposed to adding insulin after one or two oral medications failed to achieve glycemic goals. An analysis was performed looking at paid pharmacy claims over a three month time period (9/1/09 through 11/30/09). Members who were using multiple oral anti-diabetic agents were identified. Seventy-eight (78) unique members were identified as using 3 or more anti-diabetic active ingredients concurrently. None of them were taking insulin, and only 2 had claims for Byetta in their profiles. Letters will be sent to the prescribers of members on 4 or 5 anti-diabetic agents concurrently. This topic will also appear as an article in the DUR Digest. Cholesterol-Lowering Medication Pre- and Post-MI: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which members at high risk for coronary heart disease events are being treated for dyslipidemia, and of those being treated, how compliant these members are with their drug regimen. Similar to other studies that have been performed by the lowa DUR Commission looking at adherence to professional guidelines for post-MI patients, we were interested in looking to see how many lowa Medicaid Members were being treated with a cholesterol lowering agent following a new diagnosis of MI, unstable angina, and/or acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the report showed how compliant those members were with their medication regimen. A report was run looking at lowa Medicaid members who had constant eligibility between 12/1/06 and 11/30/09. An analysis of their pharmacy claims history and medical claims history were preformed during this time period. Within the members' medical claims histories, we identified members who had new diagnoses of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and/or acute coronary syndrome between 12/1/07 and 11/30/08. The drugs that were searched included drugs and drug combinations that can be used for lowering cholesterol (statins, fibrates, and niacin) as recommended by multiple professional guidelines. For those members we identified as using cholesterol lowering pharmacotherapy, a medication possession ratio (MPR) was performed to assess compliance. Twelve (12) members were identified as having used cholesterol-lowering medications prior to an episode, but then discontinued following the episode. Dr. Casey Clor asked that the data be rerun to focus on members with these diagnoses is their claims files but who were not taking a statin medication. The 3-year eligibility timeframe will not be used for the new data pull. Craig Logemann asked if it would be possible to obtain national data, for a benchmark comparison. The Commission decided to hold off on letters for now and discuss with Dr. Kline at the next meeting the possibility of the IME nurse care managers supervising these members in the future. Antiviral Utilization: Commission members were provided with utilization data and trend charts for Tamiflu and Relenza usage between 9/1/09 and 11/30/09. The peak appeared to have occurred between 10/11/09 and 10/25/09. The week of 10/18/09 had the highest number of prescriptions: 1,998 for Tamiflu, and 15 for Relenza, for a total of 2,013. Polk County had the most members on antivirals during this time period: 644. The Commission members agreed that no further action was needed for this focus study. Miscellaneous DUR Digest: The Commission members offered changes and additions to the draft for DUR Digest Volume 22, Number 2. MedWatch: The Commission members received FDA announcements concerning new Black Box Warnings. A unanimous vote was made at 11:18 to adjourn the meeting and move to closed session (lS' by Bruce Alexander, 2nd by Craig Logemann). The next meeting will be held at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, March 3,2010 at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines, IA. Attendees: / BCPS; Welcome & Introductions Vice-Chairperson Laurie Pestel called the meeting to order at 9:36 a.m. at the Learning Resource Center in West Des ~oines. Commission members and guests were welcomed and introduced. The minutes from the February 3, 2010, meeting were approved. (Motion by Bruce Alexander, second by Dr. Sara Schutte-Schenck, unanimous approval by voice vote.) Iowa Medicaid Enterprise Updates The next P&T Meeting will be April 8@' at the Botanical Center. Pam Smith recently attended the &day ADURS meeting for pharmacists specializing in medication utilization within state Medicaid populations. Dr. Kline summarized the most recent Clinical Advisory Committee meeting. They addressed utilization criteria (this will now be done annually for all PA processes at the IME); the new PA process for elective outpatient CT, MRI, and PET scans which became effective March 1%'; and revised MediPass reports. There will be some small changes to the new IME vendor contracts. DHS Director Charles Krogmeier has assembled a task force regarding people with dual diagnoses of behavioral health disorders and other health issues, specifically that many of them have been discharged only to be readmitted. It is felt an intervention is needed to reduce such instances. Dr. John Kalachnik, chairman of the aforementioned taskforce, spoke in depth of their efforts to educate providers, as well as their pharrnacotherapy recommendations. He was also asked to speak at the April 8\" P&T Meeting. Case Studies Pam Smith presented four intervention case studies. Recommendations by commissioners from these four examples resulted in annualized total savings of $1,353.69 pre-rebate (state and federal). Public Comment Nicole Griswold from Shire Pharmaceuticals spoke about lntuniv. PA Criteria Cymbalta, Lyrica, Savella: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior Authorization is required for duloxetine (~ymbalta@), pregabalin (Lyrics@), and milnacipran (SavellaTM). Payment will be the following conditions: 1. A diagnosis offbromyalgia (~ymbalta@, Lyrics@, and ~avella'~) a. a trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with three drugs from any of the following: tricyclic antidepressant, muscle relaxant, SSRI, tmmadol, or gabapentin, WITH b. documented non-pharmacologic therapies (cognitive behavior therapies, exercise etc.), AND c. documentation of a previous trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with SavellaTM, when cymbalta@ and Lyrics@ are requested. 2. A diagnosis ofpost-herpetic neuralgia (Lyrics@) The patient must have previous trials and therapy failure at therapeutic doses with at least &a of the following agents: tricyclic antidepressant, topical lidocaine, valproate, carbamazepine, or gabapentin. diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (~ymbalta~ and LyricaQ) The patient must have previous trials and therapy failure at therapeutic doses with at least two of the following agents: tricyclic antidepressant, topical lidocaine, tramadol, or gabapentin. 4. A diagnosis ofpartial onset seizures, as adjunct therapy (Lyrics@) 5. A diagnosis of major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (~ymbalta@) The Commission members offered a few changes to the PA form itself, specifically to the listed drug trial examples and their order. Sandy Pranger suggested that a caveat might be added to the form to notify providers that these trials could be found on the web site as well. Craig Logemann thought maybe each disease state should be labeled as a section, so prescribers knew they did not have to fill out the entire form. The possibility of breaking this up into multiple PA forms, one per diagnosis, was also discussed. Bruce Alexander motioned to accept the criteria wording (no final decision was made on the number of forms), and Dr. Rick Rinehart seconded. The motion passed with no objections or abstentions. Extended Release Guanfacine (Intuniv): The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for Intuniv. Payment will be considered for patients when thejbllowing is met: I) The patient is between 6 and 17 years of age with a diagnosis ofADHD; 2) Previous trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with one preferred amphetamine and one preferred non-amphetamine stimulant, as well as a 3) Previous trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with Strattera, and a 4) Previous trial and therapy,failure at a therapeutic dose with immediate release guanfacine. A quantity limit of 30 tablets per 30 days for all strengths (Img, 2mg, 3mg, and 4mg) was also recommended. Pam Smith read through criteria that had been implemented in other state programs. Bruce Alexander motioned to hold off on establishing criteria for this drug until the May meeting, as this is a new drug and it is on the agenda for the April 8th P&T meeting. Craig Logemann seconded, and the motion passed unanimously. Public Comment There were no speakers in this public comment section. Focus Studies ACE Inhibitors Combined with Angiotensin Receptor Blockers: The purpose of this study was to follow-up on the 47 unique members identified as using an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor in combination with a Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB), without a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, in their claims history during the time frame 4/1/09 to 6/30/09. Letters were sent to providers in October 2009. Twenty-six members discontinued medications following the DUR intervention, which resulted in $5,414.25 in cost savings (state and federal pre-rebate). Ufilizafion Patterns of Cholesterol-Lowering Medication Pre- and Post-MI: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which members at high risk for coronary heart disease events are being treated for dyslipidemia and of those being treated, how compliant these members are with their drug regimen. A report was presented at the February meeting looking at Iowa Medicaid members who had constant eligibility between 1211106 and 21/30/09 who had new diagnoses of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and/or acute coronary syndrome between 12/1/07 and 11/30/08. A search of these members' pharmacy claims histories was also performed looking for drugs and drug combinations that can be used for lowering cholesterol (statins, fibrates, and niacin) as recommended by multiple professional guidelines. A total of 222 unique members had constant eligibility between 12/1/06 and 11/30/09 with a new diagnosis of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, andlor acute coronary syndrome between 12/1/07 and 11/30/08. After reviewing these data, a suggestion was made to look at current data from 2009 for new events. For the new data set, medical and pharmacy claims data between 1/1/2009 and 12/31/2009 were reviewed. Members who had a new diagnosis of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and/or unstable angina were identified. Of these members, a review of their pharmacy claims history was done looking for cholesterol lowering drugs. Of these 243 members identified, 127 (52.3%) were found to be on a cholesterol lowering agent following this diagnosis. The majority of these members were on a statin; most of these members were using simvastatin. Letters will be sent to the providers of the 116 members not using a cholesterol lowering drug to inquire if the member has been managed successfully with lifestyle modifications and request they reconsider the member's risk factors for a recurrent CHD event if the member has not been successful at getting to their lipid goals. Proton Pump Inhibitors Plus Clopidogrel (Plavix): The purpose of this study was to re-review lowa Medicaid Members using clopidogrel (Plavix) for two or more consecutive months between 11/1/09 and 1/31/10 that are also using a proton pump inhibitor. In June 2009, the DUR Commission looked at reports suggesting that omeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors (PPls) could interfere with the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel (Plavix). Clopidogrel is a prodrug that is activated by CYP450 enzymes in the liver primarily by CYP2C19. All PPls may inhibit CYP2C19 to some extent, with omeprazole being a strong inhibitor of CYP2Cl9; pantoprazole (Profonix) appears to be the weakest inhibitor. It was indicated at that point in time more data was needed to clarify the clinical si nificance of the interaction between clopidogrel and PPls. On ,f November 17 , 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published an alert with updated data regarding this interaction. The FDA stated that the therapeutic effect of clopidogrel on platelets was reduced by as much as 47% in persons receiving clopidogrel and omeprazole together due to a reduction in the active metabolite of clopidogrel by about 45%. Additionally, separating the dose of each drug did not seem to impact the interaction. When the language concerning this interaction was intensified by the FDA, the Commission recommended a re- review of the data. Within the lowa Medicaid population, the following utilization data was observed during a two month time period (11/1/2009 through 12/31/2009). Seventy-two members were using Plavix plus any PPI, but only 2 of them continued this combination into January. Thirteen members were using Plavix plus omeprazole, but none of them were still using this combination in January. Since the combined utilization is trending downward, and a DUR Digest article has already been published, the Commission thought an additional intervention was not necessary. Atypical Antipsychotics plus Anticholinergics: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of atypical antipsychotics used in combination with anticholinergics to manage extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Extrapyramidal side effects consist of six syndromes that can be considered reversible (acute dystonia, akathisia) which occur within a few hours to days, or days to weeks (parkinsonism, neuromalignant syndrome), and potential irreversible hyperkinetic movement that occurs after several months to years of therapy (tardive dyskinesia, focal perioral tremor). EPS is a common side effect when older, first generation antipsychotics are used. Often times, first generation antipsychotics would need to be combined with anticholinergic medications, such as benztropine, trihexyphenidyl, or diphenhydramine, to reduce the severity of EPS. However, these side effects are further minimized when using newer, atypical antipsychotics. When used in multiple combinations andlor at higher than recommended doses, the beneficial side effect profile of atypical antipsychotics is often reduced and patients experience EPS. When EPS occur in patients taking atypical antipsychotics, such that treatment is required, one could question whether there is truly a benefit in using a more expensive atypical antipsychotic when perhaps a first generation antipsychotic could be used instead. A report was generated looking at pharmacy claims histories from 10-1-09 through 12-31- 09 for members who had two or more fills for any drug within the PDL category; Antipsychotics - Atypical. Members using anticholinergic medications to treat EPS were then identified. Of these 8,198 members, 692 members also had claims for benztropine, trihexyphenidyl, and/or diphenhydramine. The Commission decided to refer this topic to the Mental Health Advisory Group. Antipsychotic Utilization in Children & Adolescenfs 2005 vs. 2009 and Duplicate Antihistamines: Bruce Alexander motioned that these two focus study topics be tabled until the May meeting given the time constraints. Dr. Rick Rinehart seconded, and the decision was unanimous. Miscellaneous DUR Digest: The Commission members offered changes and additions to the draft for DUR Digest Volume 22, Number 2. SMAC Updates: The Commission members were given a copy of the SMAC changes effective March 4,2010. MedWafch: The commission members received FDA announcements concerning new Black Box Warnings. A unanimous vote was made at 11:55 to adjourn the meeting and move to closed session (1'' by Craig Logemann, 2\"d by Bruce Alexander). The next meeting will be held at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 5, 2010 in Room 116 at the State Capitol in Des Moines. Attendees: ~eskl, ~iarm.~.; Larry Sandy Pranger, R.&., IME; and Melissa Biddle, IME. Welcome & Introductions Chairperson Dr. Mark Graber called the meeting to order at 9:31 a.m. in Room 116 at the State Capitol in Des Moines. Commission members and guests were welcomed and introduced. The minutes from the March 3, 2010 meeting were approved. (Motion by Dr. Richard Rinehart, second by Craig Logemann, unanimous approval by voice vote.) lowa Medicaid Enterprise Updates As of July 1,2010, a new vendor will be overseeing the Disease Management and Care Management programs, so there will be some changes to the daily workload within the Medical Services Unit. The high-tech radiology program is moving forward, however; prior authorizations are now being processed for outpatient CTs, MRls, and PET scans. Providers are getting accustomed to this PA process, despite the lack of pre- implementation education due to time constraints resulting from the budget crisis. Medical Services is currently going through a URAC accreditation process as well. The lowa Care Expansion program, effective 10-1-10, will increase the budget for lowa Care and allow for 2 more primary care location options (in Council Bluffs and Sioux City prospectively) for members in addition to Broadlawns and the University of lowa, which are their only current options for treatment. In 2014 when Healthcare Reform goes into effect, this lowa Care program will cease to exist as it will be included into the Medicaid Expansion. Healthcare Reform is going to have some effects on State Medicaid programs, especially the pharmaceutical aspects. The Federal Government has imposed additional minimum rebate requirements to the manufacturers, but all of that will go back to the Federal Government. That will change the perspective on what a drug's real net pricing is; the State and Federal points of view on this will differ substantially. Another aspect of Healthcare Reform is that new formulations will require the same rebate as the existing forms. This will cut into the supplemental rebate revenue significantly, and goes retroactive back to 1-1-10. Also, the lowa Code previously excluded certain categories of medications from being included on the Preferred Drug List, including those used for mental illness. However, the Legislature removed that exemption this session so medications used in the treatment of mental illnesses will be subject to preferred and non-preferred status rather than just being on the Recommended Drug List, effective January 1, 2011. Anyone established on a mental health drug up to that point would be grandfathered. Any mental health drug requiring prior authorization will be eligible for a 7-day supply while obtaining prior authorization, as opposed to the 3-day supply currently allowed for all other products. Quarterlv Management Reports The average amount paid per claim was $59.87 for the last quarter. 1,065,956 claims paid out a total of $63,820,590.81 for the 379,425 eligible members. 74.40% of these claims were for generic medications, and 18.59% were for controlled substances. ProAir HFA continued to have the highest number of prescriptions, while the largest amount of money ($5,119,146.43) was spent on Synagis. Case Studies Pam Smith presented four intervention case studies. Recommendations by commissioners from these four examples resulted in annualized total savings of $2,442.59 pre-rebate (state and federal). Public Comment Karen Loihl from the Iowa Psychiatric Society voiced concerns regarding the proposed - prior authorization criteria forlnfuniv. PA Criteria Extended Release Formulations: At the March DUR meeting, while discussing the proposed PA criteria for extended release guanfacine, it was suggested that the language for the Extended Release Formulations PA criteria be re-evaluated. Specifically, the commission questioned if there needs to be a therapy failure with the immediate release product, or if it would be more appropriate if the patient showed some therapeutic benefit from the immediate release product. The current language reads: Payment for a non-preferred extended release formulation will be considered only for cases in which there is documentation of previous trial and therapy failure with the preferred immediate release product of the same chemical entity, unless evidence is provided that use of the immediate release product would be medically contraindicated. Prior authorization is required for the following Ultram ER. The Commission members agreed that these criteria needed to be changed. They suggested adding in \"the member has shown improvement on the immediate release medication, but does not tolerate due to side effects\" and requiring a trial of another drug in the same category. Pam Smith will revise the wording and bring it to the June meeting. Cymbalta, Lyrica, SaveNa: At the March meeting, the Commission reviewed a draft PA form for Cymbalta, Lyrica, and Savella and requested the form be split into three different PA forms for each drug. After discussion with the PA Department, it was felt that the PA form should not be split. The Commission reviewed the draft PA form with some modifications. No motion was necessary as this had been discussed prior to this meeting, and no further changes were made. The Commission members did request, however, that a search function be added to the PDL website, so that forms (especially ones like this used for multiple drugs) could be found more easily. This capability might be added in the future, depending on programming requirements. Extended Release Guanfacine (Intuniv): The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for Intuniv. Payment will be considered,forpatients when the following is met: 1) The patient has a diagnosis ofADHD and is between 6 and I7 years of age; and 2) Previous trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with immediate release guanfacine; and 3) Previous trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with one preferred amphetamine and one preferred non-amphetamine stimulant; and 4) Previous trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with Strattera. The required trials may be overridden when documented evidence is provided that the use of these agents would be medically contraindicated. A quantity limit of 30 tablets per 30 days for all strengths (Img, 2mg, 3mg, and 4mg) was also recommended. Susan Parker noted that the age restrictions were most likely unalterable (as Dr. Wadle had commented that many prescribers were wanting to use it on children younger than 6), because they needed to match the FDA standards due to Healthcare Reform allowing for more federal scrutiny about use of mental health drugs and PA criteria. Craig Logemann would also like to revise the second bullet point, stating a requirement for \"previous trial with inadequate response or intolerance with therapeutic dose of the immediate release guanfacine\". This topic was referred to the Mental Health Advisory Group. Public Comment James Osborn from GlaxoSmithKline spoke about DHS' educational efforts in regards to Beta Agonists used for Asthma. Lisa Goetz from Medimmune spoke about Synagis. Focus Studies Tamoxifen Interactions with Select SSRls: The purpose of this study was to follow-up on the 16 unique members identified as using tamoxifen in combination with an SSRI that is a strong or mild inhibitor of CYP2D6 during the time frame 05/01/09 to 07/31/09. Letters were sent to providers in October 2009. Medication discontinuations resulted in $257.28 in savings (state and federal pre-rebate). This was just a follow-up discussion, so no further action was taken. Antipsychotic Utilization in Children & Adolescents 2005 versus 2009: The purpose of this study was to compare mental health drug utilization in children between 2005 and 2009. The \"Kids Getting Anti-Psychotics\" project is a 15 state collaborative effort iointlv sponsored by AHRQ, NASMD, NASMHPD, and the Medicaid Medical ~irectors ~etwork (NMDN). The project, implemented in late 2008, has as its purpose a review of costs. utilization. and safetv issues related to children receivina mental health medications. ~ita analysis covers f&r years, 2004 to 2007, for children 0-18 years of age enrolled in Medicaid in each year. The project's primary focus is on atypical antipsychotic (AAP) use in children; however, a broad review of mental health drugs (MHD) is included. The issue, especially for atypical antipsychotic medications, is a concern that for children, most AAP use is off label and that AAP use may lead to long- term health hazards, including the development of obesity and diabetes. Parents and child advocates nationally have voiced concerns that children are receiving too many psychotropic medications at too high a dose too young. Results from this project can be used to help define quality indicators to help assess and promote best practices. While lowa did not participate in this project, an analysis was performed over a similar time period (2005 - 2009) with similar data parameters to examine this utilization within the lowa Medicaid population. The number of children on typical antipsychotics did not change much between 2005 and 2009, but the percentages on atypicals did fluctuate. Generally speaking, usage went down in the younger age groups and up in those 15 to 18 years of age. The Commission decided to wait for national data for comparison before doing a focus study. Duplicate Antihistamines: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of which lowa Medicaid members are using multiple antihistamines. Regular reviews of member-specific charts have revealed a moderately high incidence of combining two or more antihistamines over an extended period of time. Although second generation antihistamines have less CNS depression than first generation antihistamines, the combination can still lead to increased CNS sedation and other anticholinergic side effects. Typically what is observed is a member is started on a first generation antihistamine or over-the-counter second generation antihistamine and uses it for a period of time, then requests use of a preferred or non-preferred second generation antihistamine, which is approved. When the second generation antihistamine that required a prior authorization is initiated, the over-the-counter product is never discontinued. An analysis of pharmacy claims was conducted between 10/1/2009 and 12/31/2009 to identify the number of unique members combining oral antihistamines for greater than or equal to 30 cumulative days. Antihistamines combined with decongestants were also included in this search. Additionally, we looked at members who combined the antihistamine nasal spray, Asfelin/Asfepro (azelastine) with oral antihistamines for greater than or equal to 30 cumulative days. One hundred eighty- seven members continued their duplicate antihistamine regimen into December, and letters will be sent to the providers associated with these members. Synagis Utilization in 2009-2010 RSV Season: The Commission was provided trending information over several recent years of palivizumab (Synagis) utilization data within the lowa Medicaid population to determine if changes to the palivizumab (Synagis) coverage policy for the 2010-2011 season are necessary. Palivizumab (Synagis) has required a clinical prior authorization for all lowa Medicaid members since the Preferred Drug List was implemented in January of 2005. The prior authorization criteria are based on the manufacturer labeling and the Redbook guidelines adopted by the American Academy of Pediatrics (prior to the 2009-2010 RSV season). Prior to the 2009-2010 RSV season, Redbook released updated recommendations for the use of palvizumab (Synagis) for the upcoming season. These updated recommendations were based primarily on updated pharmacoeconomic studies. In August of 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases updated their Policy Statement in support of the new Redbook guidelines. Following a thorough review of the new data behind the revised guidelines, the DUR Commission was opposed to adopting the full updated Redbook guidelines. The Commission did, however, recommend limiting the season to 5 doses beginning in November and ending in March per the new guidelines, but recommended not adopting the guideline that called for a maximum of 3 doses or dosing only until the infant reaches 90 days of age for those born from 32 weeks, 0 days' gestation through 34 weeks, 6 days' gestation who qualify for prophylaxis. It is important to note that independent of the DUR Commission's deliberations, the University of lowa Hospitals and Clinics adopted similar guidelines for their physicians who prescribe palvizumab. For the 2009-2010 RSV season in lowa, RSV was considered to be at epidemic levels (two consecutive weeks with two 10% positive rapid antigen RSV tests) the week ending December 26, 2009. At this point, most members who qualified for palvizumab had received two doses. While the lowa Medicaid Enterprise adopted a hybrid of the new Redbook guidelines last season, of the states that responded to a survey, 21 state Medicaid programs adopted the full complement of guidelines and 6 states did not adopt the new guidelines. Overall, the feedback from those states has been positive in that there was very little push-back from the prescribers or hospitals. The Commission decided to wait for surveillance and epidemiologic data from the most recent RSV season to be made available for review before making any changes to the existing lowa PA criteria. Compliance with ACE, ARB, and/or Beta Blocker in CHF: The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, and/or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) utilization and compliance in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. Numerous studies have proven the benefit of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in patients with CHF. These products are typically initiated after the symptoms of fluid overload are addressed with loop diuretics. Current treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend treatment with an ACE inhibitor in patients with CHF due to their favorable effect on survival. Additionally, beta-blockers are recommended for all stable patients with current or previous symptoms of heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. It is also recommended that beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors be used in all patients with a recent or past medical history of myocardial infarction. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are also approved for the treatment of CHF, but it is recommended that their use is reserved for those patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors. The goals of therapy are to improve symptoms, slow or reverse the reduction of myocardial function, and reduce mortality. An analysis was performed looking at those members with a diagnosis of CHF and their pharmacy claims histories to ensure that current guidelines were being followed with regard to prescription drug use. Members with current Iowa Medicaid eligibility were screened to identify those with ICD-9 codes in their medical claims history that correspond to a diagnosis of CHF. Non-reversed, paid pharmacy claims between 1/1/10 and 2/28/10 were analyzed. Claims for ACE inhibitors, beta- blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers were identified. Once these were found, a medication possession ratio was performed. 11,090 unique members were identified as having a CHF diagnosis, but only 1,205 (10.9%) of them are using an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, and/or an angiotensin II receptor blocker. These numbers will be rerun to identify people who have had a hospital admission or ER visit, with a primary diagnosis of CHF. Dr. Graber also recommended looking at members who've had echocardiograms. New findings will be brought back to a future meeting for analysis. Under-Utilization of Sfatins in Diabefes: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of statin utilization in patients with diabetes. After reviewing utilization patterns of cholesterol-lowering medications in patients following a new diagnosis of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or acute coronary syndrome, there was an interest to review statin utilization in another vulnerable population. The American Diabetes Association 2010 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes recommends statin therapy be added to lifestyle modifications for diabetic patients regardless of baseline lipid levels for those with overt cardiovascular disease (CVD), for those without CVD who are over 40 years of age and have at least one risk factor for CVD, and for those with LDL greater than 100. For those with multiple CVD risk factors, the goal LDL level is less than 100mgIdL. For patients with overt CVD, the recommended goal LDL level is less than 70mgldL. Medicaid members with current eligibility and a new diagnosis for diabetes in 2009, who also had at least one diagnosis code for cardiovascular disease in their medical claims history that have never filled a statin, were identified. Three thousand, three hundred-six unique members with a new diagnosis of diabetes in 2009 with at least one diagnosis for CVD were identified. Twenty-seven of them were under 18 years of age, of which none have ever filled a statin. Three hundred-ninety two were between 18 and 39 years of age, of which 337 (86%) have never filled a statin; and 2,887 were 40 years of age or older, of which 2,409 (83.4%) have never filled a statin. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, with this large of a population size to determine how many potential CVD risk factors members have. Additionally, lipid levels are not collected in data, so there is no way to determine if a diabetic patient has an LDL greater than 100 mgldL without pharmacotherapy. Thus, this will appear as an article in an upcoming DUR Digest. Long-Acting Beta Agonists in Asthma: The purpose of this study was to identify members using long-acting beta-agonist inhalers for the treatment of asthma, and to make prescribers aware of new warnings from the FDA. In February of 2010, the FDA released new recommendations to help improve the safe use of long-acting beta- agonist (LABA) inhalers for the treatment of asthma. This alert was in response to an analysis of studies that showed an increased risk of hospitalizations and death in adults and children with asthma using LABA inhalers due to an increased risk of severe exacerbation of asthma symptoms. The drugs that were included in this recommendation were salmeterol (serevent), formoterol u&ating their package inserts and impiementing strategies to reduce the overall use of these medications, we performed an analysis to determine how these products were being used in the lowa Medicaid population. Medicaid members with current eligibility and a diagnosis of asthma in their medical claims were identified. Of these members, we reviewed non-reversed, paid pharmacy claims between 12/1/09 and 2/28/10 to identify how many members identified as using one of these products, we looked at how many were combining this regimen with an asthma-controller medication (corticosteroid, leukotriene, anti-inflammatory, and/or xanthine). We also looked at those under 18 years of age who were using the single ingredient products compared to the combination products. Of these 27,184 members, 1,834 (6.75%) were identified as having claims for a long-acting beta agonist between 12/1/09 and 2/28/10, of which 575 members were under the age of 18 years old; 17 of these members were found to be using duplicate LABAs. Of the 1,834 members identified as having recent claims for a long-acting beta agonist between 12/1/09 and 2/28/10, 824 (44.9%) were identified as combining the long-acting beta agonist with a \"controller\" medication. 1,010 (55.1%) members were identified as using a long-acting beta agonist without a \"controller\" medication. For those under 18 years of age, the ratio of single ingredient products to combination products was 0.08. This will appear as a DUR Digest article. Valproate Use as Mood Stabilizer in Women of Childbearing Age: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of which women of childbearing age in the lowa Medicaid population are using valproate for non-seizure diagnoses. The FDA recently published a reminder to health care professionals about the increased risk of major birth defects in infants exposed to valproate sodium and related products in utero. These birth defects can include neural tube defects, craniofacial defects, and cardiovascular malformations. Infants exposed to valproate during the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy have an increased risk of neural tube effect in 1 in 20 infants. When used to treat epilepsy, the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry reports that the rate of major malformations in infants born to women with epilepsy taking valproate is nearly 4 times higher than the rate of major malformations in infants born to women taking other agents. The communication from the FDA goes on to encourage health care providers to counsel women of childbearing age about the increased risk of birth defects when valproate is taken during pregnancy, and that effective contraception should be used in women not planning a pregnancy. An analysis of pharmacy claims was conducted between 12/1/2009 and 2/28/2010 to identify the number of female members of childbearing age (aged 16 years and older) who received two or more prescriptions for any valproate product. Of those identified, we removed any member who also had claims during the same time for hormonal contraceptive products, physician administered contraceptive products, and those who had undergone surgical sterilization. We also removed any member with a seizure diagnosis. The remaining members were determined to be using valproate for a mental health or other compendia-listed indication. A sub-analysis was performed to determine how many members also had a pregnancy diagnosis during the time valproate was used. Seven hundred-four unique female members, aged 16 years or older, received two or more prescriptions for valproate between 12/1/09 and 2/28/10. The remaining female members, aged 16 years of age or older, who are using valproate for a diagnosis other than seizure disorder who may have a higher risk of pregnancy totaled 177. Dr. Graber recommended that the data be rerun, limiting the ages to between 16 and 45, to allow for use in post-menopausal women. Letters will be sent to the prescribers of the members within this age bracket. Craig Logemann also noted that the ones using valproate for seizures should still be included in the study. Dr. Graber thought it would also be interesting to see how many women taking anti-seizure medication were also on folic acid. Miscellaneous DUR Digest: The Commission members offered changes and additions to the draft for DUR Digest Volume 22, Number 3. SMAC Updates: The Commission members were given a copy of the SMAC changes that had gone into effect in March and April. MedWafch: The Commission members received FDA announcements concerning new Black Box Warnings. A unanimous vote was made at 11:26 to adjourn the meeting and move to closed session (first by Rick Rinehart, second by Sara Schutte-Schenck). The next meeting will be held at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, June 2, 2010 at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines. Attendees: / staff S L~homas Kline, D.O.; and Pam -- Sandy p;ange;, R.F%., IME; and ~iddle, IME. Welcome & Introductions Chairperson Dr. Mark Graber called the meeting to order at 9:31 a.m. at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines. Commission members and guests were welcomed and introduced. Bruce Alexander received a letter and certificate of recognition from the lowa Medicaid Director for his 8 years of service to the DUR Commission. The minutes from the May 5, 2010 meeting were approved. (Motion by Larry Ambroson, second by Dr. Rick Rinehart, unanimous approval by voice vote.) lowa Medicaid Enterwise Uadates Dr. Jason Kessler was recently named the new lowa Medicaid Medical Director. A Clinical Advisory Committee meeting was held in May; they are currently looking for 3 new members. Beginning July 1, 2010 there will be some new programs at the IME, as well as contract integration and new vendors. Lock-in services will now be operated by Member Services instead of Medical Services. DHS is still working through how much of an impact Healthcare Reform will have on drug rebates. The SSDC pool meeting to discuss rebates for the next calendar year is June 15-16. DHS is also in the process of establishing rules for bringing mental health drugs onto the PDL. Draft rules and timeline were posted on www.iowamedicaidpdl.com under the Rules link, and emailed to the listserv as well. The next P&T Meeting will be September gth at the Capitol. Informational letter 903 was just sent out, announcing changes brought about from the last P&T Meeting, along with new PA criteria for Cymbalta, Lyrica, and Savella. Case Studies Pam Smith presented four intervention case studies. Recommendations by Commissioners from these four examples resulted in annualized total savings of $16,332.65 pre-rebate (state and federal). Public Comment Thomas Carattini from Accord Pharmaceuticals spoke about Ampyra. Victoria Lopez from Endo Pharmaceuticals offered to answer any questions about the Lidoderm Patch as it was on the agenda. Karen Loihl from the lowa Psychiatric Society voiced concerns regarding the proposed prior authorization criteria for lntuniv, along with the fact that it had been referred to the Mental Health Advisory Group but no meeting had been called to discuss it. Nancy Bell congratulated Bruce Alexander on his retirement from the DUR Commission and thanked him for his service. PA Criteria Extended Release Formulations: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Payment for a non-preferred extended release formulation will be considered when the following is met: e Previous trial with the preferred immediate release product at a therapeutic dose that resulted in a partial response with a documented intolerance to the preferred immediate release product of the same chemical entity and a Previous trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with a preferred drug of a dqerent chemical entity indicated to treat the submitted diagnosis. The required trials may be overridden when documented evidence is provided that the use of these agents would be medically contraindicated. Larry Ambroson motioned to accept the proposed criteria, and Dr. Rick Rinehart seconded. The motion passed unanimously. Extended Release Guanfacine (Intuniv): The Commission reviewed a letter from the lowa Psychiatric Society regarding concerns about the proposed prior authorization criteria for Intuniv. The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria, as follows. addressing the issues within the letter: Prior authorization is required for Intuniv. Payment will be considered for patients when the following is met: 1) The patient has a diagnosis ofADHD and is between 6 and 17 y ears of age; and 2) Previous trial with immediate release guanfacine at a therapeutic dose that resulted in a partial response with a documented intolerance; and 3) Previous trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with two of the following: a preferred amphetamine stimulant, a preferred non-amphetamine stimulant, or Strattera. The required trials may be overridden when documented evidence is provided that the use of these agents would be medically contraindicated. A quantity limit of 30 tablets per 30 days for all strengths (Img, Zmg, 3mg, and 4mg) was also recommended. Craig Logemann motioned to accept the criteria, and Bruce Alexander seconded. The motion passed with no objections or abstentions. Sodium Oxybate (Xyrem): The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for sodium oxybate (xyrem@)'). Payment will be considered forpatient I6 years of age or older under the following conditions: I. A diagnosis of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy and previous trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with a tricyclic antidepressant or SSM 2. A diagnosis of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy and previous trial and therapy failure at a therapeutic dose with a preferred stimulant. 3. Requests for patients with a prior history of substance abuse will not be considered. The required trials may be overridden when documented evidence is provided that the use of these agents would be medically contraindicated. This topic was tabled until a future meeting so that information and wording could be clarified regarding the stimulants, making the language consistent with other prior authorizations. Dalfampridine (Ampyra): The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for da(fampridine (AmpyraTM). r Payment will be considered for patients that have a gait disorder associated with MS. e Initial authovizations will be approved for 12 weeks; additional prior authorizations will be considered after assessing the benefit to the patient as measured by an increase in walking speed using the Timed 25 ;foot Walk assessment. r Prior authorizations will not be considered for patients with a seizure diagnosis or in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. A quantity limit of 60 tablets per 30 days was also recommended. Neurologists will be contacted for feedback, and their input will be brought back to the next meeting. Biologicals for Ankylosing Spondylitis: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for biologicals used for ankylosing spondylitis. Payment will be considered following inadequate responses to at least two preferred non-steroidal anti-infammatories (NSAIDs) at maximum therapeutic doses, unless there are documented adverse responses or contraindications to NSAID use. These trials should be at least three months in duration. Patients with symptoms of peripheral arthritis must also have failed a 30-day treatment trial with at least one conventional disease modlying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), unless there is a documented adverse response or contraindication to DMARD use. DMARDs include the non-preferred biologicals for ankylosing spondylitis will be considered only for cases in which there is documentation ofprevious trials and therapy failures with two preferred biological agents. Dr. Casey Clor motioned to accept the modified criteria, and Bruce Alexander seconded. The motion passed unanimously. Biologicals for Arthritis: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required ,for biologicals used for rheumatoid arthritis. Payment will be considered following an inadequate response to a preferred disease modzjjhg antirheumatic drug such as hydvoxycholoroquine, sulfh.salazine, methotrexate, lejlunomide, or minocycline, and a combination another preferred disease modzfving antirheumatic drug (DMARD) unless contraindicated. Payment for non-preferred biologicals for arthritis will be considered only for cases in which there is documentation of previous trials and therapy failures with two preferred biological agents. This will be brought back to the next meeting with updated wording. Biologicals for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for biologicals used for inzammatoiy bowel disease. Prior authorization is required for all non-preferred biologicals for injlammatoiy bowel disease as indicated on the Iowa Medicaid Preferred Drug List beginning the first day of therapy. Payment for non-preferred biologicals for Crohn 's disease will be considered only for cases in which there is documentation of previous trials and therapy failures with two preferred agents. * Crohn's Disease -Payment will be considered following an inadequate response to two preferred conventional therapies such as aminosalicylates (mesalamine, sulfasalazine), azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, and/or methotiexate. Ulcerative colitis (moderate to severe) -Payment will be considered following an inadequate response to two preferred conventional therapies such as aminosalicylates, and/or azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine. Dr. Mark Graber motioned to accept the proposed criteria, and Dr. Casey Clor seconded. There were no objections. Biologicals for Plaque Psoriasis: The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for biologicals used for plaque psoriasis. Payment will be considered following an inadequate response to phototherapy, systemic retinoids (oral isotretinoin), methotrexate, or cyclosporine. Prior authorization is required for all non- preferred biologicals for plaque psoriasis as indicated on the Iowa Medicaid Preferred Drug List beginning the first day of therapy. Payment for non-preferred biologicals for plaque psoriasis will be considered only for cases in which there is documentation of previous trials and therapy failures with two prefe rred agents. Dr. Casey Clor motioned to accept the proposed criteria, and Larry Ambroson seconded. There were no objections. Lidocaine Patch: At the April 8, 2010 P&T Committee meeting, it was requested the DUR review the language for the Lidocaine Patch PA. It was the P&T Committee's opinion that the language was restrictive and gave the impression that it would only be approved for a diagnosis of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia. The Prior Authorization Criteria chart, available online, states at the top of each page \"The drug prior authorization unit will consider other conditions as listed in the compendia on an individual basis after reviewing documentation submitted regarding the medical necessity. All required trials must be of appropriate dose and duration for the indication and must be documented by the prescriber on the request for prior authorization form, including dates, dose, and nature of failure.\" All PA Criteria follows the same format listing only FDA approved indications. The only FDA approved indication for Lidoderm is post-herpetic neuralgia. The Commission reviewed the prior authorization criteria as follows: Prior authorization is required for topical lidocaine patches (LidodermB). Payment will be considered for a diagnosis ofpain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia following a previous treatment failure with two preferred agents at a therapeutic dose from two of the following: tricyclic antidepressant, opioid, gabapentin, carbamazepine, or valproic acid. A maximum of 30 patches may be dispensed with the initial prescription to determine efficacy. Larry Ambroson motioned to accept the proposed criteria, and Dr. Casey Clor seconded. The decision was unanimous. Pro-DUR Edits Quetiapine (Seroquel): Through the process of reviewing regular member profiles, it has been observed that members are receiving multiple tablets of the same strength of quetiapine (Seroquel) where there is the potential to consolidate the dose to a higher strength tablet, thus resulting in a cost savings to the State. Quetiapine (Seroquel) is the only atypical antipsychotic not subject to quantity limits. Quetiapine (Seroquel) is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Recommended dosing is either twice to three times daily, depending on the diagnosis, with a maximum dose of 800mg per day. It has also been observed that members are taking low doses of quetiapine (Seroquel) without a valid diagnosis in their medical claims history. Non- reversed, paid pharmacy claims were analyzed between 3/1/10 and 4/15/10 looking at the number of tablets per day of quetiapine (Seroquel). In addition, members using low dose quetiapine (Seroquel) without any other strengths of quetiapine (Seroquel) in their pharmacy claims history were identified. Based on the findings, Dr. Richard Rinehart motioned to adopt the proposed quantity limits and Craig Logemann seconded. All were in favor of this decision. No Pro-DUR edits blocking low dose Seroquel will be developed at this time, although this issue may be re-evaluated in January. Public Comment There were no speakers in this public comment section. Focus Studies Dronabinol (Marinol) Utilization: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of off-label dronabinol (Marinol) utilization. Dronabinol (Marinol) is a synthetic form delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active chemical entity in marijuana. It was first approved by the FDA in 1985 and is indicated for the prevention of chemo- induced nausea and vomiting that has been refractory to other antiemetic treatments, as well as anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS patients. While dronabinol (Marinol) has not had a high amount of utilization in the lowa Medicaid population, its use remains steady when comparing quarters over the last few years. During the first quarter of calendar year 2010, forty-seven prescriptions were filled for 24 unique members with a total paid amount of $51,044.05 (pre-rebate; state and federal dollars). It has been suspected, through the review of member profiles, that some of this utilization has been for off-label use. Non-reversed, paid pharmacy claims were analyzed between 111110 and 3/31/10. Members with claims for dronabinol (Marinol) during this time were identified. The medical claims histories for those members who had claims for dronabinol (Marinol) were then analyzed. Of the 12 members who did not have an approved indication in their claim histories, the top 3 most commonly observed ICD-9 codes associated with dronabinol (Marinol) use were: malaise and fatigue, lumbago, and pain in limb. A focus study will be developed to contact the prescribers of those members who were identified as using dronabinol (Marinol) for what appears to be an off-label use. This issue will also be referred to the P&T Committee with the recommendation to make dronabinol (Marinol) non-preferred. Quefiapine Off-Label Utilization: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of off label quetiapine (Seroquel) utilization, particularly for the treatment of ADDIADHD. Through the process of reviewing regular member profiles and monitoring prior authorization requests, the use of quetiapine (Seroquel) for off label indications . . appears to remain high, particularly for the treatment of ADDIADHD in children and adolescents. Quetiapine (Seroquel) was first approved in 1997 and is indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder. The immediate release product is a preferred product on the lowa Medicaid Preferred Drug List, while the extended release version is non-preferred and requires a prior authorization. Neither formulation is subject to quantity limit edits. The two most common off label uses observed through the PA department are low dose quetiapine (Seroquel) for sleep and for children and adolescents for ADDIADHD. Quetiapine (Seroquel) does not have a listing for ADDIADHD in the compendia as there is no good data to support its use for the treatment of ADDIADHD. Non-reversed, paid pharmacy claims from 1/1/10 to 3/31/10 were analyzed. Members who had paid claims for quetiapine (Seroquel) during this time were identified. We then reviewed the medical claims histories of those identified as having fills for quetiapine (Seroquel). There were 3,243 members with claims for quetiapine (Seroquel) between 1/1/10 and 3/31/10, with 1,756 members without an approved diagnosis for use (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or depression), including 660 members with a diagnosis of ADHD without a co-existing approved diagnosis. This issue was referred to the Mental Health Advisory Group for further evaluation and additional suggestions to discourage off-label usage. Duplicate long-Acting Stimulants: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of concurrent use of long acting stimulants. Through the process of regular member profile reviews, the combination of long acting stimulants is frequently observed. Stimulants do not require a PA in members less than 21 years of age, which is where the majority of these duplications occur. For those 21 years of age and older, a prior authorization is required. When prior authorizations are requested for duplicate long acting stimulants, they are denied without proper medical rationale as to why the combination is warranted (most are for severe narcoleptic patients who have failed to control symptoms with a single agent). Using duplicate long acting stimulants can have an additive effect, increasing the risks of tachycardia, hypertension, and other noradrenergic side effects. Additionally, it is more costly to use two products at sub- therapeutic doses when symptoms could be controlled on one agent at a full, therapeutic dose. Available treatment guidelines for ADDIADHD do not support the use of duplicate long acting stimulants. Non-reversed, paid pharmacy claims were analyzed between 12/1/09 and 3/31/10. Members who were using duplicate long acting stimulants concurrently for two or more months that continued the combination into March 2010 were identified. These members were broken out to those over 21 years of age, and those 21 years of age and under. 170 members continued the combination of long-acting stimulants into March 2010, 165 of them 21 years of age or younger. This was also referred to the Mental Health Advisory Group. The members asked that the number of prescribers for each member and their respective specialties be added to the report. Multiple Anti-Epileptic Medications: The purpose of this study was to determine the number of Iowa Medicaid members using three or more anticonvulsants for any diagnosis concurrently. It is often noted in member profile reviews that members are on multiple anticonvulsants concurrently. This often receives comments on the member profiles discussed at Commission meetings. Anticonvulsants can be prescribed for the treatment of seizure disorders or for the maintenance of bipolar disorder. When used as maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder, the American Psychiatric Association's Practice Guideline for the Treatment for Patients with Bipolar Disorder recommends the use of lithium as first line therapy followed by valproic acid if lithium is not tolerated or does not produce a response. Lamotrigine and carbamazepine are considered possible alternatives if a second medication is required. When used to treat epilepsy, approximately half of the patients with a new diagnosis of epilepsy are successfully treated with the first antiepileptic used. If a trial with a second product is required, either due to an inadequate response or side effects, nearly half of these patients will be successful with the second drug. Combination and polypharmacy is only recommended if at least two adequate trials of single agents have failed. It is estimated that only 10- 15% of patients achieve seizure remission with two or more products in combination following failure of monotherapy. Another recent phenomenon observed in the Pharmacy Prior Authorization department is an increase in the use of the new antiepileptic drug, Banzel (rufinamide). Banzel (rufinamide) is FDA-approved for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Many of the prior authorization requests that have been received are requesting Banzel (rufinamide) for an off-label indication (the efficacy of Banzel in treating other seizure types has not been established) and/or it is being requested as an addition to an existing antiepileptic regimen as a fourth or even fifth product. The use of Banzel (rufinamide) has slowly increased in the Iowa Medicaid population; in the first quarter of calendar year 2010, there were 121 prescriptions filled for a total cost of $39,090 (state and federal dollars, pre-rebate). Non-reversed, paid pharmacy claims were analyzed between 1/1/10 and 3/31/10. Members with two or more prescriptions in their claims history for any anticonvulsant were identified (clonazepam and diazepam were not count-ed as anticonvulsants for this report). Of those identified, those who were using three or more different anticonvuisants concurrently were identified and analyzed. Of the 334 members taking three or more different anticonvulsants concurrently, 27 were identified as having Banzel (rufinamide) as part of their regimen. Letters will be sent to the prescribers of Banzel to inquire about the diagnosis for use since it is only FDA approved for use in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and cannot be teased out by looking at ICD-9 codes. Letters will also be sent to the prescribers of the members who had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or conversion disorder without a coexisting seizure diagnosis who were not on any combinations of carbamazepine, valproate, and lamotrigine. Nineteen members identified as using 3 or more anticonvulsants concurrently without a corresponding diagnosis of epilepsy or bipolar disorder will also receive letters. Letters will also be sent to the prescribers of the members being treated with three or more anticonvulsants with a diagnosis of febril convulsions if they do not have any other seizure diagnosis. Miscellaneous DUR Digest: The Commission members offered changes and additions to the draft for DUR Digest Volume 22, Number 3. SMAC Updates: The Commission members were given a copy of the SMAC changes that had gone into effect in May. MedWatch: The Commission members received FDA announcements concerning new Black Box Warnings. A unanimous vote was made at 12:lO p.m. to adjourn the meeting and move to closed session (1'' by Bruce Alexander, 2\" by Dr. Richard Rinehart). The next meeting will be held at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, August 4, 2010 at the Learning Resource Center in West Des Moines. Appendix N Mental Health Work Group The Iowa Medicaid Drug Utilization Review Mental Health Advisory Group (MHAG), formerly laow as the Mental Health Work Group, was established in State EYE 2008. It is currently comprised of three members of the Drug Utilization Review Commission (one pediatrician, one psychiatrist, and one psychiatric pharmacist), several pediatric and adolescent psychiatrists, an adult psychiatrist, and a psychiatrist from Magellan Health Services. The Mental Health Advisory Group is a separate entity from the Iowa Medicaid Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Commission. All recommendations from the MHAG must be approved by the DUR Commission before they can be implemented. The original goal of the MHWG was to address issues that developed specific to the pediatric and adolescent psychiatrists within the State of Iowa when mental health drug consolidation edits were implemented in October, 2007. Since then, the DUR Commission has made the decision to refer other mental health issues that impact the entire mental health population of Iowa Medicaid, regardless of the members' age. The MHAG met once in State FYE 2010. The minutes from the July meeting have not been approved by the members of the MHAG and therefore are not included in this report. Appendix O Smoking Cessation Report IOWA MEDICAID DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW COMMISSION 100 Amy Post Road - Des Moines, IA 50315 (515) 725-1287 * Fax 1-866-626-0216 DUR Project Coordinator To: Susan Parker, R.Ph., Pharm.D. From: The Iowa Medicaid Drug Utilization Review Commission Regarding: The Iowa Medicaid Smoking Cessation Program Date: February 5,2010 Enclosed please find copies of reports to the Department relative to the Iowa Medicaid Smoking Cessation Program. This report is divided into three sections: Background, Program Results, and DUR Review and Recommendations. Background A. Program Review The 2005-2006 General Assembly passed HF825 and HF841 requesting that the Department expand coverage under the medical assistance program to cover smoking cessation drugs. This was to be done in collaboration with the Iowa Department of Public Health programs relating to tobacco use prevention and cessation. Iowa Medicaid requested that the Iowa Medicaid Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Commission develop prior authorization criteria for the smoking cessation program incorporating counseling through Qnitline Iowa. (Studies have shown that smoking cessation programs that incorporate counseling in conjunction with medication therapy have higher success rates.) The Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee were requested to review the smoking cessation products for inclusion on the Preferred Drug List. Effective January 1,2007, the Iowa Medicaid Program expanded coverage to include select over-the-counter nicotine replacement patches and gum, and generic bupropion sustained- release (SR) products that are FDA-indicated for smoking cessation (generic ZybanO). Bupropion 150mg sustained-release products that are FDA-indicated for smoking cessation (generic ZybanO) are available without prior authorization (PA). Over-the-counter nicotine replacement patches and gum are covered with a prior authorization. e The Iowa Medicaid DUR Commission reviewed the clinical information available for varenicline (ChantixTM) on several occasions and had recommended to the Department of Human Services the drug not be covered until more safety and efficacy data were made available. Specifically, the Commission was interested in seeing safety and efficacy data on varenicline (ChantixTM) used in medically complex patients with multiple chronic conditions that more closely resembled the Medicaid population. To date, such data is not available. The Department of Human Services made the decision, however, to provide coverage of varenicline (ChantixTM) since safety and efficacy had already been proven as part of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval process. Therefore, effective February 18,2008, the Iowa Medicaid Program again expanded coverage to include the prescription product, varenicline (ChantixTM) with a prior authorization. B. Prior Authorization (PA) Criteria for Nicotine Replacement Therapy and Varenicline (ChantixTM) Following recommendations from both the DUR and P&T Committees, the prior authorization criterion were established as follows: Prior Authorization is required for over-the-counter nicotine replacement patches and nicotine gum. Requests for authorization must include: 1) Diagnosis of nicotine dependence and referral to the Quitline Iowa program for counseling. 2) Confirmation of enrollment in the Quitline Iowa counseling program is required for approval. 3) Approvals will only be granted for patients eighteen years of age and older. 4) The maximum allowed duration of therapy is twelve weeks within a twelve-month period. 5) A maximum quantity of 14 nicotine replacement patches andlor 110 pieces of nicotine gum may be dispensed with the initial prescription. Subsequent prescription refills will be allowed to be dispensed as a 4-week supply at one unit per day of nicotine replacement patches and lor 330 pieces of nicotine gum. Following the first 28 days of therapy, continuation is available only with documentation of ongoing participation in the Quitline Iowa program. 6) The 72-hour emergency supply rule does not apply for drugs used for the treatment of smoking cessation Prior Authorization is required for varenicline (ChantixTM). Requests for authorization must include: 1) Diagnosis of nicotine dependence and referral to the Quitline Iowa program for counseling. 2) Confirmation of enrollment and ongoing participation in the Quitline Iowa counseling program is required for approval and continued coverage. 3) Approvals will only be granted for patients eighteen years of age and older. 4) The duration of therapy is initially limited to twelve weeks within a twelve-month period. For patients who have successfully stopped smoking at the end of 12 weeks, an additional course of 12 weeks treatment will be considered with a prior authorization request. The maximum duration of approvable therapy is 24 weeks within a twelve- month period. 5) Requests for varenicline to be used in combination with bupropion SR that is FDA indicated for smoking cessation or nicotine replacement therapy will not be approved. 6) The 72-hour emergency supply rule does not apply for drugs used for the treatment of smoking cessation C. Prior Authorization (PA) Process e Iowa Medicaid members who want assistance in quitting smoking need to be referred to Quitline Iowa by their healthcare provider. If it is determined that the member would benefit from using over-the-counter nicotine replacement patches and/or gum, a Nicotine Replacement Therapy Prior Authorization form must be completed by the member and the prescriber. Alternatively, if it is determined that the member would benefit from using varenicline (ChantixTM), a Varenicline (ChantixTM) Prior Authorization form must be completed by the member and the prescriber. The completed form(s) is then faxed to Quitline Iowa. Quitline Iowa will follow up with the member and assess the member's smoking cessation counseling needs. Following this initial consultation, Quitline Iowa will submit the prior authorization request to the Iowa Medicaid Pharmacy Prior Authorization Unit for coverage of the necessary smoking cessation products. e In the event that the member chooses to disenroll from the Quitline Iowa program, all approved prior authorizations will be cancelled and notification will be faxed to the provider and pharmacy, while a letter will be mailed to the member. Program Results Ouitline Program National Jewish Medical and Research Center began providing Quitline services for the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) on January i, 2008. he-University of Northern Iowa has partnered with National Jewish to evaluate participantsatisfaction and quit rates. The relationship between'Iowa Medicaid and IDPH is a collaborative effort to provide smoking cessation products through Medicaid and counseling services through IDPH (via the contractual relationship with National Jewish Medical Center) to those who qualify for Iowa Medicaid. Current literature for all populations, not solely Medicaid members, that examine quit rates for various interventions reports that the odds ratio of maintaining abstinence from smoking at six months following multiple proactive call back counseling sessions after contact was initiated by a motivated quitter (similar to how the Quitline Iowa program works) is 1.41 .' It has also been found that higher intensity ' Meites, Elissa. Telephone Counseling Improves Smoking Cessation Rates. Am Fam Physician. 2007; 75(5): 650. disease management is associated with higher abstinence from When smoking cessation counseling is combined with drug therapy, the odds of achieving cessation are often times doubled When looking at the odds ratio of maintaining abstinence from smoking six months after using pharmacotherapy, current literature (not exclusively looking at a Medicaid population) report the following: nicotine patches - 1.81; nicotine gum - 1.66; bupropion - 2.06. When compared to varenicline (ChantixTM), the odds ratio of maintaining abstinence from smoking after 12 weeks of therapy ranges from 2.70 to 5.50.~ Currently, the only statistic available for the ChantixTM odds ratio is 12 weeks. Quitline Iowa received 5,473 faxed referrals for Iowa Medicaid members between October 1, 2008 and September 30,2009. From these referrals, 3,339 members were enrolled in the Quitline program. During the same time frame, 1,663 members were disenrolled from the Quitline program. The inability to reach the member was a barrier to the enrollment process as Quitline counselors often received constant busy signals, invalid phone numbers, or disconnected phones. For the specified time period above, 1,659 (30%) members could not be reached by the Quitline counselors, 222 (4%) members declined enrollment, and 253 (5%) members requested information only. Compared to data from last year, 1,418 (27%) members could not be reached by the Quitline counselors, 201 (4%) members declined enrollment, and 241 (5%) members requested information only. It should be noted, data from last year was only for a nine month time frame. The University of Northern Iowa is responsible for completing follow-up interviews with Iowa Medicaid members who participated in the Quitline Iowa counseling program. Interviews assess whether the participant has \"quit smoking\", which is defined as not having had a cigarette in the 30 days prior to the follow-up interview. Three groups of members are interviewed by the University of Northern Iowa: one at 3 months following their first call to Quitline, one at 6 months, and one at 12 months from a random sample of Medicaid members. Numbers reported are not unique members. Overall, 4,426 people completed follow-up interviews. Of those 4,426 participants, 888 were classified as being Medicaid clients of Quitline. Of these 888 participants: * 868 (99.2%) said they smoked cigarettes around the time of their first call to Quitline * Of these 868 participants, 185 (21.1%) quit smoking 195 participants (23.6%) said they spoke with a Quitline representative 8 or more times. o Of these 195 participants, 50 (25.8%) quit smoking In the 3-month cohort of the follow-up evaluation, 377 participants were classified as being Medicaid clients of Quitline. Of these 377 participants: 367 (98.9%) participants said they smoked cigarettes around the time of their first call to Quitline o Of these 367 participants, 86 (23.3%) quit smoking e 68 participants (18.9%) said they spoke with a Quitline representative 8 or more times o Of these 68 participants, 22 (32.8%) quit smoking In the 6-month cohort of the follow-up evaluation, 292 participants were classified as being Medicaid clients of Quitline.

Of these 219 participants: 214 (99.5%) participants said they smoked cigarettes around the time of their first call to Quitline o Of these 214 participants, 44 (20.3%) quit smoking * 55 participants (27.6%) said they spoke with a Quitline representative 8 or more times o Of these 55 participants, 14 (25.5%) quit smoking The mean number of contacts in the Quitline program for all Medicaid members who enrolled was five. Prior Authorization Program For the time period of October 1,2008 through September 30,2009,6,852 Prior Authorizations (PA) were approved for smoking cessation products out of a total of 9,207 requests or 74% were approved. Reasons for denial of the PA include: the member was under 18 years of age, the member was not enrolled in Quitline, the PA request form was incomplete, the PA request was for a Medicare covered product for a dual eligible, or the member had disenrolled from Quitline. There were also 12 PA requests for noncovered products; two of which resulted in requests for an Exception to Policy which were not granted. For this time period of October 1,2008 through September 30,2009, members received a total of 5,682 prescriptions for smoking cessation products at a total cost (federal and state dollars before rebates) of $512,403. Administration of the pharmacy prior authorization component of the smoking cessation program during this timeframe was $102,083 total dollars (federal and state). Any additional costs for administration of the Quitline Iowa program would he incurred by the Iowa Department of Public Health. DUR Review and Recommendations Amount Paid $7,056 $103,144 Therapy Chantix Total The Commission continues to evaluate the safety and efficacy data that becomes available for varenicline (ChantixTM). At their meeting held in September 2008, the Commission reviewed new safety information relative to use of varenicline in various mental health disorders. The clinical prior authorization criteria were reviewed and compared to the Veteran's Administration prior authorization criteria. The Commission came to the consensus that no recommended changes to the Medicaid clinical prior authorization criteria were required at this time. Also, the DUR Commission elected not to review the clinical PA criteria as part of the annual review of criterion during their meeting in August 2009. However, the Commission will Number of PAS Approved NIA 2,6251 3,278 safety data and other third party payers' prior authorization criteria to determine if any changes would he appropriate in the future. The Commission also reviewed the November 6,2009 MMWR article State Medicaid Coverage for Tobacco-Dependence Treatments - United States, 2007 at their meeting in December 2009. Although the article recommends open access to tobacco-dependence treatments without barriers or limitations in Medicaid populations, the Commission felt it was not appropriate for Iowa Medicaid to change the current smoking cessation program due to the low rate of requests for non-covered products and there have been no requests for use of smoking cessation therapy beyond the time limits currently in place. The Commission recommends that Quitline continue to establish ways to collect better efficacy data on the program and specific product efficacy and utilization data including adverse drug reactions from covered medications specific to the Iowa Medicaid population. In addition, the Commission recommends that Quitline continue to develop strategies to identify and resolve communication harriers with Iowa Medicaid enrollees. At this time, the Commission has no recommended changes on the products currently covered under the smoking cessation program. The Iowa Medicaid DUR Commission appreciates the opportunity to make these recommendations to the Department.

IOWA MEDICAID DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW COMMISSION 100 Army Post Road - Des Moines, IA 50315 * (515) 725-1287 * Fax R.Ph., DUR Commission Referral to the P&T Committee Dear Susan: At the request of the DUR Commission members, I am forwarding the following referral to the P&T Committee members for consideration. Ophthalmic fluoroquinolones were reviewed by the DUR Commission at their September 2nd, 2009 meeting. The American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines on treating bacterial conjunctivitis state that \"The choice of antibiotic is usually empirical. Since a 5-to-7-day course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is usually effective, the most convenient or least expensive option can be selected.\" The recommended first line treatment options for bacterial conjunctivitis include erythromycin ophthalmic ointment (particularly for children), sulfacetamide ophthalmic drops, or polymyxin/trimethoprim drops. Most common organisms responsible for bacterial conjunctivitis respond to these agents within one to two days with a marked decrease in discharge, irritation, and redness. Alternative treatments include bacitracin ointment, sulfacetamide ointment, polymyxin/bacitracin ointment, fluoroquinolone drops or azithromycin drops. Due to the considerable cost difference between the recommended first line therapy ophthalmic antibiotics, fluoroquinolone drops, and azithromycin drops, it would be most cost effective to initiate therapy with a preferred first line therapy ophthalmic antibiotic drop or ointment. It would be desirable to shift prescribing practices away from fluoroquinolone drops to preferred first line therapy ophthalmic antibiotics. Nearly 95% of all ophthalm~c fluoroquinolne drop users during a three month timeframe were using it as a first line agent, with only a handful of members having a corresponding diagnosis that would support its use as a first line agent. The DUR Commission, therefore, requests that the P&T Committee consider making all ophthalmic fluoroquinolones non-preferred on the Preferred Drug List, to shift utilization towards less expensive, first-line treatment options when treating bacterial conjunctivitis. Thank you in advance for consideration of moving ophthalmic fluoroquinofone products to non- preferred status on the Preferred Drug List. Sincerely, A Pamela Smith, RPh.

Phann.D From: R.Ph., DUR Commission Referral to the P&T Committee Dear Susan: At the request of the DUR Commission members, I am forwarding the following referral to the P&T Committee members for further consideration. Ophthalmic fluoroquinolones were reviewed by the DUR Commission at their September 2, 2009 meeting. The DUR Commission requested that the P&T Committee consider making all ophthalmic fluoroquinolones non-preferred on the Preferred Drug List, to shift utilization towards less expensive, first-line treatment options when treating bacterial conjunctivitis. In a letter to the Department dated November 13, 2009, the P&T Committee recommended changing the status of brand ophthalmic fluoroquinolone products to non-preferred for members less than 18 years of age. This recommendation was discussed at the December 2, 2009 DUR meeting. The DUR Commision requests the P&T reconsider their recommendation to include all ophthalmic fluoroquinolone products as uon-preferred on the Preferred Drug List for members less than 18 years of age. Thank you in advance for consideration of moving all ophthalmic fluoroquinolone products to non- preferred status on the Preferred Drug List. Sincerely, A Pamela Smith, R.Ph.

Coordinator June 2,2010 Susan L. Parker, R.Ph., Pharm.D. Pharmacy Director Iowa Medicaid Enterprise 100 Army Post Road Des Moines, Iowa 503 15 Dear Susan: The Iowa Medicaid Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Commission met on Wednesday, June 2,2010. At this meeting, the DUR Commission members reviewed utilization data on dronabinol (Marinol) for off- label use. While dronabinol (Marinol) has not had a high amount of utilization in the Iowa Medicaid population, its use remains steady. During the first quarter of calendar year 2010, forty-seven prescriptions were filled for twenty-four unique members. Of the twenty-four members, twelve were found to not have a corresponding diagnosis in their medical claims histories for use of dronabinol (Marinol). The DUR Commission recommended referring dronabinol (Marinol) to the P&T Committee to make it non-preferred on the Preferred Drug List. Sincerely, Pamela Smith, R.Ph.
