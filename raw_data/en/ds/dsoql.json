Writing in the October NUTRITION FORUM, Barrett said civil actions are slow and rarely result in a loss to the seller of unproven health products. But criminal action, which could have an in\u00ad hibiting effect, is rarely applied; only one such case was instituted in the 20-year period between 1963 and 1983. A four\u00ad year investigation by Rep. Claude Pepper revealed the FDA has no organized pro\u00ad gram for detecting and prosecuting fraud, and only 50 cents out of each $100 the agency receives is allocated to quackery. This small amount also covers educa\u00ad tional activities and publications. Pepper recommends more vigorous efforts by the FDA to educate the public, detect label\u00ad ing violations, enforce the law and unite with the FTC and Postal Service against repeat offenders. BROADCASTERS WARNED ABOUT QUESTIONABLE HEALTH TALK SHOWS: Three articles in the January 7, 1985 issue of EARSHOT, a broadcast media newspaper, deal with the problem of nonscientific health information that is presented on the radio. Two of the ar\u00ad ticles are authored by Brad Woodward and deal primarily with the activities of health entrepreneur Kurt Donsbach. Facts previously unknown to NCAHF about the nature of Donsbach's operation are revealed. Other information, such as Donsbach's criminal background, are presented. Most interesting is Donsbach's illogical defense of his past record. He claims in the article that the crime of practicing medicine without a license (he prescribed supplements, herbs, and diets for breast cancer; spastic colons, menopause, heart ailments, stomach ulcers, etc.) for which he was convicted in 1971 is now legal. . NEWSLETTER QUALITY IN THE HEAL TH MARKETPLACE Yet, he further correctly states that prescribing for a disease (which is what he did) is illegal. The law Donsbach cites is SB 1790 which became effective January 1, 1979. SB 1790 was introduc\u00ad ed by California Senator William Camp\u00ad bell (the legislator who usually introduces the special interest legislation favorable to the promoters of health hokum.) SB 1790 actually changed nothing insofar as practicing medicine without a license is concerned. It merely provided the health foods industry with a propaganda victory VOL.8, NO.1 and gave store clerks a bit more con\u00ad fidence in their right to dispense nutrition and health misinformation. NCAHF op\u00ad posed SB 1790 back then and still believes it was not in the consumer's in\u00ad terest. A third article by Chuck Wolf pro\u00advides broadcasters with information on how they can check on the validity of people wishing to dispense health infor\u00admation via the radio.

CCK is the latest product claimed to be of benefit in reducing body fat. CCK is a polypeptide (small protein molecule). Years ago CCK was identified as a hormone produced by the small intestine. It travels through the blood stream to the gallbladder and pancreas where it stimulates the flow of digestive juices. More recent scientific evidence indicates that CCK also acts on the satiety center in the brain to suppress appetite. Indeed, many researchers now suspect that the high satiety value of a meal rich in fat may be partially due to the fact that dietary fat is the primary stimulator for the release of CCK into the blood stream. This is an exciting new area of research for the scientific community that may eventually lead to advances in the treatment of obesity. However, to the health foods industry, it is another chance to exploit-the public's desire for a quick and easy solution to weight-loss. Earl Mindell, \"Ph.D.\" (from unaccredited Beverly Hills University), author of VITAMIN BIBLE and other best-selling nutrition books, is principal owner of Great Earth health food stores. Mindell has formulated a product called \"Metabolean\" which contains, among other things, intestine of cattle. Since the intestinal tissue of all mammals produces CCK, it is assumed that \"Metabolean\" contains at least a trace of CCK. According to Great Earth advertising \"Metabolean\" is \"clinical\u00ad ly proven,\" however, Gordon Scott of the FDA has assured me that his agency has received no proof that \"Metabolean\" (or any other CCK-containing product) is effective in suppressing appetite or as an aid to weight-loss. Nevertheless, handout 74B, obtained from a Great Earth store, specifically states that CCK \"satisfies hunger,\" \"decreases appetite,\" and \"aids in weight~loss.\" Before these claims are believed, it is important to consider these facts: (1) CCK is a protein molecule which would be digested before it could be absorbed if taken orally; (2) the animal experiments which found that CCK suppressed ap\u00ad petite were done by injecting the animals with highly purified CCK; (3) no one has shown, nor is there any reason to suspect, that even purified CCK (let alone ground up animal intestine) suppresses appetite; (4) the only way CCK might affect appetite would be if highly purified CCK were injected intravenously before each meal. It is doubtful CCK would prove to be safe and effective under these circumstances. The bottom line is that the only way tablets containing CCK is apt to reduce a person's appetite is via the placebo effect or realization that they shelled out $15 for what was little more than ground up cow intestine! -James Kenney, PhD, RD- The NEWSLETTER is published bimonthly by The National Council Against Health Fraud, Inc., an all volunteer, nonprofit, tax-exempt organization.

HEALTH GURU GAYELORD HAUSER DIES Gayelord Hauser, a major health guru of the '30s and '40s, died Dec. 26 in his North Hollywood home at the age of 89. Hauser, whose books sold nearly 50 million copies around the world, ad\u00ad vocated a mishmash of unproven conjec\u00ad ture and some sound ideas. He was an early advocate of yogurt, granola, wheat germ and brewer's yeast as \"miracle foods\" and exercise as a necessary com\u00ad ponent of good health. In 1951 copies of his book, LOOK YOUNGER, LIVE LONGER, were confiscated by FDA agents on the grounds that it advocated blackstrap molasses as a cureall, and Hauser was once arrested for practicing medicine without a license. He made a fortune from his books, health food pro\u00ad ducts, a newspaper column and a magazine, DIET DIGEST, and numbered the greats of Hollywood, including Greta Garbo, as his disciples. STUDY QUESTIONS VITAMIN A THERAPY FOR NIGHT BLINDNESS: Vitamin A and zinc supplementation is a favorite therapy of \"alternative\" health practitioners for vision disorders. Vitamin A and zinc have long been known to be associated with vision because they are principal components in the biochemical processes which underlie the function of the retinal photoreceptors. Fran~ receJ)-_ tors (which-are rare in this-country) are known to produce disturbances in vision. Hinck, et al (JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN OPTOMETRIC AS\u00ad SOCIATION, 55/8, August 1984) report on a study of 18 subjects with subjective night vision complaints who were screen\u00ad ed for ocular pathology, systemic disease, uncorrected refractive error and night myopia. This group exhibited signi\u00ad ficantly increased final rod threshholds (that is, they required more light when completely dark-adapted) than their age and sex matched controls with similar serum vitamin A and zinc levels. Thus, the reduced night vision was not related to abnormal levels of these nutrients. Of three subjects completing a single blind, placebo-controlled vitamin A supplemen\u00ad tation (40,000 IU daily) experiment, two had significantly improved final rod threshholds while one declined. Subjec\u00ad tively, two reported worsened night vision and one reported no change. The authors note that, while some patients with night vision complaints may have a real pro\u00ad blem, the use of expensive serum vitamin A and zinc tests are of questionable value. They also question the universal use of supplementation for these patients due to the known risks of toxicity.

BILATERAL NASAL SPECIFIC According to an article in the WILLAMETTE WEEK (Portland, OR), local chiroprac\u00ad tor, J. Richard Stober, has pioneered a \"medical procedure\" which he claims, among other things, will help the blind to see, the deaf to hear and the lame to walk. He calls his procedure \"Bilateral Nasal Specific\" (BNS). Stober believes he can cure people's ills by pushing finger cots (the little balloon\u00ad like devices that doctors put over their fingers when making rectal examinations) as far as possible up people's noses and inflating them. The procedure is repeated in each of the nasal cavities. This, says Stober, will realign the bones of the skull. He explained it this way to the WILLAMETTE WEEK reporter. \"The brain is the control center of the body. It controls every function, every cell, for every second you live. If the box it sits in is wacked out...you're messing with the primary chip in your computer.\" Stober says that the brain cells are like fish in an aquarium and if they aren't properly nourished they get sick. Inflating a finger cot in the nose is supposed to help the circulation and, thereby, provide better nutrition. \"The head is like the motor of a car,\" says Stober, and he is the carburetor adjuster. Among Stober's claims for BNS are that it can cure mental retardation in children, make dwarfs grow taller, and straighten out the heads of babies after birth. Stober has a national following of about 200 practitioners, but many chiroprac\u00ad tors and MDs in the area believe him to be \"far out.\" Ben Wilson, MD, a general surgery resident at the Oregon Health Sciences University, has worked with men\u00adtally retarded children and is familiar with Stober's procedure. Wilson calls BNS \"complete nonsense.\" \"Stober claims he has been doing BNS for 30 years,\" says Wilson, \"and he still has not been able to demonstrate objective improvement in his patients. Besides, it makes no anatomical sense.\" Wilson criticizes Stober for giving the parents of handicapped children false hope that will only lead to disappointment in the long run. He believes Stober merely takes credit for any improvements in the children's conditions attributing it to BNS without evidence that such changes are unrelated to the treatment. Only one study has been carried out to determine the value of BNS. (No details are given about the study's design). According to Herbert Vear, President of the Western States Chiropractic College in Portland, where the study was conducted, the results were jnconc:lusiy~. _ BNS treatment is not without risk. Widespread attention was focused on BNS in 1983 following the death of a Calgary, Alberta, baby who died of asphyxiation after the finger cot slipped off of the syringe, traveled through the nasal passages and lodged in her windpipe. Although the parents did not file suit, the practi\u00ad tioner involved was found guilty of manslaughter, fined $1000 and forbidden from the further practice of BNS.

Such do exist, and on January 21, 1985, representatives of the major nutrition societies met in Miami, Florida, to discuss common goals and in\u00ad terests. Participating were the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutri\u00ad tion, President, Ezra Steiger, MD; the American Society for Clinical Nutrition, President, Allan Forbes, MD; the American College of Nutrition, President, Robert D. Lindeman, MD; the American Institute of Nutrition; and, the American Academy of Certified Medical Nutri\u00ad tionists, President, George Demetrakopoulos, MO. FDA WARNS AGAINST USE OF WEIGHT-LOSS SUITS AND WRAPS: Four \"weight-loss\" devices have been listed as health frauds by the FDA. Some of these devices may be dangerous, the FDA says. Three of the listed devices, the Shrink Wrap System, the Cell-U-Loss Body Toner and the Space Suit Slenderiz\u00ad ing System, are marketed nationwide through the mail by Maximum Exposure Marketing Inc. of Stamford, Conn.; Body Shoppe Inc. of Ronkokoma, NY; and New Body Boutique Inc. of Bohemia, NY; and the fourth, the Touch-and-Stay Trimmer, by J.M. Devrey Inc. of Freeport, NY. The devices were listed as fraudulent after the promoters failed to comply with FDA re\u00ad quests for changes in claims and adver\u00ad tising that were considered misleading and exaggerated. The devices induce sweating, thus creating the illusion of weight loss. However, since the loss is water and not body fat, it is soon restored. There are no FDA-approved body wraps or sauna suits. LYSINE VS CANCER: Thomas Jukes, PhD, Emeritus Professor in Residence of Biophysics and Nutri\u00ad tional Sciences, University of Californi::i Berkeley, warns consumers to be wary of articles claiming that diets high in lysine can ward off cancer. Lysine, a common amino acid, has never been proven to have anticancer effects. Yet, articles and testimonials have appeared over the last two years encouraging magazine readers to reduce their risk of cancer by adding lysine to their diets--specifically by eating a high-lysine strain of corn. Such claims are based upon assertions and ex\u00ad periments that have not been reviewed for scientific validity. Jukes urges suspi\u00ad cion of advertisements soliciting con\u00ad tributions to underwrite do-it-yourself experiments on lysine and cancer. Jukes 1985 NCAHF PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE (Presented by NCAHF President William Jarvis at the 1985 Annual Meeting held February 14, 1985). \"1984 was the year the nation became aroused about health fraud. This was primarily a result of the hearings held by Congressman Claude Pepper. These hearings were the culmination of a four-year study which found that health fraud is the major consumer fraud problem of the nation's senior citizens. At last, a significant constituency has been found to spur antiquackery legislation! Pepper's hearings caused the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommit\u00ad tee on Consumer Affairs to hold hearings of its own in Chairman Robert Packwood's home state of Oregon (NCAHF was able to supply several witnesses for those hearings). Also, FDA has established a special antifraud unit, and FDA and the National Better Business Bureau are involved in a joint effort to solicit the cooperation of the advertising industry in curtailing the promotion of ques\u00ad tionable health products and services. There has been a noticeable increase in the number of writers contacting NCAHF for assistance in developing anti\u00ad quackery articles and feature broadcasts. Mr. Pepper introduced legislation in the last Congress that, if passed, could pro\u00ad vide the means for putting a significant crimp in the activities of quacks. A most important aspect of Pepper's proposed legislation is its functional definition of quackery which eliminates \"fraud\" as an essential characteristic of a quack. Merely promoting questionable (ie, those known to be false OR unproven) health products or services for a profit would constitute quackery. This type of defini\u00ad tion is essential if the health hucksters and their misguided converts among the lay public are ever to be stopped from exploiting the desperate and unwary in society. These bills died a natural death at the end of the last congressional session, but will probably be reintroduced this year. Despite these positive developments, the war against health fraud, quackery and misinformation is far from won. Those who profit from the spurious health business are reacting fiercely. Articles are appearing in the publications of the health foods industry, practitioners of nonscientific health care, and antiscience consumer groups attacking Pepper's bills. The bellwether of the organized at\u00ad tack on Pepper's proposed consumer protection reforms is the National Health Federation. NHF takes its lead from its Washington, DC, based Legislative Ad\u00ad vocate Clinton Miller. These promoters of questionable health products and services are keenly aware of the importance of disarming Pepper's proposed legislation. They will stop at nothing to misrepresent these bills and make antiquackery appear to be against God, the Constitution and motherhood. Their main tool is to bury legislators in mail. This \"mail force\" has worked for them in the past and could succeed again unless we antiquackery people make ourselves heard. Considering the number of people profitting from selling herbs, food supplements, weight-loss formulas, health foods, so-called \"alternative\" therapies, and so forth, the quantity of mail they can generate is large. Further, experience has taught that many of these same people belong to extremist political groups with additional political con\u00ad nections. We, the antiquackery activists, face an enormous challenge in the coming year. Our numbers are smal.1 compared to the opposition. Our financial resources are minescule next to the'multibillion dollar quackery industry. Despite the fact there are many in the health, legal and academic communities who are still apathetic about quackery and legislators will have to be prodded to act, be reassured that our cause is just and polls have consistently shown that the public supports the sound principles of science and consumer protectionism which underlie NCAHF. We have already discovered that we can make a big difference. We on\u00ad ly need to persist in our cause and make ourselves heard by society and I believe that we will prevail.\" also criticises the ads urging readers to finance new lysine research through mail\u00ad order purchases of bags of high-lysine cornmeal. He notes that most Americans get plenty of lysine from milk, meat and soy products. Corn, like most grains, is relatively poor in lysine and only about half of its lysine can be absorbed by the body. Even high-lysine corn is not an outstanding source of lysine. The primary benefit of high-lysine corn would be to cereal-consuming countries where dietary sources of the amino acid are restricted. Professor Jukes can be reached at (415)642-7160. AMA CALLS UPON CHELATION THERAPY PROPONENTS TO CONDUCT PROPER STUDIES: The American Medical Association's House of Delegates voted to call upon the proponents of chelation therapy, who are using the method to treat a wide variety of disorders including arthritis, cancer and heart disease, to conduct pro\u00ad perly controlled scientific studies to prove efficacy. A report presented to the group had determined that there were no scientific papers to substantiate the use of chelation therapy for the disorders for which it is currently being applied. [AMERICAN MEDICAL NEWS, December 14, 1984]. LAETRILE KILLS ANOTHER CHILD: The case of Karen Ziegler, 13, of San Diego, came to a sad but predictable end in January. Karen was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in August, 1983. Despite the favorable prognosis of Hodgkin's disease when treated by radia\u00ad tion and chemotherapy, Karen's parents opted to treat her with an herbal tonic and laetrile. Apparently deceived by pro\u00ad paganda dispensed by the purveyors of cancer quackery, the Zieglers fought what they considered to be a heroic fight to save Karen from conventional therapy. Investigation continues into this case. CYTOTOXIC TESTING FOR FOOD ALLEGIES: The California Dietetic Association has released a two-page fact sheet on cytotoxic testing for food allergies. The two-sided, one-page fact sheet describes the procedure, its rationale, a critique, how valid food allergy testing is done, in\u00ad formation on insurance company reim\u00ad bursement, and why consumers should not use cytotoxic testing. The sheet is useful as a consumer education handout. Copies may be obtained from the Califor\u00ad nia Dietetic Association, 7740 Man\u00ad chester Blvd, Suite 102, Playa Del Rey, CA 90291. In California, the state Board of Medical Quality Assurance is suing BioHealth Centers, a cytotoxic testing clinic, for practicing medicine without a license (LOS ANGELES TIMES, Dec 19, 1984). COURT UPHOLDS NATUROPATH'S. MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTION: An Idaho appellate court has ruled that the involuntary manslaughter conviction of Naturopath Cyrus Maxfield should be upheld. The death of an 86-year-old pa\u00ad tient was caused by excessive colonic ir\u00ad rigations administered by Maxfield. The point of contention was whether the pa\u00ad tient's death should be considered a \"reasonable medical certainty\" or \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" based upon the treatment rendered.

VITAMIN E AND ATHLETIC PER\u00ad FORMANCE: Vitamin E has long been touted as an aid to athletic performance. A good review of vitamin E and its possible value to per\u00adformance concludes that with the excep\u00ad tion of one high altitude experiment, double-blind trials have shown no gains in performance.

Poplar St., OUR OWN NOBEL PRIZE? ------- A_ proposal by Dr. Tom Jukes to develop an awards program honoring persons in the forefront of the fight against quackery was adopted by the NCAHP board at its February meeting and a committee was formed to develop the proposal. Vala Stults will serve as chairperson. Jim Lowell and Wayne Bidlack are members. NCAHF RETAI~S COMMERCIAL MAILER NCAHF cannot remain a cottage industry much longer. 'While our influence far outdistances our numbers, membership is growing rapidly, and -we must husband our energies to better utilize this membership and serve the public. One way to do so is to reduce time spent in. purely housekeeping efforts. Maintenance of the membership and mailing lists including renewals will no longer take place in the main office, but will be handled by a commercial firm. Members should be prompt\u00b7 with renewals since the commercial service will be less forgiving than -we have been and 90 days will be the limit of grace, after which delinquent members will be dropped from the mailing list. The new arrangement should give the staff more time for other undertakings, such as helping local groups organize. We may even find it possible to put the newsletter on a monthly basis; a move :we have been considering for some time. We urge you to keep us, as -well as the postal service, informed on address changes so that you will suffer no delay in receiving your newsletter and other NCAHP coDDDUnications. We also urge you to check the expiration date on your mailing label and to renew -well in advance \u00b7 ~ SYMPOSIUM APRIL 12 . NCAHP, the Greater Los Angeles Nutrition Council and the Los Angeles Medical Association are jointly sponsoring another symposium on nutrition quackery. The Symposium is approximately the same as the previous two offered at U.C. Davis in October and at Cal State Northridge in January. The program will be held at the LACMA Building 1925 Wilshire Blvd in Los Angeles and will begi~ at 8:30 AM with registration starting at 8 o'clock. Fees: Members $50, Nonmembers $55, Students $25; after March 28 add $5 to each of these fees. CE credits applied for from ADA, AMA and CME. ~ NO I QUACKERY? SI I Clinton Ray Miller, listed by the National Health Federation as their \"Health Freedom Legislative Advocate,\" makes an interesting distinction bet-ween fraud and quackery in the January issue of HF.AI.TH FREEOOM NEWS. Fraud, he says, is bad for you, and should be prosecuted But quackery \"is not a precise legal term,\" but a \"rude, pejorative term traditionally used by arrogant medical doctors to smear and intimidate\" non-orthodox professionals. Miller notes that Rep. Claude Pepper partially defines a quack as someone who \"promotes medical schemes or remedies known to be false, or which are unproven, for a profit.\" Miller objects to the words \"promote\" and \"unproven\" in this definition, implying they would be interpreted by \"the AMA, FDA, FTC and USPA standards.\" Presumably, he means scientific s~andards of safety and effectiv~ness. MARCH/APRIL 1985 FLUORIDATION: 30-YEAR REVIEW Widespread misinformation helps deprive more than half the population of the United States of the full benefits of fluoridation, according to a review in the January issue of American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The review, by Virginia L. Richmond, Ph.D, notes that the maxi\u00ad mum use of fluoridation has been shown to reduce caries by 60 percent with no ill effects to the recipient. Although the truth about the value of fluoridation has been known for nearly a century, many communities are reluctant to approve the supplementation of fluoride naturally oc\u00ad curring in drinking water because of un\u00ad proven complaints made by opponents of the measure.

PATIENT MUST BE INFORMED OF UNORTHODOX DMSO USE Under a law signed last June, California doctors wishing to use DMSO for ailments for which it has not been ap\u00ad proved must notify patients of this fact in writing. Currently, DMSO is approved only for the symptomatic treatment of in\u00ad terstitial cystitis, and scientific studies have failed to prove the substance safe or effective for other uses.

NEWSLETTER QUALITY IN THE HEAL TH MARKETPLACE NCAHF NEWSLETTER WETTER WATER SELLS DESPITE \"NO PROMISES\" STATEMENTS The American Dental Association has cautioned its members against the use of Bioline Catalyst Water, which some dentists are touting to patients as a con\u00ad trol for bleeding in operative procedures and an inhibitor of plaque formation. But a spokesman for the manufacturer, bas\u00ad ed in Bloomington, MN, says the com\u00ad pany cannot specify the substance as good \"for any particular ailment.\" Several years ago, some of the proponents of Bioline had been involved with the distribution of Willard Water, which was promoted to \"cure everything,\" according to an FDA investigator. But Willard Water in 1982 signed an agreement with the FDA to stop making health claims. Bio\u00ad Line, which is more than 99 percent water, is an \"improvement\" over Willard Water, says Mark Olson, head of research and development for the company. Bioline water is a \"catalyst\" and when added to ordinary water will make it more penetrating, he said. But distributors are told that they \"cannot make therapeutic claims\" for the substance, he added. \"We can sell our Bio-Line water as safe for consumption, but we cannot specify it as good for any particular ailment.\" (Am. Dent. A. News, Jan, 7, 1985) COLOR ME YELLOW WITH CARROTS, BUT AVOID SHARK LIVER If your guru prescribes megavitamins for you including an overabundance of Vitamin A, you may safely seek to obtain this panacea by gorging on carrots. But go easy on the I iver. Eat a lot of carrots and it may not help you see better at night, but your skin may turn yellow. The coloring agent is carotene, a precursor of Vitamin A. Although excessive Vitamin A is potentially dangerous, hypercaro\u00ad tenaemia (skin discoloration caused by carotene) is harmless and will disappear within a few weeks after going off the car\u00ad rot diet, says the British Medical Journal (290:95, Jan. 12, '85). Carotene is harmless because the body converts It to Vitamin VOL.8, NO.2 A only as needed and stores the rest (thus creating the yellow skin tinge). On the other hand, people who overdine on liver may develop elevated cranial pressure and other symptoms of Vitamin A intoxication, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (252, 24:3365, Dec. 28, '84). A housewife who ate shark liver (a source of concen\u00ad trated Vitamin A) developed acute poison\u00ad ing. Five patients who regularly consumed between 15 and 85 times the recommended dietary allowance of Vitamin A developed Pseudotumor Cerebri (elevated cranial pressure). Even as little as 10 times the recommended daily allowance has been shown to have undesirable effects. DOCTOR WHO LOST CALIFORNIA LICENSE OPENS RENO CANCER CLINIC Dr. John Richardson, MD, who in 1976 lost his license to practice medicine in California for violating the state's anti\u00ad quackery law by dispensing laetrile to thousands of cancer patients (American Medical News, 8-29 '77), has opened a cancer clinic in Reno, Nev., with Dr. Doug Brodie, MD, dispensing amygdolln (laetrile) injections and homeopathic medicine. Dr. Richardson tells patients not to worry if their tumors grow larger. According to an article in the Winter, 1984-'85 CANCER NEWS JOURNAL (19:3), Dr. Richardson states: \"Homeopathic physicians believe the tumor indicates the stimulation of the im\u00ad mune system.\" As long as the tumor is non-obstructive, the patient can live with it, and even if it is malignant, it will have a benign course through non\u00ad catastrophic modalities, he said. In 1977 Dr. Richardson was sued for $2.5 million by the widow of a lung cancer patient who died after being treated with laetrile. He was also convicted of conspiring to smuggle laetrile from Mexico for nation\u00ad wide distribution in the United States.

' 1 MOST \"CLINICAL ECOLOGY\" AILMENT CLAIMS PSYCHOSOMATIC? Dr. Abba Terr of Stanford University says a study of patients presumably suffering from allergies caused by toxic chemicals turned up no evidence validating the theory of \"clinical ecology.\" Dr. Terr, pro\u00ad fessor of medicine, interviewed and ex\u00ad amined 50 patients who had been told they were suffering from environmental\u00ad ly caused diseases; and studied their records. He said eight .had no symptoms, II had symptoms of easily-identifiable ailments and 31 had symptoms that were psychosomatic. In addition, after two years of treatment by clinical ecology proponents, only two of the 50 patients showed improvement, he said.

One way to identify a qualified nutritionist is to look for a person with the title \"Registered Dietitian\" (RD), which re\u00ad quires completion of studies at an ac\u00ad credited college as well as approved work experience and an examination given by the Commission on Dietetic Registration.

FINAL WORD: VITAMIN C NO CANCER CURE A report of a recently-completed Mayo Clinic study confirms the results of an earlier study- there is no evidence that cancer patients benefit from massive doses of Vitamin C. As reported in the Tufts University Diet ~ Nutritional Letter (3, 1; March 1985); when patients with ad\u00ad vanced colon or rectal cancers were given 10,000 milligrams of Vitamin C daily LACK OF LICENSING STANDARDS COSTS PUBLIC BILLIONS, ADA SAYS The annual cost to Americans for wor\u00ad thless nutritional advice is billions of dollars, according to the American Dietetic Association Reports (85-1: 94, 1-'85). In a policy statement, the ADA points out that most states do not set standards for nutritional advisors. As a result, the statement says, self\u00ad proclaimed nutritionists are free to dupe consumers with gimmicks and quackery. Consumers can help themselves by seek\u00ad ing guidance from legitimate profes\u00ad sionals with degrees in nutrition, dietetics or related disciplines from colleges or universities approved by regional bodies recognized by the Council on Post\u00ad secondary Accreditation. Unfortunately, in most states nothing prevents un\u00ad qualified persons from calling themselves \"nutritionists,\" \"dietitians\" or \"diet counselors\" and from promising guaranteed results from the use of vitamins, nutritional supplements and other unproven dietary regimens, the statement says. True nutritionists do not claim that specific foods have specific 2 HOMEOPATHY MAKING A COMEBACK Homeopathy, a 150-year-old \"hair of the dog\" pseudomedlcine that all but disap\u00ad peared in the 1920s, .is making a com\u00ad eback, according to the FDA Consumer. Drug companies producing homeopathic remedies report a tenfold increase in sales over a four-year period. Homeopathy claims that illnesses can be cured by extremely watered-down amounts of the substances that cause the illnesses- as little as one part per million. But like the practitioners of other off-beat medical disciplines, some homeopaths have strayed from this simplistic philosophy and have added a variety of unproven, but highly-saleable products, such as \"homeopathic in\u00ad terferon\" and over-the-counter cancer cures. The FDA has warned two pro~ ducers of homeopathic remedies, Biological Homeopathic Industries (BHI) of Albuquerque, N.M., and Botanical Laboratories of Bellingham, Wash., that their products were not in compliance with. the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act and are subject to seizure unless correc\u00adtions are made. CYTOTOXIC TESTING ADVERTISED AS A MONEY MAKER For $30,000 (and unspecified amounts for \"additional start-up costs\") you can get rich telling people what's wrong with them. And you don't have to be a medical doctor or even a sales person in a health food store. That's the thrust of ads that less than two years ago kicked off the sale of franchises setting up clinics for performing cytotoxic testing, one of the latest of the unproven health care methods. Proponents of cytotoxic testing claim they can determine allergies to around 200 foods and additives by sub\u00ad jecting samples of the patients' blood to the substances. The FDA, the National In\u00ad stitutes of Health and the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology say there is no evidence that the technique works. The cytotoxic adherents claim they can cure both emotional and medical problems by telling you what foods to avoid. Promoters also claim the procedure amounts to \"nutritional analysis\" rather than medical treatment, and thus is not subject to state and federal laws governing the practice of medicine. But the FDA disagrees. The food extracts used in the tests are licens\u00ad ed by the FDA and can be prescribed only by physicians. In addition, the blood testing procedures also come under FDA regulations. The clinics may require state or local licensing. Until there is valid scientific evidence that cytotoxic testing works, -say representatives of the American Academy of Allergy and Im\u00ad munology and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the pro\u00ad cedure must be considered experimental with no clinical uses. HYPOGLYCEMIA: A SYMPTOM - NOT A DISEASE Hypoglycemia, a deficiency of sugar in the blood stream, has become a status disease among cultists; blamed for social as well as physical malfunctions. But hypoglycemia is not a disease, says Dr. Lynn J. Bennion, M.D., author of HYPOGLYCEMIA: FACT OR FAD? (Crown Publishers, N.Y.) It is only a symp\u00ad tom, and may result from many different conditions. Hypoglycemia causes shakiness, nervousness, sweating, and hard, rapid heartbeat, and in extreme cases confusion, incoordination, coma and other brain malfunction. But many other conditions have Identical effects, he said. He added that the widely-promoted oral glucose tolerance test (OGTl) is misleading and irrational, and has led to the misdiagnosis of hypoglycemia in \"thousands of people.\" Because treat\u00ad ment depends on the underlying cause, there Is no one way to treat the ailment, he said. The so-called \"hypoglycemia diet,\" high in protein and low in car\u00ad bohydrate, taken in frequent, small feedings, is appropriate in some cases, but not in others. HYPERBARIC OXYGEN NO BENEFIT TO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS VICTIMS A recently-completed British study of the effects of hyperbarlc (pressurized) oxygen Involving 120 multiple sclerosis sufferers showed no benefits to the patients, the British medical journal LANCET (Feb. 9, p. 297) reported. This differs from a study reported two years ago in the New England Journal of Medicine that in\u00ad dicated some patients seemed to be helped. Following the earlier report, hyperbaric oxygen clinics opened across the country, charging about $100 a treat\u00ad ment. (Story in Riverside, CA, Press Enter\u00ad prise, 2-17\"85). HEALTH FRAUD THRIVES ON QUACK ADS, SAYS FDA A clipping service hired by the Food and Drug Administration came up with 435 questionable ads in a month, an article in the FDA CONSUMER (March '85) states. While no clipping service can be more than fractionally successful in ex\u00ad amining the more than 10,000 daily and weekly newspapers and other publica\u00ad tions in the country, the clippings present \"a good idea of what's being peddled to the gullible, the desparate, the people looking for something too-good-to-be\u00ad true, the article said. More than half the ads were for weight-loss products, with diet pills accounting for 218 ads. Of these, 102 touted grapefruit pills, even while the U.S. Postal Service was taking action against the promoters, Citrus In\u00ad dustries, based on evidence presented by the FDA. There were also 89 hair restorer ads; 42 for products and 47 for clinics. The state producing most of the ads was California, with 84. Texas was next with 45, and then New York, with 44. GRAPEFRUIT DIET PLANS LACK LABEL INFORMATION Eat all you want.and still lose weight by taking grapefruit pills? The only loss you may obtain may be 'in your pocketbook, an FDA Talk Paper (3-11-'85) indicates. No grapefruit pills have been approved by the FDA for any medical purpose, and the FDA is unaware that any such pill is safe a!'ld effective, the report said. Product labels for the pills may not reflect the weight loss promised in print and broad\u00adcast ads, and thus may avoid the respon\u00ad sibility of living up to such promises. And while the ads may Indicate the pills will permit users to burn off fat while eating as much food as they wish, some of the pills are accompanied by leaflets stress\u00ad ing the need for reduced food intake and increased exercise. One supplier, Citrus Industry, has been barred from using the malls to sell its Grapefruit Super Pill. However, some promoters use '800' numbers and private mall delivery ser\u00ad vices to circumvent postal controls. 3 DIET-CANCER LINK LIKELY, BUT EVIDENCE HIGHLY SPECULATIVE There is evidence for a cancer-diet rela\u00ad tionship, but \"tremendous disagreement\" among experts over the details of the relationship, the American Council on Science and Health reports in its booklet, DIET AND CANCER. For example, says Dr. Michael W. Pariza, author of the booklet, while National Cancer Institute experts advise that eating more fiber will reduce the chance of getting colon or rec\u00ad tal cancer, a National Research Council committee formed to study diet and cancer said there was no conclusive evidence that fiber is cancer-protective and still other scientists contend only cer\u00ad tain types of fiber will work. Dr. Pariza, professor and chairman of the Department of Food Microbiology and Toxicology at the University of Wiscon\u00ad sin Food Research Institute, says it may be \"fine\" to eat high fiber breakfast cereals, \"but you should realize that it hasn't been PROVEN to help prevent cancer.\" And while there is evidence \"from a variety of sources\" of a diet\u00ad cancer link, there is major disagreement over whether we know enough to recom\u00ad mend dietary changes. Dr. Elizabeth M. Whelan, ACSH executive director, said tentative figures from two British scien tists indicate that diet modification could some day prevent 35 percent of all cancer cases. \"But that some day is not now,\" she said. The 35 percent figure is \"highly speculative\" and refers to dietary factors \"not yet reliably identified,'' she said. \"At ACSH we believe that specific recom\u00ad mendations should be given to the public only when there is sufficient basis to ex\u00ad pect that they will in fact accomplish what is promised. In the case of diet and cancer, I don't think we have that basis \u00b7 yet.\" A complimentary copy of the report can be obtained by sending a stamped, self-addressed (39 cents postage) to Diet and Cancer Report, ACSH, 47 Maple Street, Summit, NJ 07901.

PORPHYRIAS TRACED TO BREWER'S YEAST INTAKE British physicians report that a man tak\u00ad ing more than 30 tablets a day of a com\u00ad mercial brewer's yeast preparation had developed stomach pains and other signs of porphyrias, an ailment normally caus\u00ad ed by hereditary factors. As reported in the !,.awrence Review of Natural Products (10:40, October '84), tests indicated the man had no major abnormalities, but revealed the presence in his body of elevated levels of porphyrias, pigment compounds normally excreted from the body in small amounts. Genetic abnor\u00ad malities have been ruled out in this pa\u00ad tient, and the brewer's yeast is considered the probable cause.

Box 1602 Allentown, PA 1&105 GHR: FALSE HOPE FOR ATHLETES Growth hormone releasers (GHRs) are be\u00ad ing falsely touted as aids for diet and health, and performance enhancers for athletes, the ACSH News and Views (Mar\u00ad Apr. '85, p.12) reports. An article by Kathleen A. Meister, an ACSH research associate, states that GHRs may be widely used by athletes, who believe that, unlike anabolic steroids, the enhancers cannot be traced in the body. There is no agreed-on formula for GHRs. Commercial formulations may consist of the amino acids argenine or ornithine alone, com\u00ad bined, or in combination with other amino acids. And while it is true that amino acids induce the body to release greater amounts of growth hormones, there is no evidence that this will have the desired beneficial effect. In fact, the opposite may be true. Excess growth hormones do not enhance healing, nor do they slow ag\u00ad ing. They do not increase athletic ability or help eliminate fat from the body. In\u00ad stead, they may lead to acromegaly, characterized by disfiguring enlargements of the bones of the face, hands and feet. There is little danger of this occurring from present GHR com\u00ad mercial compounds. The amount of amino acids they contain is too small to have a significant effect on the body, and they are taken orally, which minimizes any effect they might have. Doctors suspecting growth hormone abnor\u00ad malities may inject argenine into the blood streamioiitld out if the-response is normal. The amount required for this test is substantially higher than the amount contained in GHR tablets. Yet promoters promise that the tablets are an aid to healing and the retention of youth, that they aid weight loss by dissolving fat and that they\u00b7 increase sports perfor\u00ad mance. The use of GHRs is touted by un\u00ad proven and disproven claims in the book LIFE EXTENSION by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw. Non-Proiit Organization U.S. POSTAGE PAID Loma Linda.

AS YOU WALK THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES Stan Ulrich advises us that California chiropractors who use the title \"Dr.\" in their advertising must also, by law, add the words \"chiropractor\" or \"D.C.\" immediately following their names and not to do so is a misdemeanor, according to Section 1000-15 of the California Business and Professional Code. Ulrich, a Menlo Park attorney and an NCAHF board member, said he found 41 violations by checking newspaper advertisements and the Palo Alto yellow pages and sent copies to the Board of Chiropractic Examiners. Since then, he said, at least two chiropractors have changed their ads, indicating the board has advised violators to conform to the law. The council urges its members to check thair own yellow pages and report violations. People who wish to be treated by chiropractors and other non\u00ad medical doctors are free to do so, but they should at least be told the nature of the treatment they will receive. The address of the Board of Chiropractic Examiners is 921 11th St., Suite 601, Sacramento, CA 95814-2867. ADVERTISEMENT ALERT And while we're at it, Martha M. Villegas, a state Department of Health Services representative, has asked us to keep our eyes peeled for advertisements placed by a \"major diet pill promoter\" under investigation for unproven claims for his products. A preliminary injunction issued Feb. 26 in Ventura County Superior Court orders the defendants, Health Energetic Co., Inc.; Vita Health Research; Nutritional Research; American Diet Association; and Leo DeBou to stop advertising weight loss or diet products unless they can substantiate them \"by competent scientific or medical tests and studies.\" Diet products marketed under the above labels include Willpower Diet Tablet, Mannan-Tri.m, Orgi.,-Ni.ne, Fast-Tri.m and Sli.m Caps. Villegas asks: \"Should you notice any ads which appear to violate the injunction, would you please notify me?\" Sei:id clippings to: Ma:r;tha M.

EDITORIAL A disturbing picture of what the practice of medicine could turn into if nurses attain the primary care status that so many RNs des:l,.re can be obtained from a December/ January {80: 10) \"Special Issue\" of CALIFORNIA NURSE, the publication of the California Nurses Association. If this issue is representative of the thinking of the nursing profession, expect a mingling of channeled light, zen moxibustion, acupressure, visualization, h~opathy, thereuputic touch and others of the scientifically unproven disciplines so often found under the holistic umbrella. The first page lead article in this publication, headlined, \"INTEGRATING HOLISTIC CARE\", suggests that holistic practices \"can be easily integrated into a hospital routine.\" And while noting _ that \"opponents and skeptics\" take issue with the varied concepts thrown together under holism, \"still others are fascinated and excited by the healing potential they believe i~_CO!l,nl!Cted to a holistic approach to health care.\" This may sound like an attempt at even-handedness. But the article states that holistic medicine is opposed ''because holistic approaches are relatively new to the American health care industry,\" thus creating the implication that \"once those stick-in-the-mud MDs find out how right we holistic healers are, they will be happy to accept all of our fine nostrums.\" There are two other.stories on that first page. One is a -recommendation that nurses support holistic health care, and the other, by Marjorie McCloy, editor of California Nurse, endorses a San Francisco woman {no credentials for her noted by ~the -ci.utliorT-wno -praeti.cev--\"therepeutic tmteh\". - McCloy admits to \"a general interest in Eastern philosophy and in quantum mechanics,\" which she says are \"two related fields. 11 F.qually important with the contents of this magazine is what is omitted. There is no rebuttal. Not one article represents the point of view of modern medicine derived . from scientific investigation, although that is the field so many in the nursing profession aspire to become primary care providers in. Undoubtedly, there are many nurses- possibly even a majority of nurses\u00ad who do not agree with this wide-eyed acceptance of every newfangled discipline that claims to be scientific. _It is not that some value may not some day be demonstrated under controlled conditions, but acceptance of that possibility is a far cry from the uncritical. and even enthusiastic endorsements rendered these claims in this magazine with no mention of the need to submit them to the rigors required for scientific proof. If nurses desire a greater amount of autonomy in the practice of their profession, they should begin by cleaning up their own house. There will always be individuals operating on the fringe of every profession, and not even H.D.s are immune. However, when such individuals presume to speak for their profession in strange and unusual ways, it is not freedom of speech. It is license, and it is up to their peers to set them straight. For after all, in a publication like California Nurse the writers are not speaking for themselves. They are speaking for a profession, and what they proclaim may differ by 180 degrees from the views of their constituents. The council has received word from Washington that Rep. Claude Pepper (Fla.) may not reintroduce his three public health bills this year because of pressure from \"health food\" organizations. These bills, introduced last July, would (1) establish a National Library of Medicine to provide up-to\u00ad date health information to the public; (2) increase penalties for selling or attempting to sell drugs, devices or medical treatment while knowing they are \"unsafe, ineffective or unproven for safety and efficacy;\" and (3) establish a Strike Force on Health Quackery to coordinate the efforts of Federal agencies to curb the sale of \"fraudulent hea~th remedies.\" They are opposed by such organizations as the National Health Federation (NHF) and the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA). It is important that we let Mr. Pepper know we support these bills and urge him to push for their enactment in this session of Congress. Also let your representatives and senators know you want them to give the measures full support if and when they come up in Congress. The bills, a culmination of six years of investigation into frauds against \u00b7 the elderly, would also benefit the rest of the population. The bills died with the 98th Congress, but Pepper was expected to reintroduce them. Now, we are told, this may not occur. The NNFA, which opposes mandatory lice~ing for nutritional counselors, is urging its members to send letters opposing the legislation. The NHF is also urging letters of opposition. Our expressions of support for these bills are badly needed. TWO NEW STICKLEY ~ We have received flyers on two new books from the George F.

But you need a little know-how. On April 14, Council President Dr. William Jarvis and Ex\u00ad ecutive Director Leonard Metz visited a California Institute of Technology playground, where a dozen or so pragmatists walked barefoot across coals measured at 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit with no reported damage. The unique walkathon was sponsored by the recently organized Southern California Skeptics (Box 7000-39, Redondo Beach, CA 90277), an affiliate of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, which publishes the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. The Southern California Skeptics offers a newsletter and subscription to the Skeptical Inquirer for $25, or the newsletter alone for $15. The significance of the exhibition is that the participants in the Cal-Tech demonstration did not have to pay for the right to risk their soles.

In the May 1985 issue of its magazine, CON\u00ad SUMER REPORTS, the organization tells how it ran its own \"health-food store\" for five months, requesting catalogs and buying products from more than 70 companies. A panel of CU experts unanimously agreed that products offered for sale by 42 com\u00ad panies were in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in two ways: They were unapproved new drugs, and they were misbranded. The publication names the 42 companies, gives a rundown on five products \"judged the worst of the en\u00ad tire bunch\" and devotes a section to the \"booming nutrition-supplement business.\" Consumers Union charges that the sale of illegal products continues largely unchallenged because the FDA \"no longer vigorously enforces the law\" and has \"thrown in the towel.\" The agency's budget is more than $350 million. But only $1.8 million- less than one half cent out of each dollar- is spent to combat quackery and to educate the public about quackery. CU urges support for three bills introduced in Congress by Rep. Claude Pep\u00ad per (Fla.) last year that would increase penalties for quackery, establish a clearing house for consumer health education and information and establish a multi-agency \"Strike Force on Health Quackery\" with two representatives each from the FDA, Justice Department, Postal Service and Federal Trade Commission. The bills died last year,. but Rep. Pepper was expected to reintroduce them. Now it appears he may not do so. Write him, commending him for his past efforts on behalf of public health and the elderly, and urge him to continue those efforts by re-introducing his bills. Address letters to: The Honorable Claude Pepper U.S. House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20515 2 gullible that the newly-found ability to walk across hot coals is a manifestation of innate magical powers that can be ful\u00ad ly developed with \"only a few more lessons.\" Simply put, firewalking without damage is possible because ashes have a low rate of heat transfer. As represen\u00ad tatives of the Southern California Skep\u00ad tics put it, you can safely reach into.a hot oven if you do not touch the pan inside. Even though the air inside is just as \"hot\" as the pan, the rate of heat transfer from the air is much lower than that of the pan. With fire walking, if you stride across with firm steps your feet will normally be in contact with the coals for too short a time to cause damage. And a swath of well\u00ad watered grass at the end of the stroll quickly brings foot temperatures down to normal, and eliminates the possibility of burning from a cinder caught between the toes. But fire walking should not be attempted by people who have no knowl\u00ad edge of the technique. It is not altogether safe. Some people have acquired blisters, and a woman radio reporter who at\u00ad tended a session put on by a San Fran\u00ad cisco mystic received painfully-burned feet during her walk. MAY/JUNE 1985 HOLISTIC DENTISTRY NOT RECOGNIZED BY CDA Holistic dentistry \"is not a recognized specialty of dentistry,\" a position paper approved by the California Dental Association states. There is no single definition of holism, and some practi\u00ad tioners of so-called holistic dentistry have \"departed from scientifically proven den\u00ad tal modalities, and have adopted a philosophy which goes far beyond con\u00ad ventional dental treatment,\" the state\u00ad ment adds. Dental education traditionally teaches a multi-disciplinary approach, making a contribution to the improved health of pa\u00ad tients through treatment of dental disease. Dentists are trained to recognize the oral manifestations of many diseases and the systemic manifestations of oral disease. In addition, it is recognized that physical and mental disorders may re\u00ad quire dentists to modify dental treatment plans for some patients, the statement says. However, some \"holistic dentists\" stray so far from this concept in their practice that it may \"exceed the scope of the dental license\" under which they practice in California, the statement said. Copies of the position paper can be ob\u00ad tained free to NCAHF members and $1 to non-members. Please include a stamped, self-addressed envelope with your request to NCAHF, P.O. Box 1276, Loma Linda, CA 92354. HEALTH TIPS OFFERED A set of no-nonsense releases on health topics is offered by Emily L.

NEWSLETTER QUALITY IN THE HEAL TH MARKETPLACE NCAHF NEWSLETTER VOL.8, NO.3 I DREAMED I WAS THIN- THEN I AWOKE You won't be able to dream away your fat in California any more. Nutri\u00ad Marketing Co., which manufactures Dream Away and promotes it in television com\u00ad mercials, has signed a consent1degree stating it will stop advertising the product in the Golden State and will pay a $162,500 fine, according to a news item in the Los Angeles Times (April 11). The consent decree culminates a suit brought last September by Ventura County prosecutors. But in signing the decree, the company does not admit to wrongdoing, and a representative said the product will still be offered in states beyond the jurisdiction of California. For dieters who want to try Dream Away, a suggestion: Throw away the pills and keep the leaflet. It recommends a 1,200 calorie diet. Stick with the diet and you'll lose weight without the pills. But don't expect to lose the eight pounds a week touted in the TV commercial. An average loss of just under a pound a week was the result for persons who took the pill AND stuck to the diet, according to a study commissioned by the company. What you are not told in these advertisements is that weight and fat are not the same thing. It is therefore possible to experience a seemingly magical weight loss in the early stages of any psuedo-diet. For example, water constitutes most of the body weight and you can lose a lot of water in the early stages of a diet, especially if your weight-loss pill contains a diuretic. That leads to a temporary weight loss, but no accompanying loss of the fatty tissue you want to diminish. Eventually, however, you must replace the water, and your weight goes right back to where it was before you started taking your miracle pills. Another factor leading to a weight loss mirage is the fact that heavy eaters may have a great deal of bulk going through their bodies at any one time. If they convert to a low-calorie diet, that bulk is not replaced, and there may be an initial loss that encourages the dieter. But credit too often is given to the magic pill, and not to the change in eating habits that is really responsible. Losing eight pounds of fat a week is a physical impossibility for most people, even on a total fast. A pound of fat is 3,500 calories; eight pounds is 28,000, or 4,000 a day. Since most men need between 2,000 and 2,500 calories a day to main\u00ad tain weight and women somewhat less than that, a little arithmetic will demonstrate the folly of expecting to lose more calories than you use up. And even if you could permanently lose eight pounds a week, it would not lead to good health. Diet ex\u00adperts agree that you should lose no more than two pounds a week. Lose more than that, and some of the weight loss will be in muscle and other non-fat body tissue that you do not want to lose. IN DEFENSE OF FDA As readers of this newsletter know by our frequent referrals to news releases from the FDA and news articles about its activities, the agency serves an important role as a watchdog against fraudulent or unproven medical claims and as an en\u00ad forcement agency against such claims. But the agency's authority to act is severely hampered by loopholes such as the rulings that permit nostrums to be sold unchallenged if they can be defined through some legal mumbo jumbo as \"foods\" and not\u00b7\"drugs.\" In recent years the FDA has also suffered from a severe cutback in the funding needed to do its job. Therefore, the claims of Consumers Union that the FDA has \"thrown in the towel\" (See article on Consumers Union in this issue) may have some validity. Nevertheless, even if hobbled by weak laws and pennywise funding, the agen\u00ad cy is doing a much-needed job and needs our continued encouragement and support.

Edited by: Leonard Metz, BJ, retired science and medicine writer, the San Bernardino (CA) Sun. 1 DIET HORMONES MAY PRESENT UNKNOWN DANGERS The FDA has advised firms marketing weight-loss products containing CCK and DHEA to stop selling them or face possi\u00ad ble regulatory action (HHS News, P85-14, April 16, 1985). No proof of safety or ef\u00ad fectiveness has been submitted, the FDA says, and the products may present unknown dangers. CCK is a hormone in\u00ad volved in human digestion. Nationwide mail campaigns have claimed CCK can decrease hunger and cause a dramatic weight loss. But the chemical is un\u00ad proven, and is believed to cause contrac\u00ad tion of the gall bladder and an increase in bile secretion, altering normal body functions and presenting unknown hazards, the FDA says. DHEA is another hormone, sometimes derived from human urine, that has been sold nationwide without prescription as an aid to weight control, enhanced sex life and longer life. The FDA says it has been given no evidence to support these claims or to show the chemical is not dangerous when reintroduced into the human body. JUDGE SAYS A NAME IS A NAME IS A NAME A U.S. Circuit Court judge has ruled that a Virginia company can no longer provide hair analysis services directly to the public. But according to the judge, anyone who says he or she is a \"health professional\" can order the services on behalf of clients. In response to a Federal Trade Comission complaint, the judge last Jan. 30 ordered the owners of A & A Laboratory, Inc., of Virginia to stop tell\u00ad ing anyone \"other than health profes\u00ad sionals\" that the company could, through the use of hair analysis, measure the mineral content of the body and recognize deficiencies calling for dietary supplements. And who does the judge consider health professionals? Four weeks after the decision the judge amended it to define them as anyone who, \"with or without state authority, holds himself or herself out as a nutri\u00ad tionist or as one who deals with the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, cure or alleviation of human physical or mental ailments, conditions, diseases, pain or in\u00ad firmity.\" This decision, according to an article in NUTRITION FORUM (March '85, v.2, n.3), appears to have stopped other com\u00ad panies from offering unproven analysis services to people who do not claim credentials. But the use of such services, largely by chiropractors and unlicensed nutritionists, \"will remain a problem without further government action,\" the article stated. The judge in the case \"ap\u00ad parently believes that 'professional' use of hair analysis should be governed by state rather than federal authorities,\" the article concluded. JURY STILL OUT ON ANTIOXIDANTS Will eating antioxidant substances keep you from getting old? Well, probably not, and maybe, says science writer Mit\u00ad chell L Zoler in the March '85 (vol.40, no.3) issue of GERIATRICS. Humans may have a self-regulating system that renders the infusion of antioxidants useless, despite evidence that antioxidants may slow ag\u00ad ing by capturing free radicals and deac\u00ad tivating the free-waving electrons that characterize them .. For nearly 30 years scientists have sought evidence that the loose electrons of free radicals, by seeking to tie up to other substances, cause cellular and in\u00ad tercellular changes that may relate to ag\u00ad ing. This is the \"wear and tear\" theory of aging, Zoler says. Another theory is that free radicals cause body cells to lose their powers of different-ration- for ex\u00ad ample, the ability of liver cells to act like liver cells and kidney cells like kidney cells. In either case, evidence that an enhancement of antioxidants will slow aging has been difficult to obtain. Some book writers and health food faddists tout the ingestion of large quan\u00ad tities of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, vitamin E and carotene as an\u00ad tidotes to aging. But according to studies completed in the last few years, such pro\u00ad ducts may be of little benefit. The studies strongly indicate that the human body keeps its supply of antioxidants in balance. If an antioxidant is ingested, the body will reduce its own production. Cut down intake, and the body speeds up pro\u00ad duction. Thus, amounts in excess of the body maintenance quota may be useless. Nevertheless, although current evidence does not show that extra antioxidant will increase the span of life, \"tantalizing evidence to the contrary does occasional\u00ad ly arise,\" Zoler said. NO EXTRA POWER IN BEE POLLEN If all the claims for bee pollen were true, sports doctors would have to test athletes and horses to make sure they aren't high on bee juice. But the claims that bee pollen increases prowess just aren't true, or in more scientific language, are \"unproven,\" according to an abstract in MEDICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORT AND EXERCISE (vol.17, no.2, April '85). After double-blind tests involving 46 nor\u00ad mal, healthy adults, researchers from Lander College and Guilford College in Greensboro, N.C., could find no signifi\u00adcant differences in six categories of physiological performance between in\u00ad dividuals given capsules containing bee pollen and those receiving visually iden\u00ad tical capsules containing granulated brown sugar. The researchers concluded that claims by proponents that bee pollen enhances physical fitness or energy levels \"remain unsubstantiated by valid scientific research and are apparently ex\u00ad aggerated.\" 3 QUININE KILLS BEFORE IT ABORTS Herbal preparations taken by pregnant women to induce abortion are generally ineffective, but could lead to death of the woman or the birth of a deformed child, the LAWRENCE REVIEW OF NATURAL PRODUCTS (6,2: Feb. '85) reports. Folk\u00ad medicine history lists at least 79 plants that have been used as abortifactants, but only a handful have been demonstrated to have potential value, and even these may involve a serious risk. For example, volatile oils such as pen\u00ad nyroyal, tansy, rue, parsley and juniper may be effective only at levels toxic to the woman. For example, of 70 women who used quinine, 11 died and at least 41 gave birth to defective children, but only three aborted. A handful of natural products that show promise are being tested, but the Centers for Disease Control urges women seeking to abort to avoid self\u00ad administration of any drug touted by the health foods industry as effective, stress\u00ad ing three potential dangers. (1) If ad\u00ad ministration of the drug does not bring about the desired result, the woman may be tempted to take an increased dosage, thus running the risk of toxic reactions. (2) If the woman changes her mi'nd and decides to carry to term, she runs. a greater risk of giving birth to a defective child. (3) Women who unsuccessfully try herbal abortifactants are facing a significantly greater risk of complications because of the delay if they later seek a physician-induced abortion. Because of the weakness of our laws in protecting us against \"natural\" nostrums, the FDA can do little more than warn against the use of these poten\u00ad tially dangerous folk remedies. Only if the drug label recommends their use for a particular purpose, such as abortion, or if sales attendants recommend them to customers seeking medical advice, does the FDA have authority to step in, the Lawrence Review points out.

ARTHRITIS VICTIMS EASY PREY If you have arthritis, the odds are four to one that you have been to the arthritis underground for an unproven remedy, ac\u00ad cording to an article in the Jan-Feb., 1985, issue of REHABILITATION NURSING. A 1980 study commissioned by the Public Health Service determined that 94 per\u00ad cent of the patients receiving traditional medical care for arthritis also tried an average of four unproven remedies each, including snake venom, DMSO, special diets, visits to shrines and uranium mines and wearing jewelry of copper and other substances claimed to have anti-arthritis qualities. The Arthritis Foundation estimates that $1 billion a year is spent on such remedies, and the delay In seek\u00ad ing or maintaining proper treatment may be responsible for unreversible damage to the\u00b7 patient.

Stickley Co., which specializes in books that provide the rational thinker with a hard look at the psychic and pseudo\u00ad scientific notions that pervade our socie\u00ad ty. Stephen Barrett, M.D. often quoted in these pages, is editor of NUTRITION FORUM and William Jarvis, Ph.D, is an associate editor. The subscription rate is $30 a year ($57 for two years), and the publication can be obtained from the George F. Stickley Co., 210 W. Washington Square, Philadelphia, PA 19106. From the Feb. '85 (Vol.2, No.2) issue we learn that: - Fluoridation has withstood a challenge from the \"Illinois Pure Water Committee.\" The Illinois Supreme Court overturned a ruling made by a circuit court judge two years ago stating that a state law making public water fluorida tion mandatory was invalid. The Pure Water Committee had maintained that the state had not adequately studied the long-term effects of the water treatment, but the supreme court ruled that the com\u00ad mittee had not proved the law was unreasonable enough to call for a ban. - No support has been found in two studies for claims that food allergy or the excessive use of sugar cause hyperactivi\u00ad ty or other behavioral reactions in children. - Athletes who perform strenuousexer---\u00ad cises need more water, but not significantly higher amounts of vitamins and other nutrients than persons on a normal balanced diet. - Free subscriptions to another publica\u00ad tion, CONTEMPORARY NUTRITION, are available to food and nutrition profes\u00adsionals.

JUNE) 1985 A BIT OF HISTORY AND A LOOK AT THE FUTURE --- --------- Wh~n I joined the NCHF seven years ago, it was still the Southern California Council Against Health Fraud. When I attended my first board meeting on Aug. 13, 1978, Dr. William Jarvis reported that we had 41 paid-up members. He then announced that the Northern California Council Against Health Fraud had voted to join with us and we voted to drop the word \"Southern\" from our name and go statewide. \u00b7 Earlier this year we became the National Council Against ~ealth Fraud. At last count we had 1369 members, up 33 percent from a year ago. We have c~apter~ in the states of Arizona, Washington and W1scons1n, and one under way in Michigan (see item below). There is strong interest in the formation of member groups in Florida, New York, Iowa, Texas, Illinois, Hawaii, Oregon and Indiana. In addition, we are affiliated with organizations in New York, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Kansas. We_ have _indeed become a national organization. While still small, NCAHF is fast becoming a houseword among persons concerned for the dissemination of valid health information, and eve~ more so among groups that promote what we believe to be unsound advice. While the NCAHF pace of growth is increasing, the need for our organization is increasing even faster. In these unsettled times of seemingly unsolvable problems, many people, in despair, are reaching out for miracles. This extends to the health field, where, although the prognoses for improved medical care and nutrition are much better than ever before, the hucksters of miracle health products are making great inroads. If you want to find out more about chapter formation or about other interested persons in your area, write NCAHF Vice President Nikki Mead, National Council Against Health Fraud, Inc., Box 1276, Loma Linda, CA 92354. --Len Metz QUACKERY CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS CHAPTER FORMATION First steps toward organizing an Oregon chapter of the NCAHF will be taken Sept. 7 at a daylong conference on Understanding & Combatting Health Fraud & Quackery. Persons interested in attending should write the Multnomah County Medical Society, 2188 S.W. Park Place, Portland, OR 97205. A late afternoon session will discuss \"Considerations to Establish an Oregon Chapter or Division of the National Council Against Health Fraud.\" \"PEOPLE'S MEDICAL SOCIETY\" A MISNOMER \"Make no mistake about it: This organization is rooted in deep antagonism to the medical profession and to medical science itself.\" This is how Dr. Stephen Barrett, MD, assesses the People's Medical Society (PMS), which for the past 30 months has been urging doctors to subscribe to a 10-point \"code of practice\" and sign up for a listing in a PMS directory. The name, People's Medical Society, is misleading. Dr. Barrett, board chairman of the Lehigh Valley (Penn.) Committee Against Health Fraud, Inc., and a member of the NCAHF board of directors, notes that PMS is \"the brainchild of Robert Rodale, board chairman of Rodale Press,\" which publishes PREVENTION MAGAZINE~ The magazine in the past has strongly opposed fluoridation and has carried ads for hair analysis and copper bracelets, and books touting unproven cures for ailments, including cancer. Writing in PRIVATE PRACTICE (Nov. '84, 48-4), Dr. Barrett notes that PMS is \"very antagonistic to doctors.\" PMS Executive Director Charles B. Inlander claims that his organization is independent of PREVENTION, but Robert Rodale is chairman of the organization's board of directors and PMS was launched with the help of a large Rodale loan and and continuous publicity from Rodale Press. Like most organizations of its kind, PMS mixes scientifically sound advice with health claims that have no proven scientific basis. a \"People's Medi cal Library\" proposed by PMS recommends such medically sound journals as JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine, but would also include Rodale books advocating \"natural\" healing and home remedies, Barrett said. And while the PMS _ Code of Practice contains little that most doctors may quarrel with, endorsing it would be counter productive because this would \"furnish political support for an organization antagonistic to doctors,\" Barrett concluded. MICHIGAN CHAPTER BEING LAUNCHED A drive to form a Michigan chapter of the NCAHF has been launched by Eileen Foulkes Mikus, MS, RD, of Traverse City. Mikus is contacting our Michigan members to join in chapter formation and is receiving help from our Wisconsin chapter. She can be reached c/o Michigan Home Health Care, 6861 Wilson Road, Indian River, MI 49749, 616/238-8971. DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN AGAINST PEPPER BiLLS? ------ A distraught health foods store owner recently complained to NCAHF that the Pepper Bills would make it impossible for a health food store clerk to offer an affirmative opinion if a customer asked, \"Do you think vitamin C will help my cold?\" He was assured that the Pepper Bills have nothing to do with regulating what is said in health food stores; in fact, he was told, the situation he described could come under practicing medicine without a license since the clerk might be guilty of prescribing, but it is doubtful if this would be the case under the circumstances he described. The customer initiated the discussion including his own diagnosis and the possibility that vitamin C might be of benefit. He was further assured that the Pepper Bills would not regulate the practice of medicine which is under state, not federal jurisdiction. The store owner said salesmen who supply his store are very vocal, expressing fears that the Pepper Bills would put them out of business and \"how wrong that would be in America.\" He stated that he was becoming worried too. An i 11-i nformed physi ca 1 education teacher recently stated in a published article that if the Pepper Bi 11 passes, \"No one but approved AMA physicians could 'diagnose or prescribe'. No claims as to the benefits of fresh air and water, regular exercise and rest, or fruits, grains and vegetables could be made except by approved physicians. Claims such as 'good for you' (by food companies or bakeries) could not be made. Vitamin C and herbs would be available by prescription -0nly \" The above are but two ex~J!!Jl l a and._ ___ _ -m, si rfforriiiffon oef rig generated against the Pepper Bi 11 s. Is it part of an organized effort or just spontaneous ignorance? The answer is, probably a little of both. NCAHF has seen a number of articles in the publications of groups which profit from questionable and worthless health products and services. These range from extremely paranoid to simply negative. None give the exact misconceptions represented in the examples cited. This leads to the conclusion that a good deal of the misinformation is being spread by word of mouth. Is it an organized disinformation campaign like the smear campaigns used in political conflicts? We can only guess at that. The best thing NCAHF members can do is to be certain they understand these bills and provide accurate information to people in their communities.-\u00ad Wi 11 i am Jarvis QUACKBUSTER AWARDS PROGRAM PLANNED We-are now accepting nominations for our first Quackbuster of the Year Award. Nominees may be nutritionists, legislators, reporters, doctors, teachers, or anyone else doing an outstanding job to advance sound health practices and knowledge.

ERRATA In an item on Yellow Pages advertising in the April Bulletin Board, we referred to Stan Ulrich as a member of the NCAHF board of directors. Stan is not a board member. But he is, of course, a valued member of NCAHF. CLAUDE PEPPER CHICKENING OUT? At last report it seems unlikely that U. S. Rep. Claude Pepper (Fla.) will reintroduce three public\u00b7\u00b7 health bills that died with the last Congress. The bills, HB 6049, HB 6050 and HB 6051, would have accomplished the following tasks: (1) establish a National Library of Medicine to provide up-to-date health information to the public, (2) increase penalties for selling or attempting to sell drugs, devices or medical treatment while knowing they are \"unsafe, ineffective or unproven for safety and efficacy,\" and (3) establish a Strike Force on Health Quackery to coordinate the efforts of federal agencies to curb the sale of \"fraudulent health remedies.\" The bills were strongly opposed by such organizations as the National Health Federation (NHF). The NHF objects to the words \"unproven\" and \"not proven\" in Pepper's bills. in the March '85 (vol.4, n.3, p. 13) issue of the NHF journal HEALTH FREEDOM NEWS, the Pepper bills are called \"lysenkoism.\" T. D. Lysenko was a Russian biologist who believed in a theory of acquired characteristics. If you grew grain under ideal conditions, he said, the improvements would be passed on genetically. Since he was a pal of \"Uncle Joe\" Stalin, his beliefs became part of the communist credo, and other Soviet scientists were prevented from scientifically examining the belief. As a result, grain production in the Soviet Union was seriously curtailed for a generation. Ironically, it is the NHF that would impose its views on the scientific community of America. The diatribe has a long list of persons and agencies it. -fears would be -instrumental in uetermintng\u00b7 what medical treatments are \"proven\" safe and effective. The list includes the AMA, American Cancer Society, the Arthritis Foundation, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the \"Librarian at the National Library of Medicine,\" Dr. Victor Herbert, Dr. Stephen Barrett, Elizabeth Whalen, Ralph Nader, \"Dear Abby,\" and, of course, our own Dr. William Jarvis. On the other hand, the NHF offers no other authority for deciding what is \"proven safe.\" The NHF is also pushing a \"Foods are Not Drugs Act\" that would prevent the FDA from moving against manufacturers or distributors of \"food\" who make cl aims that their product \"wi 11 prevent, cure or mitigate disease.\" One of the ploys used by the manufacturers of laetrile and other useless drugs is to call them \"foods.\" The laws governing \"foods\" are not as strong as those that regulate drugs. ~ PAPER SUPPORTS NUTRITIONIST LICENSE LAWS A statement supporting a number of legislative efforts across the nation that would require the licensure of dieticians and nutritionists has been prepared by the NCAHF and is no~ a~ailable._ The need for licensure is inherent 1n bills designed for consumer protection, but that very licensure stipulation makes these bills a prime ~arg~t for promoters who profit from the dissem1nat1on of unsound health products. The support statement includes adjunctive material on the questionable nature of many of the opponents of such bills. There is no charge for a copy of the statement, but a stamped, self-addressed business-size envelope would be appreciated. AUGUST 1985 VITAMINS LIGHTEN YOUR POCKETBOOK- NOT YOUR STRESS Vitamin supplements sold to combat stress are costing the American public million of dollars a year, but there's no evidence that they're doing their job, says the Center for Science in the Public In\u00ad terest (CSPI). Bonnie Liebman, CSPI director of nutrition, says the promotion of high dosage vitamins for stress has no scientific support, and is a \"giant fraud.\" A report in AMERICAN MEDICAL NEWS, (May 10, 1985) CSPI notes that Stresstabs are advertised for people who are \"burning the candle at both ends\" in advertisements by its manufacturer, Lederle Laboratories. Vitamin sup\u00adplements providing 100 percent of the U.S. recommended daily allowance may make sense if you're eating poorly because of emotional for physical stress, but pills that provide from 10 to 80 times the RDA \"are simply a waste of money,\" Liebman said. One out of five people who take vitamin pills use them \"in times of stress and worry,\" and in 1981 the estimated cost for such 'stress' pills was $75 million. NATIONAL COMMISSION PROPOSED TO ENSURE VACCINE SUPPLY With manufacturers running scared because of the threat of costly liability suits, the level of supplies of vaccines in the United States is \"precarious,\" and a national vaccine commission is needed to resolve the problem, a National Academy of Science report says. An Associated Press story in the Riverside (CA) Press-Enterprise, July 30, said the vaccine uncertainty is \"a threat to the public health.\" Vaccines are not infallible, and each year about 60 persons in the United States suffer bad results from inocula\u00ad tions. Federal law is supposed to protect manufacturers from liability if the vac\u00ad cines are properly manufactured and labeled. Nevertheless, according to Dr. Jay P. Sanford, dean of medicine at the Uniformed Services University of Health NEWSLETTER QUALITY IN THE HEAL TH MARKETPLACE NCAHF NEWSLETTER VOL.8, NO.4 DIPLOMA MILLS: A GROWTH INDUSTRY Do you need a doctorate to qualify for that high-paying job or a master's degree to earn a promotion? Don't bother to spend years studying for that much-desired degree. Buy one. A search by the American Council on Education has discovered 145 institu\u00ad tions of \"higher learning\" whose lax rules for conferring degrees, the council says, put them in violation of state and federal laws. Another 114 are suspect, the coun\u00ad cil adds. According to a New York Times News Service story in the San Bernardino (CA) Sun Aug. 6, 1985, doctorates are available for around $2,300, a master's degree may cost $1,250 and a bachelor's, a mere $800. There are substantial discounts if you buy all three at the same time, and you need not read a single book or pass a single test to qualify. And if you're worried that your degrees may not be accredited, some schools awarding such degrees have banded together to create more than 30 phony ac\u00ad crediting agencies to lend a spurious stamp of approval to your diplomas. The New York Times story cites findings reported in the current issue of Educa\u00ad tional Record, the quarterly of the American Council on Education. Thousands of \u00b7 persons in government, the military, education and private enterprise hold diploma mill degrees, the report says. Diploma mills often adopt names similar to those of legitimate institutions. The FBI found 25 such bogus educational institutions and one school in Oregon that had sold more than 2,300 spurious diplomas bearing 200 names of important\u00ad sounding educational institutions. This school had 30,000 blank diplomas on hand. Lax licensing laws in some states encourage the proliferation of diploma mills, the report says. Worst in this respect are Florida and California, but California is tightening its laws. Tougher state and federal laws and enforcement are needed to put an end to diploma mill practices, the report said. Many of the \"graduates\" of these schools wind up in the health professions, touting unproven medical theories or far-out nutritional advice. Sciences in Bethesda, Md., some courts have found manufacturers liable. Only three firms have been making vaccine against seven childhood diseases, including polio. Earlier this year two of them discontinued the manufac\u00ad ture of DPT, which immunizes against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus, and the third ran into production difficulties. As a result supplies dropped drastically, and for a while booster shots for older children were postponed. One of the two has since resumed production. The proposed commission would be a permanent body reporting to Congress and the President on the state of vaccine supplies, the need for new vaccines and policies needed to eliminate shortages. It is proposed that $1 million a year be set aside for the commission. A WORD OF PRAISE Kudos to WOMAN'S DAY for an ex\u00ad cellent article entitled, \"How to Spot a Health Hustler\" in its May 21, 1985 issue. So much nonsense about unproven medical therapies is being published by the press or broadcast over the airways that fair presentations should be en\u00ad couraged. The article, by Dianne Hales, warns that unproven and fraudulent health therapies are proliferating. Citing Stephen Barrett, M.D., she lists the five \"riskiest treatments\" as chelation, col\u00ad onic irrigation, hormonal compounds for arthritis, laetrile and megavitamins. If you want to write a letter commending Woman's Day for this presentation, the address is 1515 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10036.

FDA \"TRUTH SQUAD\" KEEPS TABS ON PHONY HEALTH CLAIMANTS Hydrogen peroxide was touted as a cure for cancer, kidney stones, multiple sclerosis and a variety of infections. Water was sold as a cure for arthritis, high blood pressure and other ailments. And undercover agents of the FDA were on hand to catch these promoters of un\u00ad proven products in the act, and bring an end to misrepresentations that were not on the labels, but were given orally. Following the Health Horizons Positive Living Expo in Washington, DC, last February, the FDA sent letters to 13 ex\u00ad hibitors in May warning them to take their products off the market or face legal action. As reported in an Associated Press story in the Riverside Press-Enterprise May 31, and an FDA Talk Paper issued the same day, the FDA presence at the Washington expo was representative of similar visits to similar expos around the country by members of its Fraud Branch. By attending such expos, FDA in\u00ad vestigators can watch sales personnel in the act of promoting their products as disease cures. Without such observation, the FDA may be unable to act because often the promises of cures are not printed on the labels. Bruce Brown, an FDA spokesman, noted that the agency has no quarrel with legitimate health fairs offering blood pressure and eyesight checks and other health services. But fairs where products are sold as multiple cures for serious ill\u00ad nesses, including cancer and heart disease, should be suspect, he said. Products for which warning letters were sent included Bio-Line Catalyst Water, Stimulac, BY PASS, Kyolic, hydrogen peroxide, Pure Bio-Chelated, Natra-Bio Extracts, Mannamist, New Moon Extracts and Herbal Formulas, the FDA reported. TO LIVE OUT YOUR YEARS, THE LEAN AND HUNGRY LOOK Juan Ponce de Leon never did find the fountain of youth. But he lived 62 years, which was twice his life expectancy at birth for his times. Nevertheless, it is doubtful if he achieved his full life span. A Medical Progress report in the May 2, 1985 (v. 312, n. 18) issue of the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that the best way to achieve your full life span may be to go hungry during your youth without depriving yourself of needed nutrients. Entitled \"Life Extension\" (not to be confused with the book of the same name), the report covers the state of the art in longevity studies, quoting 194 sources. Prepared for the National Institute of Aging, the report was written by Edward L. Schneider, MD, and John D. Reed, Jr., BS. The report distinquishes between life expectancy, which is the average number of years of life the average individual can expect at birth; and life span, which is the greatest age the individual can attain, barring accidents or disease. Life spans are believed to vary from individual to individual in accordance with heredity, while life expectancy is affected by external conditions. With increased knowledge about nutrition and vastly improved techniques for dealing with disease, life expectancy for the average American has incresed about 63 percent since the turn of the century, while life span has remained the same. For more than half a century, research studies have illustrated that rats and mice living on severely restricted amounts of food live longer than their better-fed peers. But the amount of food reduction required for this phenomenon also results in retarded growth, and therefore is considered undesirable for humans. The ef\u00ad fects of exercise on longevity is less certain. Retrospective studies of athletes could find no correlation between exercise and life span, but animal studies show a con\u00ad sistent increase if exercise is initiated early in life. From early times, witch doctors, shamans and others professing to have secret health knowledge have purveyed elixirs promising to give you long life if not outright immortality. A great many potions, powders and pills are purveyed today, some of them showing promise, some merely enriching the purveyors. Gerovital H3, for example, has been enriching its major promotor, Dr. Ana Asian of Rumania, for more than 30 years; and thousands of other practitioners for shorter terms. But Dr. Asian's claims have not been verified, and the feelings of well-being reported by some patients who use it may probably be ascribed to the procaine in the preparation rather than any life-prolonging effect. A variety of other preparations have been touted as life extenders, including superoxide dismutase, vitamin E, centrophenoxine, levadopa and DHEA. Mixed reports of success with with some of them with mice may be skewed because the chemicals may contribute to weight loss, which seems to be a component of longevi\u00adty in mice. In addition, some of the chemicals are toxic at the levels required. In one study of the effect of Vitamin E (on pooled readers of Prevention magazine) increased mortality was observed in patients who ingested doses of more than 1,000 IU per day. 2 DON'T THROW OUT THOSE ALUMINUM POTS- YET Findings in 15 years of various research efforts seeking a link between Alzheimer's Disease and excessive aluminum intake are contradictory, says R. H. Wheater, MS, of the American Medical Association. Responding to a question posed in the April 19, 1985 (p. 2288, v.253, n.15) issue of the Journal of the American Medical Society, Wheater notes that increased amounts of aluminum in the brain have been found in patients who do not exhibit dementia . or other symptoms of Alzheimer's. As for low aluminum diets and the elimination of aluminum pots and pans, such measures seem unwarranted \"at the moment,\" Wheater said: There is no evidence of increased absorption of aluminum, even when the amount in the diet is doubled, he said. Most favored theories regarding the cause of Alzheimer's are slow viruses, autoimmune processes and aluminum, Wheater said. The most favored hypothesis is that the agent is a slow virus, but there is no evidence. that the disease can be transmitted, which makes this theory less likely. As for aluminum, the injection of this chemical into animal brains results in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles that resemble tangle-bearing neurons in the brains of humans with Alzheimer's, but the human tangles are in bundles of paired helical filaments, while the animal tangles are straight. Wheater surmises that even if aluminum is involved it may not be the sole cause of Alzheimer's, but may in\u00ad stead be a marker of degenerating neurons or neurofibrillary tangles. Another possibility is that Alzheimer pa\u00ad tients have a special susceptibility to the metal. Limited clinical trials have in\u00ad dicated some benefit to such patients through the administration of deferox\u00ad amine, which helps eliminate aluminum from the body. FAILING THE BLOOD TEST Cow's blood or human blood- it was all the same to Bio Health Centers of Los Angeles. According to a story in the Albany (New York) Times Union on March 27, when federal investigators sent a vial of blood and a $350 fee to the California lab stating it came from an individual who was \"overweight, tired, irritable, con\u00ad stipated\" and vegetarian and requesting a test for allergies, the lab reported that the patient was allergic to milk, blue cheese and yogurt. Since the patient was a cow and not a human being, the New York State Attorney General's Office barred Bio Health from advertising or conducting business in New York. POSITIVE THINKING NO CANCER CURE A 42-month study of 359 cancer pa\u00ad tients has revealed no relationship be\u00ad tween positive thinking and a cure, a story in TIME magazine (June 23, 1985) reveals. Citing the New England Journal of Medicine for June 16, the article said researchers could find no link between mental attitude and survival or recurrence rates. Three out of four of 204 advanced cancer patients studied by a team under Dr. Barrie Cassileth at the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center in Phila\u00ad delphia died during the period, and one out of four of 155 breast cancer or melanoma patients suffered recurrence. Cheerful patients did not fare better than average for the group, and pessimistic patients did not fare worse. In an editorial accompanying the New England Journal article, Dr. Marcia Angell, deputy editor, said a belief in positive thinking as an agency against disease is \"largely folklore.\" She criticiz\u00ad ed books by Norman Cousins, which prescribes laughter and vitamin C; and by Carl and Stephanie Simonton, which ad\u00ad vocates mental imagery techniques. Per\u00ad sons who insist there is a direct cause and effect relationship between emotions and illness may cause harm by influenc\u00ad ing patients to go to practitioners who of\u00ad fer \"mind tricks as cures for cancer,\" she said. An unfortunate implication in the belief is that it makes patients feel that they are responsible for their own illnesses and, hence, guilty if they do not respond to treatment. WETTER WATER UPDATE Mary Lee Chin, R.D., one of our sub\u00ad cribers in Denver, CO, writes to tell us that distributors of Bio-Lfne Catalyst Water are not living up to the disclaimers put out by the company. A spokesman for the manufacturer has stated the product is not specified \"for any particular ail\u00ad ment,\" a statement that keeps the manufacturer from running afoul of the food and drug laws. Chin has sent to our notice a mailing from a Frankfort, Ill., chiropractor claiming success in using the miracle water for stress, hypertension and chronic constipation. Since Bio-Line Catalyst Water is more than 99 percent water, and drinking plenty of water may help persons with chronic constipation, at least the last part of the claim may be true. The product reminds me of the dehydrated water you see advertised on occasion. To make dehydrated water, you heat dihydrogen oxide until all the water is driven off. Then you seal the remainder hermetically in a can. To restore it, you just add oxygen dihydride. The resemblance between this product and Bio-Water theory is enhanced by the in\u00ad structions for using Bio-Water, which is sold in concentration in a four-ounce bot\u00ad tle for the wholesale price of $10. To restore it, you need only add four gallons of tap water. This product, of course, is a food- not a drug, and thus does not come under the prurient scrutiny of the FDA. You take it (for nutritional purposes only) at the rate of two four-ounce jiggers a day. HYPERBARIC OXYGEN NO MS CURE, NEUROLOGISTS SAY Neurologists meeting in Dallas last June voted to stop evaluating the effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) on multiple sclerosis patients after being told of negative results in four controlled studies. As reported in Medical World News (June 10, 1985), placebos used in the studies were as effective as the treat\u00ad ment. A research team in Thousand Oaks, CA, claimed significant improvement in seven of nine patients with a lesser degree of the ailment, but other patients involved in their study with similar degrees of disability fared equally well with placebos. The team plans to con\u00ad tinue the experiments. \u00b7 A factor in the research is the high cost of administering the pressurized oxygen- about $3,000 for a four-week course of treatment. DON'T PROMISE CURES, HOLISTIC NUTRITION COUNSELOR ADVISES PRACTITIONER HOPEFULS It's the big, bold letters spelling out \"Practicing Medicine Without a License\" that draw your eye to the stand holding this manual. But when you come up close, you see that the words are pre\u00ad ceded by finer print spelling out, \"How to Practice Nutritional Counseling Without Being Guilty Of\" - And that pretty much sums up what Chester P. Yozwick, doctor of naturopathy and holistic medicine, \"Bio\u00ad Nutritional Analyst\" and \"Holistic Natural Health Care Practitioner and Educator\" has to say in his 50-page manual for peo\u00ad ple wishing to become health counselors. His message is simple. Sell your customers on \"natural health,\" but don't promise to cure their illnesses. If you stick to \"practicing nutrition and not medicine,\" you may be investigated, but you won't be fined or have to go to jail. His booklet, described on the cover as an \"authoritative and practical manual for every health practitioner, regardless of modality,\" promises to tell its readers \"how to set up a private practice, manage it and run it legally without violating AMA or MDA laws.\" Yozwick contends that the patient is responsible for his own health. Health counselors should not talk about organs or illness or promise to treat them, he said. If they do, they may be violating the law. Instead, clients should be motivated 3 to \"rely on the body's own innate in\u00ad telligence to restore itself to health.\" Yozwick is president and founder of the Nutritional Science Association, which he calls his \"support group.\" Such a group is necessary to \"support your work and protect you,\" he said. His group,\u00b7 he added, was instrumental in helping to weaken an Ohio bill that would have penalized his brand of nutritional counseling.

NATURAL, BUT DEADLY U.S. marshals have seized $340,000 worth of herbal products belonging to Nature's Sunshine Inc. of Spanish Fork, Utah, because they contain varying amounts of lobeline, a potentially dead\u00ad ly alkaline. According to the FDA Con\u00ad sumer (May 1981), four persons in Forest Lake, Minn., became ill after consuming Nature's Sunshine LBS-II capsules, which contain lobelia, an imported plant from which lobeline is obtained. Lobelia has also been found in pills at Nature's Sun\u00ad shine outlets in Texas and Ohio. The company is contesting the seizure. FISH GALL FOUND POISONOUS An old oriental arthritis remedy, the in\u00ad gestion of raw gall bladder from the freshwater grass carp, has sent three people to the hospital, an article in BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL (v.290, March 23, '85) reports. Two suffered from gastrointestinal upset, and all developed various degrees of kidney and liver pro\u00ad blems. The three have since recovered. The offending agent has riot been iden\u00ad tified, but doctors believe it is not an in\u00ad fective agent, since cooked gall bladder from the fish has been found poisonous to animals. WEIGHT LOSS EAR GADGET BANNED Some years ago, when the first American doctors visited Communist China, they were given demonstrations of the use of acupuncture to replace anesthesia during operations and were told that acupuncture possessed magical curative powers. When the dcctors return\u00ad ed to the United States some brought back enthusiastic reports of what they had seen and heard. However, clinical tests failed to reproduce the results claimed by the Chinese, and enthusiasm for acupuncture has waned. It. is believ\u00ad ed the success of the Chinese doctors may have more to do with the fact that the Chinese under communism are more resigned to pain, and less to do with any curative qualities the technique may have. Nevertheless, fringe practitioners still prescribe variations of acupuncture for everything from headaches to cancer, including overweight. So it was that a Louisiana woman paid $300 for a small piece of plastic called an Acu-Thin Ear Stimulator to wear on her ear. She was told that tiny projections on the plastic would stimulate \"pressure points\" on her ear that would inhibit her appetite, and cause her to lose weight. Instead, her ear became sore, pain spread through her head, and within five days she returned to the Acu-Thin Weight Con\u00ad trol Center to ask for her money back. When she was refused, she complained to the FDA. As related in the February '85 issue of FDA Consumer (v.19, n.1), th~ company told an FDA investigator the device is a \"non-medical device\" and not subject to federal control. But when the FDA disagreed, the company backed down and agreed to stop making, adver\u00ad tising or distributing the device, which was being sold in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas.

NEWSLETTER Box 1276, Loma Linda, CA 92354 ADDRESS CORRECTION REQUESTED 4 Non-Profit Organization U.S. POSTAGE PAID Loma Linda. CA Permit No. 48 SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER 1985 NATIONAL HEALTH FRAUD CONFERENCE REPORT On September 11, the FDA, FTC and Postal Inspector's Office convened the National Health Fraud Conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. The conference was well-attended and in\u00ad cluded representatives from consumer organizations, law enforcement agencies, professional socfeties, voluntary health agencies, trade groups and even a few \"moles\" for organized quackery. The opening and closing addresses were given by FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young, MD, Ph.D; he was followed by Carol Crawford, Director of FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, and Chief Postal Inspector Charles R. Clauson. The au\u00ad dience was delighted by the unscheduled appearance and address of Rep. Claude Pepper whose 1984 hearings in the House of Representatives are responsi\u00ad ble for the current interest in combatting health fraud. The day happened to be the occasion of Mr. Pepper's 85th birthday. The moderator, Deputy FDA Commis\u00ad sioner John A. Norris, JD, MBA, presented Mr. Pepper with an NCAHF \"Quackbusters\" T-shirt for a combination birthday gift and acknowledgement of his antiquackery efforts. Eventually,\u00b7 all of the government officials participating in the day's activities were awarded similar T\u00adshirt awards including the luncheon speaker, Virginia Knauer, Special Advisor to the President for Consumer Affairs. NCAHF was well represented at the conference. Board members Stephen Barrett, MD; Victor Herbert, MD, JD; William Jarvis, Ph.D; Grace Monaco, JD; and John Renner, MD; made presen\u00ad tations. It is clear that combatting health fraud is in vogue and many professional organizers are moving to create anti\u00ad health fraud groups. NCAHF is clearly a leader in the field, but could fade as others nearer the political center become more active. This is a mixed blessing. We would like to see NCAHF grow to the point that it can become an independent agency fulfilling the many tasks that it NEWSLETTER QUALITY IN THE HEAL TH MARKETPLACE NCAHF NEWSLETTER has identified as necessary in an effec\u00ad tive war against health fraud, misinforma\u00ad tion and quackery. While we welcome increased antiquackery efforts by others, experience has taught that there is a scarcity of resources available to combat these problems. We are somewhat con\u00ad cerned that Jimited .resources may be fragmented and diluted when a concen\u00adtrated effort is badly needed. NCAHF has led the way in clearly defining the problems involved, ap\u00ad proaching th~se proQlems scientifically, uniting legal professionals and academia with health scientists in a coalition need\u00ad ed for success against organized VOL.8, NO.5 quackery, and maintaining the in\u00addependence and credibility that is essential. There is a \"band wagon effect\" that concerns us as well. We do not want to see an ad hoc effort that will merely drive quackery underground temporarily. It is time that quackery be viewed as an on\u00ad going social problem that needs continu\u00ad ing surveillance, analysis and opposition. NCAHF is glad to share the task with others, but presently must look toward becoming large enough to fulfill its poten\u00ad tial as a private voluntary health agency that makes health fraud, misinformation and quackery its primary focus. (Report by NCAHF President William Jarvis) COURTS LOOKING INTO FAITH HEALING DEATHS Faith healing is under legal attack in Indiana, where two couples have been found guilty in the deaths of their children; and in California, where other parents who relied on faith healing for their children face court action in similar cases. An Indiana legislator is seeking to change laws that permit such treatment in his state. The Indiana cases involve the Faith Assembly, a religious sect that advocates faith healing. According to a story in the Medical World News for Aug. 26, 1985, 90 members of this church for whom traditional medicine was rejected in favor of faith healing have died. Two-thirds were children; and another was Faith Assembly leader the Rev. Hobart Freeman, who was awaiting trial on charges including reckless homicide and child neglect when he died last December of a variety of diseases. Followers have not chosen a successor because they believe he will be raised from the dead. In California, despite a law permitting the use of faith healing to treat illness, parents have been brought into court in three California counties following the deaths last year of three children from bacterial meningitis. As reported Aug. 19, 1985, in an Associated Press story in the San Bernardino (CA) Sun, the parents relied on the prayers of Christian Science practitioners rather than conventional treat\u00ad ment by doctors. Prosecutors in Los Angeles, Somona and Sacramento counties brought charges against the parents, claiming the law does not apply to life\u00ad threatening situations. Initially, charges were also filed against a Christian Science practitioner in Los Angeles County, but the charges were dropped. Church spokesmen say their members are not barred from seeking treatment from medical doctors. The parents in these cases should not be considered villains who deliberately chose to harm their children. Instead, they are victims of their beliefs. Courts, while ruling to protect children from the misguided actions of such parents, no matter how well intended, also seem to be recognizing the unintentional nature of the neglect by ordering probation and suspended sentences in most cases rather than the prison sentences that are possible under the law. At least, it is our ardent hope that this is the reason for the slap-on-the-wrist sentences being passed out in such cases.

He was an \"expert\" witness in a Massachusetts case some years ago concerning Chad Green, a leukemia victim taken to Mex\u00ad ico for laetrile treatments by his parents despite a court order requiring that the boy be kept in the state for chemo\u00ad therapy, which had placed him in remis\u00ad sion. Denied chemotherapy, the boy died just before his fourth birthday. In an in\u00ad terview in the San Bernardino {CA) Sun at the Halstead boasted he had ad\u00ad ininisterealae1rilefo patients \u00b7\"oy lhe \u00b7 bucketful.\" As reported in the Los Angeles {CA) Times, Halstead acted as his own at\u00ad torney in the five-month trial, which end\u00ad ed Oct. 3 when a jury found him guilty of 24 counts of cancer fraud and grand theft. The jury deadlocked on a con\u00ad spiracy charge and found Halstead not guilty of one count of cancer fraud. Earlier this year, two other men who pleaded guilty to reduced counts for sell\u00ading and dispensing ADS received proba\u00ad tion and were required to perform community service. Two other suspects are sought. In his trial, Halstead maintained he had never promised that ADS would cure cancer. But the prosecution said Halstead had told patients the liquid had helped patients in Japan, had caused tumors to decrease in size and could in\u00ad crease white blood cell counts. Halstead received up to $150 a liter for the liquid, which was 99.4% water and the rest mostly coliform bacteria, the prosecutors . ---said.-Malstead-saia-he-did-Aot k-AOW-the contents of ADS, but that he believes the substance is a nutritional supplement of value to patients. The law has no jurisdic\u00adtion over the sale of nutritional sub\u00ad stances, he maintained. Halstead says he will appeal. Bail has been set at $100,000 and sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 31. Halstead faces a maximum of eight years in prison. CHIROPRACTIC GROWING AND LUCRATIVE There are 31,000 chiropractors in the United States, and more than half of them have gross incomes over $100,000 a year. As reported in the AMA News, July 19, 1985, p.31, chiropractors are licensed in all states, and in some states are permit\u00ad ted to admit patients to hospitals. The average chiropractor in 1983 grossed $106,333 and netted $59,074. ON THE CHIROPRACTIC FRONT Editor's note: The following article was prepared for the NCAHF Newsletter by Ron L. Slaughter, a chiropractor in\u00ad terested in the reform of his profession. \"The National Association for Chiropractic Medicine {NACM) represents those chiropractors working to reform the practice of chiropractic; to purge ideology, restrict scope of practice and work within a strict science-based format. Toward these ends, Dr. R. L. Slaughter, president of NACM, recently met with the eleven-member board of governors of the American Chiropractic Association. The ACA is the undisputed majority associa\u00ad tion within chiropractic. \"Regretfully, Dr. S[aughter.advises that it is his opinion the ACA has no interest in renouncing traditional chiropractic dogma or in restricting scope of practice. The consequenceis-;ot course, that \u00b7prac\u00ad tice and education cannot meet the re\u00ad quirements of science methodology. Consequently, the ACA has ~o interest in working with the NACM toward these and other goals set out by the NACM. \"Dr. Slaughter advises, however, that the NACM will continue to pursue all its stated goals and feels members are mov\u00ad ing rapidly on many fronts. More members are applying weekly; many in in\u00ad fluential positions within the profession. The NACM has a number of members working as consumer advocates and en\u00adcourages its members to speak out on abuses within chiropractic.\" ALLEGED DENTAL AMALGAM TOXICITY ... ARE DENTAL FILLINGS POISONING PEOPLE? Several years ago we learned of a \"holistic\" chiropractor who recommend\u00ad ed that a patient have all of his dental fill\u00ad ings replaced with gold for the purpose of affecting his \"polarity\" and \"energy flow.\" The insurance carrier balked at paying for this-s-etv1ce \u00b7anct--a-sked for-an opinion. Currently, others are seeking to have their dental fillings replaced for another reason-alleged toxicity from mercury, which is one of the components of dental amalgam. This new concern is probably a reflec\u00ad tion of concerns raised by the reporting of toxic substance problems by the media combined with innovation by the promoters of pseudoscience such as hair analysis labs. Hair analysis has been the focus of quackery for more than a decade. At first, hair analysis promoters claim\u00ad ed that they could determine vitamin and trace mineral needs by this method, and often would also supply the supplements they recommended. In time, critics pointed out that hair contains no vitamins, therefore, cannot be used to analyze for them. It is also clear from an abundance of sclentific .literature that \u00b72 hair analysis is invalid for assessing trace minerals in individuals. Hair analysis is a valid method for assessing heavy metals {e.g., arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury) providing infor\u00ad mation on body loads and a chronology of when the intakes occurred. {For exam\u00ad ple, during growth hair shafts deposit these metals, which can be recapitulated by calculating growth rate). Forensic science has used hair analysis in cases of suspected arsenic poisoning to deter\u00ad mine how much was ingested and when. Of course, other symptoms provided clues that arsenic poisoning had oc\u00ad curred. Epidemiologists use hair analysis to compare groups of people living in polluted areas with others. The average hair-lead content of a group of children living near a busy street may be com\u00ad pared to a matched group of country dwellers to-show-that gasoline lead is be\u00ad ing picked up by the former group. However, variations of lead content that are below the levels known to be toxic among the individual children are not useful to determine that any given child is more polluted than another. In cases of lead poisoning, other symptoms will accompany the condition and other tests can be employed to verify the condition. Questionable promoters of hair analysis have adapted to the marketplace as their claims moved from vitamins and trace minerals to the presence of toxic metals. The bottom line has remained the same in that they continue to promote the sale of supplements based upon their analysis. Supplements may be sold to \"help detoxify the body,\" \"build up the immune system to help the body main\u00ad tain health,\" or some other unsubstan\u00ad tiated claim. Recently, the presence of mercury in dental fillings has become the focal point of these promoters. Hair analysis is a reliable indicator of the body's mercury burden. Hair has about.300-times-theJevelof blood 7.-Coo\u00ad tact allergy to dental amalgam (reactions of mouth tissue in direct contact with the mercury-containing amalgam, which may \u00b7 also be caused by copper in filling materials) does exist, but is apparently more rare than generally believed 3 Mercury toxicity is well known. Miners of cinnabar {the ore from which mercury is derived) are particularly prone to mer\u00ad cury poisoning and have to be detoxified occasionally. Certain occupational en\u00ad vironments {including dentists, due to the vaporization of mercury by their high\u00ad speed drills 29) are exposed to higher than natural mercury levels and may be the subject of study and regulation. by oc\u00ad cupational health authorities. Historical\u00ad ly, the \"mad hatters\" {immortalized by \"Alice In Wonderland\") were made mad by the mercury used in millinery. Mercury is widespread in the natural environment. It is found in rocks of all kinds, air everywhere, plants and drinking water. The main source of the body's mercury is natural food 1 (i.e., not caus\u00ad ed by man-made pollution). Although the mercury is present in a form that is nor\u00ad mally biologically unreactive 8, dental amalgams do add to the boay-load of mercury and such activities as chewing releases mercury ions 4, however, the dif\u00ad ferences between body-loads of people with and without mercury amalgams is insignificant and differences between in\u00ad dividuals is related more to nutrition than the number of mercury amalgams pre\u00ad sent in their mouths 5 Proponents of the mercury amalgam toxicity hypothesis state that \"mercury is highly toxic to humans, therefore, ANY AMOUNT IS HARMFUL. .. \" (emphasis mine) 6 This ignores (1) the reality that mercury is ubiquitous in the natural en\u00advironment; (2) the pharmacological prin\u00ad ciple that 'the dose makes the poison'; and, (3) the extensive scientific data on mercury and human health. It is worth noting that all dentists would benefit financially from a national stampede to have mercury-containing restorations replaced with composite, gold or something else. This would come at a time when the dental profession is suffering from decreased revenues-due largely to the effectiveness of fluorides in decay prevention. It is a tribute to the integrity of the dental profession that it is challenging alleged amalgam toxicity because of its lack of scientific support. This is consistent with its support of fluoridation, which will cost the profes\u00ad sion billions of dollars in the future. Den\u00ad tal mavericks may claim that dentists are merely attempting to \"save face\" rather than admit to having used a dangerous material, however, the crux of the matter lies in the lack of evidence for alleged dental amalgam toxicity, which would be forthcoming from experts in environmen\u00ad tal health-not dentistry-if it were true.

CHIROPRACTOR ORDERED TO DESIST COLONIC IRRIGATIONS After seven years of litigation, a San Diego chiropractor has been ordered by a California Superior Court judge to stop administering colonic irrigation. Accor\u00ad ding to Action Report No. 28 of the Board of Medical \u00aeuality Assurance, when a restraining order was first sought by the BMQA against chiropractor John Luly in 1978, the state Board of Chiropractic Ex\u00ad aminers intervened on his side contend\u00ad ing that colonic irrigation is a traditional part of chiropractic. ,!3ut Judge Carlos A.

SUIT CHARGES ALTA-DENA DAIRY WITH FALSE ADVERTISING Three consumer groups have filed suit against Alta-Dena Dairy of City of In\u00ad dustry (CA) charging that advertisements for the dairy's raw milk are false and misleading and requesting that a warn\u00ad ing be placed on raw milk products stating they may contain dangerous bacteria. As reported in the Los Angeles Times, Aug. 28, 1985, the suit asks an im\u00ad mediate halt to advertising that states raw milk is safe and wholesome tor in\u00ad fants, elderly people and invalids. The three groups, Consumers Union, the Gray Panthers and the American Public Health Association, filed the suit Aug. 27 in Alameda County Superior Court in Hayward. The suit states that health-threatening organisms have been found in Alta-Dena raw milk samples more than 200 times during the past 11 years. Company representatives say the charges are part of a conspiracy against raw milk. The case was filed not long after an epidemic of deaths and illnesses among purchasers of soft cheeses made by Jalisco Mexican Food Products (Arcadia, CA) that were found to contain Listeria monocytogenes, an organism particularly dangerous to infants. Some of the milk used to manufacture the cheese came from Alta-Dena herds, but a definite link between the dairy and the disease has not been established, although an ex\u00ad perimental testing procedure at the University of Vermont tentatively turned up the organism in milk samples from the dairy. The cheese-making process includ\u00aded pasteurization, which is designed to kill dangerous organisms in milk. q I, YEAST CONNECTION? WHAT YEAST CONNECTION? Editor's note: The following article by Dr. David Malish, MD, of San Jose, CA, is a reprint from the Summer, 1985, issue of Health and Nutrition Newsletter, a publication of the Santa Clara County (CA) Medical Society. \"Most diseases are discovered; others are invented. Many physicians suspect the new yeast, or \"candidiasis hypersen\u00ad sitivity syndrome,\" to be the latest exam\u00ad ple of an overblown, perhaps invented disease. \"Proponents blame yeast for a vast variety of often everyday symptoms: fatigue, depression, hyperactivity, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, im\u00adpotence, respiratory problems, and more. \"The purported villain is the yeast organism, Candida albicans. Candida albicans is found almost everywhere, from table tops to doorknobs, and is a normal inhabitant of mucous mem\u00ad branes. It causes neither symptoms nor disease, except in unusual circum\u00ad stances. \"Yeast connection\" proponents often describe antifungal (yeast killing) drugs. No drugs, not even aspirin, should be taken without genuine reason. \"The candidiasis theory was recently promoted in an OMNI magazine article on 'People are Talking,' and in the book THE YEAST. CONNECTION, by William Crooks, MD. In addition to long-term treatment, Crooks recommends a 'Can\u00ad dida Control Diet.' Included is a lengthy list of \"foods you must avoid-\" yeast breads, cheese, mushrooms, sugar, white flour, and anything that may, in theory, either contain or provide nourishment tor yeast. According to Crook, milk, too, is suspect, since it contains a natural sugar, lactose. \"To summarize a (to be published) draft of an American Academy of Allergy and Immunology position paper: \"1. The concept of yeast hypersen\u00ad sitivity is speculative and un\u00ad proven; most symptoms described could apply to virtually all sick peo\u00ad ple at some time or other. Nor is there any proof that treatment with antifungal drugs helps. \"2. The public is misled to believe that this 'syndrome' is a genuine illness and a source of serious disease.\" HEAL TH GURU, BARBELL MAGNATE, DIES Bob Hoffman, founder of York Barbell Co., health products manufacturer and a former member of the National Health Federation board of governors, died July 18 at the age of 86. During the '60s and '70s federal agencies five times forced his company to stop making false claims for his health products. HAIR ANALYSIS LABS NOT IN AGREEMENT Laboratories performing hair analysis seem to be no more in agreement than astrologers. When hair samples from two healthy youngsters were sent to 12 laboratories for analysis, there was little unanimity in the findings, Dr. Stephen Barrett, MD, reports in an article entitled \"Commercial Hair Analysis\" in the Aug. 23-30 issue of JAMA (vol.254, no.a, p. 1041-1045). Readings of mineral content in the samples varied not only from laboratory to laboratory, but also from identical samples sent to the same laboratory. Six labs recommended food supplements, but there was no agree\u00ad ment among them on nutrient mix or strength. Because of a recent court adverse decision, it is probable that such labs will stop advertising their services directly to the public, Barrett says. But THE NATIONAL COUNCIL AGAINST HEALTH FRAUD, INC. P.O. Box 1276, Loma Linda, CA 92354 Main Office & Resource Center CHAPTERS Arizona Council Against Health Fraud, Inc. legislation is still needed to prevent the sale of hair analysis services to other unorthodox medical practitioners. PAMPHLET ALERT REQUESTED The California Department of Health Services has requested shoppers to keep an eye out for pamphlets advertising Col\u00ad on Rinse, a product manufactured by Health Plus, Inc., of Pomona, CA. On Ju\u00ad ly 10 the company pleaded no contest to three misdemeanor counts for unlawful advertisements and manufacturing drugs without a license, and agreed to repackage the product and submit future advertising for DHS review.

AFFILIATES HEALTH CLAIMS MAY BE PERMITTED ON FOOD LABELS In a reversal of policy, the FDA pro\u00ad poses to soften rules that prohibit health claims on food packages and labels. The action has been considered since last October, when the National Cancer In\u00ad stitute endorsed efforts of the Kellog Co. to promote alleged anti-cancer effects and other health benefits of its All-Bran on the product container. A New York Times News Service story published Aug. 18, 1985, in the San Bernardino (CA) Sun states that consumer groups are fearful that the FDA action would open the door to irresponsible health and medical claims by food manufacturers. The FDA says it is trying to set up guidelines to permit accurate claims while keeping out fraudulent claims.

VOL.8, N0.5 MEDIA BACKS AWAY FROM SCleNCE The Fall, 1985 C.HJ .. L.D. NEWSLET\u00ad TEA reports that two major media sources have backed away from previous interests ln reporting on the needless deaths and suffering of the children of Christian Science church members due to medical Aeglect. The Norman Lear productron com\u00ad ~pany .and FAMt.lV OlRCLE magazine. are nat'l\"led. C.H.I.L.D. NewSLETTER has revealed some of the tactics us\u00ad ed by the Christian Science church to intimidate critics of its practices and the clearly unconstitutional laws which spe.cifi.call.y exempt the church from prosecution in cases of medical neglect The present status of Chris\u00ad tian Science and the law cannot stand public scrutiny, but it remains to be seen If the media has the courage to e>(pose it to the na1ion. Christian Science church members are general\u00ad ly highly-educated and many are well\u00ad placed in government, the legal system and the media providing them \u00b7 with a, cons.iderable amount of political leverage. It is understandable \u00b7that loyal members are protective of their church, but social r:esponsfbillty fSemands that they rethink some of their practices and their relationship with the U.S. Constitution. \"TROPHOPHOBIA\" ''Trophophobia\" ~ the fear of nutritious foods. It is\u00b7 described by Reginald Passmore, retired phyisologist from the University of Edinburgh. He groups it with other eating disorders. Trophophobia Is engendered by the constant media bar\u00ad .rage that makes people believe modern foods are poisonous, aHergy\u00b7producing, inadequate and so forth. This concept and perspective on meat and dairy fats, eg,gs, salt, sugar and atoohoHe beverages is covered in his article \"Food propagandists-the new puritans,\" JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE August, pp.387;;aa9.

NUTRITION SENSE AND NONSENSE IN DENTISTRY JUXTAPOSED The September, 1985 issue ofDENTAL ECONOMICS presents two articles on nutritio.rn counseling by dental practices. The first i.s by a dentist who says \"nutri\u00ad tion counseling boosted ourpractice.\" H. Paul Jacobi, DDS of Neenah; Wisconsin, (author of ''Dentist's Flight Manual to. Success\") passes off what he cal Is the \"controversial\" aspects of dental nutrl\u00ad tionaJ counseling by saying \"What else is new? There are a lot of controversies in dentistry.\" He says, \"For any dentist with a hang-up about selling nutrltional products, I understand. But selling den\u00ad tures also irwolves a product sold several times tt1e labaratory bill.'' JfilQQl:)i says he wouldn't consider doing a surgical pro\u00ad cedure without .first doing a \"Lingual Ascorbic Acid Test\" (editors note: this test is invalid see J. ORAL MED, 29:8, 1974). .. - Juxtaposed with the above article is \"Nutrition counseling: proceed with cau\u00ad tion,'' by Ann. Ehrlich, MA, President of a management counsulting firm. Ms. Erhllch states that dentists 'have a pro\u00ad fessional and ethical responsibility to pro\u00ad vide a real service based on actual patient ne.ed. She warns against un\u00ad proven methods such as hair analysis and applied kinesiology and questio.ns whether prescribing nutritional sup\u00ad plements is either \"warranted or wise.\" Ehrlich exhibits a strong background in sound nutrition and ethics and suggests that dentists who do wish to offet nutrl, tion counseling work with Registered Dietetians and have a training program for staff. NOTE: For those interested in a $Ound source of nutrition information for den, tists see Pollack RL and Kravitz E. (1985) NUTRITION IN ORAL HEALTH AND DISEASE, Philadelphia: Lea & Febiger. In, c.luded is a .33-page chapter \"'Food .fads and. -faHaeies\" by NCAHF President\u00b7 William Jarvis. 1 QUESTION~BLE ARTHRITIS TREATMENTS REVIEWED Donna J. Hawley, MN, EdD, Associate Professor of Nursing, Wichita State U. reviews a wide range of uoconventional approaches to arthritis in her article ''Nontraditlonal treatments of arthritis\" piJblisned in NURSING CLINICS OF \u00b7 NORTH AMERICA, 19:663'671, December, 1984. Unfortunately, Hawley misuses im\u00ad portant terms like ''nontraditional'' and ''quackery,\" and exhibits a limited underst~ndlng of the \"placebo effect.\" However, the substance of the article is . extremely good and will be of value to anyone wishing to improve their understanding of arthritis quackery and related issues. NORWEGIANS LEARN A LESSON ABOUT QUACKERY The Norwegian Consumer Om\u00ad buesman sought to forNfy citizens against health fraud by placing a hypothetical example of a phony ad which contained features that should tip them off to quackery. The ad read: NEW FROM USA! LURIUM 300X (LURIUM back thel.r '.hair! Makes you sum in a hurry! Cures most disease! Removes wrinkles! Makes your car use 15-20% less gas! ORDER TODAY! The ad then went on to give points to consumers about when to be skeptical about adver\u00ad tising. However, many people only saw the portion of the ad making the dramatic promises. Close. to 300 people ordered the miracle bottle at $15 apiece! (From an unidentified Swedish newspaper, cir\u00ad ca October, 1985). Is this a lesson is hurnan gullibility or does it tell us something about human desperation? It's too easy to stop with the humorous side of this experience without recognJzing that people are exploitable by quackery in the same manner as lonely people make good marks for con men feigning friendship. There are laws against fraud and false advertising, but it seems like the basis for them has to be relearned again and again. PSORIASIS According to a brief report in PHAR\u00ad MACI.ST'S LETTER 1:6, December, 1985, reserach in Norway on . 1:5,000 victims turned up no evidence that life style or diet were a cause of psoriasis. \"DR. BERGER'S IMMUNE POWER DIET\" BOOK-BAD! Jean Mayer, nutrition expert and Pres.i\u00ad dent of Tufts University says, \"It is my hope that no ft/ture graduate of the Tufts medical school will exhibit as ltWe knowledge of nutrition as does Dr. Berger in his book.\" Berger is a psychiatrist who studied at Tufts and Harvard. Berger's er\u00ad rors include the claims that Americans are suffering from \"alarming vitamin shor\u00ad tages\" and that \"most people have hid\u00ad den food sensitivities to the very foods that appear most nourishing and healthy\" thus impairing the immune system. The book proposes two remedies: the elimina\u00ad tion diet which purports to eliminate tne ''Sinister Seven'' foods the authot feels have caused 85% of the reactions he has seen in patients; and, rebuilding the im\u00ad mune system defenses with megadoses of vitamins, minerals and amino acids. Berger also pr<>motes unneeded and fraudulent substances\u00b7 such as PABA, bioflavonolds and \"vitamin 8-15.\" For a copy of Dr. Mayer's review of Berger's book send a stamped, self~addressed envelope to NCAHF. Ask for \"Tough To Swallow!\" 3 PROFLUORIDATION AND .

MALPRACTICE JUDGEMENT IN CANCER CASE Manhattan physician Emmanuel Revici's medical license was suspended for 60. days in 1983 on the i;irounds that the 87-year-old physician Mad fraudulently promised to cure cancer and that his medically unapproved treatments posed an immediate danger to his patients (NY TIMES, Dec, 29, 1983). In late November of this year Revici was sued for malprac\u00ad tice by a woman whose breast cancer went from a time when it could have been treated with a simple lumpectomy to the point that bilateral radjcal mastectorny was required. The jury award the plaintiff $1 million but the judge halved the amount on the basis thatthe plaintiff had been advised by other physicians to have the simpler operation but had chosen to ignore their advice and place herself in Revici'.s care. RETINOIC ACID EMBRYOPATHY Retinoic acids are analogues of vitamin A which cannot replace the visual or reproductive functions of vitamin A but can assume its roles in stimulating bone growth and epithelial differentiation. Although less toxic than vitamin A, retinoic acids are known to produce birth delects in animals and has been im\u00ad plicated in a few clinical case reprots in\u00ad volving humans. A study of the possible relati.onship between retinoic acid and birth defects in 154 people taking isotreti\u00ad noin, a retlnold prescribed for severe acne, identified a characteristic pattern of malformation. These findings have im, portant implications for those who idolize nutrition-related substances in preference to other types of \"drugs.\" See Lammer, et al, ''Retinoic acid embryopathy,\" NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE, 313:837-841, WHY NCAHF OPPOSES HR \u00a21!Jngre$smen t~r HR 2- which would 1.11:ileralrze the law en makirng healtfll claims f.or fQed products. \u00b7 medicine or herti>al' drugs, laetrile; and other specious items. off as foods, NHi= has.pledgeditselfto the passage of thi.s leg,fslation no Utah, Larry E.

At the October, 1985 Board of Directors meeting, it was voted that a Task Force on Consumer Activism be formed that would develop a \"how to\" manual for use by local chapters and divisions listing and describing specific activities for use in combatting health fraud, misinformation and quackery. WaJlace I. Sampson, MD, 515 South Drive, Suite 10, Mt. View, CA 94040 was named as the task force coordinator. Anyone interested in serving on this.task force should send a resume to Dr. Sampson. He will select task force members, assign task~, compile and distribute results, and serve as spokesperson for the group. If you have some specific contribution to make or special expertise related to such an effort, please make it known to Dr. Sampson. Members will no doubt be pleased to know that Dr. Sampson is not starting from scratch on this important project. He has been very effective in local anti-health fraud activities in his area and is a key person in the California Medical Association's Division of Scientific & Educational Activities. ANNOUNCEMENT: ANNUAL MEETING DATE CHANGE According to the NCAHF bylaws, the Annual Meeting is to be automatically held on the second Thursday of February each year unless announced otherwise at least 30 days prior to the meeting. In 1986, the date for the Annual Meeting of NCAHF is changed to Friday, February 14. AFDO PALNS HEALTH FRAUD ACTION TEAMS ----- --- --- --. --- The Association of Food and Drug Officials (AFDO) is an organization made up of state and federal leaders in food and drug. AFDO has outlined a plan for establishing \"Health Fraud Surveillance and Action Teams\" (HFSAT), inviting all consumer protection organizations to implement and actively participate in the recommended program. Under the plan, HFSATs would review information on suspected health fraud products collected by participating agencies and non-goevernment units to determine which were obvious fraud, probable, questionable and not actionable. Degree of risk to consumers would also be a factor in which items would command a comprehensive remedial program. (From a report in FOOD CHEMICAL NEWS, 12/2/1985, p.35). WHAT DOES NCAHF MEMBERSHIP PERMIT? ------ Recently, at the trial of a \u00b7cancer quack, a member of NCAHF testified in favor of the defendant claiming, to be an expert on health fraud based upon his membership in NCAHF. His testimony was quickly refuted by a NCAHF Director who was also testifying in the case--against the defendant. This incident raises two important points. First, some people join NCAHF who, despite their signing that they support its beliefs and purposes, are antagonistic toward consumer protection and scientific discipline. The membership committee cannot possibly screen out such people until they haye exposed themselves. Second, due to the sensitive nature of combatting health fraud, it is important that not just anyone speak as representatives of the Council. It is stated in the bylaws in Article V, Section 8: \"The only persons who may speak for the Council are the Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and others specifically designated by action of the Board of Directors.\" For these reasons, a qualifying statement will appear on future applications stating: \"Membership '\u00ad does not qualify a person to advertise themselves, as a representative of NCAHF or claim special expertise.\" Hopefully, this will be sufficient ~o discourage abuse. If not, a stronger statement may be needed. We realize that those with ill-will are impossible to control, but this statement does provide a basis for challenging misuse. SEND THE NEWSLETTER TO LEGISLATORS One way to make your state . and national legislators more aware of health fraud is to send them the NCAHF NEWSLETTER. You may either order a gift membership for them, send a donation to cover the cost (use a regular $15 membership fee as a guide), or plead for NCAHF to send the newsletter free--we have a limited number of complimentary recipients but must feel that such charity is justified--since it would be impossible for NCAHF to send the newsletter to all legislators. You may wish to at least send the newsletter to members of the health committees of your legislatures. ABOUT THOSE DOCTORS ENDORSING HERBALIFE You may have \u00b7seen Herbalife ads featuring testimonials by physicians extolling Herbalife products. Needless to say, NCAHF looks unfavorably upon health professionals who use their credentials to promote products--especially when it is nearly a certainty that they are part of a multi-level marketing scheme. NCAHF President Jarvis has dubbed such individuals \"Office Entrepreneurs\" and questions the propriety of using the unequal influence inherent in the doctor/patient relationship in this way. What's more in the case of the Herbalife ads is that at least one of the doctors quoted is well known to NCAHF as a bad actor. We wonder about the others as well and would like NCAHF members to inform. -us -rf-any \u00b7others are . of questionable reputation a~ well. THEY ARE: Richard Basford, MD, Beverly Hill, CA William Bernard, MD, Lafayetter, LA Irving M. Blatt, MD, Metaire, LA James F. Bradley, Jr, MD, Jonesboro, AR John E.

Harewood, MD, Brooklyn, NY Richard A. Joseph, MD Naperville, IL Edmund J. King, MD, Wethersfield, CT \"'-, Roy Kupsinel, MD, Oviedo, Nederland, TX To be fair, NCAHF would also be interested in positive comments anyone can offer about any of these doctors. FDA CLARIFIES POSiTION ON HERBALIFE DEATHS In a TALK PAPER dated October 16, 1985, the FDA has stated that there is no evidence 'to connect Herbaltte-- directly -to fatalities -\u00b7previously reported to have been connected to\u00b7 Herbalife products. As for complaints about minor adverse reactions, FDA states that these could be due to a number of factors including diet change or the pharmacological reaction of herbs in the products, however, the concentrations of these herbs at recommended dosage levels would not be anticipated to produce such reactions. All press inquiries should be directed to Jack Martin at the FDA Press Office (301)443-4177. INFORMATION SOUGHT ON INTIMIDATION LAWSUITS Professor George W. Pring, of the University of Denver College of Law, is concerned about the potential chilling effect of \"intimidation lawsuits\" brought against citizen action groups and individuals as a means of preventing citizen participation in governmental decision-making processes. According to an article in the July 22, 1985 NATIONAL LAW JOURNAL, (p.16). Prof. Pring wishes to document cases where people have been sued because of their involvement in government proceedings on zoning, civil rights, civic improvement, envi ronmenta 1 p\u00b7rotecti on, public works, consumer fraud or official misconduct.
