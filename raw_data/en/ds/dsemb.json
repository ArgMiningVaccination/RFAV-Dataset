Today, after billions of vaccinations have been administered worldwide, there are many new findings as regards ad verse reactions to COVID - 19 vaccines. One signal noted internationally is the onset of pericarditis/myocarditis following vaccination with mRNA vaccines. Three articles in this issue of Swissmedic Vigilance News deal with this topic: One covers reporting rates of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following pri- mary and booster vaccinations with COVID -19 mRNA vaccines in Switzerland, while another looks at the risk of myocarditis following COVID -19 vaccination in children aged 5 -11 years. A case report concerns a successful re -ex- posure with COVID -19 mRNA vaccine at a re- duced dose in a patient with a history of clini-cally suspected pericarditis/myocarditis follow- ing the first dose of COVID -19 vaccine. There are few examples of other signals in the literature, mea ning spontaneous individual re- ports and case reports play a major role in re- cording and evaluating these previously un- known, rare AEFI in pharmacovigilance data- bases. Other articles in this issue concern the on- set of persistent headaches, thromboembolic events and multiple sclerosis or MS relapses fol- lowing vaccination with COVID -19 vaccines. The AEFI recorded by Swissmedic are analysed and evaluated using a range of methods to de- tect potential signals. An article on signal detec- tion using disproportionalit y analysis gives in- sights into this process, while another explains the use of \"observed versus expected analyses\" in post -marketing surveillance of COVID -19 vac- cines. Once a signal has been confirmed, appropriate risk mitigation measures are introduced. Modi- fication of the i nformation for healthcare pro- fessionals and/or patient information is usually necessary. The following pages contain an over- view of updates for the COVID -19 (COVID -19 vaccine (Ad26.COV2- S [recombinant]). As yet, there is no correspond-ing overview for the CO VID-19 vaccine Nuvaxovid , which was authorised in April 2022. Although the focus of pharmacovigilance ef- forts is currently on the COVID -19 vaccines, sig- nals for other active substances are, of course, also being monitored. The case report \"Unex- pected cause of aphthous ulcers, diarrhoea and thrombocytopenia in a patient with COVID -19 vaccine breakthrough infection\" recalls the is- sue of different methotrexate dosages. The article on advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), in particular CAR -T cell (chi- meri c antigen receptor T cell) therapies, demon- strates yet another aspect of vigilance. We hope you find this issue a stimulating and interesting read. Eva Eyal Pharmacist and editor of Swissmedic Vigilance News Safety of Medicines division, Swissmedic Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 4 | 43 Drug safety and signals : COVID -19 vaccines COVID -19 vaccines: tabular overview of changes to warnings and adverse reactions in the Information for health - care professionals To date, four vaccines have been authorised in Switzerland for vaccination against the novel and Nuvaxovid (12.04.2022). These vaccines were already being very widely used shortly after launch as part of the global vaccination campaign to combat the COVID -19 pandemic. Thanks to this spe- cial starting situation, further knowledge of the safety profiles of these vaccines, such as very rare adverse effects, was obtained rap-idly after authorisation. Inflammation of the heart muscle or pericardium in connection with the mRNA vaccines is one example of such adverse effects that were not observed during the authorisati on studies. When indi- cations of previously unknown risks are sub-sequently confirmed, the information for healthcare professionals (and if necessary the vaccine recommendations) are revised accordingly. The following table gives an overview of the changes t hat have been made to the \"Warnings\" and \"Adverse reac- tions\" sections of the information for healthcare professionals for the first three COVID -19 vaccines authorised. The following table is 1 % vs. 0 ,8 %) beobachtet, verglichen mit Te ilnehmenden, die Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 5 | 43 Medizinische Fachkr\u00e4fte sollten als auf Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 6 | 43 COVID auf mit in der 2022 7 | 43 Thrombose mit Thrombozytopenie nach Edition 28 - May 2022 8 | 43 Reporting rates of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following basis and booster vaccinations with COVID -19 mRNA vaccines in Switzerland Valeriu Toma, MD Safety of Medicines division, Swissmedic Here, we present an interim assessment of local reporting rates of myocarditis and/or pericarditis cases received by Swissmedic fol- lowing booster immunisation (3rd with mRNA vaccines. Although the COVID -19 im- munisation programme is still ongoing, the number of vaccinations administered has vis-ibly stabilised over recent weeks at national level, and hence the present estimates will most likely not change considerably towards the end of the vaccination campaign. By 12 March 2022, Swissmedic had received 34 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis in re-lation to a booster vaccination against COVID -19. According to vaccination figures provided by the FOPH/BAG (1) , approx. 3.61 million boosters have been administered i n Switzerland so far, which results in an overall reporting rate of 9.4 cases of myocardi- tis/pericarditis per million booster doses of mRNA vaccines. Of these 34 cases, 18 were reported in association with Spikevax \u00ae (with 2.13 million booster doses adminis tered) and 16 for Comirnaty\u00ae (1.48 million booster doses). These figures result in reporting rates of 8.4 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis per million booster doses of Spikevax and 10.8 cases per million booster doses of Comirnaty. By 8 March 2022, 377 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis with a suspected link to mRNA vaccinations had been reported in Switzerland (3). Of these, 338 cases occurred in relation to approx. 12 million basis vaccine doses (1 st/2nd dose), resulting in an overall re- porting rat e of 28.2 cases per million basis doses. Hence, the currently assessed report-ing rate of myocarditis/pericarditis following booster vaccination (approx. 9.4 cases per million) is 3 times lower than the overall re-porting rate following basis vaccination doses (28.2 cases per million). With regard to the main mRNA vaccines cur- rently in use in Switzerland, the following data trends are currently apparent. For Spikevax, 266 myocarditis/pericarditis cases had been recorded by 8 March 2022 following 7.65 million basis vaccine doses (1 st/2nd dose) administered, resulting in a re- porting rate of 34.8 cases per million basis doses of Spikevax. This was > 4 times higher compared to the currently observed report-ing rate of 8.4 cases for Spikevax booster (see above). Of all cases recorded by 8 March 2022, 71 were reported in relation to Comirnaty, out of 4.31 million basis doses (1 st/2nd dose), re- sulting in a reporting rate of approx.16.5 cases per million basis doses. The reporting rate of myocarditis/pericarditis for Co- mirnaty booster was 10.8 reports per million doses (see above) and thus lower compared to basis doses. Table 1. Estimated reporting rates following mRNA COVID- 19 vaccination, by vaccination dose and gender Vaccine dose Reporting rate estimates myocarditis/per icarditis per 1 ,000,000 doses Female Male Cormirnaty 1st/2nd 9.8 21.4 Comirnaty booster 9.5 12.2 Spikevax 1st/2nd 14.7 53.9 Spikevax booster 3.7 13.1 Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 9 | 43 The gender distribution (Table 1) shows higher reporting rates in males, particularly for basis vaccine doses (1st/2nd), which is con- sistent with data from previous pharmaco - epidemiological studies (e.g. Ref. 2) . The Spikevax booster shows lower reporting rates of myocarditis/pericarditis in both males and females. The current reporting rates of myocardi-tis/pericarditis per million doses following booster vaccination are rather similar for Spikevax (8.4 cases) and Comirnaty (10.8 cases). However, the decline in reporting rates following booster vaccinations as com-pared with basis doses (1 st/2nd dose) is more prominent (> 4 times) for Spikevax. There are several possible causes for this observa- tion. Firstly, the booster dose of Spikevax contains only half of the amount of the basis vaccine dose, i.e. 50 \u00b5g mRNA, which may possibly result in reduced incidence rates of various adverse reactions, including myocarditis/ pericarditis. In addition, national and international safety data have shown that inflammation of the heart muscle and heart sac in persons under 30 years of age was observed more frequently with Spikevax than with Co- mirnaty (3).The Swiss Federal Commission for Vaccination (FCV/EKIF) has subsequently reviewed the national vaccination recom- mendation for mRNA vaccines against COVID -19 (4), and only Comirnaty is cur- rently recommended for use in persons be-low 30 years of age. Indeed, although re-porting figures in particular age groups are still rather low for conclusive assessments, only a very small number of myocarditis/per- icarditis cases was recorded in persons under 30 years following Spikevax booster. Furthermore, general reporting awareness as regards myocarditis/pericarditis may have decreased in Switzerland during the booster vaccination campaign. Although comparisons of spontaneous re- porting rates for different vaccine doses at different time points during the vaccination campaign should be made with caution, there is currently no evidence that myocardi- tis/pericarditis is more frequent after booster vaccinations. Our data suggest that they could possibly occur less often than after the first two vaccination doses.

These have oc- curred particularly in young males and more frequently after the second dose of vaccine. Since data on the course after re- exposure to a second dose of a COVID -19 mRNA vaccine following an episode of pericarditi s/myocar- ditis in connection with COVID -19 mRNA vaccination are almost non- existent, specific recommendations for action in this situation are lacking. We report here on the re- expo- sure to a COVID -19 mRNA vaccine (tozinam- eran, Comirnaty \u00ae) at a reduced dosage (10 \u00b5g) in a male patient with a history of clinically suspected pericarditis/myocarditis connected with the first dose (elasomeran, Spikevax\u00ae). Case narrative A man who was 24 -years -old at the time of the suspected ADR was actively immunised in the spring of 2021 against SARS -CoV-2-in- duced COVID -19 for \u00ae, COVID -19 mRNA vaccine from Moderna). The patient had a history of asthma, hay fever and allergies to various foods and latex. For these conditions the patient took medication as required with formoterol / budesonide and cetirizine. After the vaccination (with a latency period of approx. 5 hours), he experienced swelling at the injection site. On the following day, the patient suffered fever, for which he took paracetamol, and shortly thereafter pre- sented himself at an emergency department with palpitations and a resting pulse of 140/minute, although he was discharged home on the same day after an ECG showed normal findings. On the second day after the vaccination, he experienced aggravated symptoms of dyspnoea and chest pains re-lated to exertion, position and respiration, which prompted his readmission to hospital. Laborator y tests showed elevated inflamma- tory parameters (CRP maximum: 63 mg/L), a dynamic troponin profile (peak: 28 and normal D -dimer levels (259 \u00b5g/L, reference value: < 500 \u00b5g/L). The electrocardiogram recorded a sinus rhythm with a normal heart rate without re- /depolarisation abnormali- ties and with lateral PQ -segment depressions (V5/V6). With typical symptoms and mini- mally elevated cardiac enzymes over time, the patient was assumed to be suffering from pericarditis/myocarditis in connection with COVID -19 mRNA vaccination, while a vi- ral origin was considered in the differential diagnosis (although there had been no symptoms of a viral infection before the vac-cination). Treatment was started with colchi-cine and ibuprofen. This produced a positive outcome wi thin a few days, and the patient could be discharged home in an improved general condition. However, the patient's subsequent recovery was slow, and he was unable to work at all for approx. 8 weeks. In June 2021, a blood sample tested negative for anti -nucleocapsid IgG, which suggested that the patient had not experienced a COVID infection as a trigger overlapping with the vaccination. Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 11 | 43 At the patient's request, and following a comprehensive discussion of the risk of a fur- ther episode of pericarditis/myocard itis asso- ciated with re -exposure to a second dose of a COVID -19 mRNA vaccine, he was given a reduced dose (10 \u00b5g instead of 30 \u00b5g) of the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine tozinameran (Co- mirnaty \u00ae) at the start of 2022. This dose was well tolerated by the patient, who merely re- ported pain at the injection site and tired- ness, and otherwise experienced no further side effects and no fever. One month after the 10 \u00b5g dose of tozinameran, since the pa- tient showed a very high SARS -CoV-2-IgG anti-spike (> 400 AU/ ml resp. > 1040 BAU/ml), no further administration of a reduced dosage is currently planned. In the spring of 2022, the patient suffered a COVID -19 infection with a moderate but self-limiting course without hospitalisation (three days of fever above 39\u00b0C, feeling very ill with headaches, coughing, sore throat, tiredness and exhaustion). Discussion At the start of the major vaccination cam-paigns (starting in Switzerland in January 2021, beginning with the defined risk groups as per the national vaccination s trat- egy (1)), pericarditis/myocarditis was not a known adverse drug reaction (ADR) to COVID -19 mRNA vaccines. Cases of pericardi- tis/myocarditis mRNA vaccinations were subse- quently observed (2 -4). After an evaluation of the data available at the time, in August 2021 Swissmedic reported a possible connec-tion between mRNA COVID -19 vaccination and the onset of pericarditis/myocarditis (5). Most of the cases occurred within 14 days of the vaccination, more frequently after the second dose and in young men (5) . The Swiss Information for healthcare professionals for Spikevax \u00ae (Moderna) and Comirnaty\u00ae (Pfizer) was revised accordingly. Chest pain, shortness of breath and palpitations were also listed as symptoms potentially indicative of pericarditis or myocarditis in the \" Warn- ings and precautions \" section (6). The case report described here concerns a male patient with clinically possible pericar- ditis/myocarditis (7) but not with a probable or confirmed myocarditis diagnosis accord-ing to the CDC criteria, which are listed in Table 1 (8) . Table 1. Classification of the probability of myocarditis diagnosis according to CDC cri-teria (8) Myocarditis diagnosis probable Myocarditis diagnosis confirmed 1.

Abnormal testing Biopsy Elevated Troponin AND MRI findings consistent with myocarditis 3. No other identified cause 3. No other identified cause The precise mechanism explaining how peri- carditis/myocarditis might occur after COVID -19 mRNA vaccination is not known (9). Various hypotheses, including a hyperim- mune/inflammatory response, autoim mun- ity and delayed hypersensitivity, are cur-rently under discussion (9). Exper ts recommend that, until further safety data are available, those who develop peri-carditis/myocarditis after mRNA COVID -19 vaccination should not receive any further Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 12 | 43 dose of a COVID -19 vaccine (10) . If, after a risk assessment, the de cision is made to ad- minister a further dose of a COVID -19 vac- cine, the pericarditis/myocarditis episode must at least have completely regressed be- forehand (10). For men aged 18 and over who opt for a further dose of COVID -19 vac- cine, some experts recommend the use of the COVID -19 vaccine from Janssen instead of the COVID -19 mRNA vaccines, although the increased risk of \"thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome\" should be taken into account (10) . It has also been rec- ommended that those who have experi- enced a confirmed episode of pericardi-tis/myocarditis should receive, after being in-formed of the corresponding risks, a second dose of the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine from Pfizer (Comirnaty \u00ae), since the rate of re- ported cas es of pericarditis/myocarditis is slightly lower for this vaccine than for the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine from Moderna (Spikevax \u00ae) (11). Little information is available in the litera-ture on re- exposure to a COVID -19 mRNA vaccine after an episode of pericarditis/myo- carditis following an earlier COVID -19 vac- cination. There are reports of individual pa-tients who reacted with a further episode of pericarditis/myocarditis following a second vaccination (12) but also of two patients who received a second dose of vaccine after experiencing myocarditis without the reap-pearance of symptoms (13). An analysis from Canada (article not yet peer -reviewed/pub- lished, Public Health Ontario) showed evi-dence suggesting that the risk of pericardi-tis/myocarditis is reduced with a longer in-terval between the vaccine doses (14) . Conclusion Reports of ADR during the pos t-marketing phase are extremely important for drug safety. Well -documented courses following re-exposure would be a great help in clinical decision- making in respect of the repeat ad- ministration of a vaccine or medicine to a pa- tient after a previous advers e reaction. Un- fortunately, such data are not recorded sys- tematically. Additional data, ideally col- lected systematically, are urgently needed in order to better evaluate the safety of re- ex- posure to a COVID -19 mRNA vaccine after an episode of pericarditis/m yocarditis. The in- terval between the preceding vaccine dose or adverse reaction and the re -exposure, the selected vaccine and its dosage for re- expo- sure are of particular interest. A comparison of cases with positive and negative rechal-lenges after re- expo sure to a COVID -19 mRNA vaccine would facilitate the risk as- sessment for a re -exposure in an individual patient. Until further safety data are available, an in- dividual risk assessment should be carried out for patients who have developed peri- carditis/myoca rditis following COVID -19 vac- cination before a further dose of a COVID -19 vaccine is administered. However, this is pos- sible only to a limited extent because of the lack of data. For example, if the decision is taken to give a further vaccine dose to some-one with a high personal risk of experienc- ing severe COVID -19, the considerations de- scribed above should be taken into account. Although clear dose dependence is not ap- parent for many adverse reactions, in the case described here a reduced dosage (10 \u00b5g) wa s administered after a prolonged in- terval (8 instead of 6 months) and was toler-ated by the patient without the recurrence of symptoms. Whether a reduced vaccine dose for subsequent injections is beneficial generally in these situations cannot be de-termined on the basis of this single case re- port. If a reduced vaccine dose is adminis- tered, the immune response should subse- quently be monitored by measuring the an-tibody titres. Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 13 | 43 Reporting adverse reactions For reporting adverse drug reactions (ADR), Swissmedic r ecommends the use of its own reporting portal developed specifically for this purpose (Electronic Vigilance System, ElViS).

Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 14 | 43 COVID -19 vaccination for children aged 5-11 years; low risk of serious vacci - nation reactions such as myocarditis or seizures Thomas Schwartz , MD Safety of Medicines division, Swissmedic On 29 October 2021 the Food and Drug Ad- ministration (FDA) extended the emergency authorisation for the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine for chil- dren aged 5 -11 years. Between 3 November and 19 December 2021, approximately 8.7 million doses of the COVID -19 vaccine from Pfizer -BioNTech were administered to children aged 5-11 years in the USA. During that period, no other vaccines were authorised for this age group. In the same period, the U S database system VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System), which is operated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , re- ceived 4,249 reports of adverse events fol-lowing vaccinations in this age group, which were analysed by CDC staff (1). In total, 4,149 (97.6%) of the VAERS reports related to non- serious events and 100 (2.4%) to seri- ous events. The most commonly reported disorders and diagnostic findings among the 100 reports of serious adverse events were fever (29; 29.0%), vomiting (21; 21.0%) and elevated troponin levels (15; 15.0%). The latter is indicative of myocarditis which, following COVID -19 vaccination, has ap- peared most frequently in male vaccine re- cipients aged 12-29 years (2). Of the 11 con- firmed cases of myocarditis in the 5 -11 years age group, seven children had recovered by the time of reporting while four were in the recovery phase. Of the ten high -severity reports concerning seizures, two children had a febrile seizure, one child had a history of seizures, two chil-dren were believed to be developing a pos- sible convulsive disorder and five suffered a first- time onset of seizures. VAERS received two reports of fatalities dur-ing the evaluation period. These concerned two female children aged 5 and 6 years, both of whom had a complicated medical history and had already been in a critical condition prior to vaccination. According to the authors, the data available did not point to any causal link between death and vac- cination. These results confirm the good tolerability of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine in children aged 5-11 years, as already evident in the study reviewed for the authorisation and in an earlier evaluation of the US VAERS database (3, 4) . In Switzerland, Comirnaty \u00ae has been tempo- rarily authorised for the vaccination of chil-dren aged 5-11 years since 10 December 2021. To date, Swissmedic has received 12 re- ports of adverse events from approximately 83,000 administered doses of Comirnaty \u00ae in this age gr oup (as at 24 March 2022). Eight reports were non- serious while four were se- rious. In the latte r cases, the following vac- cination reactions were reported: abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, loss of con- sciousness, febrile seizure, fatigue and head- ache.

The Pharma- covigilance Unit of the Safety of Medicines division has received reports connected with Comirnaty and Spikevax from patients who experienced persistent headaches, some-times occurring daily, a fter receiving COVID - 19 vaccination with an mRNA vaccine. In some cases these had still not subsided after several weeks and, on the whole, responded poorly to analgesic medication. Neurological investigations did not usually reveal any finding that could have been explained as the cause. In some cases these persistent headaches oc- curred in patients who had almost never pre- viously suffered from headaches in their life. As at 9 November 2021, 16 cases of persis- tent headache with symptoms lasting for at least four weeks and for which no clear cause could be found by neurological inves- tigation had been identified. The patients were vaccinated with Spikevax in 13 cases and Comirnaty in three cases. Five cases oc- curred after the first dose of the vaccine and 11 cases after the second. The headaches af- fected 11 women aged between 26 and 63 and five men aged between 17 and 54. The average age in all 16 cases was 41.5 years. Most of the cases (n=13) were reported di- rectly by the affected patients, while three cases w ere reported by healthcare profes- sionals. In all 16 patients the headaches were still present at the time of the report. To in- vestigate the symptoms, MRI scans of the head were carried out in ten patients, and a lumbar puncture was additionally per- formed i n four cases, but none of these showed any indicative findings. Painkill ers administered were but i n most cases these only pro- duced slight pain relief. I n two cases the per- sistent headaches were treated with mor-phine preparations. As representative examples, two patient case reports are described below. First case report Middle -aged woman, second dose of Spikevax: \"On the day after the vaccination I experi- enced severe, dull, crushing headaches across my forehead and down the side. These remained constant and no painkillers worked. A visit to the doctor after two weeks did not find anything. My condition then deteriorated: flashes in my head - I felt as if I were electrified and was unable to sleep for several nights. A few days later I underwent investigations in the Neurology department of a cantonal hospital. Nothing was found. I was prescribed a cocktail of painkillers over two days. The headaches have not disappeared, and I occasionally also have a burning headache across my scalp, but that is not constant. The dull, crushing pain has persisted for four weeks now. The headache is different from ones that I've had in the past, and it's always there. I've never had any problems to date with migraine or similar conditions. My doctor is unable to ex- plain the headaches. My quality of life is se- riously impaired and I had not had any health problems before. \" Second case report Younger woman, second dose of Comirnaty : \"Onset three hours after the second injec- tion: nosebleed, headaches, dizziness. The Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 17 | 43 headaches persisted from then on (six weeks) and became more intense from week to week (most recently a 9 on the pain scale). As a result, I was unable to work at all. Nor-mal analgesics (combination of Irfen [ibu- profen], Dafalgan and Novalgin) provided no, or only minimal, pain relief. Pain relief could only be achieved with tramadol in ad-dition to the painkillers mentioned above. Increasing sensitivity to light and noise. Head MRI and lumbar puncture were nor- mal.\" Conclusion Isolated reports received via t he spontane- ous reporting system indicate that the known and common side effect of \" head- ache\" can persist for a prolonged period in individual cases, requiring further diagnostic investigation and treatment. A new meta -analysis of headache after vac- cination against COVID -19 shows that head- ache represents the third most common ad- verse event, occurring in 22% and 29%, re- spectively, of vaccinated individuals after the first and second doses, although it also oc-curred in 10% to 12% of those receiving pla- cebo (1). However, no evidence of cases of persistent headaches can be found, either in this meta -analysis or in the rest of the litera- ture currently available to us. New -onset persistent headache has a consid- erable negative impact on the quality of life of the sufferers. Whether a causal connec- tion with the administered vaccinations ex- ists, and how such a connection can be ex-plained in pathophysiological terms, cannot be conclusively determined at this time. The described observations from the spontane-ous report s have not been confirmed to date by published investigations. The new onset of headaches that persist for prolonged pe- riods will continue to be monitored closely in connection with the monitoring of the safety profile of COVID -19 vaccines.

A slightly elevated risk of thromboembolic events has been confirmed for adenovirus vector -based vaccines ( 1-4), but a causal link with mRNA vacc ines has yet to be estab- lished. Methods We analysed cases of thromboembolic events reported in 2021 to the Geneva Re- gional Pharmacovigilance Centre (RPVC) and reviewed the scientific literature on the sub-ject. Resul ts In 2021, the Geneva RPVC received 300 re- ports of adverse drug reactions associated with COVID -19 vaccines, 22 of which in- volved thromboembolic events. The majority of cases concerned women (n=14, 64%) with an average age of 76. The men were younger, wit h an average age of 48. The commonest thromboembolic events were pulmonary embolism (8 cases) and deep vein thrombosis (5 cases). Onset occurred after an average of 13 days (ranging from 1 to 44 days), while the majority of events (n=17, 77%) occurred within three weeks following vaccination. In 19 of the 22 cases of throm-boembolic events following administration of an mRNA vaccine, at least one risk factor was present. By way of comparison, the total number of reports submitted in Switzerland for the same terms and same period was 392. Table 1.

Some medicines regulatory agencies, includ- ing ANSM (the French national medicines safety agency), Swissmedic, or Singapore's HSA, are currently monitoring thromboem- bolic events, particularly cases of cerebral ve- nous sinus thrombosis associated with the Com irnaty and Spikevax vaccines and sys- temic ANCA- associated vasculitis associated with the Spikevax vaccine (6) . Two cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis were re-ported to the Geneva RPVC in 2021: Case no. 1: A 52 -year-old woman with a his- tory of disc herniation with sciatica which had been treated with dexamethasone for 12 days. Eighteen days after receiving her first dose of the Comirnaty \u00ae vaccine, she at- tended the emergency department after an episode of nausea, vomiting, confusion, and right -sided neck pain. She was given a brain Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 20 | 43 scan, the results of w hich were described as normal, and returned home. Three days later, she presented with sensory ataxia of her right arm, apraxia, and optic ataxia. She had two generalised tonic -clonic seizures in the emergency department. A cerebral angi-ogram identified ce rebral venous sinus thrombosis of the right superior sagittal si-nus, extending to the right internal jugular vein with haematoma in the left parietal area, haemorrhagic transfor- mation of the lower left parietal area and signs of venous stasis. While she was in the hospital, hormonal, inflammatory, infec- tious, and neoplastic causes were ruled out. Thrombophilia screening was negative, but the family history included pulmonary em- bolism with a fatal outcome in the patient's father. The patient was put on curative anti- coagulation for a minimum of three months. Her symptoms improved gradually while she was in hospital. Case no 2: A 50 -year-old man with a history of left fronto -parietal grade III anaplastic as- trocytoma for which he had received radio- therapy and chemotherapy and with a his- tory of treated secondary epilepsy. The day after receiving his second dose of Spikevax \u00ae, he presented with slight paresis of the lower right face, slight aphasia, and moderate dys-arthria. A cerebral MRI scan revealed sub- acute venous thrombosis of the left trans- verse and sigmoid sinuses extending to the root of the left internal jugular vein. The pa- tient's history included very frequent and painful headaches for two weeks and an in-crease in the number of epileptic seizures. No personal or family history of venous thromboembolic disease was reported. The patient was put on long- term curative anti- coagulation in response to his suspected paraneoplastic coagulant state. His clinical progress was positive, with neurological nor-malisation and a distinct decrease in head-aches. Discussion Several case reports of thromboembolic events have been published since mRNA COVID -19 vaccines were first launched (7 - 11), but none has established a causal link with the vaccines. Several case -control stud- ies have been conducted to assess this poten- tial association. Thus, adverse events such as cerebral venous thrombosis, myocar-dial thrombocytopenia syndrome were investi gated in a recent US study of 6.2 million individuals (average age 49, 54% women) who had received an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. The incidence of these events in the period up to the 21st day following vaccination (regarded as the risk period) was not signific antly higher than the incidence in the period from 22 to 44 days after vaccination (control period) (12) . A national -scale study in France of people aged 75 and over who had received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine evaluated the rela- tive CVA, and pulmo- nary embolism. No evidence was found of an increased risk of these adverse events in the 14 days following the first or second dose of the vaccine (13) . In January 2022, the same group of Fr ench pharmaco- epidemiology ex- perts (EPI -PHARE) published a second study, which set out to evaluate the short -term risk of acute myocardial infarction, haemor-rhagic or ischaemic CVA, ChAdOx1 nCoV -19 vaccines in subjects aged between 18 and 74. This study investigated a population of more than 46 million sub-jects, from which every individual who had experienced a severe cardiovascular event needing hospital admission was i ncluded. The incidence of the different events did not differ significantly between the three weeks Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 21 | 43 following the first, second or third dose of mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 and mRNA -1273) and the reference periods (4 ). Finally, an Israeli study of nearly 900,000 sub-jects who had received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and a control group with the same number of subjects did not find any in-creased risk of cerebrovascular events in the 42 days following vaccination (21 days after the first dose of vaccine plus 21 days after the second) (14) . However, BNT162b2 was strongly associated with a risk of myocardi- tis, lymphadenopathy, appendicitis, and her- pes zoster infection. This same article also presented the data of a 173,106- person co- hort (average age 34, 54% women) who had been infected with SARS -CoV-2. Notably, SARS -CoV-2 infection increased the risk of presenting myocarditis and pericarditis, re- nal failure or arrhythmia, as well as throm- boembolic events such as pulmonary in- farction and intracranial haemorrhage. Conclusion The case- control studies published to date show no evidence of an increased short -term risk of thromboembolic events following ad- ministration of mR NA COVID -19 vaccines. The risk of thromboembolic events is greater and potentially longer -lasting following SARS -CoV-2 infection. Thus, despite sponta- neous reports of post -vaccination thrombo- embolic events, the benefits of using mRNA vaccines largely outwe igh the risks.

Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 23 | 43 Multiple sclerosis and COVI ment of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Univer- sity Hospital Zurich, Switzerland Introduction Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progres- sive neurological disease in which, on the one hand, an autoimmune response leads to demyelination and, on the other, genetically related dysmyelination can occur in the cen-tral nervous system (CNS). A distincti on is made in diagnosis between three main forms: relapsing- remitting MS, primary pro- gressive MS and secondary progressive MS. The first symptoms of MS usually appear be- tween the ages of 15 and 45, with an aver-age range at diagnosis of 28-31 years, and MS affects women more often than men. Other risk factors for the development of MS include a genetic predisposition (primarily changes in the HLA -DRB1 locus), other auto- immune diseases, viral infections, smoking, being overweight in childhood, the microbi- ome and geographic factors (1). Cases of CNS demyelination after the administration of various vaccinations, for example against in- fluenza, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepa-titis A and B, measles and rubella, are also documented in the literature, although there is still no clear evidence showing a causal link between the onset of MS and these vaccinations (2) . Since a wide variety of vaccines has been associated with MS in the past in the literature, the question also arises in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic as to whether the newly authorised COVID -19 vaccines can also cause multiple sclerosis. Since vaccination as a trigger for a relapse in someone with pre -existing MS has also been discussed in the past, the question also arises for patients who have alr eady been diag- nosed with MS as to whether the SARS -CoV- 2 vaccines may lead to a deterioration in the disease, and whether COVID -19 vaccination is beneficial, safe and effective. Case reports In January 2022, the Zurich Regional Phar-macovigilance Centre (RPVC) received three case reports of multiple sclerosis occurring shortly after vaccination with Spikevax (elasomeran) or Comirnaty \u00ae (tozinameran): Case 1: A male patient was vac- cinated against COVID -19 with two doses of Spikevax. Two weeks af ter the first dose, he experienced the onset of episodes of pro-gressive hypoaesthesia with fluctuating, stabbing pains. These symptoms increased after the second dose. About one month af-ter the second vaccine dose, an MRI scan showed spinal cord lesions at the level of thoracic vertebrae 10/11. After further inves-tigations, a relapsing form of multiple scle-rosis was diagnosed for the first time. Fur-ther details on the outcome of this case were not yet available at the time of the report. Case 2: A 26 -year-old female patient experi- enced episodes of tingling paraesthesia for the first time four days after the first dose of the COVID -19 vaccine Comirnaty \u00ae (tozinam- eran). The patient also suffered fine motor deficits in her left hand. Four months after vaccination, an MRI scan detected several demyelination foci, and relapsing multiple sclerosis was subsequently diagnosed. A three- day treatment with high- dose steroids and immunomodulatory therapy was started with Tecfidera \u00ae (dimethyl fumarate). The subsequent course of this case is not yet known. Case 3: A 45 -year-old female patient re- ceived two doses of the COVID -19 vaccine Spikevax (elasomeran) and, two days after the second dose, first noticed a warm sensa- tion in her left leg, followed by tingling on the side of her thigh and pain. Two weeks later, the symptoms had regressed com- pletely. After a few more weeks, the patient Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 24 | 43 experienced two further episodes of weak- ness, dysaesthesia and tingling in her legs and arms. This patient also had a docu-mented hi story of several episodes of par- aesthesia and tingling (for the first time in 2018), and these had always subsequently regressed. Three months after the vaccina-tion, an MRI showed several demyelinating lesions at the level of the cervical spine. Re-lapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis was di- agnosed. The patient was treated with Solu-Medrol \u00ae (methylprednisolone), which pro- duced an improvement in her symptoms. Discussion COVID -19 vaccines as triggers of MS or MS relapses The onset of MS or an MS relapse has no t been mentioned to date as an adverse drug reaction to COVID -19 vaccines in their re- spective Swiss product information texts (3). The international spontaneous reporting system includes reports of the onset of mul- tiple sclerosis after COVID -19 vaccination. However, when interpreting cases from spontaneous reporting systems, it must al- ways be borne in mind that an assertion about an actual causal connection cannot usually be made since, for example, risk fac-tors or non -drug -related causes often re- main unkno wn. After the administration of over 15 million vaccine doses in Switzerland (4), the WHO pharmacovigilance database currently contains just 13 suspected reports of \"multiple sclerosis acute and progressive (High -Level Term, HLT)\" for \"elasomeran\" and seven suspected reports for \"tozinam- eran\" in Switzerland. No cases of MS after the administration of the COVID -19 Vaccine Janssen in Switzerland are currently listed in the WHO database. According to the Vigi- Base disproportionality analysis, the Report-ing Odds Ratio (ROR) for all three vaccines, both for \"multiple sclerosis (PT)\" and \"mul-tiple sclerosis relapse (PT)\", is still under 0.3 (lower limit of the 95% confidence interval likewise 0.3), which means that fewer MS cases than expected have been reported af-ter COVID -19 vaccinations (as at 5 April 2022) (5). Several more case reports of new -onset MS and MS relapses after COVID -19 vaccinations are also documented in the literature. For example, a review by Ismail and Salama identified 12 cases of CNS demyeli nation with a clinical presentation of MS after COVID -19 vaccinations up to 30 September 2021 (over a period of 10 months). Six of these patients with previously diagnosed MS suffered an MS relapse after vaccination; only a clinically isolated syndrome had previ- ously been identified in one male patient newly diagnosed with MS, while another male patient had previously experienced neurological episodes (without a diagnosis of MS). Four patients suffered their first MS episode after the COVID -19 vaccination. Women were affected in 11 of the 12 docu- mented cases. The median age of the af- fected patients was 33.5 years (24-48 years), and the median period between the COVID - 19 vaccination and the onset of the clinical symptoms was six days (1 -21 days). Half of the patients developed the MS symptoms af- ter the first dose of the COVID -19 vaccine. Nine patients received an mRNA vaccine, and two patients were immunised with a vector vaccine (6) . In both the case reports of the Zurich RPVC and those of the review by Ismai l and Salama, more women than men were af- fected by an MS event after COVID -19 vac- cination. According to the literature, ap- proximately two- thirds of MS disorders af- fect women. This may be due to a stronger immune response to foreign and self -anti- gens in wom en than in men (7) . One article in the literature also reports that those with a history of a suspected or diagnosed auto- immune disease are at higher risk of devel- Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 25 | 43 oping a new (additional) autoimmune disor- der than those without a previous immune- mediated di sease (8). None of the cases re- ported to the Zurich RPVC or included in the review by Ismail et al. had a documented his- tory of an autoimmune disease. A precise mechanism to explain how a COVID -19 vaccination could lead to an auto- immune disorder such as M S is not currently known (6). Moreover, since autoimmune dis- eases are presumably caused by multiple fac-tors, it is unlikely that COVID -19 vaccination would be the single trigger for the develop-ment of MS (9) . A causal connection between the COVID -19 vaccin es and the onset of MS is currently doubtful. It should also be borne in mind that very large numbers of people have been immunised against COVID -19 and that cases of newly -diagnosed MS or MS relapses will have therefore inevitably occurred shortly after v accination without necessarily imply- ing a causal link (6). A meta -analysis con- ducted in 2011 showed that the causal evi-dence for the onset of MS after various vac-cines was insufficient (10). Moreover, an analysis of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) managed by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the FDA (Food and Drug Ad-ministration), showed that COVID -19 vac- cinations were also not associated with an increased risk of neuroautoimmune adverse events: Compared t o other vaccines rou- tinely administered in adulthood, the COVID -19 vaccines have the lowest ROR for neuroautoimmune adverse effects, at 0.246 (median ROR for the other vaccines: 0.292; p<0.0001) (11). According to the Swiss Multi- ple Sclerosis Society, despite the millions of vaccine doses administered, including to MS sufferers, no evidence has been found of an increased risk of an MS relapse after COVID - 19 vaccination. However, the authors do mention that flu- like symptoms, such as a raised temperature after vaccination, can temporarily exacerbate previous MS symp- toms, and they suggest that the raised tem- perature reduces the nerve conductivity of previously damaged nerve pathways, but without triggering an inflammation in the central nervous system (as occu rs in a re- lapse) (12). In a study from Israel, such exac- erbations resembling MS relapses were ob-served in 2% of MS patients after the first dose and in 4.8% after the second dose. The rates of actual MS relapses observed after the COVID -19 vaccinations dur ing the study (2.1% after the first dose and 1.6% after the second dose) corresponded to the rates of MS relapses in patients who had not re-ceived a vaccination in the years before the pandemic (ranging from 2.3-2.9%). There- fore, this study also failed to show a link be- tween COVID -19 vaccination and increased MS disease activity (13) . No clear evidence can be found in the literature at this time to indicate a causal connection between COVID -19 vaccination and the onset of MS or the triggering of an MS relapse. In view of the increased risk of contracting an infec-tious disease during an immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive MS treatment and the possibility of suffering from a serious ill- ness with complications, the benefit of COVID -19 vaccination appears to outweigh the risks according to the current data situa- tion. COVID -19 vaccination recommendations for MS patients The immunomodulatory treatment of MS patients can pose a challenge for an effec-tive immunisation against COVID -19. How- ever, no officially approv ed guidelines cur- rently exist for this situation. In their review, Cabreira et al. stress that the COVID -19 vac- cination schedule should be precisely coordi- nated depending on the treatment in each case in order to achieve the best possible ef-fect. The revie w also includes a number of Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 26 | 43 vaccination recommendations. If the immu- notherapy has not yet started, administra- tion of the COVID -19 vaccination is recom- mended immediately if possible (ideally at least two weeks before the start of treat- ment) (14, 15) . The authors also mention that, during treatment with interferon -\u00df, glatiramer acetate or natalizumab , a COVID - 19 vaccination can be administered at any time, since the relevant studies have not shown a reduced response to the vaccina- tion. If the patient is taking dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod or teriflunomide, a vaccine can also basically be administered at any point in the treatment although, given the risk of lymphopenia and therefore an in-creased risk of infection during the treat- ment, vaccination is recommended as soon as possible. To ensure that the effect of the COVID -19 vaccination is as strong as possible, a pre- vaccination lymphocyte count is also recommended. However, it has been ob- served that the COVID -19 vaccination in MS patients with lymphopenia resulted in a weakened, though still protective, immune response. Since other drugs, including the anti-CD20 antibodies (e.g. ocrelizumab), can lead to a reduced immune response to the vaccination, it is recommended that, in addi- tion to the lymphocyte count, the COVID -19 vaccination should ideally be administered towards the end of a cycle with these m edi- cines. This means, for ocrelizumab for exam- ple, that vaccination should be started, at the earliest, 12 weeks after the last dose of a cycle but should be completed, at the latest, four to six weeks before the next cycle. In or- der to ensure an adequate immune response to the COVID -19 vaccination, the antibody status should be determined in all severely immunosuppressed patients following the vaccination and, if the levels are low, a fur- ther vaccination should be considered (14). The Swiss MS Society recommends an anti- body test four weeks after administration of the second COVID -19 vaccine dose. If an ad- equate antibody reaction is still not detected after a third vaccination, a fourth vaccina- tion is not recommended (12) . Conclusion A few cases of new -onset multiple sclerosis and MS relapses in connection with COVID - 19 vaccination have been documented in the literature to date. However, it should be borne in mind that very large numbers of people have been vaccinated during the pandemic and that new MS cases or MS re- lapses will have therefore inevitably oc- curred shortly after vaccination. No evidence of a causal link has been found to date. Ac-cording to the current data situation, the COVID -19 vaccines can continue to be con- sidered as safe both for those with and with- out a history of MS and therefore constitute an important measure in reducing the risk of COVID -19 infection in MS patients as well.

Initial knowledge o f the vaccines' safety from pivotal randomised clinical trials was limited and concerned mostly common local and systemic adverse events related to vac-cine immunogenicity occurring a short time after vaccination (1, 2) . Pharmacovigilance activities with the collection and analysis of spontaneous reports from healthcare pro-fessionals and patients are therefore of par- amount importance in identifying potential unknown risks (3). Indeed, by 8 March 2022 , Swissmedic and the regional pharmacovigi- lance centres had evaluated more than 10,000 spontaneous reports of suspected ad- verse events following immunisation (AEFI) associated with COVID -19 vaccines, which occurred among 6,105,171 vaccinated peo- ple who rec eived at least one dose. Notably, spontaneous reports handled by Swissmedic are shared with VigiBase \u00ae, the global data- base of the World Health Organization (WHO) Programme for International Drug Monitoring. In this way, the Swiss reports are also available for the international identifi- cation of potential signals. Furthermore, the WHO database offers the possibility of signal detection activities by means of dispropor- tionality analysis. Signal detection in spontaneous reports as- sociated with COVID -19 vacci nes first relies case- by-case analysis by clinically quali- fied assessors who take into account de-tailed information provided by reporters. This includes the timing and course of the AEFI, as well as background information such as the number of vaccines adminis-tered. However, with the number of reports increasing, the clinical review could benefit from the use of statistical methods for signal detection (4). In light of this, the Institute of Pharmacological Sciences of Southern Swit-zerland, in close collaboration with Swiss- medic, set up a signal detection activity by disproportionality analysis in VigiBase \u00ae using spontaneous reports originating from Swit-zerland and concerning To this end, disproportionality analyses have been routinely performed at national level and by vaccine type. These included the measurement of the reporting odds ratios (ROR) for COVID -19 vaccine/AEFI combina- tions meeting predefined st atistical signal detection criteria. These criteria were a min-imum of five reports concerning a COVID -19 vaccine/AEFI combination and an ROR lower limit of a 95% confidence interval greater than one to reduce the likelihood of false positives. In the ROR c alculation, the numer- ator is the number of reports concerning a specific AEFI reported in association with a suspected COVID -19 vaccine divided by the number of reports of adverse events other than the one of interest with the same COVID -19 vaccine. The denominator is the number of reports of the AEFI of interest among all other drugs presented in the da- tabase divided by the number of reports of adverse events other than the one of inter- est among all other drugs. Excluding AEFI Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 29 | 43 either already labelled in the Swiss infor- mation for healthcare professionals for the Moderna (Spikevax\u00ae) and Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty\u00ae) vaccines, or already debated internationally, a panel of pharmacovigi-lance and clinical pharmacology experts from both our Institute and Swissmedi c are examining and discussing findings on novel and unexpected COVID -19 vaccine/AEFI com- binations in order to promptly detect COVID -19 vaccine- related safety concerns that could warrant further investigation. One possible next step to evaluate such a po- tential safety signal could be an observed vs. expected analysis of a specific reaction which additionally takes into account the natural background incidence of a reaction. Since the start of sig nal detection activity in Au- gust 2021, an early signal of disproportion- ate reporting in VigiBase \u00ae for paraesthesia with the Moderna (Spikevax\u00ae) vaccine was detected in Switzerland. This occurred a few months before the same signal was assessed and validated by the European Medicines Agency, which ultimately added par aesthe- sia to the European summary of product characteristics for the Moderna (Spikevax \u00ae) vaccine (5). Disproportionality analysis has some limita-tions. First, the absolute number of reports and the level of disproportionality are not indicative of the frequency of the adverse event in the population. Second, the report-ing rate, defined as the number of reports divided by the number of vaccines adminis- tered, cannot be interpreted as an incidence rate. Third, spontaneous reports suffer from reporting bias es including underreporting and notoriety bias. Nevertheless, by properly weighing findings from disproportionality analysis against its limitations, continued re- search on newly identified safety signals can provide valuable information to support public health, guide regulatory decisions and design specific follow -up confirmatory studies.

The primary role of OE analyses is to check the evidence for possible side effects arising from sponta- neous reports. New illnesses or symptoms may also occur purely by chance shortly after a vaccination. An OE analysis can delve deeper into this situation to establish whether the number of reports of a particu-lar symptom or illness after a vaccination is higher than would be expected if no vac-cination had been administered. Two variables are considered in the OE anal-ysis: firstly, the number of cases actually re-ported ( Nobserved ) and, expected ( Nexpected ) over a spec- ified time period. If a particular adverse event after a vaccination is identified as a possible signal, the risk interval is first deter- mined, e.g. 21 days after the vaccination. The calculation of expected cases ( Nexpected ) in this time period includes the background in-cidence rate of adverse events and what is termed the person- time at risk , i.e. the per- sons exposed to the vaccination during this period. Example of a calculation: The background incidence rate for a partic-ular reaction is e.g. 15.5 cases per 100,000 person years. If 1,000,000 people are vac-cinated in 21 days, this gives a person -time at risk of: 1,000,000 number of cases ( Nexpected ) in this ex- ample corresponds to: background incidence rate \u00d7 person- time at risk = 0.57 \u00d7 15.5 = 8.8 . The background incidence rate is often taken from publications and should corre- spond to a non- vaccinated population with demographic characteristics that are similar to those of the exposed group. Since a spontaneous reporting system is as-sumed to involve under -reporting (= not all occurring cases are reported), this factor can be included in the calculation. Assuming, for example, that only 50% of cases are re- ported, the number of observed cases can be doubled in order to create a more realistic picture. Thus, if two cases of a reaction after vaccination are observed within 21 days, and taking into account an under -reporting rate of 50% , this gives an O/E ratio of 4/8.8 = 0.45. The final output of an analysis is a ra-tio. If this is <1, as in our example, then fewer cases were observed than expected. A value greater than 1 corresponds to an in-crease and may be indicative of a signal. The OE analysis is based on a series of as- sumptions: the number of vaccine doses ad- ministered is known, realistic estimate of the under -reporting rate, background incidence rate is roughly similar in the vaccinated pop-ulation and the non -vaccinated comparative population, and the selected risk interval in days corresponds to the period in which the reaction can actually occur (i .e. is not too short or too long) (1). OE analyses are useful for promptly checking the evidence from spontaneous reports, par- ticularly if quick conclusions about the safety of a vaccine are needed, or if the event of interest occurs shortly after the admi nistered vaccinatio n, e.g. within three weeks.

She had a his-tory of ductal breast carcinoma with lym-phatic and bone metastases for which she had been receiving treatment with fulves- trant (Faslodex \u00ae) and palbociclib (Ibrance\u00ae) for more than 18 months. She also had a his-tory of peripheral arterial occlusive disease and hypothyroidism. In addition to the on- cologicals, the following medication was rec- to a general deterioration in con-dition, fever, painful limbs and lateral pain in the right knee, the patient reported that she had been experiencing loss of appetite and pronounced pain in her mouth with aphthous ulcers and angular cheilitis for two to three weeks and diarrhoea (occasionally bloody) and stomach pain for three to four days. Antibiotic treatment with i.v. ceftriax- one was initiated for probable cellulitis of the right lower leg and additional bacterial superinfected COVID -19 pneumonia. In ad- dition, thromboprophylaxis with dalteparin was started. Tests on admission revealed elevated creati-nine of 146 \u00b5mol/l (calculated GFR after CKD-EPI 31 steroi- anti -inflammatory (NSAID) nimesulide was discontinued. The following day's tests showed a drop in plate let count from 94 to 44 G/l; the following day, this value fell to 27 G/l. Blood cultures showed Streptococcus py- ogenes bacteremia focused on the cellulitis of the right lower leg. The patient's general condition deteriorated and she was septic, despite the commencement of antibiotic treatment. In the differential diagnosis, hep-arin- induced vita-min B12 deficiency were excluded as the cause of the fall in platelet count. In view of the diagnostic assessment, splenomegaly seemed unlikely from an aetiological stand- point, and calculating the DIC score revealed no evidence of current severe disseminated intravascular co agulation. Given the ultimately unclear symptom com- plex (COVID -19 breakthrough infection de- spite having had a booster two months pre- Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 32 | 43 viously, fall in platelet count, leukopenia, in- tra-oral aphthous ulcers and diarrhoea), the patient's history was reviewed again in de- tail and the oncology centre responsible for her treatment was consulted. Two days after she was admitted to hospital, this line of ac- tive enquiry revealed that the patient possi-bly had rheumatoid arthritis for which she had been receiving low -dose methotrexate treatment (10 mg/week s.c.) for about three months. Since the patient was suspected to be expe-riencing methotrexate intoxication resulting from an acute deterioration in kidney func-tion and interaction with the NSAID, she was given 10 mg i. v. calcium folinate four times a day for one week as well as a platelet con-centrate for her platelet count, which had by then fallen to 17 G/l. The patient's kidney function deteriorated further while she was in hospital. An ultrasound scan ruled out a postrenal cause. A urine test indicated that the renal impairment was most likely due to mixed prerenal and renal factors. Severe tubular proteinuria and crystals in the pa- tient's urine sediment were compatible with kidney injury associated with methotrexate intoxication. In the differential diagnosis, additional tubular necrosis with initially longer sepsis -associated hypertension seemed plausible. While the patient was in hospital, her oxy-gen saturation levels fell as a result of the COVID -19 pneumonia and s he was therefore given temporary oxygen therapy and a course of dexamethasone (Fortecortin \u00ae) last- ing seven days. Haemodynamically relevant excluded. The pa-tient's platelet count subsequently normal- ised and her kidney function improved sig- nificantly. Methotrexate was discontinued. The cause of the sudden and dramatic drop in platelet count was subsequently identi-fied as a combination of methotrexate accu- mulation associated with the acute deterio-ration in kidney function, sepsis with St rep- tococcus pyogenes bacteremia and COVID - 19 pneumonia. After four weeks, the patient was discharged for rehabilitation in a good general condition. Discussion The risk of accidental overdosage with low - dose methotrexate has been known for many years. In S witzerland, Swissmedic and Patient Safety Switzerland repeatedly ad- dressed the issue in specialist publications in- tended for medical professionals in Novem-ber 2012 and December 2015 (1, 2, 3) . Nev- ertheless, cases continued to occur, so in Jan-uary 2016 a package of measures that in- cluded a boxed warning on the packaging and in the Information for healthcare pro- fessionals and Patient information as well as a patient card was adopted in Switzerland. Furthermore, the authorisation holders is-sued a DHPC in June 2016 with the aim of avoiding accidental methotrexate overdose in Switzerland. Longer -term measures were also adopted, including a restriction on pack sizes/dosage strengths or specialities authorised sepa- rately by indication. Thus, in July 2016, Methotrex at-Mepha rheuma/derm was ap- proved as the first preparation in Switzer-land to carry a name that restricted use to rheumatology and dermatology. Despite all efforts, methotrexate still tops the list of medications that cause serious or even fatal adverse dru g reactions (4, 5) . We are using this case report to highlight the persistently topical nature of the risk of methotrexate intoxication. According to the WHO's VigiBase database (accessed via VigiLyze), 959 reports of ad- verse drug reactions to methotrexate were registered in Switzerland between 2016 and 2021 (see table 1). Of these, 46 involved cases with a fatal outcome. 184 cases - or Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 33 | 43 around 20% of reports - were reported us- ing the Preferred Terms \"Accidental expo- sure to product, Accidental overdose, Over-dose, Product administration error, Product prescribing error or Incorrect dose adminis- tered\" (6). According to these data, one in five adverse drug reactions to methotrexate were connected with the wrong dosage or incorrect administration. In 2018, there was a clear decline in the number of ADR to methotrexate compared to the two previous years, and this decline has persisted since then. We see the cumulative effect of the measures that have been discussed and im-plemented since the beginning of 2016 as the cause for this development. The fall in 2021 could also stem from reporting bias, since pharmacovigilance reporting during that year focused on COVID -19 vaccines both in Switzerland and internationally. Table 1: Data from the WHO pharmacovigilance database concerning methotrexate in Switzer- land 2016 -2021 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Number of ADR cases for MTX in VigiLyze in Switzerland per year 233 258 118 158 105 87 Of which fatal cases 12 11 4 7 3 9 Of which reported under PT Accidental exposure to product 66 35 9 5 1 0 Of which reported under PT Accidental overdose 6 1 2 6 1 1 Of which reported under PT O verdose 9 3 1 1 1 0 Of which reported under PT Product administration / prescribing error 12 5 0 9 0 0 Of which reported under PT Incorrect dose administered 4 1 0 1 2 2 The commonest causes of incorrect dose ad-ministration for methotrexate are (7, 8) : Interfaces: Communication problems and misunderstandings result in incorrect dis- pensing and use - for example when treatment changes from once -weekly s.c or i.m injection to tablets or, as in this case, when information gets lost when the patient is admitted to hospital. Incorrect prescription owing to lack of specialist knowledge; failure to adapt dose to reduced [renal function] or acute or chronic renal impairment; failure to take account of drug interactions (as in the present case - concomitant admin- istration of NSAIDs can result in renal im-pairment and thus encourage methotrex-ate accumulation). Dispensing: Unclear written instructions, for example the use of abbreviation s, where \"M\" could stand for Monday or midday. Use: Patient fails to take the medication correctly because the timing of doses has changed; confusion with prophylactic fo-lic acid. Accidental methotrexate overdosage is pri- marily observed in cases where patients have to take or apply the medication daily rather than weekly (8, 9) . However, overdosage can also occur with once -weekly dosage, for ex- ample as a result of drug interactions or acute deterioration in renal function, as in the present case. Unintentional intoxication is often attribut- able to interface issues where information is lost owing to communication problems or misunderstandings between inpatient and outpatient care teams. In our case, a crucial piece of information was not communicated when the patient was admitted to hospital, resulting in a transitory deterioration in her condition and in time being lost until cal-cium folinate was administered. Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 34 | 43 There could be various reasons for the de- cline in reported ADR to methotrexate ob- served in Switzerland since 2018. The aware- ness among healthcare professionals has been heightened by the measures that have been introduced and, in addition, techno- logical systems such as computerised pre-scribing systems or pharmacy software issue warnings when the medicine is prescribed and dispensed. During 2021/2022, the Patient Safety Foun-dation is running an investigation into the use of low -dose methotrexate and precau- tionary measures to prevent accidental over- dosage (10). The results of this investigation are keenly anticipated. Conclusion This case report spotlights the importance of pharmacovigilance as a way of identifying long- known ADR. Owing to its different in- dications, dosages and use regimens, its nar- row therapeutic index, the need to adjust dosages and its contraindication in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, metho-trexate is a high- risk substance in terms of serious adverse drug reactions. Through the stakeholders' efforts, the measures implemented to date hav e re- duced the number of such incidents. Accord-ing to VigiLyze, a higher than average num- ber of ADR to methotrexate were registered in Switzerland in 2016 and 2017. The num-ber of reported cases has been stagnating since 2018, and in 2021 it declined further . All involved healthcare professionals should work with the affected patients to avoid ad- verse events in connection with low -dose methotrexate. Regular reviews of metho- trexate dosage, renal function and issuing repeated instructions to patients are essen- tial in doing so, as are careful documenta- tion and communication at interfaces. Reporting adverse reactions For reporting adverse drug reactions (ADR), Swissmedic recommends the use of its own reporting portal developed specifically for this purpose (Electr onic Vigilance System, ElViS).

Produced mainly from genes, tissues or cells, ATMP have opened up new possibilities for treating cancers, as well as rare genetic, neurodegenerative and in-fectious diseases. These products are evolving extremely rap- idly because we now have a better under-standing of the pathogenic and molecular mechanisms of diseases, and tools have been developed for transferring specific genes and transporters and enabling precise tar- geting. A substantial number of ATMP for numerous indications, containing various ac- tive substances and with differing admin- istration routes, are currently being devel-oped worldwide. The most active regions are North America and Europe, and Switzerland is among the l eading countrie s in this field. From the legislative standpoint, ATMP are considered to be equivalent to medicines and are therefore subject to the Swiss Ther- apeutic Products Act. However, the evalua-tion criteria and the type and volume of the analytical, preclinical and clinical data re- quired to demonstrate quality, safety and ef-ficacy are specific and differ, to a certain ex-tent, from those in traditional pharmaceuti-cal practice due to the biological and func-tional properties of ATMP and their particu- lar risks. On the other hand, the need for pa- tients to have fast access to medicinal prod-ucts for treating hitherto incurable illnesses necessitates a rapid, but adequate, assess- ment of the benefit -risk profile for these products. In January 2022, a new Advanced Therapy Medi cinal Products division (the former Transplant Unit) was formed at Swissmedic with the aim of responding to these specific requirements. The ATMP division is tasked with the regulatory and scientific oversight of all ATMP in the strict sense of the term (products for gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineering), but also of other products for which genetic infor- mation is introduced into the somatic cells, including oligonucleotides, mRNA or anti-sense RNA (asRNA). The remit of this division also includes interventions related to autol- ogous grafts and other products such as bac-teriophages, the transfer of microbiota, pro-cedures for inactivating pathogens in blood, and non- standardised medicines . The new ATMP division is responsible for all activities connected with these types of med- icines or procedures, including inspections, marketing authorisations (MA), clinical trial authorisations and biovigilance. The existing - relatively low - level of com- mercialisation of ATMP is due to the com-plexit y of these technologies and the associ- ated manufacturing and research processes. Currently, 21 advanced therapy medicinal products have received a marketing author- isation (MA) in Switzerland (including three out of four authorised COV ID vaccines), which is comparable with the authorisations granted in other countries. On the other hand, between 15 and 20 applications for the authorisation of clinical trials are submit-ted each year. Some of the applications for MA and for the authorisation of clinical trials relate to CAR - T (chimeric antigen receptor T -cell) products. These are immunotherapies that employ ge-netically modified T lymphocytes with the aim of equipping them with specific recep- tors and causing them to attack certain types Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 36 | 43 of malignant cancers of t he blood or lym- phatic system. These treatments need to take numerous factors into account, from the collection of the cells, via the produc-tion, transport, storage and administration to the patient, through to the short - and long- term follow -up of the pati ent. Each of these stages can affect both safety and effi- cacy, because the very principle of this ther-apy, which is based on \"living\" medicines, in- duces potentially severe side effects. CAR-T products are currently used to treat cancers such as DLBCL (diffuse large B- cell lymphoma), primary mediastinal large B- cell lymphoma, B- cell acute lymphoblastic leu- kaemia (B -ALL), mantle cell lymphoma, etc., and experience has shown that they can suc- cessfully prolong the lives of numerous pa-tients. However, these products occasionally cause serious adverse events which, if not recognised and treated promptly, can even lead to the death of the patient. Cytokine re- lease syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), tumour lysis and cy topenias are common side effects and pose challenges in the treatment of patients. This specific tox-icity profile means that the risks need to be managed by trained personnel in a specialist hospital setting. The treatments based on CAR-T cells therefore require close monitor- ing in ho spital, with daily checks for at least ten to twelve days. Strict procedures must be put in place to monitor each indication in or- der to improve the management of risks and knowledge of these risks. Treatment with to-cilizumab and steroids may be needed in an emergency and should be available. Below are a few examples of adverse events that occurred in Switzerland with products manufactured from CAR- T cells and which werde observed for marketed produ cts or during clinical trials. These examples were obtained from biovigilance reports for ATMP received in 2021. Only the most signif-icant cases requiring a prolonged hospital stay are mentioned. Over this time period, no deaths were reported in connection with these treatments. Exampl es from marketed CAR- T products: An evaluation of 19 treated patients re-vealed four who had experienced a serious (CRS) and/or neurotoxic (ICANS) adverse ef-fect during the six -month period covered by the report in 2021: 1) Grade 2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with a neurotoxicity syndrome associated with CAR- T cell therapy (ICANS) and pul- monary oedema (resolved); 2) Neurotoxicity therapy (toxic and metabolic encephalopathy); 3) Neurotoxicity syndrome associated with CAR-T cell therapy toxic and met- abolic encephalopathy; 4) Grade 3 neurotoxicity syndrome associ-ated with CAR- T cel l therapy (ICANS 3 - resolved). Examples from CAR- T products used in clinical trials: 1) G4 hemiparesis in connection with an -associated neurotoxicity syndrome) 2) (immune effector cell -associ- ated neurotoxicity syndrome) 3) CRS, hae-mophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (HLH), 3 CRS with hepa- totoxicity and DIC between one and eight days after treatment. On day 9, the pa- tient also suffered potentially fatal symp- tomatic sinus bradycardia. Swissmedic Vigilance News | Edition 28 - May 2022 37 | 43 Since the products are obtained by leu- kapheresis and manufactured specifically for a patient, the established specifications are not always respected. In these cases, the need to take decisions based on the benefit - risk profile and to deviate from the strict es-tablished procedures was a significant fac-tor. Adverse events that were not connected with the treatment generally involved dis- ease progression or early relapses (even in the presence of CAR- T cells that were still de- tectable). Some patients also reported that their underl ying condition had progressed when the production of the CAR- T cells was still incomplete or in the first few months af- ter the treatment (often due to an early re- lapse). On the other hand, it has been re-ported that some of the patients who are cancer -free for more than six months to a year after the treatment can then remain re-lapse- free for up to several years . As shown by the above examples, CAR -T products all cause similar adverse effects. It should be noted that the serious adverse ef- fects related to treatment with CAR- T prod- ucts do not stop any cancer treatment from being successful. Some patients who had to be hospitalised for long periods because of serious adverse events remained neverthe- less relapse -free for up to five years or more. The accumulati on of knowledge and im- proved risk management are making these treatments increasingly promising.
