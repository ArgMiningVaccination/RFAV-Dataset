How would it be with Polio and measles being the normal illnesses for infants? Through the decades vaccines have been very pivotal in preventing miserable illnesses such as mumps, measles, chicken pox and polio. However, in recent days there has been a controversial debate about vaccinations causing autism or the Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As a consequence the amount of kids receiving vaccines has greatly decreased as parents are becoming more reluctant and cautious. Vaccinations particularly the Measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) have been on the spotlight. Over the past ten years there has risen an anti-vaccination movement widely known as \"Anti-Vax\" causing numerous parents not to vaccinate their kids. A good number of these parents fear that vaccinating their kids would render them autistic. On the other hand, many scientific articles have been written in response to the topic arguing that there is no link between vaccines and autism. With the looming debate, this paper aims at analyzing the scientific evidence regarding the issue. ASD or the Autism spectrum Disorder is simply described as a complex neurobiological disorder that affects normal development of the brain leaving most people with difficulties in communication, difficulties with developing social relationships and a tendency of repeating specific pattern of behaviour. Individuals affected with autism have their nervous, endocrine, hepatic, immune and gastrointestinal systems affected. Approximately 2% of children in the US are affected by autism spectrum disorder which equates to 1 in 45. The belief that autism spectrum disorder was caused by vaccines was fueled by Andrew J. Wakefield who first argued that there was a correlation between autism and MMR vaccine. Dr Andrew was one of Britain's most prominent doctors. He published this information in \"The Lancet\"- one of Britain's most famous medical journals. Since Andrew's publication the fact that vaccines are associated with "}
